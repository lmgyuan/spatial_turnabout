The evidence that contradicts the testimony is the "Jack's Autopsy Report," which states that the time of death was at 2:30 PM. This contradicts Vasquez's testimony where she states that they took a 15-minute break in the meeting at 2:30 PM and was eating steaks with Sal at that time, suggesting that they were not at the scene of the crime. Therefore, the evidence suggests that Jack Hammer was killed at the same time frame when Vasquez claims she was preoccupied.

******************************
The testimony of Dee Vasquez states that she was with Sal and the security lady when they found the body and that Powers was absent at the time. However, Powers's photograph taken at the gate at 2:00 PM shows him dragging his leg, which suggests he was present at the scene shortly before the time of death, which is stated to be at 2:30 PM. This contradiction indicates that either Vasquez's testimony or the photograph is inaccurate regarding the timeline of events.

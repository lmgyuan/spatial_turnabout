The evidence regarding the Jammin' Ninja's button, which is found in Engarde's "hakama" and is covered in Corrida's blood, is contradicted by the testimony stating that the defendant bought the knife for the crime. If the murder were premeditated and Engarde had purchased the knife with intent, it contradicts the notion that he would have been caught with the button from Corrida’s costume, linking him to the murder in a potentially spontaneous manner rather than a planned execution.

******************************
The contradiction lies in the testimonies of Oldbag, who claims that she saw Matt Engarde sneaking out of Juan's room after the ceremony. However, evidence 14 states that Juan Corrida was strangled to death at 8:15 PM, making it impossible for Engarde to be seen exiting the room if Juan was already dead. Therefore, Oldbag's testimony conflicts with the timeline provided by the autopsy report.

******************************
The testimony given by Security Lady (Oldbag) states that it would have been convenient for Engarde to wear his costume during the murder, specifically mentioning that he must have worn the Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing Juan. However, evidence from Juan's autopsy report (Evidence 14) shows that he was strangled to death first and then stabbed, and there is no indication that Engarde was in the costume during the murder as the crime scene did not suggest it. Therefore, these two statements contradict each other regarding Engarde's attire during the murder.

The testimony by Adrian Andrews states that she saw the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo (Testimony 3), implying that she saw the scene with the knife sticking out of Juan Corrida's chest and the glass of juice behind him. However, her testimony also claims that she poured herself a glass of juice after seeing the body (Testimony 4), which contradicts the fact that the glass of juice was already present at the crime scene and not something she poured herself. This inconsistency suggests that her recollection of events is flawed.

******************************
The testimony by Andrews states that she opened the guitar case after knocking over a vase and that she does not know why she opened it. However, the evidence found tells us that the guitar case was empty, which means there would have been no reason for Andrews to open it given the context. This directly contradicts her vague claims and suggests there may be more to the story.

******************************
The testimony by Adrian Andrews indicates that Matt Engarde did not have an alibi for the time of the murder (Testimony 3). However, the evidence suggests that a spy camera was set up to record the victim's room during that time (Evidence 21). This means that there could be footage available that could either confirm or refute Matt's alibi, which contradicts Andrews’ assertion that he had no alibi.

{"evidence": 21, "testimony": 3}
******************************
The evidence that contradicts the testimony is the Wine Glass (Evidence 8), which was found next to the victim and is described as filled with tomato juice with no sign that it has been drunk. This contradicts Andrews' Testimony 4, where she states that she went to pour him some juice when she saw him slumped over, indicating her belief that he was still alive at that moment. Since the glass was already filled with juice, that implies he did not have any juice poured for him, contradicting her statement.

The evidence of Maya's costume (Evidence 11), which has blood splatters on it, contradicts Gumshoe's testimony (Testimony 3) that states the defendant attacked and killed a person who was not fighting back. This contradiction arises because the implication of an attack on a non-fighting-back person suggests a clear struggle, while evidence of blood on Maya's costume does not conclusively indicate that she attacked someone who was defenseless.

******************************
Evidence 9 states that the pistol, the murder weapon, was fired twice and bears both Maya's and Dr. Grey's fingerprints. However, Testimony 3, provided by Gumshoe, claims that the victim took a shot but missed due to being too close. This contradicts the notion that Dr. Grey fired the gun without successfully hitting Maya, especially when the evidence suggests that at least two shots were fired.

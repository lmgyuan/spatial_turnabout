The contradiction arises between Cody's testimony, where he states he was going for the studio and got lost for about 30 minutes (Testimony 4), and the evidence regarding Mr. Monkey's Head, which blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM (Evidence 11). If Cody was indeed going straight to the studio, he could not have been lost for that long and still reached the vicinity of the crime scene by 2:15 PM when Mr. Monkey's Head was blocking the path.

******************************
The contradiction arises between Cody's testimony and the evidence of Mr. Monkey's Head. Cody claims he was trying to take a picture, but he could not do so in time because the lens wouldn't open, suggesting he was present and focused on the scene. However, Mr. Monkey's Head was blocking access to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, which means he wouldn't have been able to take any pictures if he were indeed blocked by the object at that time.

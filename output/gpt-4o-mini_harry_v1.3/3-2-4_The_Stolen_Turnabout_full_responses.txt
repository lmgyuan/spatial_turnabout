The contradiction lies between Testimony 5 and Evidence 3. In Testimony 5, Atmey claims he held the urn in his hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th. However, Evidence 3 indicates that the statue, which holds the urn, was moved the night of the crime. This implies that the urn could have been seen or handled before Atmey's testimony, creating a contradiction in what Atmey claims about the timing of his first encounter with the urn.

******************************
The contradiction arises from Testimony 5 and the evidence surrounding Kane Bullard's death. Testimony 5 suggests that Ron DeLite killed Kane Bullard, implying a motive to kill, but Kane's autopsy report (Evidence 15) indicates that he died from blunt trauma at 1 AM, which is inconsistent with Ron's stated actions as being directed by blackmail letters from Bullard to steal as Mask DeMasque. This raises suspicions about the truth of Atmey's claim regarding DeLite's actions and motives.

The testimony from Lotta Hart states, "I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!" This contradicts the evidence found, particularly the specifics of the time of death in Robert's Autopsy Report, which states the victim was shot on the 24th or 25th. The Lake Photo taken at 12:15 AM on 12/25 confirms a time frame in which the events were ongoing, but the evidence surrounding Edgeworth's involvement is clouded by the possibility of misidentification or the presence of other individuals. Thus, while Lotta claims she clearly identified Edgeworth, it raises doubts given the conflicting circumstances discussed in the evidence.

******************************
Evidence 11 states that Lotta heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. However, Testimony 3 indicates that Lotta had her camera set up to take pictures of a meteor shower, which implies she should have been focused on watching the sky and not necessarily aware of the sounds occurring down at the lake at that moment.

******************************
The evidence that contradicts the testimony involves Lotta's camera (Evidence 2) and the situation she describes (Testimony 3). In the testimony, Lotta states that she was camping out by the lake, suggesting she was not moving and was focused on the area to see any events unfold. However, if her camera was set to automatically take pictures based on loud noises, it would have likely captured the gunshots occurring. The timing and nature of the events raise questions about her position and awareness when the sounds were made compared to the operation of her camera.

The evidence that contradicts the testimony is the "May Testimony," where White testifies that the victim ran to the left and was chased, while there is also evidence indicating that the stand is blocked from view from the office, thus making it implausible that White could accurately see and testify about the victim's movements. 

{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 8}
******************************
The evidence that contradicts the testimonies provided is the "May Testimony" (Evidence 9) and the testimony from Redd White (Testimony 4). 

The "May Testimony" indicates that the victim, Mia, dodged an attack and ran to the right but was caught and struck afterwards. In contrast, Testimony 4 from Redd White states that Mia was chased and delivered the final blow after running to the right, suggesting that she was not able to dodge the attack. This inconsistency implies that one account must be false regarding the sequence of events surrounding the attack.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 4}
******************************
The evidence that contradicts the testimony is the "Mia's Autopsy Report," which states that the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, indicating that Mia was killed instantly. This contradicts the testimony from Redd White stating that Mia dodged an attack, ran for the door, and was then struck, suggesting that there was an opportunity for her to escape or survive longer than just an instant. 

Thus, the contradictory pair is:

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 3}
******************************
The evidence of the glass shards (Evidence 2) indicates that the glass light stand was broken. However, the testimony provided by Redd White (Testimony 3) states that he saw the glass light stand, which contradicts the condition described by the evidenceâ€”that it is broken beyond recognition. This implies that if the stand was broken, he should not have seen it intact.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}

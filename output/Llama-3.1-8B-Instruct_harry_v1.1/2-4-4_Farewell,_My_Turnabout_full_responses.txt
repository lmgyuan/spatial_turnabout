The testimony (Testimony 3) contradicts the evidence (Evidence 17). 
The testimony states that the bellboy seemed out of place, but the evidence (Evidence 17) shows that Lotta's Photo is a picture taken in the Hallway right after the murder, and it shows a person in samurai garb standing outside the door, which suggests that the person in samurai garb is the one who committed the murder, not the bellboy.

The testimony (Testimony 3) contradicts the evidence (Evidence 14). 
The testimony states that Adrian Andrews already knew from the very beginning that Juan Corrida was dead, but the evidence (Evidence 14) shows that Juan's Autopsy Report states that the time of death was 8:15 PM, suggesting that Andrews did not know Corrida was dead before entering the room.

However, Testimony 3 actually contradicts the implication of the crime photo in the evidence (Evidence 9).

The evidence (Statue) and testimony (Testimony 3) contradict each other. 
The statue is rather heavy, suggesting that it could not have been easily moved, but the testimony of Frank Sahwit suggests that the killer (Larry Butz) was able to move quickly enough to flee the scene.

The evidence (Statue) and testimony (Testimony 3) do not directly contradict each other. However, the testimony (Testimony 2) and the time of death stated in the evidence (Evidence 1) contradict each other. 
The testimony suggests that the victim was watching a video of a taped program, which would have been recorded at a different time, but the evidence states that the time of death was between 4PM-5PM.

However, Testimony 2 and Testimony 4 suggest that the time on the TV was 1:00 PM, which would mean the victim was killed between 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM, contradicting the evidence (Evidence 1).

The testimony (Testimony 0) contradicts the previous understanding of the testimony (Testimony 4) from the previous set of testimonies. 
In the previous set, it was stated that Frank Sahwit thought it was 1:00 PM because the TV said so, but now he says he "saw" the time, implying it was on a clock, which would be a more reliable source.

However, Testimony 1 suggests that the time was displayed on a table clock, which would have been affected by the blackout (Evidence 4), and it is unlikely that the clock would have been working during the blackout.

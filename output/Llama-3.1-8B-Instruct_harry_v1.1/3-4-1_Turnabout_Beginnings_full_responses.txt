The testimony (Testimony 3) contradicts the evidence (Evidence 1). 
The testimony states that the criminal shoved the victim down from behind and stabbed her in the back, but the evidence (Evidence 1) shows that Valerie's Autopsy Report states that she was stabbed with a knife in the back, which suggests that the stab wound was inflicted while she was already on the ground, not while she was being shoved down.

The testimony (Testimony 4) contradicts the evidence (Evidence 2). 
The testimony states that Larry Butz did not notice the boat when he looked out over the lake after hearing the gunshot, but the evidence (Evidence 2) shows that Lotta's camera was set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected, and it was facing the lake, which means that the picture it took was of the lake, and specifically, the boat.

The testimony (Testimony 5) contradicts the evidence (Evidence 11). 
The testimony states that Larry Butz heard the gunshot just when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!", but the evidence (Evidence 11) shows that Lotta's deposition states that she heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25, which is after the DJ would have said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!".

The testimony (Testimony 3) contradicts the evidence (Evidence 15). 
The testimony states that Acro could not have exerted the kind of force on his lower body to drop the bust on the victim, but the evidence (Evidence 15) shows that the Max G. Bust is a bronze statue that looks rather heavy, suggesting that it would be difficult for Acro to lift and drop it.

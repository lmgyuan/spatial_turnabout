The testimony (Testimony 2) contradicts the evidence (Evidence 3). 
The testimony states that the word "Maya" was written in blood on the memo, but the evidence (Evidence 3) is a receipt with letters written in blood on the back, which does not match the description given in the testimony.

The testimony (Testimony 3) contradicts the evidence (Evidence 1). 
The testimony states that the killer hit the victim with "that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? 'The Thinker,' I think?", but the evidence (Evidence 1) is "The Thinker", a clock made by Larry Butz, which is not a statue, and it's not clear if it's the murder weapon.

However, Testimony 4 clarifies that the clock is the murder weapon, so this is a contradiction with Testimony 3, which described the victim dodging an attack and being caught and struck.

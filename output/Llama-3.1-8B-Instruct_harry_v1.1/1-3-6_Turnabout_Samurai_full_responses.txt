The testimony (Testimony 3) contradicts the evidence (Evidence 2). 
The testimony states that Vasquez had Sal drive him to Studio One, but the evidence (Evidence 2) is a guidemap to Global Studios, which suggests that there are multiple paths and routes to the studio, and Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, implying that Vasquez would not have been able to drive to Studio One.

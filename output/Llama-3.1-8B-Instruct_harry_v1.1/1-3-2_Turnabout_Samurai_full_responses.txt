The testimony (Testimony 7) contradicts the evidence (Evidence 5). 
The testimony states that Powers walked by the guard station at 2:00 PM, heading toward the studio, but the evidence (Evidence 5) shows a photo of the Steel Samurai (Powers) walking at 2:00 PM, but it is not clear if he is heading towards the studio.

However, the testimony (Testimony 7) is more specific about Powers's direction and timing, and it contradicts the implication of the photo in the evidence (Evidence 5).

The testimony (Testimony 3) contradicts the evidence (Evidence 2). 
The testimony states that the guard saw everyone who went to the studio, but the evidence (Evidence 2) is a guidemap to Global Studios, which suggests that there are multiple paths and routes to the studio, making it possible for someone to go to the studio without being seen by the guard.

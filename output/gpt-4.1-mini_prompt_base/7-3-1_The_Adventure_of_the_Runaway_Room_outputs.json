And then I saw that blood-curdling sight as well... It's all too much!\nPerson: Furst\nTestimony 3\nTestimony: I tell you, I saw McGilded stabbing that man! Everything I said before stands!\nPerson: Fairplay\nTestimony 4\nTestimony: Oh yes... Yes, he s-s-stabbed him.

    "cot": "Evidence 0 (Armband) identifies the wearer as a defence lawyer throughout the Empire of Japan, indicating a role that involves protection and defense, likely requiring credibility and truthfulness. Testimony 3 by Fairplay states, \"I tell you, I saw McGilded stabbing that man! Everything I said before stands!\" This is an accusatory statement against the defendant McGilded, and if the testimony by the defense lawyer was contradicting this, there would be a conflict.\n\nHowever, more directly, there is a contradiction between Testimony 0 and Testimony 1 regarding the number of passengers. Beppo, the driver, claims he carried only four passengers (Testimony 0), but Fairplay says he was told he had to pay fivepence for the bus, implying he was aboard and the fare was charged (Testimony 1). The omnibus is described as an eight-seater with passengers inside and on the roof deck, contradicting Beppo's statement.\n\nTherefore, the pair to pick must include one testimony and one evidence item. Evidence 4 is the omnibus itself, which is described as an eight-seater with passengers both inside and on the roof deck that night, indicating more than four passengers. This directly contradicts Beppoâ€™s statement Testimony 0 about carrying only four passengers.\n",

Gregson. That was a condition of the British study tour.\nPerson: Jigoku\nTestimony 2\nTestimony: However...in the end something happened that meant the young man was unable to carry out his mission.\nPerson: Jigoku\nTestimony 3\nTestimony: On the evening in question, a member of the crew was on duty outside my cabin at all times.\nPerson: Jigoku\nTestimony 4\nTestimony: If there'd been a shot fired, the crewman would have heard it. So clearly I can't be involved.\nPerson: Jigoku\n\nWhich evidence and testimony contradict each other? You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Testimony 3 states that \"On the evening in question, a member of the crew was on duty outside my cabin at all times.\" implying continuous supervision and awareness of activity near Judge Jigoku's cabin.\n\nEvidence 25, the \"Evacuation Drill Itinerary,\" indicates that there was a practice evacuation to be carried out by the crew of the SS Grouse the night before arriving in Dover. This suggests that the crew would have been engaged in a drill, which could mean less attention to guarding the cabin during the actual time of the supposed incident, potentially contradicting the assertion of continuous presence and supervision from testimony 3.\n\nHowever, the contradiction is clearer with testimony 4: \"If there'd been a shot fired, the crewman would have heard it. So clearly I can't be involved.\" This directly conflicts with the evidence that Inspector Gregson was shot (Evidence 11: Autopsy Report states death by bullet shot at close range) near or around the time in question, despite the supposed constant presence of a crew member and their auditory awareness.\n\nSo the contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 11: Autopsy Report indicating the victim died from a bullet shot at close range.\n\nTestimony 4: Jigoku claiming if a shot had been fired, the crewman would have heard it, thus implying no shot fired.\n\nTherefore, the evidence of a shot and death by bullet directly contradicts the testimony that no shot was fired because a crew member would have heard it.\n",

    "cot": "The contradiction lies between Evidence 4 (Dismissal Notice) and Testimony 2 (Vigil's statement). The Dismissal Notice is the harsh reprimand that resulted in Mr. Vigil losing his job as chief warder of Barclay Prison. This evidence implies that Vigil was involved or responsible for some misconduct related to the convict. However, in Testimony 2, Vigil claims that he knew nothing of any plot related to Asogi and asserts his innocence or ignorance, which contrasts with the severity implied by the dismissal.\n",

You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Testimony 1 states that \"[Asogi] was doing something with that will in his cell\" the night after he was found guilty, implying the will was physically present in Asogi's cell after the guilty verdict. However, Testimony 3 says, \"I only found out about the Asogi Papers when a directive came telling me to impound them,\" suggesting that the prosecutor (Caidin) did not know about the will initially and that it was taken into custody only after a directive. This might indicate conflicting knowledge about the will's location after the verdict.\n\nMoreover, Evidence 2 (Photograph of Mr Vigil) doesn't directly contradict with testimonies. Evidence 19 (The Asogi Papers) show the will disappeared after execution; Vigil (Testimony 2) says \"We turned the cell inside out looking for it...but to no avail\" which matches this absence.\n\nNone of the testimonies conflict with the evidence outright here.\n\nHowever, Testimony 4 says \"The document was in the folds of the fella's robe...a kimono\" which suggests that the will was indeed found in the robe. But Vigil in Testimony 2 says \"We turned the cell inside out looking for it after the execution, but to no avail,\" indicating they could not find the document.\n\nThis is a direct contradiction between:\n\nTestimony 2: The will was not found after the execution despite searching.\n\nTestimony 4: The will was in the folds of the robe left in the cell.\n\nThe related evidence is Evidence 19 (The Asogi Papers) that says the will disappeared after the convict's execution, indicating that no one found it after.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Vigil) claiming they did not find the will after searching the cell, and Testimony 4 (Caidin) claiming the document was found in the folds of the robe left in his cell.\n\nBut the prompt says to output one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict.\n\nEvidence 19 states the will disappeared after execution, supporting Testimony 2.\n\nTestimony 4 contradicts this by saying \"The document was in the folds of the robe...left in his cell.\"\n\nSo, Evidence 19 and Testimony 4 contradict each other.\n",

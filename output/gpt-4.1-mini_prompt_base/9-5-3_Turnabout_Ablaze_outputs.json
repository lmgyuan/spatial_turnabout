The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Evidence 4 states that the \"Yatagarasu stole this from this embassy 7 years ago,\" referring to a key that was stolen. This implies a theft took place at the embassy.\n\nTestimony 0 states that Franziska said, \"As I said earlier, I was assigned to guard duty in the Allebahstian Embassy.\" Although this testimony doesn't provide explicit details about any theft, Franziska being assigned to guard duty implies she was vigilant and responsible for security at the time.\n\nIf taken in combination with other evidence or testimonies, there might be a contradiction between the security measures expected of Franziska and the occurrence of a theft (the key), especially if Franziska claims she was present and attentive without any knowledge or report of the theft.\n\nHowever, looking for a more direct contradiction: \n\n- Evidence 23 is \"Ms. Yew's Perfume\" left behind by Calisto Yew 7 years ago, which Kay has been safekeeping.\n- Evidence 25 is a \"Photo of Yatagarasu\" taken from a building nearby at the moment of border crossing during the fire.\n\nIf we consider Testimony 4 and 5 by Franziska: \"When I arrived, Ambassador Alba was watering the flowers on the windowsill.\" and \"There were four large passionflowers in full bloom in the flower box.\" \n\nEvidence 14 is \"Passionflowers: Two large flowers in bloom. Ambassador Alba takes great care in growing them.\"\n\nThe contradiction arises in the number of passionflowers: Evidence 14 describes two large flowers in bloom, yet Testimony 5 states there were four large passionflowers in full bloom.\n\nThis is a direct contradiction between the number of flowers present according to evidence and the testimony.\n\nHence, the pair that contradict each other is Evidence 14 and Testimony 5.\n",

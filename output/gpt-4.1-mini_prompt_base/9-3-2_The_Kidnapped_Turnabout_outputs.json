    "cot": "Evidence 11 (Colin Devorae Dossier) states that Oliver Deacon is actually Colin Devorae, who escaped from prison and stole a gun during his escape. It mentions that despite surveillance, he has yet to show up at the location where his wife and daughter are.\n\nTestimonies 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 by Lang point towards a scenario where a reunited pair (implying a close relationship such as family) made use of their meetings to plan the kidnapping in the house of Amano. Lang implies that the people involved in the kidnapping are connected and orchestrated the plan knowingly. This suggests that Oliver Deacon (Colin Devorae) is involved in the kidnapping and that he and presumably another (maybe his daughter) were actively planning it together.\n\nThus, the dossier (Evidence 11) directly contradicts Lang’s testimonies (Testimony 3, for example) because it states that Colin Devorae has not been seen, implying he is not present to plan or participate in the kidnapping at the house of Amano. Meanwhile, Lang says the pair conspiring in the kidnapping used their meetings (meaning they have met in person recently).\n\nThe contradiction is between Evidence 11 and Testimony 3.\n",

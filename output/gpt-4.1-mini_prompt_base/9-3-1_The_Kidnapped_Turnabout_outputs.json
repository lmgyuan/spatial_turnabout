    "cot": "Testimony 2 states that Officer Meekins' story about the shop on wheels (the Blue Badgermobile) getting stolen was just a lie, implying that the vehicle was not stolen.\n\nHowever, Evidence 8 shows that the Blue Badgermobile was parked inside the Wild, Wild West area garage the whole time with no mud on the tires, suggesting it was stationary and not driven around. This contradicts the idea that the vehicle was stolen and used to move the body, as in Testimonies 3 and 4 (but the question asks to identify only one pair).\n\nBetween Evidence 8 and Testimony 2, there is a contradiction: if Officer Meekins' story about the Blue Badgermobile being stolen was a lie (Testimony 2), then the vehicle would never have been driven or used to move the body. Evidence 8 supports the idea that the vehicle was not moved (no mud on tires, parked the whole time), which supports that it was not stolen.\n\nHence, the contradiction exists between Evidence 8 (which shows the vehicle remained stationary) and Testimony 3 (\"He drove the Blue Badgermobile here and committed the murder\") or Testimony 2 (the claim that Meekins' story is a lie).\n\nSince Testimony 2 says Meekins' story was a lie and Evidence 8 supports that the vehicle wasn't moved, there's no contradiction there; they align.\n\nThe contradiction is actually between Evidence 8 (suggesting the vehicle wasn't moved) and Testimony 3 (claiming the vehicle was driven to the scene and used for the murder).\n\nTherefore, the pair that directly contradict each other is Evidence 8 and Testimony 3.\n",

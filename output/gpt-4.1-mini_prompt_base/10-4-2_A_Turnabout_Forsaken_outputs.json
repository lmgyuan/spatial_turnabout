    "cot": "Evidence 11 (Autopsy Report) states that the chest wounds were inflicted post-mortem. However, testimony 3 by Karin states, \"The wounds on her chest were postmortem. I relayed everything to Karin. After that, it was none of my beeswax!\" which appears to support the evidence rather than contradict it. Therefore, no contradiction there.\n\nLooking through the testimonies, Karin repeatedly insists there are no mistakes in the autopsy report (testimonies 0,1,2,4,5), and that the chest wounds were post-mortem (testimony 3), which aligns with evidence 11.\n\nNow checking if any evidence states otherwise or contradicts Karin's statements:\n\n- Evidence 9 (Candelabrum) is suggested to be the murder weapon judging by wounds on the victim's chest. However, Evidence 11 says the wounds on the chest were inflicted post-mortem.\n\nThis suggests a contradiction: if the chest wounds were inflicted post-mortem (no life), how can they be the murder weapon wounds?\n\nThis contradiction is supported between Evidence 9 and Evidence 11.\n\nBut no testimony references the chest wounds as the murder weapon.\n\nChecking for contradictions between testimonies and evidences.\n\nGiven Karin's repeated assertion that the autopsy report is flawless and accurate, and the evidence indicates post-mortem chest wounds, if any testimony suggested the chest wounds were inflicted while alive (pre-mortem) that would contradict.\n\nBut none of the testimonies provided states that.\n\nAssessing if Nurse Niedler’s statement (testimony 23) contradicts anything about the victim's injuries, but no details about chest wounds or autopsy there.\n\nTherefore, the only contradiction to highlight is between the autopsy report (evidence 11) indicating chest wounds were postmortem and the suggestion that the candelabrum was the murder weapon by chest wounds (evidence 9).\n\nBut since the task asks for one evidence-testimony pair, and testimonies 0 to 5 from Karin all affirm the autopsy report with no contradiction, the only possible to select is testimony 2 where Karin says, \"There's no way I'd make a mistake in writing the autopsy report\" ...Ouch!\n\nIf the autopsy report mistakenly says chest wounds were postmortem, it would contradict her testimony.\n\nHence:\n\nEvidence 11 (Autopsy Report) contradicts Testimony 2 (Karin) because the wounds on the chest being postmortem seem suspicious or incorrect, as shown by the \"Ouch!\" which could imply a mistake.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 11 and Testimony 2.\n",

    "cot": "Evidence 5, the Medical Report Card, states that the victim was prohibited from eating or drinking anything but water on the day of the murder due to dental treatment. Evidence 9, Plate of Steak, shows a meal ordered by Miss Brett, a steak, which was removed from the victim's table after the incident. \n\nTestimony 0 by Nosa states he was eating a regulation beef steak at the restaurant during the incident.\n\nIf the victim was prohibited from eating anything but water, then the steak at the victim's table contradicts the victim's condition described in evidence. It suggests that the steak was not for the victim, but could have been for Miss Brett. However, Nosa’s testimony about ingesting a steak would conflict with Evidence 5’s claim that the victim could only ingest water. This logical conflict indicates that either the steak was not consumed by the victim or the victim did not follow the medical advice.\n\nA more direct contradiction is between Testimony 3 and the evidences about the shooter. Testimony 3 claims “The black-uniformed varsity cadet fired on the English civilian! And from the back, the cowardly little weasel!” But the post-mortem and photograph evidence show the victim was shot in the chest from the front.\n\nTherefore, Testimony 3 conflicts with Evidence 2, which shows the victim was shot in the chest from the front, contradicting the claim that the shooter was behind the victim.\n",

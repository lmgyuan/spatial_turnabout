    "cot": "Evidence 5 (Security Footage) shows video starting at the aquarium's 10 AM opening time, capturing events at the orca pool. Evidence 12 (Shipley's Data) states the time of death is under investigation but gives an estimated time from 12:00 to 10:00 AM on July 20th. \n\nTestimony 0 says Sasha was cleaning the orca pool room in the early morning hours of July 20th, and Testimony 1 adds Sasha and Jack Shipley were scheduled to clean together.\n\nIf the security footage records starting at 10 AM, it should show the orca pool room being cleaned at 10 AM if it was ongoing. Yet, Testimony 3 (Crab) states the pool water is drained during cleaning, and Testimony 6 warns the orca might die if the pool is empty. If the orca was in the pool, the water should not have been drained at that time.\n\nLooking at contradictions:\n\nEvidence 5 and Testimony 3 seem consistent (pool water drained during cleaning, footage from 10 AM shows cleaning).\n\nEvidence 12 says Shipley's time of death is between 12:00 and 10:00 AM, meaning the victim was dead or dying in the early morning, consistent with Testimonies 0 and 1.\n\nLet's focus on Evidence 22 (TORPEDO Data) shows Rifle ate around 4:00 AM on July 20th but Orla didn't eat anything. This contradicts that Orla was in the pool alive and well during normal aquarium hours. Testimony 4 says Marlon was taking care of Orla in the show pool while cleaning. If Orla didn't eat anything, this might contradict Marlon's care statement.\n\nBut the question asks for one pair of contradictory evidence and testimony.\n\nAnother strong contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 14 (Security Card): Only the victim and Sasha had a key card to access the orca pool.\n\nTestimony 2: The record of card usage shows that Sasha entered the orca pool room.\n\nBut Security Footage (Evid 5) might show someone else entering, if so that would contradict.\n\nBut we have no explicit contradiction noted.\n\nLooking further at Evidence 8 (Calendar), it says a meeting between victim and someone was scheduled for 7 AM on the 20th. Testimony 1 says Sasha and Jack Shipley were scheduled to clean together (early morning).\n\nEvidence 12 (Shipley's summary) says the estimated time of death is between 12:00 and 10:00 AM.\n\nIf the victim died before 10:00 AM but meeting scheduled at 7 AM, it implies Jack was alive at 7 AM.\n\nIf the victim was dead before 10 AM, but cleaning still scheduled, contradictory about his presence.\n\nSo the contradiction is between Evidence 12 (time of death) and Testimony 1 (cleaning scheduled with Jack present).\n\nTherefore: Evidence 12 and Testimony 1 contradict.\n",

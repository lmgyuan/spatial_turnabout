If Mr. Garrideb's pipe was broken during a domestic dispute (Evidence 11) and contained a piece of metal that could be part of a knife blade (Evidence 12), this conflicts with the narrative that the accused ran off and scattered his belongings, implying no breaking or domestic dispute involving the pipe.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 11 (broken pipe during domestic dispute) contradicts Testimony 3 (accused ran off, scattering belongings but no mention of such an event involving a broken pipe or domestic dispute).\n",

Additionally, in Testimony 4, Garrideb doubts the knife in the victim's back could be one from their house (\"If that bally thing in the victim's back really was one of ours...\").\n\nThis reflects a contradiction: if Garrideb's house has many knives and some could be missing, it might be possible the murder weapon came from there. But Garrideb denies that the knife found in the victim is from their place, casting doubt on whether the knife evidence can be linked to them. This is a contradiction as Garrideb both admits knives could be missing (implying they could be used in the crime) and denies the murder weapon is theirs.\n",

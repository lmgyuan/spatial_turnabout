However, Testimony 6 by Laguarde states that \"He probably had a dog dispose of the body,\" implying the dog was used post-murder, not as the perpetrator. Moreover, the bloodstained glove (Evidence 4) and the stab wound (Evidence 2 & 20) suggest a direct human involvement in the murder, not an animal attack.\n\nMore importantly, Laguarde's Testimony 3 says \"In any case, he was the one who stabbed the victim to death,\" referring to Kanis, while Evidence 15 (Security Camera Footage) shows the victim being attacked by a dark form (possibly a dog) around 9 AM, but the estimated time of death (Evidence 20) is between 3 AM and 6 AM, making it impossible that the attack seen in the footage was the fatal one.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction lies between:\n\n- Evidence 15: Security Camera Footage showing an attack at around 9 AM\n\n- Testimony 3: Laguarde's assertion that Kanis stabbed the victim to death (which must have happened before 6 AM according to the autopsy)\n\nThis contradiction highlights that the \"dark form\" in the footage could not have been the cause of death, contradicting any testimony implying the dog attack was the murder.\n\nHowever, the question asks for only one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other.\n\nAnother clearer contradiction is between:\n\n- Evidence 9: Sahwit claims to have seen a black dog biting the victim's throat.\n\n- Testimony 3: Laguarde asserts that Kanis stabbed the victim to death.\n\nIf the dog bit the throat, that would contradict the assertion that the victim was stabbed to death by Kanis.\n\nBecause the autopsy (Evidence 20) confirms the cause of death as stabbing, the claim of the dog biting the throat (Evidence 9) contradicts the stabbing cause.\n\nTherefore, the pair is Evidence 9 and Testimony 3.\n",

You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Evidence 5 states that a rope was discovered on top of Knight's body, suggesting the victim may have been tied up. However, there is no testimony that explicitly supports or denies this. Instead, focusing on a more direct contradiction:\n\nTestimony 4 by Laguarde states: \"After our talk, he went right back to his cell, I assure you.\" This testimony implies that after being brought to her office at around 3 AM (Testimony 1), Knight immediately returned to his cell without incident.\n\nEvidence 15, however, describes security camera footage showing the victim being attacked around 9 AM in the detention center holding cell. This contradicts the implication in Testimony 4 that Knight went straight back to his cell without further issues after the 3 AM meeting; if he was attacked at 9 AM, it means he was not safely in his cell or at least that something happened later, contradicting the assurance of the witness.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 15 and Testimony 4 contradict each other.\n",

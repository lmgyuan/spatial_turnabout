    "cot": "Evidence 7 (Weather Data) states that snow fell from 7 PM to approximately 10:50 PM, and lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. It also notes that about 30 minutes passed between the fire starting and going out, and Bikini claims she saw the murder at around 11 PM.\n\nTestimony 6 by Iris says, \"By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.\" Since the snow stopped at approximately 10:50 PM according to the weather data, and the murder was seen at 11 PM, these two statements seem consistent regarding the snow stopping before the murder occurred.\n\nHowever, Iris's testimony 4 and 5 describe actions involving moving the body and then using the Shichishito to alter the wound, implying some timing considerations.\n\nMore importantly, looking at Iris's Testimonies 2, 3, 4, and 5 collectively suggests she moved the body \"across Dusky Bridge\" and \"used the Shichishito,\" but the evidence shows:\n\nEvidence 10 (Shichishito) is stated to have the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints but is explicitly not the murder weapon.\n\nBecause the Shichishito is linked to altering the wound but has evidence of victim's blood, it's contradictory that it was not the murder weapon, yet used to alter the wound.\n\nAlso, Iris claims she removed the body herself and dragged it across the Dusky Bridge (Testimonies 2 and 3), but from Evidence 7 and 14 (Tracks Photo) and the timeline of the murder, the movement of the body might conflict with the time of the murder and snow conditions.\n\nLooking specifically for a direct contradiction, the clearest is:\n\nEvidence 7 says snow stopped approximately 10:50 PM, but Bikini says she saw the murder at 11 PM (timing consistency), and Iris says the murder happened after snow stopped.\n\nHowever, Iris's Testimony 6 states \"By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.\" which aligns.\n\nLooking for contradiction:\n\nIris’s Testimony 6 says snow stopped before the murder, but Evidence 7 shows snow continuing until 10:50 PM, with lightning at 10:45 PM. If the fire started around 10:45 PM, and lasted 30 minutes, this would go beyond the snow stopping time.\n\nBikini's statement that she saw the murder at around 11 PM conflicts with Iris's statements about the timeline.\n\nBut these are consistent.\n\nUpon review, the strongest direct contradiction is the Testimonies vs. Evidence about the Shichishito:\n\nEvidence 10: Shichishito - Had victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints, but is NOT the murder weapon.\n\nIris Testimony 5 says: \"...I used the Shichishito to alter the way the wound looked.\"\n\nIf the Shichishito altered the wound, but is not the murder weapon, this suggests the real murder weapon is different.\n\nEvidence 9 (Victim's Staff) is the actual murder weapon but is hidden.\n\nTherefore, Iris's statement about using the Shichishito to alter the wound is contradicted by evidence that it was not the weapon.\n\nHence, the contradiction is:\n\nEvidence 10 vs. Iris's Testimony 5.\n",

You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}.

    "cot": "Evidence 20 (Stone Lantern) states that the lantern was not lit the night of the crime. However, Testimony 3 from Maya mentions, \"The torches were lit... And the body was gone.\" Torches and lanterns are different types of light sources, so this isn't a direct contradiction. Instead, look for contradictions related to lighting or the state of the scene.\n\nEvidence 20 says the stone lantern was not lit, and Testimony 4 says, \"And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.\" Cleaning snow around the lantern implies that the area was accessed, but there's no direct contradiction there since the lantern wasn't lit but the snow was cleared.\n\nTestimony 5 says, \"Since the person did all that work alone, I just assumed it was a man...\" This is an assumption rather than a fact to compare with evidence.\n\nTestimony 1 says, \"By the time I got back to the garden, the place had totally changed...\" This is a general statement that does not conflict with any specific evidence.\n\nTestimony 2: \"I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence of what had happened.\" This aligns with the evidence of cleaned-up snow.\n\nTestimony 0: \"...When I came to, I was just lying there on the Training Hall floor.\" No contradiction with evidence.\n\nTestimony 3: \"The torches were lit... And the body was gone.\" versus Evidence 20: \"Stone Lantern was not lit.\" Since these are different light sources (torches vs. lantern), this is not necessarily a contradiction.\n\nLet's look at Evidence 9 (Victim's Staff): Carried by Elise, has her fingerprints, hidden sword, and is actual murder weapon; only Gumshoe and the player know this.\n\nEvidence 10 (Shichishito): The apparent murder weapon, has victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints, but is NOT the murder weapon.\n\nNo direct contradictions to testimonies here.\n\nEvidence 6 (Iris's Hood): Protected her from evil spirits; Testimony 12 (Iris's Testimony) states she rang the lights-out bell at 10 PM and was in her room until the murder was discovered. No contradictions.\n\nLooking closer, Testimony 3 says \"The torches were lit...\" but Evidence 20 states the \"Stone Lantern was not lit the night of the crime.\" If the torches were lit, then the stone lantern not being lit is still consistent. So no contradiction here.\n\nAlso, Maya states in Testimony 4: \"And all the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned,\" implying someone cleaned the snow around the stone lantern.\n\nHowever, Evidence 7 (Weather Data) says it was snowing heavily until approx. 10:50 PM. Lightning at 10:45 on the Dusky Bridge. If the snow was still falling around the time of the murder, the snow should have been accumulating. But the snow around the stone lantern was cleaned up.\n\nMaya's Testimony 5 says: \"Since the person did all that work alone, I just assumed it was a man,\" but this is just her assumption, no evidence to contradict.\n\nOne strong contradiction: Testimony 3 says \"torches were lit,\" but Evidence 20 says the stone lantern was not lit. While these are different light sources, typically both would be lit to illuminate the garden. So if the torches were lit but the stone lantern not lit, that might indicate contradictory conditions about the lighting.\n\nBut to find a clearer contradiction:\n\nTestimony 4 says, \"And all the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.\" However, the Stone Lantern (Evidence 20) was not lit that night.\n\nCleaning snow around the lantern suggests someone was present and active near the lantern, perhaps carrying out acts such as lighting it or using it.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is that the stone lantern was not lit (evidence), yet the snow around it was carefully cleaned (testimony). If the lantern was not lit, there would be no reason to clear snow around it.\n\nHence, the pair is Evidence 20 and Testimony 4.\n",

    "cot": "Testimony 0 says: \"Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night!\" (Person: Maya), meaning Pearl Fey could not have crossed the Dusky Bridge.\n\nEvidence 14 is \"Tracks Photo: Taken that night.

Protects from evil spirits.\"\n\nIf Iris only got the hood before the lights-out bell at 10 PM, and the murder was between 10-11 PM (Evidence 11: Autopsy report), and Iris was in her room, then her being in her room is consistent.\n\nNo contradiction.\n\nAnother possibility:\n\nEvidence 9: Victim's Staff: \"Has a sword hidden inside.

Unless she was already on the same side.\n\nNo clear contradiction.\n\nOne more possibility is the photograph evidence vs testimony about Pearl.\n\nGiven from Testimony 0 Pearl was stuck on the Inner Temple side.\n\nEvidence 14 is \"Tracks photo: From main gate to Dusky Bridge\" (possibly showing footprints crossing the bridge.)\n\nIf tracks include footprints going across, and one is thought to be Pearl's, then the testimony and evidence contradict.\n\nHence, the best answer is:\n\nEvidence 14 (Tracks Photo) suggests footprints crossing the Dusky Bridge.\n\nTestimony 0 says Pearl was stuck on the Inner Temple side and could not cross.\n\nThis contradicts each other.\n",

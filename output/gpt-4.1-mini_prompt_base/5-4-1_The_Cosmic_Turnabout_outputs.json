I was trying to save him!\nPerson: Starbuck\n\nWhich evidence and testimony contradict each other? You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "The pair that contradict each other is Evidence 16 (Lighter) and Testimony 3 (Starbuck).\n\nExplanation:\n- Testimony 3 by Starbuck claims innocence: \"I didn't kill Clay! I was trying to save him!\"\n- Evidence 16 shows the lighter with Athena's prints in the victim's blood, found by Detective Fulbright. This implies that the true culprit held a lighter with evidence at the scene, which contradicts Starbuck's claim of innocence if he was indeed the culprit. However, since the prints are Athena's, it implicates someone else and does not necessarily contradict Starbuck directly. \n\nSo, let's look at another contradiction.\n\nEvidence 0 (Attorney's Badge) has no direct contradicting testimony.\n\nEvidence 6 (Launch Pad 1 Door Lock) indicates only the defendant, victim, and Space Center director had access. This may contradict any testimony denying access.\n\nStarbuckâ€™s Testimony 1: \"Like always, I took the elevator down to the middle level and headed for the corridor.\"\n\nEvidence 4 (Bombing Report): explosions sparked fire on second floor and middle level near elevator.\n\nIf Starbuck says he took the elevator down to the middle level, but evidence shows the elevator area was compromised with explosions and fire, this may be a contradiction regarding movement.\n\nHowever, this is circumstantial and does not directly contradict his testimony.\n\nTestimony 0 by Starbuck: \"All I did was support Clay over my shoulder and get us out of the rocket!\"\n\nBut Evidence 8 (Oxygen Tank Data) shows victim's oxygen tank was ruptured by a bullet, suggesting shooting, while Starbuck claims to only carry Clay.\n\nTestimony 2: \"Clay had passed out by the time we got the order to evacuate.\"\n\nEvidence 7 (Security Camera Video) shows the defendant and victim's escape from the corridor to the boarding lounge, ending abruptly.\n\nIf Starbuck claims to be supporting Clay out of the rocket, but video shows movement only of the victim and defendant to boarding lounge, this can be a contradiction.\n\nThere's a stronger contradiction between Evidence 16 (Lighter with Athena's prints), which suggests Athena's involvement, and the initial assumption of suspects.\n\nBut no direct contradictory testimony from Athena is presented.\n\nLooking more closely, Evidence 14 (Aura's Statement): The perp held a lighter with an Earth emblem on it in their left hand, and a knife in their right.\n\nEvidence 16 says the lighter found has Athena's prints in victim's blood.\n\nBut Athena is not a suspect and no testimony from her is given.\n\nThus, contradiction involving Starbuck's claim of innocence (Testimony 3) and clear evidence of a weapon (knife and lighter) presence does apply to Starbuck.\n\nHe denies killing but being found with the lighter and knife in the victim's blood contradicts that.\n\nTherefore, the strongest contradiction is Evidence 16 and Testimony 3.\n",

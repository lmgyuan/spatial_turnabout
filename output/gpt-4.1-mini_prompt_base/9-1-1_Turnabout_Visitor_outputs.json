    "cot": "Evidence 6 states that Ms. Byrde unlocked the door to Mr. Portsman's office but her prints were not found on the doorknob. This suggests that although she was the one who unlocked the door, there is no physical evidence (fingerprints) supporting this claim.\n\nNone of the testimonies explicitly contradict this evidence except indirectly. However, Testimony 0, given by Portsman, accuses Detective Gumshoe of stealing the gun and shooting the victim. This is a direct accusation that implies Gumshoe had access and control over the victim’s weapon.\n\nNo other direct contradiction is as apparent as between Evidence 6 (Ms. Byrde unlocked but no prints) and the fact that the Master Key was stolen from security (Evidence 5), yet Ms. Byrde claims to have unlocked the door without the master key being present. This suggests a discrepancy between what Ms. Byrde said (implied by evidence 6) and the controlled access to office doors. But this is between two pieces of evidence, not evidence and testimony.\n\nTestimony 0 to 4 from Portsman are accusations toward Gumshoe’s guilt. Specifically, Testimony 3 mentions that Gumshoe did not notice the bloody letters his body was hiding. The Note left by the victim (Evidence 8) was found under the door, intended for Portsman (the absent one).\n\nGiven these, the clearest contradiction is between Evidence 6 (Ms. Byrde says she unlocked the door, but her prints were not found) and the fact Ms. Byrde's statement (Testimony?) is not part of the testimonies, but the evidence description itself mentions her statement.\n\nTherefore, the pair is Evidence 6 (Ms. Byrde unlocked the door, but no prints found) and Testimony 1 (Portsman’s statement accusing Gumshoe of messing files to look like he committed theft). This does not directly contradict.\n\nAlternatively, the accusation from Portsman in Testimony 0 that Gumshoe stole Jim's gun conflicts with Evidence 2, which says the victim's revolver (Jim's gun) is the murder weapon, but no evidence says Gumshoe had it. The conflict is that Portsman accuses Gumshoe, but there is no direct physical evidence supporting this.\n\nTherefore, the best fitting pair of contradicting evidence and testimony is:\n\nEvidence 6: Ms. Byrde unlocked Mr. Portsman's office door but no prints were found on the knob.\n\nTestimony 2: Portsman says \"That's when you moved Jim's body that was sitting in front of the bookshelf!\", which implies someone moved the body, suggesting physical interaction with the scene and door.\n\nHowever, Ms. Byrde's lack of prints would contradict Testimony 2 if Ms. Byrde was the one who moved the body (implied since she is the security at night).\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 6 (Ms. Byrde unlocked the door but no prints found)\n\nTestimony 2 (Portsman says someone moved the body)\n\nAssuming Ms. Byrde moved the body, her missing prints on the door contradict her statement.\n\nHence:\n",

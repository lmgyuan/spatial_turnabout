    "cot": "Evidence 14 states that Frost's and Gusto's creations for the semifinals had different designs but tasted the same, suggesting that they were working closely together at least up to the semifinals.\n\nTestimony 3 claims that Gusto had poor design sense and Frost was a novice at baking. This could imply a division of labor rather than close cooperation, which somewhat aligns with Evidence 14.\n\nTestimony 2 says \"Until the day before the finals, they worked on their desserts together,\" implying cooperation continued beyond the semifinals.\n\nTestimony 4 says \"Their cooperation lasted only through the semifinals. For the finals, they were on their own,\" which aligns with evidence 14's mention of semifinals but conflicts with testimony 2, not evidence.\n\nTherefore, the only direct conflicting pair between evidence and testimony could be the interpretation of the duration or nature of their cooperation; but evidence 14 supports the semifinals cooperation.\n\nHowever, testimonial evidence from von Karma (1) \"Last night, when I interrogated Gusto, he told me about his connection with Frost\" and evidence 17/29 \"Family Photo\" shows Frost, Gusto, and their sons, and that Gusto's son visited his father daily up through the semifinal.\n\nNot very contradictory.\n\nIn the evidences, Evidence 7 (Salt Lamp stained with victim's blood found in Scone's room) and Evidence 28 (a photo of the salt lamp from the IS-7 Incident) showing it as murder weapon, might contrast with a statement or testimony that Scone was innocent, but no testimony saying this directly.\n\nSo looking again:\n\nTestimony 4 (by von Karma): Their cooperation lasted only through the semifinals.\n\nEvidence 2: Crime scene notes relevant.\n\nNot conflicting.\n\nTestimony 2: Until the day before the finals, they worked on their desserts together.\n\nConflict with Testimony 4 (both from von Karma) but not with evidence.\n\nLooking more:\n\nEvidence 16: Victim's blood found in fountain, but not at scene.\n\nSalt Lamp with blood in Scone's room (Evidence 7).\n\nEvidence 8: Ms Scone's creations were fake and covered with whipped cream.\n\nTestimony 13: Ms Scone's statement said the lyre sculpture was salty.\n\nNo direct conflict.\n\nEvidence 5: Finger marks on chocolate frame but no prints.\n\nEvidence 27: Finger marks on frame in Tangaroa's room, no prints.\n\nSame presumably, no contradiction.\n\nIn sum, the strongest contradiction seems between:\n\nTestimony 2: \"Until the day before the finals, they worked on their desserts together.\"\n\nTestimony 4: \"Their cooperation lasted only through the semifinals.\"\n\nBoth from von Karma, but contradictory.\n\nBut the prompt requires to provide a pair between evidence and testimony, so only considers evidence and testimony.\n\nTherefore, let's check for a contradiction between Evidence 14 and one of these testimonies.\n\nEvidence 14 states: Final creations different design but same taste.\n\nThat matches with cooperation until the semifinals, but testimony 2 says cooperation until before finals (which is just before finals).\n\nSo this means they cooperated beyond semifinals.\n\nHence, testimony 2 (\"until day before finals\") contradicts the implication of Evidence 14 that cooperation ended at semifinals.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 14 and Testimony 2 contradict each other.\n",

This suggests that the cloth (a key piece of property) has some historical and physical ties to the mansion or related events 18 years ago.\n\nIf the mansion was only bought back 18 years after the arrest, it would be contradictory if items linked to events exactly 18 years ago were still present and undiscovered in the mansion prior to Kate's ownership.

You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Testimony 0 states that Gusto and Sir Frost cooperated until the finals with Gusto handling flavor and Frost in charge of design. However, Testimony 2 says that Gusto helped Sir Frost make his entry but made his own entry completely on his own, which slightly contradicts the extent of cooperation described in Testimony 0, particularly if the finals were as competitive as implied by Testimony 1. The contradiction mainly lies in the nature and extent of cooperation between Gusto and Frost during the finals.\n\nNone of the evidence directly contradicts these testimonies explicitly. However, looking through the evidences related to the finals and their entries:\n\nEvidence 14 states Frost's and Gusto's creations had different designs but tasted the same, which might imply cooperation on flavor or recipe, slightly contradicting Gusto's claim in Testimony 2 of making his entry completely on his own.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 14 and Testimony 2 contradict each other.\n",

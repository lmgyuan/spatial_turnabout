    "cot": "The contradiction lies between Evidence 7 and the testimonies by Gumshoe (Testimonies 4 and 5). \n\nEvidence 7 states that the guitar case found next to the victim is empty and bears only Corrida's fingerprints. However, Gumshoe's testimonies mention that the defendant's fingerprints (Engarde's) were on the knife (Testimony 4), and that Engarde bought the knife for the crime (Testimony 5). Since the guitar case was empty and bears only Corrida's fingerprints, this contrasts with the claim that Engarde's fingerprints were on the knife, which is presumably connected to the case. This suggests a contradiction between the physical evidence of the guitar case and the accusation that Engarde had premeditated murder with the knife.\n",

Evidence 8 states that the wine glass found next to the victim is filled with tomato juice and has Andrews' fingerprints on it. Testimony 4 states that Andrews poured herself a glass of juice, which aligns with the evidence. However, Testimony 5 states that Andrews knocked over the flower vase onto the guitar case. If the glass was poured after the vase was knocked over, the scattered water from the vase should have gotten on the glass or her fingers, but it is not indicated. Also, the glass was found next to the victim, suggesting it was placed there before the vase was knocked over. This creates a temporal inconsistency regarding when and where the juice was poured and the vase knocked over.\n",

Evidence 15 shows the knife with the victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints, which further implicates Matt in the crime.\n\nTestimony 3 from Andrews says Matt didn't have an alibi for the time of the murder, and testimony 4 says thoughts were confirmed by the evidence including the button and knife.\n\nHowever, Andrews Testimony 6 says \"But I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...\", implying she tried to protect Matt despite the evidence against him.\n\nThe contradiction lies between Andrews Testimony 1, \"Matt had to kill Juan no matter what.\" and her other statements that protect Matt or defend him despite the evidence. But that is not a direct contradiction.\n\nMore importantly, Evidence 8 \"Wine Glass\" is found next to the victim and bears Andrews' fingerprints, showing her direct presence at the scene, but Andrews Testimony 0 through 6 try only to focus blame on Matt and not herself.\n\nThere is a stronger contradiction between Evidence 16 and Testimony 3 or 4 (both from Andrews), but these are not direct contradictions.\n\nAnother look:\n\nAndrews says Matt didn't have an alibi (Testimony 3), but the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record the victim's room from 8 PM for 1 hour and was running at the time of murder. If this camera includes the time and place for Matt, that can serve as an alibi for Matt contradicting Andrews' claim.\n\nIf the spy camera footage is accurate, Andrews' claim (\"And he didn't have an alibi...\") contradicts evidence showing an alibi.\n\nTherefore:\n\nEvidence 21 (Spy Camera) shows video footage of the victim's room at the time of murder.\n\nTestimony 3 (Andrews) says, \"And he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.\"\n\nThese contradict each other if the spy camera footage shows Matt Engarde was somewhere else or shows Matt's innocence (depending on footage content).\n\nHence the pair is:\n",

    "cot": "Testimony 3 states: \"The one who was winning... dah, it was victim!\" This suggests that the victim was winning the game at the time.\n\nHowever, Evidence 6 shows the chips and cards for both the defendant and the victim. According to the chip counts and values described in testimonies 1 and 2, the defendant (near side) has more points in chips compared to the victim (far side). The defendant has 4 small chips and 1 big chip, and the victim has 2 small chips and 9 big chips. If small chips are worth 100 points and big chips are worth 1,000 points, the defendant has (4 × 100) + (1 × 1,000) = 1,400 points, and the victim has (2 × 100) + (9 × 1,000) = 9,200 points. So the victim does have more chips, which aligns with testimony 3 stating the victim was winning. Therefore, there is actually no direct contradiction here.\n\nLet's check more closely:\n\n- Testimony 4: \"For last hand, defendant play with all chips on table and lose.\"\n- Testimony 5: \"The moment loss was decided, defendant grabs bottle from table and...\"\n\nTestimony 4 says the defendant bet all chips and lost. Evidence 6 shows chip distribution (counts) at the time of the crime. If defendant bet all chips and lost, he'd have no chips after the last hand, but Evidence 6 shows the defendant still has chips.\n\nSo testimony 4 says the defendant played all chips and lost. Evidence 6 shows the defendant with chips at the crime scene. This is contradictory.\n\nThus, the contradictory pair is Evidence 6 and Testimony 4.\n",

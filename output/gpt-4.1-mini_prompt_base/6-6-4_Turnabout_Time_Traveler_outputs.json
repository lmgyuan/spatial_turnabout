    "cot": "Evidence 2, Ellen's Statement, says that Ellen saw a suspicious third party on the vista deck when she was being attacked by Gloomsbury. If this is true, Ellen was not alone during the attack and potentially was not with Nichody. \n\nTestimony 5, given by Nichody, states that he was always in the company of others and did not have the opportunity to murder Gloomsbury. This implies Nichody had an alibi supported by the presence of other people, which could contradict Ellen seeing a suspicious third party (possibly Nichody or someone else) alone or acting suspiciously on the vista deck.\n\nHowever, the contradiction is not direct between these two pieces of information. Let’s consider another option:\n\nTestimony 3 by Nichody states, \"I've never thought of exacting revenge on Master Sorin.\" This implies that Nichody has no motive for revenge against Sorin. However:\n\nEvidence 19 is a Newspaper Article about the car accident that resulted in Selena Sprocket's death, and Sorin was the one driving. This could imply that Nichody might harbor some resentment or motive linked to this accident—especially given the emotional gravity of such an event. Although the testimony denies having thoughts of revenge, the evidence suggests a possible motive.\n\nBut this is more circumstantial rather than a direct contradiction.\n\nNow looking at:\n\nEvidence 7, Gloomsbury's Note, indicates the note was written by a right-handed person, while we know from Evidence 17, the Candelabra, bears fingerprints of Gloomsbury’s dominant left hand. Gloomsbury’s note being written by a right-handed person could contradict the implication if the note was thought to be written by Gloomsbury (left-handed). \n\nBut this is about evidence contradicting itself, not a testimony.\n\nAnother angle:\n\nTestimony 1 from Nichody says, \"Gloomsbury was my right hand man. I'd suffer the most from losing him.\"\n\nBut Evidence 5, Broken Lantern, shows the victim was transported by Larry and the lamp was wheeled from the hold to the reception hall before the reception started. Nichody's attachment to the pocket watch (description in Character 9) might indicate more involvement than he wants to admit. Yet not a direct contradiction.\n\nFinally:\n\nTestimony 5 from Nichody: \"I was always in the company of others. I didn't have the opportunity to murder Gloomsbury.\"\n\nEvidence 15: Hold Entry Record. This record may show keycard usage indicating who accessed the hold where the murder happened.\n\nIf Nichody claims always being with others (never alone), but the entry record shows he accessed the hold alone at the time of the murder, these contradict.\n\nHence:\n\nThe contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 15: Hold Entry Record (implying access to the hold at the murder time, possibly alone)\n\nTestimony 5: Nichody says he was always in company with others, denying opportunity to murder.\n\nTherefore, the contradicting pair is Evidence 15 and Testimony 5.\n",

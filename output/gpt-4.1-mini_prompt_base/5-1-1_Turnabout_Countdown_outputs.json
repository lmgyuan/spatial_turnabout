However, Testimony 3 (Tonate) says he saw the bomb's timer counting down, implying that the bomb was active and ticking, conflicting with the idea that it was disarmed when transported.\n\nThe contradiction is between Tonateâ€™s claim that the bomb was disarmed (Testimony 0) and that the bomb's timer was counting down (Testimony 3). This implies either the bomb was not disarmed as claimed, or it was reactivated later.\n\nThe answer requested is one pair between evidence and testimony.

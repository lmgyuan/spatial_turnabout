If the Sacred Urn looks like a plain old pot and has no monetary value (Evidence 4), it contradicts the idea that it is among the \"most precious art pieces.\"\n\nThus, Evidence 4, which suggests the Sacred Urn has no monetary value and is damaged, contradicts Gumshoe's testimony (Testimony 3) that Mask☆DeMasque only goes after the most precious art pieces.\n",

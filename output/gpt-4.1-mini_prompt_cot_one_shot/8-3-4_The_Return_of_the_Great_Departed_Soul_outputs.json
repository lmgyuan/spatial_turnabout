Tell me...did the victim have a twin?\nPerson: Drebber\nTestimony 3\nTestimony: All the spectators saw the birdcage appear above their heads and then crash headfirst into the Crystal Tower.\nPerson: Drebber\nTestimony 4\nTestimony: The kinesis clearly took place, because there's nowhere else thirty feet high for the birdcage to have fallen from.\nPerson: Drebber\nTestimony 5\nTestimony: A terrible accident, I grant you. Perhaps the science on which the machine was built was flawed somehow?\nPerson: Drebber\n\nAnswer:\nLet's think step by step:",
    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidences and testimonies for contradictions.\n\nEvidence 5 (Photograph of the Victim) shows an apparent stab wound to the chest.\nEvidence 6 (Autopsy Report) confirms the victim was stabbed in the chest and had a broken neck from a violent fall.\nTestimony 3 states that the birdcage appeared above the spectators' heads and then crashed headfirst into the Crystal Tower, causing the victim's fall.\nTestimony 4 asserts that the kinesis took place, indicating the birdcage actually flew and fell from 30 feet high.\n\nHowever, Evidence 10 (Wooden 'Birdcage') states that the cage crashed down into the Crystal Tower, but the damage to the tower and the victim's condition suggest not just a fall but also a stabbing.\n\nTestimony 5 doubts the science of the machine and suggests the accident, but nothing directly contradicts an evidence.\n\nNow looking for a strong contradiction:\nEvidence 7 (Screwdriver) shows a weapon found in the kinesis machine with blood that matches the victim's wound, implicating the screwdriver as the stabbing weapon.\n\nDrebber's testimonies characterizes the machine as built correctly and claims the kinesis occurred.\n\nBut in Testimony 2, he talks about a body double if the show was a fraud, asking about a twin. This implies he is doubting the victim's death or the explosion's authenticity.\n\nNow, check if this conflicts with the evidence proves the victim died from stabbing and fall injuries.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction seems to be between the notion the kinesis took place (Testimony 4) and scientific plausibility or the existence of evidence that the victim was stabbed with a screwdriver hidden in the machine (Evidence 7).\n\nThis suggests Drebber claims the kinesis took place (Testimony 4) but the presence of the screwdriver with blood (Evidence 7) implies foul play rather than an accident.\n\nHence, these two contradict because the testimony denies possibility of murder weapon being involved, whereas evidence shows the screwdriver as the murder weapon.\n",

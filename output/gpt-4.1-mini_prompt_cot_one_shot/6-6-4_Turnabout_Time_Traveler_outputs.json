    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies for contradictions.\n\nEvidence 14 (Autopsy Report) states that the Time Keeper was used as the murder weapon, and also states Gloomsbury's head shows signs of being hit twice. \n\nOn the other hand, Nichody's repeated statement (attached to almost all evidences) claims that Sorin was stabbed by Gloomsbury with the candelabra, and that the struggle was between Sorin and Gloomsbury using the candelabra as the stabbing weapon.\n\nThis is a contradiction: the autopsy report says the Time Keeper was the murder weapon, but Nichody's testimony suggests the candelabra was the stabbing weapon.\n\nThis contradicts the central theme, as the murder weapon cannot be both the Time Keeper (clock with secret mechanism) and the candelabra.\n\nTherefore, the evidence and testimony contradict on what the murder weapon is.\n\nEvidence 14 says Time Keeper was the murder weapon.\n\nNichody's testimony says Gloomsbury stabbed Sorin with the candelabra.\n\nHence, the contradiction is between Evidence 14 and Nichody's statements (which are attached to all evidences but let's consider the overall statement).\n\nAmong testifying characters, no explicit numerical testimony is assigned to Nichody, only to Sorin. So we need to map Nichody's statement as testimonial evidence.\n\nBut in the testimonies, Sorin says \"Pierce heard the commotion,\" \"I was stabbed,\" but no direct mention of candelabra.\n\nThus, Nichody's account (the statement repeated in the evidences) contradicts the autopsy report which disagrees with that the candelabra was used.\n\nHence, the contradiction is between Evidence 14 (Autopsy Report) and Nichody's statement attached to multiple evidences (which acts as testimony). Since the testimonies are numbered and assigned to persons and Nichody is not assigned a numbered testimony, there is no direct testimony line for Nichody.\n\nLooking at the testimonies assigned to Sorin, he never says what weapon suspected was. The contradiction is between Evidence 14 and Nichody's account.\n\nGiven the instruction to output one evidence and one testimony pair, we must pick one testimony.\n\nThe only testimony that describes the injury and speaks about being stabbed is Testimony 3: \"I was badly injured from being stabbed, but I was frantic.\"\n\nTestimony 3 is Sorin's statement and can be seen in conflict with Evidence 14 regarding the actual weapon.\n\nBut Testimony 3 does not specify weapon type, only injury.\n\nLooking for testimony that contradicts the murder weapon:\n\nNone specify the murder weapon explicitly.\n\nBut Nichody's statement is repeated for all evidences, strongly claiming the candelabra was the weapon.\n\nSo the contradiction is between nichody's account (a testimony) and autopsy report. \n\nTherefore, select Evidence 14 (Autopsy Report) and Nichody's statement (testimony). Since Nichody has no numbered testimony, we may assume they are not counted as testimonies.\n\nAlternatively, pick Testimony 3 (Sorin's statement about stabbing) which does not mention weapon but can be linked as contradicting the evidence.\n\nAlternatively, consider Testimony 0 (I went to the vista deck with Pierce) is neutral.\n\nTestimony 2: \"That's why my name doesn't appear on the hold entry record,\" is relevant about access.\n\nNo explicit contradiction here.\n\nIn summary, the only notable contradiction from the info given is that the candelabra (Evidence 17) is claimed by Nichody to be the stabbing weapon, but autopsy report (Evidence 14) says the Time Keeper was the murder weapon.\n\nHence, I will answer:\n\n{\"evidence\": 14, \"testimony\": 1} \n\nBut 1 is Sorin saying \"Pierce heard the commotion...\" - not related.\n\nAlternatively pick Testimony 3 (Sorin's stabbing comment).\n\nGiven the situation, the best match is:\n\nEvidence 14 (Autopsy Report) vs testimony assigned to Nichody (which is not numbered).\n\nAlternatively, pick the testimony 3 about stabbing.\n\nHence:\n",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided:\n\nEvidence 18 (Sorin's Notebook) states that one page has been torn out. \nTestimony 1 (Nichody) says that he saw Master Sorin writing in his notebook at the scene.\nTestimony 3 and 5 both say that Nichody tore the page out of the notebook to protect Sorin.\n\nThere's no direct contradiction here.\n\nEvidence 5 (Broken Lantern) says that the victim's body was found in the Pegabull lantern, restored by Ema but with a bloodstain inside.\n\nTestimony 4 (Nichody) says he hid the still-warm body in the Pegabull lantern in the hold.\n\nNo contradiction here either.\n\nEvidence 14 (Autopsy Report) says Gloomsbury's head shows signs of being hit twice, and the Time Keeper was used as the murder weapon.\n\nTestimony 2 (Nichody) says Master Sorin said to him, \"I'll take the blame for the murder, so please take care of Ellen.\" This suggests Sorin taking responsibility.\n\nNo explicit contradiction.\n\nEvidence 17 (Candelabra) says it bears the fingerprints of Gloomsbury's left hand and is stained with blood matching the blood on the side of the lift.\n\nEvidence 16 (Lift Bloodstain) says the blood on the side of the lift in the hold matches the blood on the candelabra.\n\nNo contradictions yet.\n\nEvidence 2 (Ellen's Statement) says Ellen saw a suspicious third party on the vista deck when she was being attacked by Gloomsbury.\n\nTestimony 0 (Nichody) says he rushed to the vista deck, but the crime had already been committed.\n\nIf Ellen was attacked on the vista deck and saw a third party, and Nichody says the crime had already been committed when he arrived, there is no contradiction in their testimonies.\n\nLooking further:\n\nEvidence 7 (Gloomsbury's Note) says the writing is smudged as though written by a right-handed person.\n\nNothing appears contradictory here in testimony.\n\nEvidence 10 (Photo of Reception) shows much of the reception hall obscured by thick fog from the Fog Machine (Evidence 8).\n\nNo contradiction here.\n\nNow, examine Evidence 1 (Ellen's Pendant) which she received from her fiancé Sorin.\n\nTestimony 1 (Nichody) says he saw Miss Ellen and Gloomsbury collapsed, and Master Sorin writing in his notebook.\n\nEllen was attacked by Gloomsbury and collapsed, and Nichody saw Sorin writing.\n\nNo contradiction.\n\nLooking back at Evidence 4 (Time Keeper), the murder weapon was activated and used on the victim.\n\nTestimony 2 says Sorin said he will take the blame.\n\nIf Sorin is the murderer, he couldn't have written in his notebook (per testimony 1) without stopping.\n\nNo direct contradiction.\n\nHowever, no testimony states that Sorin was not the murderer.\n\nNow, focusing on testimony that may contradict Evidence 18 (Sorin's Notebook), which has a torn page.\n\nTestimony 0 says that Nichody rushed to the vista deck, but the crime had already been committed.\n\nTestimony 3 says Nichody tore out a page from Sorin's notebook and hid the body.\n\nThis suggests Nichody altered the evidence.\n\nEvidence 18 shows the missing page.\n\nSo no contradiction, but confirmation.\n\nLooking for direct contradiction:\n\nEvidence 2, Ellen's Statement, says Ellen saw a suspicious third party on the vista deck when attacked by Gloomsbury.\n\nTestimony 0 says Nichody rushed there but the crime was already committed.\n\nNo contradiction.\n\nEvidence 6 (Photo of Victim) says victim was found inside the lantern in reception hall.\n\nTestimony 4 (Nichody) says he hid the body in the spare Pegabull lantern in the hold.\n\nContradiction: The victim's body was found in the reception hall lantern (Evidence 6), but Nichody claims he hid the body in a lantern in the hold (Testimony 4).\n\nThe locations differ: reception hall vs. hold.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 6 and Testimony 4.\n",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies to find a contradiction:\n\nEvidence 14 (Autopsy Report) states that the Time Keeper was used as the murder weapon, and that Gloomsbury's head shows signs of being hit twice.\n\nTestimony 5 by Nichody claims: \"I was always in the company of others. I didn't have the opportunity to murder Gloomsbury.\"\n\nHowever, Evidence 5 (Broken Lantern) shows the victim’s body was found inside a lantern, which had a bloodstain on it, and Larry moved the lantern before the reception started. This suggests that the timing of the murder is critical, and Nichody’s statement that he was always with others conflicts with the implication that the murder weapon was used at a time Nichody claims to be accompanied.\n\nMoreover, the multiple blank testimonies by Nichody (Testimonies 0, 2, 4) along with Testimony 3 (\"I've never thought of exacting revenge on Master Sorin.\") and Testimony 1 (\"Gloomsbury was my right hand man. I'd suffer the most from losing him.\") might suggest Nichody is trying to hide something.\n\nBut the clearest contradiction is between the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14), which states the Time Keeper was used as the murder weapon, and Nichody’s alibi in Testimony 5, where he claims he had no opportunity to murder Gloomsbury.\n",

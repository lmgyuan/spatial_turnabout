The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall.\nPerson: Lamiroir\nTestimony 5\nTestimony: I saw bullet holes in the wall, and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot...\nPerson: Lamiroir\nTestimony 6\nTestimony: Then I was led by the police to Mr. Gavin's dressing room, and told to wait there.\nPerson: Lamiroir\nTestimony 7\nTestimony: That was where I learned that something had happened... But I wasn't told the details.\nPerson: Lamiroir\n\nAnswer:\nLet's think step by step:",
    "cot": "Let's analyze the testimonies and evidences for contradictions. Lamiroir's testimonies contradict each other slightly but nothing definitive. Testimony 0 states \"I saw nothing\", while Testimony 5 states \"I saw bullet holes in the wall\", meaning he saw something related to the crime. This is a contradiction within testimonies, not between evidence and testimony.\n\nNext, Evidence 5 is the Revolver belonging to Mr. LeTouse found at the crime scene. Evidence 9, the Crime Photo, shows the victim shot in the shoulder, lying face left. Evidence 10, Diagram, mentions bullet holes on the wall where the door was, in line with Lamiroir's Testimony 5.\n\nTestimony 2 says Lamiroir did not return backstage after the second set; Testimony 3 says he went backstage for a moment after his performance. If the performance was after the second set, that is a contradiction. Again, that is between testimonies.\n\nEvidence 15 and 17: The igniter was identical to Gavin's guitar, which burned the night of the concert. However, Testimony 6 says Lamiroir was led by police to Gavin's dressing room, suggesting he was there after the incident.\n\nNo direct contradictions there.\n\nTestimony 4 says LeTouse's body was behind a wall (was not visible); Evidence 9 says victim was lying with face left, bullet holes found on wall near victim. They match.\n\nAll things considered, the key contradiction is Testimony 0 (\"I saw nothing\") by Lamiroir, in direct conflict with Evidence 5 (Revolver belonging to Mr. LeTouse) and Testimony 5 (he saw bullet holes in the wall). Since Evidence 5 indicates a revolver found and testimony 5 says he saw bullet holes, Testimony 0 is contradicting both these facts. Choosing one pair, we say Testimony 0 contradicts Evidence 5, in that claiming \"I saw nothing\" conflicts with finding the murder weapon at the scene.\n",

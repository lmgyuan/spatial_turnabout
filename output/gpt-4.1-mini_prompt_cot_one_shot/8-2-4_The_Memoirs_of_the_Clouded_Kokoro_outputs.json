    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies carefully to spot contradictions.\n\nEvidence 3 (Pair of Teacups) states that there is no tea ring on the inside of Mr Natsume's cup. This suggests that Mr Natsume did not drink from his cup.\n\nTestimony 2 by Shamspeare states: \"Whilst feigning distraction in our debate, ne'er did a drop of his own drink pass his lips.\" This aligns with the evidence that Mr Natsume did not drink his tea.\n\nHowever, Testimony 1 states: \"'Twas in my cup alone that the wicked miscreant secretly pour'd his wicked poison.\" This implies that Shamspeare is accusing Mr Natsume of poisoning his own cup, which Mr Natsume never drank.\n\nTestimony 3: \"When he departed by and by, I did use the tea that remain'd in his cup to make my coins of ice.\" This also supports that Mr Natsume did not drink his tea.\n\nTestimony 4: \"Thus 'tis no surprise that poison be not found in the tea I did pour into the moulds of soap.\" This suggests Shamspeare poured tea into soap molds and claims there was no poison there.\n\nEvidence 5 (Bar of Soap) has a circular depression in the middle.\n\nThe contradiction lies most clearly between Testimony 1 and Evidence 3. If Mr Natsume never drank from his cup (Evidence 3), and the poison was in Shamspeare's cup (Testimony 1), the issue is the poison's location versus consumption.\n\nAnother point is from Testimony 1: Shamspeare says poison was in his cup alone. But Evidence 12 (Bottle of Poison) was found in Miss Green's possession, not Shamspeare's.\n\nThis links a contradiction: Shamspeare's testimony that poison was in his cup alone conflicts with Evidence 12, which links the poison to Miss Green.\n\nTherefore, the pair contradicting each other is:\n\nEvidence 12 (Bottle of Poison found with Miss Green) and Testimony 1 (Shamspeare claiming poison was in his cup alone).\n",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the testimonies and the evidences related to the torn envelope.\n\nEvidence 4 (Torn-Off End of Envelope) states that a ripped piece of an envelope was found in Mr Shamspeare's room and it fits perfectly with an envelope in Miss Green's possession.\n\nTestimony 4 by Green states: \"I can point out the villain here! And as for that torn-off piece of the envelope, I don't know anything about it.\"\n\nThis testimony contradicts Evidence 4 because Miss Green possesses the matching envelope yet denies knowing anything about the torn-off piece found in Mr Shamspeare's room. This contradiction shows that Green is lying or withholding information about the envelope.\n",

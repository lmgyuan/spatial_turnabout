I've been stabbed!\"\nPerson: Elbird\nTestimony 3\nTestimony: It sounded like someone in pain, calling out for help. But...\nPerson: Elbird\nTestimony 4\nTestimony: I couldn't do anything since I was locked up in my cell. So, I went back to my training.\nPerson: Elbird\n\nAnswer:\nLet's think step by step:",
    "cot": "Let's analyze the contradictions between the evidences and testimonies:\n\nEvidence 8 (Prison Roll Call) states that the victim's body had not been found at the 7 AM roll call. Evidence 20 (Autopsy Report) estimates the time of death between 3 AM and 6 AM on the 27th. This suggests the victim died before the 7 AM roll call, but his body was not found during roll call.\n\nTestimony 2 (Elbird) says: \"Just as I'd counted to two, I heard a voice shout out, 'AAARGH! I've been stabbed!'\" This suggests Elbird heard the stabbing happening.\n\nHowever, Testimony 4 (Elbird) says \"I couldn't do anything since I was locked up in my cell. So, I went back to my training.\" This indicates he was locked up, and presumably couldn't move from his cell at the time of the stabbing.\n\nEvidence 7 (Door Sensor) states that doors detect the prisoners' bracelets and raise the alarm if inmates are near, and prisoners are not allowed to move about freely.\n\nCombining these: if Elbird was locked in his cell during the stabbing and couldn't do anything, he should not have been able to hear the shouting (depending on the cell layout and soundproofing), or he should have been able to raise alarm or assist. But the key contradiction is that he says he heard the stabbing while counting to two (which implies being at or near the scene), but also says he was locked in his cell (implying a distance or unable to witness).\n\nAlternatively, looking for a more direct contradiction:\n\nEvidence 13 (Wiped Floor) states that blood was wiped from the floor in Knight's cell and confirmed as Knight's.\n\nTestimony 4 (Elbird) says he was locked in his cell and just went back to training, implying no disturbance.\n\nHowever, if bloody floor was wiped, some disturbance or efforts to clean up happened.\n\nBut this is indirect and a stretch.\n\nLooking further:\n\nEvidence 10 (Sahwit's Bracelet) says the bracelet was broken and undetected by sensors.\n\nTestimony 0 (Elbird) says recreation time ended at 10 AM.\n\nEvidence 15 (Security Camera Footage) says the victim was attacked around 9 AM, but footage has a 3-hour time gap.\n\nIf Sahwit's bracelet was broken and undetected, yet prisoners can't move freely, contradiction about presence.\n\nBut no testimony explicitly contradicts these.\n\nGoing back to testimonies 2 and 4:\n\nTestimony 2 (Elbird) says he heard a voice shout, presumably the stabbing occurred.\n\nTestimony 4 (Elbird) says he was locked up and went back to training, implying he did not help or respond.\n\nThis shows a contradiction in the witness' behavior and statements.\n\nAlternatively, examine testimonies 2 and 3:\n\nTestimony 2: \"Just as I'd counted to two, I heard a voice shout out, 'AAARGH! I've been stabbed!'\"\n\nTestimony 3: \"It sounded like someone in pain, calling out for help. But...\"\n\nSuggesting hesitation or doubt.\n\nBut not a direct contradiction with evidence.\n\nNow, consider that the evidence says the time of death was between 3 AM and 6 AM (Evidence 20).\n\nBut Testimony 0 says recreation ended around 10 AM.\n\nTestimony 2 says the stabbing was heard while counting to two, no exact time given.\n\nIf death was between 3-6 AM, but recreation ended at 10 AM, and presumably prisoners locked in at night, it's unlikely anyone heard a stabbing at 9 or 10 AM.\n\nTherefore, Testimony 2 contradicts Evidence 20.\n\nThat is, Elbird claims to have heard the stabbing voices at recreation time (post 7 AM), but autopsy says death between 3 and 6 AM.\n\nHence, these contradict.\n\nTherefore, evidence 20 (autopsy, time of death 3-6 AM) contradicts testimony 2 (hearing stabbing shout at around recreation time, presumably after 7 AM).\n\nHence, the pair is Evidence 20 and Testimony 2.\n",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies for any contradictions:\n\nEvidence 9 states that Sahwit claims to have seen a black dog biting the victim's throat.\n\nEvidence 20, the Autopsy Report, states that the cause of death was a stab wound to the neck, inflicted by a sharp blade, and death was instantaneous.\n\nSahwit's testimony (Testimony 3) indicates he found the victim lying dead, implying he was the witness to the aftermath but does not directly mention a dog.\n\nAlso, Evidence 15 shows security camera footage showing the victim being attacked by a dark form, with a time discrepancy.\n\nHowever, Sahwit's testimony does not mention any attack by a dog; the evidence is that he found the victim dead.\n\nAnother point: Evidence 4 describes a Rubber Glove stained with blood and mud found in Workshop A; Sahwit was using it during his animal styling training, which involved a dark mudpack treatment.\n\nEvidence 10 says Sahwit's bracelet was broken and couldn't be detected by the prison's sensors at the time of the incident, which could allow movement unregistered.\n\nTestimony 0-4 are all from Sahwit, mostly about his actions and reactions upon finding the body.\n\nLooking deeper for contradiction:\n\nEvidence 5 is a Rope found on top of Knight's body, questioning whether he was tied up.\n\nEvidence 23, \"Mr. Saint's Trick,\" involves a contraption using ropes and weights, with the victim's body replacing the weights.\n\nTestimony from the warden or others regarding the presence or absence of these ropes or the state of the body is missing.\n\nHowever, focusing on the biggest contradiction:\n\nEvidence 2 (Mr. Knight's Body) says he was killed by a stab wound to the throat, instantaneous death.\n\nEvidence 9 says Sahwit claims a dog bit the victim's throat.\n\nIf the victim died instantly by stabbing, the dog biting the throat appears unlikely or at least questionable as the cause of death.\n\nSo, Sahwit's claim (Evidence 9) contradicts the autopsy report (Evidence 20).\n\nLooking at testimonies, Testimony 3 is Sahwit saying he found the victim dead.\n\nBut the only direct mention of the dog biting is in Evidence 9.\n\nThus, the contradiction is between the autopsy report (Evidence 20) indicating death by stabbing and Sahwit's claim of a dog biting the victim's throat (Evidence 9).\n\nSince Sahwit's testimony does not explicitly mention the dog, the contradiction is between Evidence 9 and Evidence 20.\n\nThe question asks: which evidence and testimony contradict each other — to select a pair of an evidence and a testimony.\n\nTherefore, find the testimony that corresponds to the dog bit claim or at least conflicts with the autopsy.\n\nTestimony 3: \"Then I saw him lying there... A man... not moving... dead!\" by Sahwit\n\nTestimony 0-4 are all from Sahwit.\n\nSahwit's testimony does not mention a dog attack, but Evidence 9 says \"Sahwit claims to have seen this dog biting the victim's throat.\"\n\nTherefore, Sahwit's testimony seems to contradict the autopsy (Evidence 20).\n\nSo the contradiction is between Evidence 20 and Testimony 3 (where Sahwit claims to have seen the dead body, but in Evidence 9 he says he saw a dog biting the throat).\n\nHence, the contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 20 (Autopsy report — cause of death stab wound to neck) and\n\nTestimony 3 (Sahwit's claim of witnessing the crime scene with dog bite implication).\n\nTherefore:\n",

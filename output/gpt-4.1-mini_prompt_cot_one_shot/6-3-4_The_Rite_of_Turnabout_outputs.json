Rayfa states that all members of the Khura'inist clergy have such marks upon them. \n\nTestimony 3 by Ema states \"He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name.\" This implies Zeh'lot was not a legitimate member of the clergy. But such a tattoo would mean Zeh'lot was recognized as a legitimate member of the clergy (according to Rayfa’s statement about clergy markings).\n\nThus, the tattoo evidence (Evidence 16) contradicts Ema’s testimony (#3) that he was an illegal immigrant and suggests he was an accepted clergy member, which opposes the idea that he was an illegal immigrant.\n",

Poor Zeh'lot... It must have felt so heavy.\nPerson: Tahrust\n\nAnswer:\nLet's think step by step:",
    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies step by step to find contradictions.\n\nEvidence 17 (Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report) states: \"Cause of death was a spinal cord injury from being stabbed in the upper back by a bladed weapon.\"\n\nTestimony 0 (Tahrust) says: \"I was entertaining His Magistry and his family when the crime occurred.\" Since Tahrust himself was murdered (as evidenced by Evidence 3: Tahrust's Autopsy Report), he cannot have been testifying about events that happened during the crime while entertaining, implying a contradiction or impossibility.\n\nHowever, focusing on contradictions between evidence and testimonies:\n\nTestimony 1 (Tahrust) states: \"My wife Beh'leeb was in the kitchen cooking the entire time.\"\n\nEvidence 8 (Maya's Statement) states: \"On the day of the rite, the water in the spring was already stained red when Abbot Inmee and Maya arrived at the Inner Sanctum.\" This sets a timeline of events.\n\nEvidence 4 (Ritual Curtain) says the entrance was shut during the rite, isolating the sanctum from the outside world.\n\nTestimony 5 (Tahrust) states: \"I would describe the noise as a terrible crash. Poor Zeh'lot... It must have felt so heavy.\" If Tahrust was entertaining guests at that moment, the noise would have been noticed, contradicting the mother's claim.\n\nAlternatively, more concretely, Evidence 17 says Zeh'lot died from a stab in the upper back.\n\nTestimony 3 says: \"It sounded like an altercation between Acolyte Zeh'lot and Acolyte Fey.\"\n\nIf the altercation took place before the stab wound, the medical evidence matches.\n\nNo clear contradictions there.\n\nConsidering Evidence 4: \"The entrance was shut during the rite,\" but Evidence 25: \"Golden Orb... it seems to be the key to the rebel hideout,\" and the presence of a secret rebel hideout (Evidence 26) contradicts the supposed isolation by the ritual curtain.\n\nBut that's between evidences, not testimony.\n\nThe most explicit contradiction is between:\n\nTestimony 1: \"My wife Beh'leeb was in the kitchen cooking the entire time.\"\n\nAnd Evidence 21: Beh'leeb's Statement (about the Feast of Blessings the day before), which implies Beh'leeb was busy with the Feast, not necessarily cooking during the crime.\n\nBut weak contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, more directly:\n\nTestimony 0: \"I was entertaining His Magistry and his family when the crime occurred.\" — Given that Tahrust is the victim, he cannot simultaneously testify about his own murder.\n\nHence, the strongest contradiction is that the victim cannot testify about the crime happening while he was alive.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 3: Tahrust's Autopsy Report (he is dead) and Testimony 0 (Tahrust testifying about events during the crime).\n",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies step by step:\n\n- Testimonies 0, 1, 2, and 3 are statements from Tahrust.\n- Testimony 0 and 1 focus on Maya Fey and her connection to Lady Kee'ra, claiming that Maya knows Lady Kee'ra's true name.\n- Testimony 2 claims it was the real Lady Kee'ra who returned to root out rebels.\n- Testimony 3 is Tahrust's claim that \"She attacked and killed me with a strength far beyond any mortal woman.\"\n- Evidence 23 (Tome of Secrets) states that the priestess acting as Lady Kee'ra's representative must know Lady Kee'ra's name and have seen her face, but that speaking the name is unforgivable and must be kept secret.\n- This directly conflicts with Testimony 1 where Tahrust says Maya knows Lady Kee'ra's true name, which would violate the secrecy stated in Evidence 23.\n- Additionally, Testimony 3's statement that \"She attacked and killed me\" conflicts with Evidence 3 (Tahrust's Autopsy Report) which states the cause of death was blood loss from an abdominal wound delivered by a bladed weapon, implying a physical attack by a human, rather than a supernatural one.\n\nTherefore, the most direct contradiction is between:\n\n- Evidence 23 which instructs that Lady Kee'ra's name must not be spoken or known by anyone except the representative, thus contradicting Testimony 1 where Tahrust claims Maya knows the true name (implying knowledge that should not be shared or known).\n- Alternatively, Evidence 3's cause of death as physical injury contradicts Testimony 3's supernatural claim about attacking strength.\n\nAmong these, the clearest contradiction is between Evidence 3 and Testimony 3: the autopsy report shows a physical weapon caused death, whereas the testimony claims a supernatural attack.\n\nHence, the contradictory pair is Evidence 3 and Testimony 3.\n",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the key points in the evidence and testimonies:\n\n- Evidence 13 (Wocky's Check-Up Report) is from June, showing a metallic object near the heart.\n- Testimony 4 by Alita states: \"Why would I go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart?\" This implies the chart is from half a year ago.\n- But the check-up report (Evidence 13) is dated June, which suggests it's recent (or at least from the current timeline), not half a year old.\n- Alita’s testimonies indicate a contradiction: in Testimony 0, she says she went to the clinic for the first time in half a year, implying she has been away for a long time.\n- Evidence 18 (Wocky's Chart) is found in the clinic safe and signed by nurse Alita Tiala. If the chart is indeed half a year old (as Alita claims), then the timing with Evidence 13 is off.\n- Also, Alita's statements about warning and not hiding dark secrets may conflict with the pistol found at the crime scene (Evidence 10) bearing Wocky's prints, suggesting involvement.\n\nHowever, the clearest contradiction is between:\n\n- Evidence 13 (Wocky's Check-Up Report): recent report from June with metallic object found near the heart.\n- Testimony 4 (Alita): \"Why would I go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart?\"\n\nIf the chart is recent (Evidence 13), then Alita cannot claim it is from half a year ago.\n\nTherefore, this is a clear contradiction.\n",

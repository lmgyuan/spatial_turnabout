Evidence 20 (Autopsy Report) estimates the time of death between 3 AM and 6 AM on the 27th. This suggests the victim died before the 7 AM roll call, but his body was not found during roll call.\n\nTestimony 2 (Elbird) says: \"Just as I'd counted to two, I heard a voice shout out, 'AAARGH! I've been stabbed!'\" This suggests Elbird heard the stabbing happening.\n\nHowever, Testimony 4 (Elbird) says \"I couldn't do anything since I was locked up in my cell. So, I went back to my training.\" This indicates he was locked up, and presumably couldn't move from his cell at the time of the stabbing.\n\nEvidence 7 (Door Sensor) states that doors detect the prisoners' bracelets and raise the alarm if inmates are near, and prisoners are not allowed to move about freely.\n\nCombining these: if Elbird was locked in his cell during the stabbing and couldn't do anything, he should not have been able to hear the shouting (depending on the cell layout and soundproofing), or he should have been able to raise alarm or assist. But the key contradiction is that he says he heard the stabbing while counting to two (which implies being at or near the scene), but also says he was locked in his cell (implying a distance or unable to witness).\n\nAlternatively, looking for a more direct contradiction:\n\nEvidence 13 (Wiped Floor) states that blood was wiped from the floor in Knight's cell and confirmed as Knight's.\n\nTestimony 4 (Elbird) says he was locked in his cell and just went back to training, implying no disturbance.\n\nHowever, if bloody floor was wiped, some disturbance or efforts to clean up happened.\n\nBut this is indirect and a stretch.\n\nLooking further:\n\nEvidence 10 (Sahwit's Bracelet) says the bracelet was broken and undetected by sensors.\n\nTestimony 0 (Elbird) says recreation time ended at 10 AM.\n\nEvidence 15 (Security Camera Footage) says the victim was attacked around 9 AM, but footage has a 3-hour time gap.\n\nIf Sahwit's bracelet was broken and undetected, yet prisoners can't move freely, contradiction about presence.\n\nBut no testimony explicitly contradicts these.\n\nGoing back to testimonies 2 and 4:\n\nTestimony 2 (Elbird) says he heard a voice shout, presumably the stabbing occurred.\n\nTestimony 4 (Elbird) says he was locked up and went back to training, implying he did not help or respond.\n\nThis shows a contradiction in the witness' behavior and statements.\n\nAlternatively, examine testimonies 2 and 3:\n\nTestimony 2: \"Just as I'd counted to two, I heard a voice shout out, 'AAARGH! I've been stabbed!'\"\n\nTestimony 3: \"It sounded like someone in pain, calling out for help. But...\"\n\nSuggesting hesitation or doubt.\n\nBut not a direct contradiction with evidence.\n\nNow, consider that the evidence says the time of death was between 3 AM and 6 AM (Evidence 20).\n\nBut Testimony 0 says recreation ended around 10 AM.\n\nTestimony 2 says the stabbing was heard while counting to two, no exact time given.\n\nIf death was between 3-6 AM, but recreation ended at 10 AM, and presumably prisoners locked in at night, it's unlikely anyone heard a stabbing at 9 or 10 AM.\n\nTherefore, Testimony 2 contradicts Evidence 20.\n\nThat is, Elbird claims to have heard the stabbing voices at recreation time (post 7 AM), but autopsy says death between 3 and 6 AM.\n\nHence, these contradict.\n\nTherefore, evidence 20 (autopsy, time of death 3-6 AM) contradicts testimony 2 (hearing stabbing shout at around recreation time, presumably after 7 AM).\n\nHence, the pair is Evidence 20 and Testimony 2.\n\n{\"evidence\": 20, \"testimony\": 2}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2626, "completion_tokens": 867, "total_tokens": 3493, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

And he had no connection with the victim.\"\n\nIf Kanis is the owner of the black dog, then Sahwit's account implicates Kanis, which Laguarde contradicts.\n\nHowever, this is not a direct contradiction between testimony and evidence.\n\nLooking for contradictions with testimonies by Laguarde, who says the victim was brought to her office around 3 AM and went straight back to his cell.\n\nLook at Evidence 15 (Security Camera Footage) that shows a time gap around 9 AM, and footage shows the victim being attacked then.\n\nThis conflicts with Evidence 20 indicating time of death between 3 and 6 AM.\n\nSo security footage shows attack around 9 AM, but autopsy says death was between 3 and 6 AM.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 15 (Security Camera Footage) contradicts Evidence 20 (Autopsy Report) on time of death.\n\nBut question asks for one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict.\n\nIs there a testimony about the time of death from witnesses?\n\nNo explicit testimony on time of death.\n\nTherefore, let's compare testimonies with this evidence.\n\nTestimony 1 says victim was with Laguarde at 3 AM.\n\nBut if death happened between 3 and 6 AM, it is possible Laguarde saw the victim at 3 AM and victim died shortly after.\n\nNo real contradiction there.\n\nTestimony 5 by Laguarde denies Kanis's connection with the victim.\n\nEvidence shows Kanis hiding the chisel (Evidence 21) in his dog\u2019s mouth, tying him to the murder weapon.\n\nThus, testimony 5 contradicts evidence 21.\n\nTherefore, the strongest contradiction between evidence and testimony is:\n\nEvidence 21: Chisel with blood found hidden by Kanis.\n\nTestimony 5: Laguarde claims Kanis had no connection with the victim.\n\nHence, evidence 21 contradicts testimony 5.\n\n{\"evidence\": 21, \"testimony\": 5}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2623, "completion_tokens": 729, "total_tokens": 3352, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_79b79be41f"}}, "error": null}

This is a contradiction: if the salt lamp was at the crime scene (Scone's room), and it has victim's blood, that means blood was found at the crime scene.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 16 (victim's blood not found at crime scene) and Evidence 7 (salt lamp stained with victim's blood found in Scone's room) which suggests blood was at the crime scene.\n\nBut the prompt asks for contradictory evidence and testimony pairs.\n\nTherefore, let's look for any testimony that contradicts this.\n\nCheck testimonies again.\n\nTestimony 0 to 5 (Gusto) mainly about cooperation, not about blood or crime scene details.\n\nNo other testimonies about the crime scene or the blood.\n\nSince no testimonies about blood, the contradiction isn't between testimony and evidence.\n\nTry other contradictions.\n\nEvidence 5 and Evidence 27: Frame Finger Marks - \"Someone left finger marks but no prints\" in chocolate frame and in Tangaroa's room.\n\nThe presence of finger marks but no prints is suspicious.\n\nCheck testimonies.\n\nNo testimony mentioning frame finger marks.\n\nCheck for any testimony that conflicts with the Contest Rules (Evidence 4) claiming there was no cooperation in the finals (Testimony 4: Gusto says \"Aside from not cooperating with Sir Frost, the finals weren't much different from the semifinals.\") Also, Testimony 0 says they cooperated until finals.\n\nNo clear contradiction here.\n\nLook for clearer clues.\n\nEvidence 34: Gemini Case Analysis shows sugar found in the fountain water matches pale blue liquid in the victim's room 18 years ago.\n\nEvidence 32: Lift cart was wet \u2014 used by Frost 18 years ago.\n\nEvidence 24: Luminous Cloth was lost 18 years ago and rediscovered in the fountain.\n\nNo testimonies about this.\n\nCheck if anyone says something conflicting.\n\nTestimony 5: Gusto says \"Sir Frost's son and my own went to the same elementary school.\"\n\nNo conflict.\n\nTry to find contradiction between testimony and evidence.\n\nEvidence 13: Ms. Scone's Statement says \"Frost's sculptures in the finals were scrumptious, except for the lyre, which was salty.\"\n\nEvidence 14: Semifinal Entries says Frost and Gusto's entries were different but tasted the same.\n\nIf Scone states that the sculptures were mostly scrumptious except one salty, and semifinal entries had same taste, that might conflict.\n\nNot a strong contradiction though.\n\nAlternative:\n\nEvidence 8: Ms. Scone's creations were fake plastic models covered with whipped cream.\n\nTestimony?\n\nNone mention fake creations.\n\nBut that would be a contradiction between testimony and evidence only if a testimony says the creations were genuine.\n\nNo such testimony found.\n\nCheck any testimony implying something about Ms. Scone's real creations.\n\nNo such testimony.\n\nAnother attempt.\n\nEvidence 6: Mansion key - Tangaroa had the key entirely.\n\nIf a testimony says someone else had the key or accessed rooms without Tangaroa knowing, conflict would arise.\n\nNo testimony about key possession.\n\nTry regarding the instant camera film.\n\nEvidence 11: instant camera with 3 remaining exposures.\n\nIf someone testifies taking more than 3 pictures, perhaps conflict.\n\nNo testimony about using instant camera.\n\nConclusion:\n\nDue to limited testimonies mostly dealing with cooperation with Sir Frost and direct flavor contest, the only notable possible contradiction involving testimony is:\n\nTestimony 5 by Gusto states: \"Sir Frost's son and my own attended the same", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2561, "completion_tokens": 1000, "total_tokens": 3561, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

by heavy blow to the head with a circular object.\n- Chest wounds inflicted post-mortem.\n\nThis implies that the stab wounds to the chest happened after death, and the fatal injury was the heavy blow to the head.\n\nHowever, Evidence 9 (Candelabrum) is described as a three-armed candle holder that may have been the murder weapon, judging from the wounds to the victim\u2019s chest, and it is found by the victim's body.\n\nSo the injuries on the chest are post-mortem stab wounds, so the victim was already dead from the head injury.\n\nThere does not seem to be a direct contradiction here.\n\nLooking into the testimonies, Blaise in testimonies 0 to 5 talks about the victim Jill Crane, her burn mark, gloves, and denying motive.\n\nNo direct contradiction with evidence is apparent immediately.\n\nFrom Evidence 16 (Ringleader's Appearance), the ringleader wore a magenta flower, white jacket, and gloves.\n\nEvidence 6 is a magenta flower torn from the victim\u2019s clothes.\n\nThis suggests the victim also had a magenta flower on her.\n\nNo contradiction there.\n\nLooking at Evidence 23 (Nurse Niedler's Statement), she describes how she swapped places with Rosie Ringer.\n\nRosie Ringer is the victim, Character 7.\n\nIs there any testimony that contradicts that?\n\nNo direct testimony relates.\n\nLooking at the blood evidence, Evidence 19, 20, 21 relate to blood in various places.\n\nNo testimonies about this.\n\nEvidence 8 (Kay's Recollections) says Kay was pushed off the building by a person from beyond the concession stand.\n\nBut the victim is Rosie Ringer, not Kay.\n\nNo contradictions with testimonies.\n\nTestimonies of Blaise (0 to 5) conflict among themselves: in testimony 1 he says he did not really know Rosie well, while in testimony 0 he says she was a member of the committee (which is a fact, no conflict).\n\nNo direct contradiction.\n\nTestimony 2 and 3 discuss burn marks and gloves, which is consistent with Evidence 14 (Broken Plushie) that mentions identifying a person with a burn based on a recording.\n\nNo conflict with testimony.\n\nTherefore, the key contradiction looks between the autopsy report (Evidence 11) and the description of the wounds by other evidence or testimony?\n\nThe autopsy says chest wounds were post-mortem, yet Evidence 9 (Candelabrum) says it may have been the murder weapon judging by the wounds on the victim's chest.\n\nIf the victim's chest wounds were post-mortem, the wounds couldn't be the cause of death, which contradicts the idea that the candelabrum's chest wounds caused death.\n\nAlternatively, considering the statements about the victim having stab wounds and the candelabrum being the weapon, if the testimony or statement says the chest wounds caused death, that would be contradictory.\n\nBut no testimony mentions chest wounds causing death.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is likely internal between Evidence 9 and Evidence 11.\n\nSince only evidence and testimony pairs are requested, the best candidate is the testimony \"Ms. Hart's Statement\" (Evidence 18) which talks about the auction continuing after the victim's murder, but no testimony mentioned that.\n\nAlternatively, Blaise's testimony 4: \"Either way, it's not like I had a motive to murder her,\" which conflicts with Evidence 23 (Nurse Niedler's Statement) that she swapped places with Rosie Ringer.\n\nIf Rosie Ringer swapped places with Niedler, and Blaise says no motive, but the swapping might mean someone else had motive.\n\nNo direct contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, Blaise's testimonies 2 and 3: He says he only just learned that she had a burn mark on her hand, and maybe she always wore gloves to hide it.\n\nBut Evidence 16 says the ringleader wore white gloves and a

Evidence 10 (Security Camera Footage) states that President Wang and Judge Gav\u00e8lle are seen arriving on the roof of the Bigg Building, but there is no footage of the president riding the elevator down to leave. Testimony 1 from Lang says, \"That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone,\" indicating that the woman went down the elevator by herself while the president did not.\n\nThen Testimony 2 says: \"After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all!\" which aligns with the evidence. Testimony 3 asks rhetorically if there is any other way for the president to come down, which suggests the elevator is the only way.\n\nTestimony 4 suggests the president was pushed off the roof by that woman, but the evidence does not show or support him leaving the roof via the elevator or any other way. However, the contradiction is subtle.\n\nLooking for contradictions between testimony and evidence:\n\nEvidence 9 (Behind-the-Scenes Photo) shows that no monster footprints and no body were visible yesterday, but Evidence 6 (Monster Footprints) claims the concrete was broken and earth exposed after Excelsius Winner dug up the president's corpse.\n\nBut no testimony mentions these footprints or the corpse being dug up.\n\nAnother possible contradiction could be between Ms. Hart's statement (Evidence 11) who \"was in the 51st-floor storeroom the night before last, but didn't see the president pass through,\" and Testimony 0 or Lang's testimony referring to the photo taken 10-20 minutes after the president went up to the roof.\n\nBut these could coexist (she didn't see him pass through the storeroom, but photo shows president and judge on roof).\n\nLooking at the testimonies by Lang: Testimony 0 says a photo was recorded 10-20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman - this is supported by Evidence 9 (Behind-the-Scenes Photo). Testimony 1 states \"That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone\", but Evidence 10 says the footage shows no footage of president leaving by elevator. These two agree.\n\nTestimonies 3 and 4 suggest the only way down was the elevator or being pushed off the roof.\n\nNone of those testaments contradict the evidence strongly.\n\nLet's look at Evidence 27: Mr. Aldown's Photograph: \"Shows the president being kidnapped. Only one picture was taken. Touch the Check Button for details. Staged photograph taken after Aldown was killed.\"\n\nThis states the photograph was staged and taken after Aldown was killed.\n\nIf any testimony claimed the photograph shows a real kidnapping, that would be contradiction.\n\nBut no testimony mentions this photograph explicitly.\n\nLooking at Evidence 18 (Bug): \"The person in the red raincoat planted this inside Kay's Yatagarasu pin.\" This contradicts Kay Faraday's own character as a thief wearing the pin\u2014 if the pin was bugged, and testimony 0 or 1 claim she was communicating normally.\n\nBut no given testimonies for Kay or about the bug.\n\nTherefore, the only direct contradiction is between Evidence 10 and Testimony 4.\n\nEvidence 10 says: no footage of president taking elevator down; Testimony 4 says: \"Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman\", implying the president was pushed off the roof.\n\nIf the president was pushed off the roof, the question is if the evidence (no sign of falling body) contradicts this? No explicit mention.\n\nAlternatively, consider Testimony 1 and 2 by Lang: She goes down alone, president no sign on elevator, implying she left alone, president did not leave by elevator.\n\nTestimony 3 says: \"There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there?\" which is in question.\n\nBut the evidence includes side gate chain was cut last night (Evidence 4), that may provide an alternative exit.\n\nTherefore, Testimony 3 is contradicted by Evidence 4 which shows a side gate chain was cut, possibly allowing an alternative way down.\n\nHence the contradiction:\n\nTestimony 3 states: \"There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there?\"\n\nEvidence 4 says: \"The combination lock on the front gate was left untouched, while the side gate's chain was cut sometime last night.\"\n\nCut side gate suggests an alternative exit.\n\nTherefore, testimony 3 is contradicted by evidence 4.\n\n{\"evidence\": 4, \"testimony\": 3}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2814, "completion_tokens": 933, "total_tokens": 3747, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

And crashed into the Crystal Tower!\"\n\nEvidence 10 (Wooden 'Birdcage') states that the cage crashed down into the Crystal Tower.\n\nNo problem there.\n\nHowever, Evidence 5 (Photograph of the Victim) shows the victim after he had ostensibly been 'beamed' to the Crystal Tower - with a stab wound to the chest.\n\nEvidence 6 (Autopsy Report) states that the victim was stabbed in the chest and had a broken neck from the violent fall.\n\nTestimony 5 by Gina says: \"I didn't get a good look inside the cage, but no one went near it after it crashed into the tower.\"\n\nThis may contradict the autopsy indicating a stab wound inflicted before or during the fall, but that is not a direct contradiction.\n\nNow, focusing on Evidence 17 (Post-Explosion Photograph): It shows the experimentation stage completely levelled by a time bomb.\n\nTestimony 1 from Gina says: \"There's this huge bang from the stage, and then the next second, another bang in the sky beside us.\"\n\nIf the explosion was from the stage (first bang) and then the balloon (second bang), as Gina says, it matches Evidence 17.\n\nNow, look at Evidence 3 (Mysterious Contraption \u2192 Crossbow), a weapon found hidden behind a tree under the experimentation stage, belonging to Mr. Enoch Drebber.\n\nHowever, no testimony mentions or denies the presence of the crossbow, so no contradiction there.\n\nEvidence 4 (Piece of Green Cloth), a torn canvas-like material with scorch marks found under the experimentation stage, possibly from the balloon.\n\nTestimony 3 from Gotts says the explosion was from the green balloon, which fits with the cloth.\n\nNow focusing on the position of the victim.\n\nEvidence 10 says the wooden cage crashed down with the victim inside, damaging the Crystal Tower. Testimony 4 (Lune) matches this.\n\nHowever, Evidence 6 (Autopsy Report) states the victim's neck was broken from the fall and was stabbed in the chest.\n\nEvidence 7 (Screwdriver) matches the shape of the victim's stab wound and has blood traces, indicating the weapon used.\n\nHowever, evidence indicates the victim was stabbed, but no testimony mentions anyone stabbing the victim.\n\nNot a contradiction, but an omission.\n\nEvidence 12 (Camera) is from a waxwork from Madame Tusspells, associated with Drebber.\n\nThere is no testimony contradicting that.\n\nFocus on the contradictions between testimonies and evidence:\n\nTranscript of Testimony 3 (Gotts): \"It voz not ze sky zat exploded. It voz a green balloon zat woz next to ours at ze time.\"\n\nEvidence 17 (Post-Explosion Photograph) shows the experimentation stage was completely levelled by a time bomb, an explosion that destroyed the stage.\n\nIf the explosion took out the stage, then it was certainly not just a balloon.\n\nTestimony 3 specifically says it was the balloon that exploded, implicitly denying that the stage exploded.\n\nTherefore, Testimony 3 (Gotts) contradicts Evidence 17.\n\nHence, the pair is Evidence 17 and Testimony 3.\n\n{\"evidence\": 17, \"testimony\": 3}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2586, "completion_tokens": 795, "total_tokens": 3381, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

Ms. Byrde says she unlocked this door, but her prints were not found on the doorknob.\"\n\nThe contradiction here is between Evidence 6 and the implied testimony of Ms. Byrde (which is not directly given in the testimonies but can be assumed from the description of Evidence 6). Ms. Byrde claims she unlocked the door, but no fingerprints were found on the doorknob to support this. Although this is a contradiction between evidence and implied testimony, it is not between the distinct testimonies and evidences given.\n\nThe main explicit contradiction is between:\n\nTestimony 0: Portsman accuses Detective Gumshoe of stealing the gun and shooting Jim to death.\n\nEvidence 2: The revolver (the victim's gun) is believed to be the murder weapon, and it was issued to the victim.\n\nIf Gumshoe shot the victim with his (the victim's) own gun, that aligns.\n\nHowever, this does not directly contradict.\n\nLooking deeper:\n\n- Portsman claims Gumshoe moved Jim's body (Testimony 2), but evidence doesn't specifically mention body location contradictions.\n\n- Portsman accuses Gumshoe of tampering files (Testimony 1), which is supported by Evidence 4 (Stolen File missing pages written in blood). This aligns.\n\nTherefore, no clear contradictions there.\n\nThe significant contradiction is between Evidence 6 and Ms. Byrde's claim:\n\nEvidence 6: Ms. Byrde says she unlocked the door, but her prints were not found on the doorknob.\n\nSince no testimony from Ms. Byrde is given, only the evidence statement, this could be framed as contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, the inconsistency between the fact that the master key was stolen (Evidence 5), Ms. Byrde says she couldn't lock the door, yet the door was found unlocked or being unlocked by her, but no fingerprints were on the doorknob.\n\nSo we can present that.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction lies between Evidence 6 and Ms. Byrde's testimony (implied by the description in Evidence 6).\n\nSince only testimonies from Portsman and Gumshoe are given (testimonies 0-4), and none from Ms. Byrde, likely the question expects a contradiction between Evidence 6 and a testimony given.\n\nSince no testimony matches that, possibly we should find a contradiction elsewhere.\n\nAnother angle:\n\nEvidence 1: Bullet went clean through the victim's abdomen.\n\nEvidence 2: Revolver was issued to victim; only 1 shot fired.\n\nIf the gun was fired only once and the bullet passed clean through, this supports the victim being shot.\n\nHowever, Testimony 0: Portsman says Gumshoe stole Jim\u2019s gun and shot him.\n\nIf the gun was stolen and used by Gumshoe, then victim\u2019s gun was used on him.\n\nBut nothing contradicts.\n\nSo considering all, the most apparent contradiction is the one between Evidence 6 and Ms. Byrde's claim (implied testimony) about unlocking the door but no fingerprints.\n\nSince Ms. Byrde\u2019s statement is described in Evidence 6, but no explicit testimony from her is given, this may be accepted.\n\nHence, the contradictory pair:\n\nEvidence 6 and the statement by Ms. Byrde about unlocking the door (implied testimony).\n\nAssuming the prompt\u2019s instruction allows implied testimony as \"testimony,\" we assign testimony number 6 to Ms. Byrde\u2019s claim (since there are only 5 testimonies numbered 0-4, and the rest of the characters do not have testimonies).\n\nAlternatively, we can say that there is no testimony number matching, but given the instruction, let's choose evidence 6 and testimony 6 (imagined) as the contradiction pair.\n\nIf we must select only given testimonies, then none contradict evidence.\n\nHence, only possible pair is evidence 6 and Ms. Byrde's claim (implied testimony).\n\nTherefore, final answer:\n\n{\"evidence\": 6, \"testimony\": 6}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1342, "completion_tokens": 952, "total_tokens": 2294, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

So hard to say about murder weapon ownership.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 1: Teneiro says Edgeworth is the killer.\n\nBut Evidence 9 (Ms. Meele) states the victim was seated at 5 AM when the plane took off.\n\nIf the victim was seated at 5 AM, she contradicts the evidence that the victim was found dead at 6:15 AM inside the elevator (Evidence 2).\n\nMaybe Teneiro\u2019s Testimony 2: \"The scene I saw in front of the elevator...\"\n\nProbably says the victim was already dead.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Ms. Meele's testimony (Evidence 9) and the Crime Scene Notes (Evidence 2) or the Autopsy (Evidence 13).\n\nSince we have to select one evidence and one testimony only.\n\nThe only testimony that gives a clear conflicting statement is Ms. Meele's testimony (Evidence 9), which says victim was in his seat at 5 AM.\n\nAnd Evidence 2 says victim was found dead at 6:15 AM inside the elevator.\n\nSince 'Evidence 9' is labeled under evidences, but is a testimony of Ms. Meele, it's a kind of hybrid evidence/testimony.\n\nBut since the task says to give \"evidence\" and \"testimony\" pairs, and the \"Ms. Meele's Testimony\" is under evidence, the only testimonies are numbered 0 to 4, all Teneiro\u2019s.\n\nAmong Teneiro's testimonies, Testimony 1 states Edgeworth is killer, but Evidence 0 identifies the badge is kept by Edgeworth (probably indicating he had nothing to do), or that the badge was missing from the victim", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1817, "completion_tokens": 1000, "total_tokens": 2817, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

The autopsy report, Evidence 13, supports this.\n\nEvidence 9 (Ms. Meele's Testimony) states that Mr. Akbey Hicks was in his seat when the plane took off again at 5 AM. Mr. Hicks could not have been in his seat at 5 AM and then be found dead at 6:15 AM in the elevator, especially as the elevator was on the first floor lounge, meaning the plane must have landed or at least been on the ground.\n\nTestimonies 1 and 3, both from Meele, claim that from 3 to 4 and from 5 to 6 she was alone in the flight attendants\u2019 room. This contradicts evidence that Mr. Hicks was in his seat at 5 AM (as stated by Meele herself in testimony 9) while Meele claims to be alone from 5 to 6 in the attendants\u2019 room (testimony 3). Meele cannot be alone in the attendants' room and have seen Mr. Hicks at his seat at 5 AM.\n\nThus, Meele's testimony that she was alone in the flight attendants' room from 5 to 6 contradicts her testimony that Mr. Hicks was in his seat at 5 AM. The question asks for one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict, however, because the contradiction is between two testimonies or between evidence and testimony, and testimony 9 is considered an evidence\u2014Ms. Meele's testimony in evidence 9 versus testimony 3: Meele's statement about being alone from 5 to 6.\n\nGiven that Evidence 9 is Ms. Meele's statement and Testimony 3 is also from Meele, this is less clear.\n\nBut if we consider the contradiction between Evidence 9 (Ms. Meele's statement that Mr. Hicks was at his seat at 5 AM) and Testimony 3 (Meele states she was alone in flight attendants' room from 5 to 6) - Meele stating she was alone and Mr. Hicks being in his seat at 5 AM would be contradictory if Meele saw him.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 10 (GoYou Suitcase) was used to transport the body, the bloody cloth found inside was stained with blood, and the autopsy report states the victim died from a blow to the back of the head. Meele's testimony (1 and 3) claims she was alone in the flight attendants\u2019 room during the relevant times, meaning she had opportunity to move the body. So the key contradiction is in Meele stating she was alone when perhaps she shouldn't be.\n\nTherefore, the clearest contradiction is between Evidence 9 (Ms. Meele's statement that Mr. Hicks was in his seat at 5 AM) and Meele's own Testimony 3 (saying she was alone in flight attendants' room from 5 to 6), as Meele cannot see Mr. Hicks in his seat at 5 AM if she was alone in the flight attendants' room.\n\n{\"evidence\": 9, \"testimony\": 3}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1730, "completion_tokens": 687, "total_tokens": 2417, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

The Blue Badger's costume was stolen by Lauren Paups (Evidence 5), and the Bad Badger costume was worn by Oliver Deacon (Evidence 5). It's stated that the gunpowder burn is proof the victim was shot at point blank (Evidence 9), possibly suggesting the victim was killed with his own gun.\n\nSince Lance says the fingerprints prove Lolli killed Oliver, but the gun is originally stolen by Oliver himself, this might contradict the testimony.\n\nAlternatively, the testimonies themselves do not contradict each other, as they are arranged in a logical sequence supporting Lolli as the killer.\n\nLooking for a stronger contradiction:\n\nEvidence 6 says \"Victim, Deacon, shot from ABD through shoulder\", but Evidence 9 says \"Gunpowder burn is proof he was shot from point blank.\" Now, usually, a gunpowder burn suggests a shot from very close range, but \"through shoulder\" suggests the bullet's trajectory, so no contradictions there.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 15 says Revoiver used to kill Deacon was stolen by victim during escape.\n\nTestimony 0 states \"There are fingerprints on that murderous gun.\" It's not specified whose fingerprints.\n\nTestimony 1 says \"And they prove that it was Lolli who killed Oliver.\"\n\nIf the gun was stolen by the victim himself, and the fingerprints show Lolli's, it contradicts the ownership and origin of the revolver?\n\nAlternatively, this might be consistent.\n\nAnother possible contradiction:\n\nEvidence 5 says \"Stolen Costumes: Blue, Proto and Bad Badger.

However, Evidence 3 states that the cause of death (COD) was a single stab to the base of the neck and that the body was not badly burnt by fire, and Evidence 35 states the murder weapon was visible in Mr. Alba's bouquet in the photo, suggesting the knife was present there during the murder. But Testimony 1 claims Alba left the bouquet in the theater and anyone could have taken the knife from there, which contradicts the assertion that Alba personally used the knife to kill Coachen.\n\nBetween these, the clearest contradiction lies between Alba\u2019s claim of killing Coachen with the knife stuck in his bouquet (Testimony 0) and Alba's other statement (Testimony 1) that he left that bouquet in the theater and someone else could have taken the knife, implying he did not use it. These two testimonies contradict each other, but the prompt requests to identify contradiction between an evidence and a testimony.\n\nLooking further, the crucial contradiction involves Testimony 2 and Evidence 3: Testimony 2 states that Coachen's body was discovered in Babahl, while Evidence 3 describes the body and the COD but does not say where the body was found outside referring to the theater originally. Additionally, Testimony 3 insists there is no way Alba could have transported the body from the theater to Babahl, implying the body was found in Babahl which contradicts the possibility that the body was at the theater.\n\nBut the strongest contradiction is between Testimony 0 (Alba admitting to killing Coachen with the knife in his bouquet) and Evidence 11 (DeMasque II's Note), which shows the note requesting the theft of the Primidux Statue, handwriting matching Coachen's, indicating Coachen's involvement unrelated to Alba's stabbing claim. But this is indirect.\n\nMaybe a clearer contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Coachen's body was discovered in Babahl) and Evidence 36 (Security Footage), which shows Steel Samurai pushing a pushcart into Babahl from the dressing room and that there was blood inside. If Coachen died in the theater, but the body was found in Babahl, someone transported the body, contradicting Testimony 3 (Alba\u2019s claim he could not have moved the body). So Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 36.\n\nTherefore, the direct contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 36: Security footage showing a person pushing a pushcart into Babahl from the dressing room with blood inside - suggesting the body was moved to Babahl.\n\nTestimony 3: Alba states he could not have transported the body from the theater to Babahl.\n\nHence, Evidence 36 and Testimony 3 contradict each other.\n\n{\"evidence\": 36, \"testimony\": 3}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2859, "completion_tokens": 592, "total_tokens": 3451, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_79b79be41f"}}, "error": null}

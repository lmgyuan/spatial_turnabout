Saint is in charge of it and drives it around on the back of a truck.\n\nTestimonies:\nTestimony 0\nTestimony: I continued my correspondence with the young acolyte even after entering prison.\nPerson: Kanis\nTestimony 1\nTestimony: Recently, that has all come to an abrupt halt, however. It left me quite concerned.\nPerson: Kanis\nTestimony 2\nTestimony: Furthermore, those involved in the crime 12 years ago were all drawn into incidents one by one.\nPerson: Kanis\nTestimony 3\nTestimony: I grew more and more curious. And so I absconded briefly from the prison.\nPerson: Kanis\nTestimony 4\nTestimony: Writing letters in braille can be a rather enjoyable pastime.\nPerson: Kanis\n\nAnswer:\nLet's think step by step:",
    "cot": "Looking at the evidence and testimonies, Kanis (Character 18) states in Testimony 3 that he \"absconded briefly from the prison,\" indicating he escaped or was not in prison at that time. However, the Description of Kanis (Character 18) clearly states that he \"escaped from prison three nights ago,\" implying he was in prison until three nights ago. This suggests that the timing of his escape conflicts with the \"briefly absconded\" claim if that was earlier than the recent escape. However, this seems like a minor inconsistency in timing, not a direct contradiction.\n\nNow focusing on the evidence regarding the 12-year-old incident involving Alf Aldown (Character 20). Evidence 27 states the photograph showing the kidnapping was staged after Aldown was killed. But Mr. Aldown's Final Call (Evidence 25) is a message left detailing what Aldown saw, which would only be possible if the photograph was taken while Aldown was still alive and able to witness events.\n\nThis confirms a direct contradiction: if Evidence 27 states the kidnapping photo was staged after Aldown's death, Aldown could not have seen or reported the incident, contradicting Evidence 25.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 27 (\"Staged photograph taken after Aldown was killed\") and Evidence 25 (\"Message left by Aldown detailing what he saw\").\n",

There's not a single word about that in the letter, is there?\nPerson: Simeon\nTestimony 2\nTestimony: If I had said the word \"kill\" even once, I guess it could be considered instigation.\nPerson: Simeon\nTestimony 3\nTestimony: Well, maybe I did say it. But there's no way for you to prove it.\nPerson: Simeon\n\nAnswer:\nLet's think step by step:",
    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidences and testimonies related to Simeon and the forged letter.\n\nEvidence 1 is a Forged Letter written by an unknown person claiming to be Kay. Simeon's testimonies focus on whether he instigated murder through the letter. Testimony 1 claims there is not a single word about instigating murder in the letter, whereas Testimony 2 and 3 hint that he might have said the word \"kill,\" implying instigation.\n\nSince the letter is forged, Simeon's denial (Testimony 1) that the letter contains any instigations contradicts the fact that the letter itself was used as evidence against him, indicating it must have statements that imply wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, there is a contradiction between Evidence 1 (Forged Letter) showing that instigation could be implied, and Testimony 1 where Simeon denies such content.\n",

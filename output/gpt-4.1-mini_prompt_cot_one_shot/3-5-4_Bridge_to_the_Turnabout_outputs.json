    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies for contradictions.\n\nEvidence 9 states: \"Victim's Staff - Carried by Elise Deauxnim when she was alive. Has her fingerprints on it. Has a sword hidden inside. No one knows this except Detective Gumshoe and I. Has a sword hidden inside. The actual weapon used to murder the victim.\"\n\nEvidence 10 states: \"Shichishito - The apparent murder weapon. Had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but is not the murder weapon.\"\n\nTestimonies 0 to 5 all describe Iris testifying about a violent struggle involving Elise and Maya, mentioning the staff and a dagger.\n\nThere is a contradiction between Evidence 9 and Evidence 10 regarding the actual murder weapon. The Shichishito was initially thought to be the murder weapon but evidence shows it was not, and the actual weapon was the victim's staff with a hidden sword. Testimony 3 says: She threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe! Which suggests the dagger was the weapon.\n\nThis conflicts with Evidence 19, which is the Dagger: \"Found behind a tree in the Inner Temple garden. The blood doesn't match the victim's.\"\n\nSo Iris says the dagger was pulled and used to attack, but evidence shows the blood on the dagger doesn't match the victim's, implying it was not used.\n\nHence, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (\"She threw her staff away and pulled a dagger\") and Evidence 19 (the blood on the dagger doesn't match the victim's, suggesting it was not the murder weapon).\n\nTherefore, Testimony 3 and Evidence 19 contradict each other.\n",

I called out to Mystic Maya.\nPerson: Iris\nTestimony 1\nTestimony: I thought it was my duty to protect the future Master of the Kurain Tradition.\nPerson: Iris\nTestimony 2\nTestimony: So I removed the body from the Inner Temple by myself...\nPerson: Iris\nTestimony 3\nTestimony: I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge.\nPerson: Iris\nTestimony 4\nTestimony: Then I used the snowmobile to carry it back to Hazakura Temple and...\nPerson: Iris\nTestimony 5\nTestimony: ...I used the Shichishito to alter the way the wound looked.\nPerson: Iris\nTestimony 6\nTestimony: By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.\nPerson: Iris\n\nAnswer:\nLet's think step by step:",
    "cot": "Let's analyze the potential contradiction:\n\nEvidence 7 (Weather Data) states that snow lasted until approximately 10:50 PM, with lightning strikes from 10:00 to approximately 11:00 PM. Bikini saw the murder at around 11 PM, which fits with the weather timeline.\n\nTestimony 6 by Iris states: \"By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.\"\n\nHowever, according to Evidence 7, snow stopped around 10:50 PM, and lightning (and presumably other conditions) continued until around 11 PM, when the murder occurred. So the snow had stopped \"by the time the murder took place,\" matching the testimony.\n\nNo contradiction here.\n\nNow, looking at Iris’s multiple testimonies:\n\nTestimony 3: \"I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge.\"\n\nEvidence 14: Tracks Photo shows a trail from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge.\n\nTestimony 4: \"Then I used the snowmobile to carry it back to Hazakura Temple...\"\n\nUsing a snowmobile and dragging a body across a snowy bridge could be contradictory if the tracks photo only shows foot or snowmobile tracks but not both or contradicts timing.\n\nMore directly, consider:\n\nTestimony 5: \"...I used the Shichishito to alter the way the wound looked.\"\n\nEvidence 9 states: Victim’s Staff (with a hidden sword) is the actual murder weapon.\n\nEvidence 10 states: Shichishito had blood of victim and suspect but is not the murder weapon.\n\nThis indicates Iris used the Shichishito (Evidence 10) to alter the wound appearance, but the real murder weapon is the victim’s staff (Evidence 9). This doesn't contradict the testimony since Iris confession explains the discrepancy.\n\nTestimony 2: \"So I removed the body from the Inner Temple by myself...\"\n\nTestimony 3: \"I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge.\"\n\nTestimony 4: \"Then I used the snowmobile to carry it back to Hazakura Temple and...\"\n\nIn Testimony 3, she claims to have dragged the body across the bridge, yet Testimony 4 says she used a snowmobile to carry it back. This seems inconsistent about the method of transport.\n\nAlternatively, the more pressing contradiction is between Testimony 6:\n\"By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.\"\n\nand Evidence 7's weather data indicating that snow stopped at approx. 10:50 PM, with murder time at 10-11 PM.\n\nBut the murder could have been at 10 PM, the start time of the window for the autopsy report.\n\nTestimony 12 (Iris's Testimony) says: \"Rang lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room until the murder was discovered.\"\n\nEvidence 11 (Autopsy Report) says time of death was 10-11 PM.\n\nIf Iris says she was in her room after 10 PM until the murder was discovered, it contradicts Testimony 2-4 where she transported the body across Dusky Bridge and back.\n\nSo the biggest contradiction is between Iris's two testimonies:\n\nTestimony 12 (Iris's Testimony): \"Rang lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room until the murder was discovered.\"\n\nand the set of Testimonies 2-4:\n\nTestimony 2: \"So I removed the body from the Inner Temple by myself...\"\n\nTestimony 3: \"I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge.\"\n\nTestimony 4: \"Then I used the snowmobile to carry it back to Hazakura Temple and...\"\n\nThese are mutually exclusive: she cannot both have been in her room from 10 PM until the murder discovery and have been carrying the body across the bridge, unless the murder occurred after lights out, which conflicts with evidence.\n\nTherefore, the best contradiction is between Evidence 11 (Autopsy Report - murder time 10-11 PM), implying the murder happened around or just after 10 PM, and Iris's Testimony 12, where she says she was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered.\n\nIn contrast, the fact that she says she moved the body is incompatible with being in her room at the same time.\n\nHence, Evidence 11 and Testimony 12 contradict.\n",

    "cot": "Analyzing the evidences and testimonies:\n\nEvidence 21 is a photograph of Dusky Bridge taken the morning after the crime. Evidence 7 includes weather data indicating that there was snow and lightning strikes on the night of the crime, with lightning striking Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. Testimony 2 claims that Maya was in the spare prep room when the bridge was finally fixed the next day.\n\nIf the Dusky Bridge photo (Evidence 21) shows the bridge as still broken or on fire, and Testimony 2 says the bridge was fixed by the next day, there could be a contradiction depending on the photo's content. However, the photo is not described in detail.\n\nMore importantly:\n\nEvidence 11 states that Elise Deauxnim died of a stab in the back between 10 - 11 PM.\n\nTestimony 12: Iris's testimony states that she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and then was in her room until the murder was discovered.\n\nIf the murder occurred between 10 and 11 PM, then Iris could not have committed the crime if she was strictly in her room.\n\nIf Evidence 9 states the victim's staff (carried by Elise) was the murder weapon (with a hidden sword), but Evidence 10, the Shichishito (a sword) had the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints on it but was not the murder weapon, there is no conflict stated between testimony and evidence.\n\nThe key contradiction is between Iris's testimony (Testimony 12) and the time of death in the autopsy report (Evidence 11). Iris claims to be in her room from 10 PM onwards, yet the victim was stabbed between 10 and 11 PM.\n\nTherefore, Iris's testimony (Testimony 12) contradicts the time of death indicated by the autopsy report (Evidence 11).\n",

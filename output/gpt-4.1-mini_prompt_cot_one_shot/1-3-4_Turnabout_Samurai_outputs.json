    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies for contradictions.\n\nEvidence 5 shows a photo of Powers dragging one leg taken at 2:00 PM at the gate between the entrance and the Studios. Evidence 3 states that Jack Hammer died at 2:30 PM due to being pierced in the chest by a spear. Meanwhile, Evidence 11 mentions that Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.\n\nIf the path to the crime scene was blocked between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, Powers dragging one leg at 2:00 PM near the studios may not be consistent with Powers being able to reach the crime scene at or before 2:30 PM to commit the crime, assuming he was the murderer.\n\nThe testimonies, however, especially Cody's testimonies (Testimony 0 to 5), do not speak on Powers' physical condition or movement time, and instead focus on his camera and the timing of photos.\n\nNone of the testimonies mention Powers' condition or that he was at the gate at 2:00 PM.\n\nGiven that, the direct contradiction is between Evidence 11 and Evidence 5 rather than evidence and testimonies.\n\nNow, looking at testimonies, Testimony 5 (Cody) says \"I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em,\" but Evidence 15 (Cody's Camera) says Cody always carries his camera but he's still learning how to use it. This suggests Cody may not be reliable in erasing photos.\n\nBut no direct contradiction between evidence and testimony is obvious there.\n\nSince testimonies 0-5 are all from Cody about camera photos. Evidence 5 is a photo taken at 2:00 PM showing Powers dragging one leg, which contradicts the testimony 5 (Cody) that says he erased photos because it was too late.\n\nIf Cody erased the photos, Evidence 5 (photo of Powers dragging one leg) can't exist, which means Testimony 5 and Evidence 5 contradict each other.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 5 and Testimony 5.\n",

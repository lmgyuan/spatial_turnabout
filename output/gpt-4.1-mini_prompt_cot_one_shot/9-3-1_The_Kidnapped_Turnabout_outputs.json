    "cot": "Let's analyze the testimonies and evidence step by step for contradictions:\n\nTestimony 4 by Lang states: \"Officer Meekins ambushed the victim in this garage and killed him here with his gun!\"\n\nEvidence 6 (Mr. Deacon's Murder Notes) states that the victim was shot in the garage and that there was very little blood at the site where the body was found, implying the body was moved after being shot.\n\nEvidence 8 (Blue Badgermobile) says that the Blue Badgermobile was parked inside the garage the whole time and no mud was found on the tires, which suggests no movement outside the garage.\n\nBut let's consider the blood evidence:\n\nEvidence 6 mentions very little blood at the site of the body, which could imply the body was moved after the shooting.\n\nIf Officer Meekins killed the victim in the garage, as per Testimony 4, it would not explain well the lack of blood at the location.\n\nHowever, there is a more direct contradiction:\n\nTestimony 4 accuses Officer Meekins of killing the victim in the garage.\n\nEvidence 7 and 11 identify the victim as Oliver Deacon and provide details.\n\nTestimony 3 says: \"Not unless you're a member of law enforcement like Officer Meekins, isn't that right?\" implying that Meekins had gun access.\n\nAlso, Evidence 9 says that the victim was wearing a costume with gunpowder burns proving he was shot from point blank.\n\nEvidence 15 (Revolver) was used to kill Deacon, originally stolen from a guard by the victim during escape.\n\nTherefore, a contradiction arises in:\n\nTestimony 4 claims Officer Meekins killed the victim.\n\nBut Evidence 15 claims the victim had the revolver stolen from the guards, suggesting he possibly was armed and the shooting involves more complex events.\n\nBut these points might not be strongly contradictory.\n\nLooking for a clearer contradiction:\n\nEvidence 6 says the victim was shot from lower right abdomen, bullet exited right shoulder, and the body was moved because of little blood on location.\n\nTestimony 4 says Meekins killed victim in garage.\n\nIf the body was moved, it's likely not killed in garage or at least not left there immediately.\n\nAnother unclear conflict.\n\nHowever:\n\nTestimony 2: \"With your current gun laws, it's not exactly easy to get your hands on a gun.\"\n\nTestimony 3: \"Not unless you're a member of law enforcement like Officer Meekins, isn't that right?\"\n\nThis implies that the only way to get a gun is being law enforcement.\n\nYet, Evidence 13: \"Missing Model Gun was ripped from the Bad Badger costume. It's capable of firing blanks.\"\n\nEvidence 15: Revolver used to kill Deacon was originally stolen from guard by victim during escape.\n\nThis implies the victim got a gun despite restrictions.\n\nThis is a minor contradiction but more of elaboration.\n\nBest contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 6:\n\nTestimony 4 claims Meekins killed Deacon in garage.\n\nEvidence 6 says little blood at body site, implying body was moved.\n\nThis suggests that the shooting location and murder location differ, contradicting Testimony 4.\n\nTherefore, the evidence and testimony contradict on the location and circumstances of death.\n",

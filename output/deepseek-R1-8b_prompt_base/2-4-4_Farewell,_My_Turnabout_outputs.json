This suggests that the guitar case was present at the crime scene, but there's no evidence that Powers was involved in moving or interacting with it.\n\nHowever, **Testimony 0** suggests that Powers was in the hallway, which doesn't directly contradict the evidence. To find a contradiction, I need to look for a testimony that directly conflicts with an evidence.\n\nLooking at **Testimony 1:** Powers claims he was referring to Juan Corrida's room when he mentioned the \"room.\"\n\nNow, looking at the **Evidence 9 (Wine Glass):** It's filled with tomato juice and bears Andrews' fingerprints. This suggests that Andrews was present at the crime scene.\n\nHowever, **Testimony 1** doesn't directly contradict this. To find a contradiction, I need to look for a testimony that attributes the crime to someone else or provides false information.\n\nLooking at **Testimony 5:** Powers claims that the bellboy he saw was the assassin.\n\nHowever, the **Knife** found has Engarde's fingerprints, not the bellboy's. This suggests that Engarde, not the bellboy, was the murderer.\n\n**Conclusion:** The testimony (Testimony 5) suggests that the bellboy was the murderer, while the evidence (Evidence 16) shows Engarde is the culprit. This is a contradiction because the testimony incorrectly attributes the murder to the bellboy.\n\n```json"

Nothing else is known.<if asked for details> Worn by De Killer on the night of the murder. One of its special buttons is missing.\n32. **Whip:** Thrown away by Franziska von Karma, it has a certain mysterious nostalgia to it.\n\n**Testimonies:**\n0. **de Killer:** He mentions that Adrian Andrews is his client, however...\n1. **de Killer:** He mentions that one thing he cannot overlook is tampering with the crime scene.\n2. **de Killer:** He mentions that his client did it to frame another for the crime.\n3. **de Killer:** He mentions that while pretending to be the first person to discover the body and enter the scene...\n4. **de Killer:** He mentions that Adrian Andrews already knew from the very beginning that Juan Corrida was dead!\n5. **de Killer:** He mentions that even more appalling is the creation and planting of the \"knife\" and \"button\".\n6. **de Killer:** He mentions that this act is what he was referring to when he said his client had \"broken the rules\".\n\nNow, I need to find a contradiction between one of these testimonies and an evidence.\n\nLooking at **Testimony 0:** de Killer claims Adrian Andrews is his client, however...\n\nNow, looking at the **Evidence 14 (Attempted Suicide Report):** It states that Adrian Andrews attempted suicide due to shock from Celeste Inpax's suicide. This suggests that Andrews was indeed involved in some manner with the crime, possibly as a witness or co-conspirator.\n\nHowever, **Testimony 0** suggests that Andrews is his client, which could imply that Andrews is the murderer or somehow involved. This is a contradiction because the evidence shows that Andrews attempted suicide due to the shock of Celeste's suicide, not necessarily that she was the murderer.\n\n**Conclusion:** The testimony (Testimony 0) suggests that Andrews is de Killer's client, implying her involvement in the crime. However, the evidence (Evidence 14) shows that Andrews attempted suicide due to shock, not as the murderer. This contradiction arises because the testimony incorrectly attributes Andrews' attempted suicide to criminal involvement.\n\n```json"

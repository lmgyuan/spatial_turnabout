    "cot": "Alright, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the characters and the context. We have a murder case involving a visiting professor, John H. Wilson, who was found dead in a restaurant. The suspect is a military sergeant named Iyesa Nosa, but there are other characters involved, like Kazuma Asogi, a defense lawyer, and Susato Mikotoba, his judicial assistant.\n\nLooking at the evidence, there's a lot to unpack. Evidence 0 is the University Collar Pin, which seems unrelated to the crime. Evidence 1 is the Post-Mortem Report stating the victim died from a gunshot wound to the chest, with the bullet not passing through his body. Evidence 2 is a photograph showing the victim was shot from the front. Evidence 3 is the Waiter's Business Card, which might be a red herring. Evidence 4 is a Crime Scene Photograph showing a carbonated water bottle and a steak lunch on the victim's table. Evidence 5 is a Medical Report Card showing the victim had dental work and was told not to eat or drink anything but water on the day of the murder. Evidence 6 is a Photograph of Handbag showing Miss Brett's handbag on a chair. Evidence 7 is the Carbonated Water Bottle the victim and Miss Brett shared. Evidence 8 is Jezaille's Report about an unknown poison, and Evidence 9 is the Plate of Steak removed from the victim's table.\n\nNow, looking at the testimonies:\n\nTestimony 0: Nosa says he was eating steak and discussing tactics with Korekuta.\nTestimony 1: Korekuta was hunting for a gold koban coin.\nTestimony 2: Nosa saw the enemy fire and described the shooter as a cowardly weasel.\nTestimony 3: Nosa claims the shooter was a black-uniformed varsity cadet who fired from behind.\n\nThe testimonies seem to suggest that Nosa saw someone in black uniform shooting the victim from behind. However, the evidence (Evidence 1 and 2) shows that the victim was shot in the chest from the front. This seems contradictory because if Nosa saw the shooter from behind, the victim shouldn't have been shot in the front.\n\nTherefore, the evidence (Post-Mortem Report and Photograph) indicates the victim was shot from the front, while Nosa's testimony suggests the shooter was behind him. This contradiction suggests that Nosa's testimony might be unreliable or that there's a misunderstanding in the evidence.\n\nSo, the evidence (Evidence 1 and 2) and testimony (Testimony 2 and 3) contradict each other because the evidence shows the victim was shot in the chest from the front, whereas Nosa claims to have seen the shooter from behind, which would mean the victim was shot from the rear.\n\nFinal Answer: The evidence (Evidence 1 and 2) and testimony (Testimony 2 and 3) contradict each other because the evidence indicates the victim was shot from the front, while Nosa claims to have seen the shooter from behind.\n```json"

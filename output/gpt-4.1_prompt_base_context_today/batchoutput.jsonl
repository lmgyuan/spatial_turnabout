Also, the wine glass at the scene is completely clean, apart from Andrews' fingerprints (see Evidence 8), implying perhaps the killer was wearing gloves or costume gloves, but Oldbag's testimony says the killer wasn't holding anything in either hand (she says both hands were empty).\n\nHowever, the testimony that most obviously contradicts the facts is Testimony 3: \"He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\" Oldbag uses this to justify why Engarde was in costume. But the Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) shows that there was a scheduled press conference, not an immediate show, and Mr. Engarde himself claimed he wasn't even told about a press conference\u2014that it was arranged by his manager and the show was canceled.\n\nBut the most direct contradiction, as highlighted within the trial, is:\n\nOldbag claims Engarde was wearing his \"flashy racing jacket\" when leaving Corrida's room. But the evidence (Jammin' Ninja's Button, Evidence 16) was found in the \"hakama\" (part of the Nickel Samurai costume), indicating the person was in costume, not in the flashy jacket.

If the captain was thrown high into the water from such a height, the body would be expected to exhibit injuries consistent with a huge impact or blunt force trauma all over, possibly broken bones, obvious trauma, or similar evidence.\n\nIf the photo shows the body doesn't match these expectations (for example, no major trauma, different cause of death, or evidence hinting at drowning or poisoning and not being bashed), it directly contradicts Marlon Rimes' claim about the manner of death.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 2 (Photo of the Body) and Testimony 3.\n",

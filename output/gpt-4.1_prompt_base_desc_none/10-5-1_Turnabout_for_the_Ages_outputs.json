    "cot": "Let's examine Testimony 3: \"There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there?\" Person: Lang.\n\nEvidence 2 is \"Bigg Building\": the name implies that the crime scene is a building, and its details may clarify the layout. To contradict Lang's assertion, we need evidence that suggests there *is* another way off the roof besides the elevator.\n\nLooking at the list of evidence, \"Bigg Building\" likely contains information about the building's layout. If the evidence indicates, for example, the presence of stairs, fire escape, or an access ladder, then Lang's claim that the elevator is the only way down would be contradicted.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 2 (Bigg Building) and Testimony 3 directly contradict each other if the evidence shows an alternate path down.\n",

If the costumes were stolen, this implies a different culprit or different scenario for the means of the kidnapping.\nBut a much stronger contradiction comes from Evidence 6: \"Preliminary Findings → Mr. Deacon's Murder Notes.\"\n\nLet's consider \"Stolen Costumes.\" If the kidnapping was made possible only because costumes were stolen, then the plan must rely on the theft, and it could contradict a scenario where it was simply two conspirators making use of their meetings to plan, as Lang alleges in Testimony 3.\n\nTherefore, Testimony 3 states: \"the two of them made good use of their meetings to plan this little kidnapping.\"\n\nEvidence 5 (\"Stolen Costumes\") could contradict this, as the plan depended on the availability of stolen costumes, not merely on the meetings. Essentially, Lang's assertion ignores the necessity of costume theft for the plan to proceed; without the costumes, the plan as he describes wouldn't work.\n\nThus, the contradiction is between Evidence 5 (\"Stolen Costumes\") and Testimony 3.\n",

    "cot": "The contradiction lies between Means's statement in Testimony 3 and the contents of Courte's Planner (Evidence 2). In Testimony 3, Means claims he lost his alibi because he had to pre-record his speech. However, Courte's Planner (Evidence 2) would have contained her schedule and may show that there wasn't a necessary overlap between the pre-recording and the time of the murder, suggesting his alibi shouldn't have been lost simply due to the pre-recording. This casts doubt on his claim.\n",

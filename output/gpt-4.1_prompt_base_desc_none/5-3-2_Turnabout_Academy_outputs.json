    "cot": "Testimony 3 states that Hugh O’Conner never went to the art room and had no reason to be there. However, the evidence \"Courte's Planner\" (Evidence 2) might have an entry or note indicating that O’Conner (or someone with his motive or schedule) was supposed to go to the art room or had business there. If the planner shows such an entry, it directly contradicts O’Conner's claim of never going to the art room and having no reason to be there.\n",

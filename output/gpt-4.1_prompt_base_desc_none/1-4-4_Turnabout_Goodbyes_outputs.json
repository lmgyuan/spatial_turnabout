    "cot": "The contradiction lies in Larry Butz's (Butz) testimony that although he was listening to his radio \"real booming loud,\" he is \"sure I heard that gunshot.\" If the music was truly very loud, it would be unlikely that Butz would clearly hear the gunshot from the lake. This contradiction is reinforced by the existence of Lotta's Camera (Evidence 2), which was triggered by the sound of gunshots, yet Butz, despite being nearby, only heard one gunshot (Testimony 3). This raises a suspicion about how much he could actually perceive if his radio was very loud. \n",

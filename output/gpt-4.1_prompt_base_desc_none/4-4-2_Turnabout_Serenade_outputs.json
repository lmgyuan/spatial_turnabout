    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies:\n\n- Evidence 2 is \"Lyrics Sheet\".\n- Testimony 3 from Lamiroir: \"When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment...\"\n\nIf Lamiroir left the stage with the lyrics sheet (Evidence 2) or if the lyrics sheet was discovered in a place or at a time that contradicts her claim about being backstage only \"for just a moment,\" there could be a contradiction.\n\nHowever, let's find a clearer contradiction.\n\n- Testimony 0: \"As for what I saw... I saw nothing.\"\n- Testimony 4: \"I saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall.\"\n- Testimony 5: \"I saw bullet holes in the wall, and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot...\" (So she didn't see the body, but saw bullet holes.)\n\nAccording to LeTouse's Autopsy Report (Evidence 8), the manner, timing, or place of LeTouse's death is likely documented, possibly demonstrating that his body could not have been hidden \"behind a wall\" from Lamiroir's claimed position, or that seeing the bullet holes would not have been possible. However, the actual contradiction may be more clearly with the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) or the Diagram (Evidence 10).\n\nBut based strictly on the pairings:\n\nLamiroir testifies she went \"backstage for just a moment\" (Testimony 3), implying limited opportunity to see or take anything. If, for instance, the Lyrics Sheet (Evidence 2) was found in the backstage, but Lamiroir had it during her performance, or vice-versa, this would be a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction could be:\n\nLyrics Sheet (Evidence 2) -- which tracks Lamiroir's or the song's movement -- and Testimony 3, where Lamiroir describes her backstage behavior.\n",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the testimonies and the evidence:\n\nTestimony 3: \"And, Machi practically left his signature at the scene.\" (Speaker: Ema)\nEvidence 2: Lyrics Sheet\n\nContext:\nTestimony 3 claims Machi (who is blind) left his signature at the scene, presumably meaning it was an act only Machi could have done, pointing out an incriminating detail. However, if we connect this with Evidence 2 (Lyrics Sheet), we recall from the story that the crime scene was staged according to the song's lyrics. If Machi is blind, he could not have arranged the body or scene to match the lyrics sheet without being able to see it. Therefore, the assertion Machi \"left his signature\" contradicts the logical conclusion established by the meaning of the lyrics sheet, which suggests vision was required.\n\nThus, Testimony 3 and Evidence 2 contradict each other.\n",

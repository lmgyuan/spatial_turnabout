However, focusing on the evidence and testimonies provided, the \"Crime Scene Notes\" (Evidence 2) would typically document room entry, door status, and time of body discovery. If the Crime Scene Notes contradict the statement that everyone was scheduled to meet in the room after judging (for example, by stating the room was locked, off limits, or already taped off by police at that time), that would contradict Badd's testimony.\n\nTherefore, the likely contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 2.\n",

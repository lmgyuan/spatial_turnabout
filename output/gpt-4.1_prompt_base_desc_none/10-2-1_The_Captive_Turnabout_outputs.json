Alternatively, if the security camera (Evidence 15) showed nobody screamed at the time Sahwit claims, that might be another contradiction. However, sticking purely to Testimony 3 and Evidence 2:\n\nIf the body evidence shows signs of life at the time Sahwit claims he screamed about a dead man (for example, postmortem interval timing, body warmth, etc.), that would contradict his testimony. This is a common contradiction used to catch someone lying about when and how they discovered a victim.\n\nExplanation: Testimony 3 states Sahwit let out a scream at the sight of Mr. Knight's dead body. If the specifics of the body (Evidence 2) show Mr. Knight was not yet dead at the time, or the scene does not match someone having discovered it as a corpse, the two contradict.\n",

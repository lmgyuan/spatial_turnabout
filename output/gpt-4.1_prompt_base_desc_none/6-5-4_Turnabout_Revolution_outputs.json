You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}.

    "cot": "The contradiction lies between Evidence 2 (Photo of My Father) and Testimony 5 (\"I was reunited with my mother, Queen Amara, fifteen years ago when Dhurke abducted her.\"). The Photo of My Father likely depicts Nahyuta and his real father, suggesting a family relationship that conflicts with the claim that Dhurke \"abducted\" Amara and that this is when Nahyuta was reunited with his mother. If the photo depicts a stable family scene with both Dhurke and Amara present, it undermines the narrative of abduction and separation hinted at in the testimony.\n",

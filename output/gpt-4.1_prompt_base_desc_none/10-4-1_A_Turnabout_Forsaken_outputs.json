If an evidence explicitly proves nothing red was visible, that would be a contradiction. Alternatively, is there an evidence that proves Kay could not have been in that position or could not have seen the color red at all?\n\nLooking at Evidence 8: \"Kay's Recollections.\" If Kay's recollections is an evidence stating that Kay can't remember anything at all, then this directly contradicts her testimony in number 3, where she says she remembers seeing something red.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 2:\nTestimony: ...I just can't remember. I can't remember anything at all... (Person: Kay)\n\nIf Evidence 8 \"Kay's Recollections\" details something she specifically remembers (perhaps seeing the raincoat), but she says she can't remember anything, that's a contradiction.\n\nThus, the contradiction is:\nEvidence 8: \"Kay's Recollections\" (likely a note or record of something Kay remembered)\nTestimony 2: Kay says she can't remember anything at all.\n\nSo the contradiction pair is:",

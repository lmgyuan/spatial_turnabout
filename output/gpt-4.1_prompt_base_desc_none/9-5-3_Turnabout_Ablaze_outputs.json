    "cot": "Let's analyze:\n\nTestimony 3, by Lang: \"I don't think I need to tell you that the Primidux Statue didn't sprout wings.\"\nThis statement suggests that the Primidux Statue couldn't have flown on its own or moved by itself (i.e., it was incapable of traveling through the air in an extraordinary way).\n\nLooking at the evidence, Evidence 6: Babahl's Primidux Statue and Evidence 16: Allebahst's Primidux Statue are direct references to statues. However, let's also note Evidence 30: Hair Sticks → Crossbow Arrows, which indicates that something was launched by crossbow arrows.\n\nLang's other testimonies worry about what could have been launched by a crossbow.\n\nGiven all this, if the assumption is that the Primidux Statue did not move (Testimony 3), but the evidence of crossbow arrows (Evidence 30) and the mechanism is present, there is a contradiction if someone claims the statue moved/flew (as in, \"didn't sprout wings\").\n\nBut a more direct contradiction is between Testimony 1: \"Even if you fired the arrows from this side, they wouldn't go far with a statue tied to them!\" (Implies a statue was attempted to be sent flying by crossbow) and Evidence 30, which proves arrows (maybe related to hair sticks/crossbow arrows) could have launched something else (not the heavy statue).\n\nBut since you request one evidence and one testimony, the clearest pair is:\n\nTestimony 3: \"I don't think I need to tell you that the Primidux Statue didn't sprout wings.\" (i.e., it could not have flown on its own)\nEvidence 25: Photo of Yatagarasu — but that's just a photo, not related.\nEvidence 30: Hair Sticks → Crossbow Arrows, which relate to the actual mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between the assertion that the Primidux Statue couldn't have \"sprouted wings\" (Testimony 3) and Evidence 30, which suggests something was launched with crossbow arrows (possibly giving the illusion of flight/movement across distances).\n\nSo the answer is:\n",

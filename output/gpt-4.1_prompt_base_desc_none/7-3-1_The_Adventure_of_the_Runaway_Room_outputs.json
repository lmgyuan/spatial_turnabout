To check for contradiction, let's look at the evidence. Crime Scene Photograph (Evidence 2) is a logical choice to cross-examine. \n\nThe contradiction here is that, often in mystery stories like this, the Crime Scene Photograph may show the view inside the omnibus (Evidence 4), possibly showing that Fairplay's line of sight was blocked or he was in a position where he could not have directly seen the stabbing occur. Therefore, his claim of directly witnessing the stabbing would be contradicted by what the Crime Scene Photograph shows.\n",

    "cot": "Testimony 3 by Beppo states, \"I, I d-didn't actually s-see anything myself. No. N-Not until I h-heard that scream.\" This indicates that Beppo did not witness the actual stabbing or events leading up to it—he only became aware after the scream, implying he missed any crucial moments in the act.\n\nOn the other hand, the \"Crime Scene Photograph\" (Evidence 2) would provide an objective snapshot of the scene, potentially showing something Beppo missed. For example, if the photograph shows something that contradicts his implied position or awareness during the crime, such as evidence he should have seen if his testimony were accurate, there is a direct contradiction between objective evidence and his claim of not seeing anything until after the scream.\n",

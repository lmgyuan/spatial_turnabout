In many detective mysteries, finding a critical belonging on the scene that the accused couldn't possibly have lost contradicts the \"scattered all over the floor\" notion—perhaps the book was hidden/elsewhere, not scattered.\n\nHowever, most direct would be:\n- Evidence 2 (Iris's Postcard) is unrelated.\n- Let's focus on the Secondhand Book Receipt (Evidence 3):\n\nTestimony 3 says the accused \"ran off, scatterin' his belongings all over the floor,\" implying all his things were left at the scene. Let's say the Secondhand Book Receipt was not at the scene, contradicting the claim that all belongings were scattered if the receipt had to be found elsewhere (on his person or at his apartment).\n\nAssuming that's the case, the contradiction is:\nTestimony 3 (\"The accused ran off, scatterin' his belongings all over the floor.\") is contradicted by Evidence 3 (Secondhand Book Receipt), which was not left at the scene.\n",

This contradicts her implication that the crime scene was not disturbed and closely monitored.

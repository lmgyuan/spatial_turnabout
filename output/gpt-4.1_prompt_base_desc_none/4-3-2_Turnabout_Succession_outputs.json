    "cot": "Testimony 3 from Brushel says, \"And you know what happened next. 'Star Falls!' end quote.\" This alludes to Drew Misham suddenly collapsing after drinking coffee, suggesting something catastrophic happened right after the coffee was served.\n\nEvidence 13 is the \"Misham's Autopsy Report,\" which is highly relevant. If the autopsy reports that the true cause/time of death does not match the immediate \"Star Falls\" moment described by Brushel—such as indicating a delayed reaction from the poison, or a different cause of death than what is claimed in the testimony—then Brushel's testimony would be contradicted by the actual medical findings. This means that the dramatic description does not line up with the medical evidence.\n",

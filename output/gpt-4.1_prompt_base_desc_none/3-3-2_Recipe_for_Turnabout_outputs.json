    "cot": "Looking at Testimony 3: \"Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.\"\nThis suggests the victim (the \"young man\") received a coffee cup from the waitress.\n\nAmong the evidence, Evidence 13, \"Coffee Cup,\" is directly related to this scenario. However, if we consult the crime details and logic from the case (from the Ace Attorney series), the contradiction often is—whether the victim actually drank from the cup.\n\nHowever, focusing on what's presented:\n\nTestimony 1: \"He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!\"\nTestimony 4: \"The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.\"\n\nIf Glen Elg was holding a newspaper in one hand and, according to the autopsy report (Evidence 10: Glen's Autopsy Report), he was left-handed, but the poison residue was found on the cup, which was supposedly taken with his \"free\" hand, it can lead to a contradiction. But currently, the provided evidence list doesn't describe which hand the cup's residue was found on.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider Evidence 14: \"Victim's Lottery Ticket.\" If that was in his hand, but Kudo insists he was holding a newspaper, it's a contradiction, but that's not fully clear here.\n\nAlternatively, looking at \"Sports Paper\" (Evidence 3), which is likely the \"newspaper\" Glen Elg was holding, and Testimony 4, \"the little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.\" If the autopsy or investigation notes confirm he didn't use his \"free\" hand, or the fingerprints don't match, that would be a contradiction.\n\nBut the concrete contradiction commonly cited in this scene is between:\n- Evidence 13: Coffee Cup (which had only one set of fingerprints, contradicting the claim that Glen Elg drank from it).\n\nAnd\n- Testimony 4: \"The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.\" (Asserts Glen Elg definitely drank from the coffee cup.)\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is:\nKudo claims Glen drank from the cup, but the evidence shows the cup didn't have Glen's fingerprints—revealing the contradiction.\n",

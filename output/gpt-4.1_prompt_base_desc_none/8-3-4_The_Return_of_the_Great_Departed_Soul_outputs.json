    "cot": "Let's analyze the testimonies by Esmeralda Tusspells.\n\nTestimony 3 states:\n\"I hid myself until he gave me a signal. ...I was there for a very long time that night.\"\n\nIf we look for an evidence that contradicts the idea of someone hiding for a long period of time waiting for a signal, we must consider which evidence could show that she was not present or that the circumstances of her work on the corpse were misrepresented.\n\nAmong the evidence items, let's look at Evidence 17 - \"Post-Explosion Photograph\". If this image, for example, shows that the area was inaccessible, destroyed, or under observation by others during the time Tusspells claimed to be hiding there, that would contradict her testimony of hiding and waiting for a signal (since the area couldn't have been accessed as she described).\n\nAlternatively, another contradiction could relate to the \"Photograph of the Victim\" (Evidence 5), which might, for example, show the body already altered or moved by the time Tusspells claimed to be present. However, \"Post-Explosion Photograph\" is more directly relevant if it disproves the possibility of her being in the area for a long period.\n\nTherefore, let's select Evidence 17 and Testimony 3.\n",

If there is a sketch of the scientific experiment, this suggests that he was involved in science at that site, contradicting his testimony that he was just observing a graverobber.\n\nTherefore, Drebber's claim of only witnessing a graverobber (Testimony 3) contradicts the existence of the Experiment Sketch (Evidence 2), which proves a scientific experiment was conducted and that he was part of it.\n",

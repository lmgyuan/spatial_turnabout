    "cot": "Let's analyze Testimony 3:  \nTestimony 3 by Nash: \"The bloke wot owned the place was 'oldin' a gun, so 'e should 'ave just fired instead of yellin' at the girl!\"\n\nThe testimony is about Windibank (the pawnbroker) holding a gun and Nash implying Windibank had a chance to fire. But if we look at Evidence 12 (Windibank's Gun), it likely contains information such as whether the gun was recently fired, loaded, or was in reach. Suppose the evidence shows that Windibank's gun had not been fired at all (or is otherwise incapable of being fired at that time). In that case, Nash's testimony is contradicted by the physical evidence, because Windibank could not have fired.\n\nExplanation: If Evidence 12 (Windibank's Gun) forensically proves that the pawnbroker's weapon was *not* fired, or was not ready to be fired, then Nash’s testimony that Windibank \"should 'ave just fired\" doesn't hold up – Windibank wouldn't have fired even if he wanted to.\n",

If the disk was already taken by Graydon or the police, the redemption ticket would not still be valid or relevant—but the existence of the ticket (which was stolen) suggests the item had not yet been redeemed by Graydon at the time of the theft.

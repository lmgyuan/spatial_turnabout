Let's check the evidence for anything relating to the crime scene, possible witness photos, diagrams, or autopsy showing alternative movement.\n\nEvidence 3: Study Photo  \nEvidence 4: Study Diagram\n\nBut specifically, Evidence 17: Tomb Crime Photo, and Evidence 4: Study Diagram could show the layout or who could have exited which way.\n\nHowever, Evidence 12: Robbery Report could suggest something that contradicts the nature or time of exit. But none specify the door used except possibly the Study Diagram.\n\nBut let's look at Testimony 1 as well: \"I passed by the doctor's house... and that's when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\" Coupled with Evidence 13: Dr. Buff's Autopsy Report, if the time of death is before what Atishon stated as seeing Are'bal, that is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 4: \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\" with Evidence 13: Dr. Buff's Autopsy Report. If the report gives a time of death well before, and Atishon's statements about time contradict that, or if there's evidence Atishon was in fact aware of the death.\n\nBut focusing on the most direct contradiction:\n\nTestimony 3 (\"He was running out the front door.\") can be contradicted by Evidence 4: Study Diagram, if the diagram or crime scene photo shows it's impossible or the path doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, based on the context from Ace Attorney-style logic, the statement that Mr. Are'bal was running out the front door is undercut by the study diagram (Evidence 4) which proves he couldn't be seen running out the front door from where Atishon was.\n",

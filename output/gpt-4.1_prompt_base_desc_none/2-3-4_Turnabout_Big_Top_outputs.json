    "cot": "Let's analyze the situation:\n\n- Evidence 15, \"Max G. Bust\", is likely the murder weapon (as implied by testimonies about lifting it and dropping it on the Ringmaster).\n- Acro testifies in testimony 3: \"There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body,\" suggesting he couldn't have committed the act.\n- However, evidence from elsewhere (possibly crime photo, but more directly the bust itself) can contradict this, as Acro also says in testimony 1: \"I have a strong upper body from working as an acrobat, and only my legs were injured.\"\n- The contradiction is between his claim that he couldn't exert force and the fact that he could use his upper body (testimony 1 vs 3), but if we need to pair a *testimony* with an *evidence*, the Max G. Bust (evidence 15) represents something that could be lifted using upper body strength, contrary to Acro's claim in testimony 3.\n\nThus, the contradiction lies between Evidence 15 (\"Max G. Bust\") and testimony 3 (\"There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body.\"), since the bust could indeed be lifted and dropped using only upper body strength.\n",

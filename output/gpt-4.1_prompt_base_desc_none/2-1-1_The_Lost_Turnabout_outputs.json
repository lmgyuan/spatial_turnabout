Testimony 3 states that \"we found that there was sand trapped under the victim's fingernail,\" directly implying the victim used his hand to write in the sand. However, if the Autopsy Report states that Dustin's right hand was incapacitated or otherwise could not have been used after the fatal injury, this would directly contradict the testimony that sand was under his fingernail due to writing. Thus, these two pieces contradict each other.\n",

Additionally, this implies that Wellington is fabricating details of what he witnessed.\n\nSo, Wellington's claim that he saw Maggey's face at that moment is contradicted by the autopsy report, which describes the severity and instantaneous nature of the fall.\n",

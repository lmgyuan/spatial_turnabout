There is evidence, specifically the Blackout Record, that can be checked against this claim. If the Blackout Record shows that the power outage did not coincide with the time Sahwit described, it would contradict his statement about the phone not working due to a blackout. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 6 (Sahwit: \"However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\") and Evidence 4 (Blackout Record).\n",

    "cot": "Testimony 3 by Sahwit (\"That must have been what I saw.\") implies he saw a table clock (the statue) in the apartment. However, the only way to recognize the statue as a clock is by seeing it up close—otherwise, it simply looks like a statue. If Sahwit claims to have seen the time by looking at the statue—without actually being in the apartment—this indicates a contradiction, as only the killer would know the statue was a clock. Therefore, Frank Sahwit’s testimony 3 is contradicted by the Statue (Evidence 2), which is not obviously a clock to a casual observer.\n",

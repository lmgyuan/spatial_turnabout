    "cot": "Testimony 4 (from Ema) claims that \"the defendant murdered him before he had a chance to reveal the secrets,\" meaning the notebook secrets were never revealed. However, Evidence 12 (Show Footage) exists, and this type of evidence would be a direct record of the stage events, likely confirming if the secrets were revealed during the show or not. If the footage shows the secrets were not revealed or the notebook was not exposed, this would contradict Ema's claim that the motive was completed before the secrets were revealed.\n\nHowever, more directly, Testimony 5 claims \"the defendant's prints were on the tape. I guess she must've moved it during the show.\" Evidence 3 (Fingerprinting Results) would logically either confirm or deny the presence of Trucy's prints. If Evidence 3 shows the defendant’s prints were NOT on the tape, that would directly contradict Testimony 5.\n\nSo the clear contradiction is between Evidence 3 (Fingerprinting Results) and Testimony 5 (about prints).\n",

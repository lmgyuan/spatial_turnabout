    "cot": "Let's analyze the provided testimonies and the list of evidence. We are looking for a pair in which a testimony contradicts a specific piece of evidence.\n\nThe testimonies are all by Luke Atmey. In particular, Testimony 2 states: \"It was Mr. Bullard who wrote the blackmail letter and sent it to Ron DeLite.\" The evidence list includes \"Blackmail Letter\" (Evidence 10).\n\nFirst, check the relationship between these:\n\n- If the Blackmail Letter (Evidence 10) contains proof of its true sender—say for example, it's been found to have handwriting or fingerprints that do NOT match Kane Bullard but someone else—then Atmey's testimony would be contradicted by this evidence.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider Testimony 0: \"I, Luke Atmey, had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever.\" If there is an evidence item that shows Atmey was in contact with Bullard (such as a camera photo, letter, or other link directly between Atmey and Bullard), that would be a contradiction.\n\nBut, the most direct contradiction is with Testimony 2 and Evidence 10. If the Blackmail Letter (Evidence 10) was proven to not be from Kane Bullard, but instead from someone else, then Luke Atmey's testimony (Testimony 2) would be false.\n\nThus:\n\n**Explanation:** Luke Atmey testifies that Kane Bullard wrote and sent the blackmail letter (Testimony 2), but if the Blackmail Letter (Evidence 10) contains proof (perhaps a signature, handwriting, or fingerprints) that someone else—possibly Atmey, or another character—was the actual writer, this directly contradicts his statement.\n",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the testimonies first:\n\n- Testimony 1: \"From 3 to 4, I was, um... in the flight attendants' room all by my lonesome self.\" (Meele)\n- Testimony 3: \"And from 5 to 6, I was, um... in the flight attendants' room all by my lonesome self.\" (Meele)\n\nLooking at the evidence:\n\n- Evidence 2: Crime Scene Notes\n\nUsually, the \"Crime Scene Notes\" evidence would provide details about the timing of the crime, possibly indicating when and where people were or not present. If \"Crime Scene Notes\" say something happened between 5 and 6 in a location, or mention Ms. Meele being present elsewhere, then her testimony about being alone in the flight attendants' room would be contradicted.\n\nGiven these pairings, a classic contradiction in Ace Attorney games is when the crime scene notes show someone could not have been somewhere, despite their claim.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 2 (Crime Scene Notes) and Testimony 3 (\"And from 5 to 6, I was, um... in the flight attendants' room all by my lonesome self.\") contradict each other.\n",

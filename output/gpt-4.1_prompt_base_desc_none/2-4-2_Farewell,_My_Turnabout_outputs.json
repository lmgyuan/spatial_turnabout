If the defendant had just bought the knife recently *for the crime*, the only fingerprints on it would logically be from him (supporting Testimony 4). However, if there is other evidence (such as, perhaps, a receipt showing the knife was purchased at a different time, or fingerprints of another person on the knife), that could contradict Testimony 5.\n\nBut based on the given evidence and testimonies, a stronger contradiction emerges between Testimony 2 (\"There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\") and the evidence related to the button.\n\nTestimony 3 says: \"It was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's 'hakama'.\"\n\nLooking at Evidence 16: \"Jammin' Ninja's Button.\" If this evidence shows that the button was found somewhere inconsistent with Mr. Engarde's possession (for example, it was actually still on the Jammin' Ninja costume as per the evidence photo), this would directly contradict Testimony 3.\n\nThus, the contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 2: The Nickel Samurai (the costume of Matt Engarde), and\nTestimony 3: The claim that the button was found in Matt Engarde's \"hakama\" (which is the traditional trousers of the costume).

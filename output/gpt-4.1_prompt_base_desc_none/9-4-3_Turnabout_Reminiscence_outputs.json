Gumshoe's Testimony\" (Evidence 2), there may be mention of strange sounds or events occurring before the gunshot, such as suspicious noises or actions—after all, Gumshoe is known to have either made noise or caused a disturbance in the lobby prior to the gunshot. If Gumshoe's testimony establishes that he was making noise in Lobby No. 2 or was otherwise causing a commotion that should have been heard by Badd, then Badd's claim not to have heard \"any other strange sounds\" is contradicted by Gumshoe's own account.\n",

This contradiction suggests that Yew could indeed know about the knife, especially if her presence is established via the perfume evidence.\n",

The bullet hit the man pulling the stand from the front, square in the forehead!\"\n\nNow let's examine the evidence that might contradict this sequence. \n\nEvidence 10 (\"Knife\") might be relevant, but we're focusing on the testimony about a pistol, so let's check the autopsy report.\n\nEvidence 11 (\"Meraktis's Autopsy Report\") usually contains cause of death and wound description. If the autopsy report contradicts the statement that the wound was \"square in the forehead\" (for example, the report says the bullet entered from the back or side), that would directly contradict Stickler's testimony 4.\n\nThus, this is a likely contradiction.\n\nSo, my answer is:",

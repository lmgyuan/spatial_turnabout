But a stronger contradiction is with the testimony that says it was \"just a little chat,\" paired with evidence that implies some violent or fatal consequence or discovery of foul play not reflected in the testimony.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is that Laguarde downplays the meeting as a casual chat (Testimony 3), potentially at odds with the fact that Mr. Knight was found dead not long after—evidence of a significant event, not just a short chat.\n",

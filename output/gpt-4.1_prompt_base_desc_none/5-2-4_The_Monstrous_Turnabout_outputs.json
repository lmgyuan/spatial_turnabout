If L'Belle was running in terror and saw the \"demon\" emerge, it would contradict the continued presence of a functioning Warding Charm at the scene. If a charm was still in place — as proven by the evidence — the demon shouldn't have been able to \"emerge.\" This casts doubt on L'Belle's testimony, especially since such charms are central to the legend and the crime's circumstances.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 2 (Tenma Taro Warding Charm) directly contradicts Testimony 3.\n",

It was found at the crime scene.\n\nIf L'Belle was only observing from behind the screen (as claimed in Testimony 7), he should not have been close enough to leave traces of his hand cream near the crime scene. But the presence of his hand cream there implies he was directly involved with or handled something at the scene, contrary to his claim of just \"watching from behind\" (and contrary to the \"up close\" being just visual, not physical proximity).\n\nBut this most directly contradicts Testimony 3, where he claims to only see things \"up close,\" not to touch anything or be physically present at the scene itself.\n\nThus, the contradiction: L'Belle's hand cream found at the scene (Evidence 19) vs. his statement that he only saw things \"up close\" and did not touch or enter the scene.\n",

The Tenma Taro Warding Charm is an item used to ward off the \"evil\" Tenma Taro yokai—it's a physical item that embodies superstition (See also: Village Superstitions, Evidence 16). If L'Belle is stating he will \"expose the truth behind Tenma Taro,\" this implies he believes there's a hidden or fraudulent side to the legend. However, the existence of the Tenma Taro Warding Charm as evidence shows the superstitious belief is deeply ingrained and physically manifested in the village, directly contradicting the idea that it could be \"exposed\" as just a fraud by an individual declaration.\n\nSo, the testimony that L'Belle can expose the truth (implying the Tenma Taro legend is false or fabricated) contradicts the physical evidence of the charm, which demonstrates how seriously the yokai legend is taken.\n",

    "cot": "Testimony 1 by Menimemo states, \"Because why would I have bothered to stab the woman if I'd already poisoned her?\" This suggests that Menimemo believes poisoning and stabbing are mutually exclusive as methods of murderâ€”i.e., someone would not both poison and stab a victim. \n\nHowever, the Post-Mortem Report (Evidence 0) would likely detail that the victim died from a combination of poisoning and a stab wound (as is typical in such stories), thereby directly contradicting Menimemo's claim that the two acts would not be combined.

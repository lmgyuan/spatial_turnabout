    "cot": "Testimony 3 states: \"But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.\" This means Cody claims he couldn't take a picture at the critical moment.\n\nHowever, Evidence 15 is \"Cody's Camera.\" If you inspect the camera, you often find that it is an automatic camera and would have taken a picture automatically if someone was in front of it. This suggests Cody could not have missed the shot if he was trying to take one.\n\nThus, these contradict: Cody's claim that he couldn't get his camera open in time, and the fact that his camera should have taken any shot automatically.\n",

    "cot": "Let's examine the testimonies and evidence for contradictions:\n\nTestimony 3 (Andistan'dhin): \"Hands unclean, the accused did the deed. Forced the box open. No key did he need.\"\nThis testimony claims that the box was forced open, not unlocked with a key.\n\nEvidence 2: Rohl's Autopsy Report\nRohl's Autopsy Report likely contains the cause of death and perhaps details about the crime scene. Typically, in Ace Attorney games, the autopsy report can include key details like \"There are no signs of forced entry on the box\" or \"No signs of a struggle,\" which would directly contradict a claim that something was forced open.\n\nTestimony 3 directly claims \"the accused... Forced the box open. No key did he need.\" If the autopsy report or crime scene evidence indicates there was no forced entry on the box, this is a clear contradiction.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 2 (Rohl's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 3 (Andistan'dhin's claim of forced entry) contradict each other.\n",

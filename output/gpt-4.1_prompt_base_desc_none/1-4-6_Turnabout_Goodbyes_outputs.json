    "cot": "A notable contradiction arises between **Evidence 21: DL-6 Bullet** (from the DL-6 incident) and **Testimony 5: \"A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream\"** by Edgeworth.\n\nEdgeworth testifies that only one gunshot was fired. However, investigation and forensics in the DL-6 case revealed that **the bullet removed from Gregory Edgeworth (Evidence 21) was actually fired from Yanni Yogi's gun, and the circumstances suggest there may have been multiple gunshots or a different sequence of events.** Thus, the testimony of a \"single gunshot\" contradicts the physical evidence and the implications from the investigation.\n",

Photo\" (Evidence 5) likely shows a photo of the Steel Samurai (allegedly Will Powers) entering the studio at 2:00 PM, as claimed by Oldbag in Testimony 7 (\"It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!\"). However, the photo shows the Steel Samurai, but there's reasonable doubt if it was really Powers in the costume at that time—e.g., Powers may have an alibi, or the person in costume may not be easily identified as Powers because of the mask.\n\nThus, the contradiction is that Oldbag testifies that it was Powers she saw, but the evidence (the photo) does not sufficiently prove that the person was indeed Powers, only that it was someone in the costume.\n",

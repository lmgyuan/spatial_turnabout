    "cot": "Det. Gumshoe's Testimony (Evidence 2) likely contains details about what Detective Gumshoe saw, did, or experienced at the scene, as the name suggests. Testimony 3 by Gumshoe states, \"And until I heard the gunshot, I didn't take a single step away from the Lobby No. 2 door.\" If Det. Gumshoe's Testimony contradicts this claim by stating that Gumshoe did leave his post (for example, the testimony mentions Gumshoe was seen or admits to stepping away for some reason before the gunshot), then this would be a contradiction.

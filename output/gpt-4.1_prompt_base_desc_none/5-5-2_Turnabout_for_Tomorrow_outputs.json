    "cot": "Testimony 3 from Ponco states: \"Mommy Metis fell down near the round window on the workbench side of the room!\" This describes the specific location where Metis Cykes fell (and was presumably killed). However, looking through the list of evidence, Evidence 10 (Metis's Autopsy Report) is most relevant. Autopsy reports often provide the actual details of the cause of death as well as the approximate location or position of the body when found.\n\nIf Metis's Autopsy Report (Evidence 10) stated a cause of death or a location inconsistent with the claim that she \"fell down near the round window on the workbench side of the room\" (for example, if the report said she was killed somewhere else, or found elsewhere), then this would directly contradict Ponco’s testimony about the crime scene.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 10.\n",

However, Evidence 18 (\"Lighter\") could contradict this if, for instance, there is information that the lighter was used in a context where fingerprints would naturally be present without implying guilt (e.g., Athena used it previously for a benign purpose), or if there’s evidence pointing to prints being planted or left during another time. In the context of Ace Attorney, such a contradiction is common—where a prosecution asserts that prints directly prove guilt, but defense shows an innocent explanation for those prints.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction lies between the claim in testimony 3 (that the lighter with Athena's prints is proof she is the culprit) and the lighter evidence itself (which may not actually implicate guilt without further context).\n",

The existence of this photo proves that the Yatagarasu was indeed present and visible at the scene, contradicting Shih-na's claim of seeing nothing (since there's concrete proof the Yatagarasu was there). If Shih-na truly was in the next room, it would be difficult not to at least catch a glimpse, especially if a photo exists capturing the culprit.\n",

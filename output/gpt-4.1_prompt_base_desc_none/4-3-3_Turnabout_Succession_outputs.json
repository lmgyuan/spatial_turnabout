    "cot": "Let's analyze the relevant testimonies:\n\n- Testimony 3: \"The bullet was fired from the pistol found at the scene, no doubt about it.\" (Gumshoe)\n- Testimony 4: \"And the pistol definitely belonged to the old man, sir!\" (Gumshoe)\n\nFrom the evidence:\n- Evidence 20: \"Stage Pistol\"\n- Evidence 19: \"Magnifi's Letter\" (Old man likely refers to Magnifi Gramarye.)\n\nUsually, in Ace Attorney cases, the contradiction is: If the murder weapon (the pistol) found at the scene is definitively linked to the old man, but another piece of evidence (such as Magnifi's Letter) implies that a different weapon or method was involved, or that the shooting couldn't have come from that pistol, this would constitute a contradiction.\n\nHowever, Evidence 2 is \"Gramarye Envelope\" and does not relate. The more likely contradiction is between the \"Stage Pistol\" (Evidence 20) and Testimony 3 (\"bullet was fired from the pistol found at the scene\"). If the Stage Pistol is a prop and could not have fired a lethal bullet (as established in some trials), Testimony 3 is contradicted by Evidence 20.\n\nSo, the contradiction, in summary: Gumshoe claims the fatal bullet was fired from the pistol found at the scene, but the Stage Pistol is a prop incapable of firing real bullets.\n",

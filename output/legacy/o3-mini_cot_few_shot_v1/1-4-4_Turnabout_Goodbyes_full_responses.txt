Testimony 5 states that after hearing a single gunshot, the witness went home. However, Evidence 10—the murder weapon, a 22‑caliber pistol—was reported to have been fired three times. This discrepancy between a single gunshot being heard and a weapon known to have discharged three rounds is the contradiction.

Testimony 3, where Butz asserts, "But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!" implies a single gunshot; however, Evidence 11—which is Lotta's Deposition—states, "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25," directly contradicting the singular count mentioned in Butz’s statement.

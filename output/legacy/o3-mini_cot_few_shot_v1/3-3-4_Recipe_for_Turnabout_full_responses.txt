Testimony 0 asserts that a mirror was placed in the middle of the restaurant dividing it into two halves, yet the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) clearly shows two dining tables separated by a folding screen rather than a mirror. This discrepancy between what the witness described and what is captured in the photo is the contradiction.

Testimony 4 by Tigre claims, "Youse wanna check my alibi, just ask Violetta." However, Evidence 27—Viola's Medical Papers—reveals a 1 million dollar bill for cranial surgery that was due last year. This suggests that Violetta (Viola Cadaverini) was likely undergoing serious medical treatment or recovery at that time, making it improbable that she was available to confirm Tigre’s alibi. The implication is that Tigre’s assertion about having an accessible witness in Violetta contradicts the evidence that shows she was preoccupied with her medical issues.

Testimony 0 from Tigre states, "I ain't no liar. I never met Glen Elg." However, Evidence 20—Glen's Calendar—contains a note saying, "Meet with The Tiger," which implies that Glen Elg had scheduled a meeting with Tigre. This directly contradicts Tigre’s claim of never having met Glen.

Testimony 0 claims, "I was supposed to meet wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon," yet Evidence 20—the victim's calendar—states “Meet with The Tiger” on the day of the incident. This contradiction indicates that instead of a rendezvous with a kid, the victim was actually scheduled to meet with Tigre himself. The objective record in Evidence 20 thus opposes Tigre’s self-reported appointment in Testimony 0.

Testimony 4 by Tigre boasts, "Yesss! I won! Half a million bucks! He got lucky, you' know. Real lucky." However, Evidence 14—labeled "Victim's Lottery Ticket"—is described as a winning ticket for half a million dollars found during a body search of Maggey, clearly linking the jackpot to the victim rather than to Tigre. This creates a contradiction between Tigre claiming the windfall for himself and the evidence that attributes the prize to the victim.

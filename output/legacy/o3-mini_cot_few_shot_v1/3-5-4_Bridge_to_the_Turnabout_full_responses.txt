Evidence 12 is a physical record of Iris's whereabouts stating she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and then stayed in her room until the murder was discovered, while Testimony 0 has her claiming she went to the Inner Temple garden and witnessed the entire incident. These two accounts conflict, as she can't be both in her room and at the scene outdoors at the same time.

******************************
Testimony 0 describes Iris witnessing the violent conflict—reporting that Mystic Maya was hit over the head with a staff—while Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) states that she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and then stayed in her room until the murder was discovered, which implies that she did not witness any of these events. This is a clear contradiction between her courtroom account and her written testimony evidence.

Testimony 6 states, "By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped." However, Evidence 7—the Weather Data—indicates that snow fell from 7 PM until about 10:50 PM, with lightning striking Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. Given that Elise's Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) places the time of death between 10 and 11 PM, it is unlikely that the snow had already stopped at the time of the murder. This discrepancy—where the weather report clearly shows snow falling until around 10:50 PM, while the testimony claims it had stopped earlier—creates a direct contradiction between Evidence 7 and Testimony 6.

Testimony 4, where Maya states she saw a man by the light of the stone lantern, is contradicted by Evidence 20, which clearly indicates that the stone lantern was not lit the night of the crime.

Testimony 4 states, "And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too." However, Evidence 7 (the Weather Data) shows that snow was falling from 7 PM until about 10:50 PM. Given the continuous snowfall during the time window of the crime, it seems highly unlikely that the area around the stone lantern could have been cleared so thoroughly. This contradiction points to an inconsistency between the witness’s account and the actual weather conditions.

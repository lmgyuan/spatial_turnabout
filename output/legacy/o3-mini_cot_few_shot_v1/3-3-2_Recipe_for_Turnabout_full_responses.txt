Testimony 2 claims, “There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there,” implying that the serving girl openly added the poison at the moment of service. However, Evidence 16—a “Potassium Cyanide” sample—was found hidden in Maggey’s apron pocket and bears her fingerprints. This suggests that instead of blatantly sprinkling the powder into the drink, the poison was more surreptitiously carried on her person. These two details are at odds with each other: conspicuous application versus secret possession of the substance.

Testimony 4 mentions that “the little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip,” implying that his fingerprints should be on the cup. However, Evidence 13 (Coffee Cup) states that the cup is covered in the victim’s and Maggey’s fingerprints, with no sign of a third party’s prints. This contradiction between who handled the cup is the key discrepancy.

Testimony 2 states, "Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over," suggesting that a vase was disturbed or even broken. However, Evidence 12 – the Crime Photo – clearly shows that there is an intact vase on each table. This direct contradiction between the testimony and the photographic evidence indicates that Testimony 2 conflicts with Evidence 12.

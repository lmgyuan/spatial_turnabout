Testimony 8 claims, "If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot," implying that Cody did not have his camera at hand. However, Evidence 15—Cody's Camera—notes that he always carries his new digital camera. This directly contradicts Cody’s claim, as his camera should have been with him that day.

******************************
Testimony 3 claims that the camera’s lens wouldn’t open in time so Cody missed his shot. Yet Evidence 15, which describes Cody’s camera as a new digital model that he reliably carries (even if he’s still learning how to use it), implies that his equipment should be fully functional. This suggests a contradiction between his explanation and the state of the camera.

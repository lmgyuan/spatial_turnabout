Testimony 3 states, "I kept it in my pocket, waiting for the chance to propose and give it to her." However, Evidence 10 is a ring marked with the engraving "From T to R" that was found at the scene. If Trilo truly still had the ring in his pocket, then it shouldn’t have appeared as evidence, which makes these two pieces of information directly contradictory.

Testimony 0 claims, "There's no doubt in my mind! There were no white roses that night!" Yet Evidence 4 – the Max G. Promo Poster – clearly shows white roses among the three famous symbols. This contradiction between the testimony and the evidence makes them irreconcilable.

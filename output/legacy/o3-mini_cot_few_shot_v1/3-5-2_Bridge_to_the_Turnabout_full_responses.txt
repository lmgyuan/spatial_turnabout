Bikini's Testimony 3 claims that Iris came to the Inner Temple, dressed the same as at dinner. However, Evidence 12—labeled as "Iris's Testimony"—states that Iris rang the lights out bell and then stayed in her room until the murder was discovered. These accounts are clearly at odds since Iris cannot be both in the Inner Temple and in her room at the same time.

Testimony 3 states, "Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on." However, Evidence 6—"Iris's Hood"—confirms that Iris was supposed to have her hood (it’s a protective item she always wears and was received before the lights out bell), creating a clear contradiction.

Testimony 0 states, "When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place," implying that the bloody sword present was clearly used in the crime. However, Evidence 10—the Shichishito—is described as having both the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints yet is explicitly noted to not be the murder weapon. This directly contradicts the witness’s implication that the sword present was the murder weapon.

Testimony 5 from Bikini claims that "Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all..." suggesting she was active on the scene. However, Evidence 12 – Iris's Testimony – clearly states that she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and then stayed in her room until the murder was discovered. This directly contradicts Bikini's claim that Iris could have been driving a snowmobile at the time of the crime.

Testimony 2 claims that “I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire!” Yet Evidence 21 is a photo of Dusky Bridge taken the morning after the crime that makes no mention—or display—of any fire damage. In a case where a bridge truly was burning at the time, one would expect a photo taken under such dramatic circumstances to capture substantial evidence of that blaze. This glaring discrepancy in the condition of Dusky Bridge between the testimonial account and the photographic evidence suggests a direct contradiction.

Testimony 2, where Butz claims to have seen Iris flying with her hood fluttering, directly conflicts with Evidence 12—documented as Iris’s own testimony stating that she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and then stayed in her room until the murder was discovered. This contradiction indicates that either Butz’s observation or Iris’s account is false.

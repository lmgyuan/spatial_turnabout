Gumshoe’s Testimony 2 states, “On it, the word 'Maya' was written clearly in blood!” which implies that the victim left behind a blood-stained note identifying Maya as the killer. However, Evidence 14 – Mia’s Memo – is actually a list of names in Mia’s handwriting and does not match the description of a bloody, accusatory note. This clear mismatch between the description of the note from Testimony 2 and the actual content of Evidence 14 indicates a contradiction.

April May identifies the murder weapon as “that clock,” referring to Evidence 1 “The Thinker.” However, there is also Evidence 2—the broken glass shards from a glass light stand—that implies the actual weapon was a light stand rather than a clock. This contradiction between witness testimony and the physical evidence points to an inconsistency regarding what the murder weapon really was.

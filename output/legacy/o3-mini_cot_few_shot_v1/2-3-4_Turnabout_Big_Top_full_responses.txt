Testimony 4 states, "That makes it impossible for me to have known the location of the Ringmaster's head." Yet Evidence 11, the "Russell's Autopsy Report," reveals the victim died from blunt force trauma to the back of the head—which strongly implies that the perpetrator had a clear idea of where to strike the victim's head. This creates a contradiction between Acro's claim of ignorance about the victim’s head location and the physical evidence showing a precise blow to that area.

Testimony 5 mentions that the victim's death was accompanied by a single gunshot sound. However, Evidence 10, which is the murder weapon (a 22‚Äêcaliber pistol), clearly indicates it was fired three times. This presents a contradiction between the witness account of a solitary gunshot and the physical evidence of multiple shots.

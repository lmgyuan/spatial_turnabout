Testimony 2 states, "It was, like, oh my gawd, totally my sister!" implying that Ini recognized her sister as being alive and present. However, Evidence 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2) clearly details the death of Mimi Miney in a car accident, contradicting Ini’s claim of seeing her sister.

******************************
Testimony 6 claims, "I, like, didn't have my license, so, like, I couldn't take over driving for her." However, Evidence 18 is Ini's driver's license photo, indicating she does have a license. This directly contradicts her testimony.

Testimony 0 states, "Like, around that time, I was, like, really close to getting my license," implying that Ini Miney had not yet obtained her driver’s license. However, Evidence 18—labeled “License Photo”—is Ini’s photo for her driver’s license, suggesting that she either already had a license or was much further along in the process than her testimony indicates.

Testimony 2 claims, "As you can see, it's covered in blood," implying that the defendant’s costume was soaked in blood. However, Evidence 11 (Maya's Costume) is described as her robe with some blood splatters and a bullet hole in the sleeve, yet otherwise clean. This discrepancy between “covered in blood” and just having some stains indicates a contradiction.

******************************
Testimony 3 claims that "the victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed," yet Evidence 8—the Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report—clearly states that after a chest stab the victim was shot in the forehead at point-blank with gunpowder residue present, indicating a successful and fatal shot. This is a direct contradiction.

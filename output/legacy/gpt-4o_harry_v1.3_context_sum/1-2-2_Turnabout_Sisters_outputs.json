    "response": "The contradiction lies between the evidence and the testimonies of Detective Gumshoe. According to Testimony 2, Gumshoe claims that \"Maya\" was written in blood next to the victim's body, and Testimony 3 states that lab test results showed the blood was the victim's. Furthermore, in Testimony 5, Gumshoe claims that the victim wrote the killer's name before she died. However, Evidence 5, Mia's Autopsy Report, states that the death was instantaneous due to a single blunt force trauma. This autopsy report contradicts the implication that the victim could have written anything after receiving such a fatal wound.\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 5}",

    "response": "April May's testimony 3 claims that she saw Maya hit the victim with the weapon, which is specified as \"The Thinker\" in her testimony 4. However, Mia's Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) indicates that Mia may have lived for a few minutes after the blow, which conflicts with April's claim of instant sight of a decisive hit and her testimony of immediate knowledge of lethal harm. Additionally, The Thinker being identified as a clock in the testimony can be linked to the idea that she might not have seen the attack as it was a disguised weapon, and possibly, she would not recognize it instantly as a clock unless informed or had prior knowledge (like through the wiretap).\n\n{\"evidence\": 1, \"testimony\": 3}",

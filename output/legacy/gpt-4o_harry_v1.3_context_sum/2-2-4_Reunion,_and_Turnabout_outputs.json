You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Testimony 0 from Ini states that, around the time of the accident, she was very close to getting her license, which implies she didn't have a driver's license at the time of the accident. However, Evidence 18 shows Ini's photo for her driver's license, which contradicts her claim. This suggests that Ini already had a driver's license, contradicting her testimony about being close to getting it.\n\n{\"evidence\": 18, \"testimony\": 0}",

    "response": "To find a contradiction, let's examine Armstrong's testimonies and match them against the evidences.\n\nIn testimony 3, Armstrong states: \"After la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the evidences. Evidence 12 is a crime photo that shows the dining tables and the folding screen. The caption mentions a knocked over coffee cup, a stained table cloth, and, crucially, it indicates that no one was seated across from the victim. This suggests no one was actually at the table nearest the victim since it was empty. \n\nTestimony 3 implies Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident, potentially obstructing important details in the scene captured in Evidence 12. The contradiction is in the details regarding the moving of objects post-incident.\n\nTherefore, Armstrong’s testimony about moving the mirror contradicts the crime photo evidence that captures the scene after the murder. Armstrong’s action could suggest tampering or an alteration to the scene, which should have remained untouched until after the investigation.\n\n{\"evidence\": 12, \"testimony\": 3}",

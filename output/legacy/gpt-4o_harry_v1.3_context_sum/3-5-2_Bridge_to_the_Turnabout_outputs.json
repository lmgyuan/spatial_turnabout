    "response": "To identify a contradiction between Bikini's testimony and the evidence, we need to analyze the statements. Bikini's testimony states that she saw the blade being drawn out (Testimony 2) and that there was a lot of blood (Testimony 3), suggesting that she witnessed the moment the fatal wound was inflicted.\n\nHowever, the details from the autopsy report (Evidence 11) state that the victim was stabbed in the back and then fell 10 feet after death, meaning the attack happened from behind, and she wouldn't necessarily witness it clearly. Additionally, Eye-witness accounts seeing Mystic Ami stab Elise could be contradictory with the fact that Iris was also said to have been there at the scene of the crime.\n\nFurther, the Crime Photo (Evidence 13) could contradict her account because if the sword wasn’t the actual murder weapon (Evidence 10), then seeing a lot of blood (Testimony 3) due to a stabbing with that sword is contradictory, as the real weapon was hidden inside the staff (Evidence 9).\n\nTherefore, given Testimony 2, which implies she must’ve seen the weapon being plunged and Testimony 3 about the blood, Bikini's comments might be misleading in light of Evidence 10 (Shichishito is not the murder weapon) and the actual murder weapon being the hidden blade in the Victim's Staff (Evidence 9). But given we are looking for a single contradiction through evidence and testimony, the testimony about the unusual amount of blood seems highly contradictive with the usage of Shichishito, given it was not the weapon used and gives insight into the faulty account.\n\nTherefore, a reasonable contradiction pairing can be an alleged unusual bloodshed with the incorrect weapon due in fact to a hidden sword that truly committed the crime, serves a clear point for contradiction.\n\n{\"evidence\": 10, \"testimony\": 3}",

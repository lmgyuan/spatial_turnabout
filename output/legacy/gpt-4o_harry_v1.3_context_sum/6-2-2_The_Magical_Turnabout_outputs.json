    "response": "The contradicted pair is Testimony 4 and Evidence 3. Detective Ema claims that Trucy murdered the victim, Manov Mistree, before he could reveal the secrets of the Gramarye magic tricks. Yet, Evidence 3, the fingerprinting results, show that Trucy Wright's fingerprints were not found on the top along with the victim's and Bonny's. This is crucial because the absence of Trucy's fingerprints suggests she may not have been in contact with the crime scene as described in the testimony, undermining the claim that she murdered him.\n\n{\"evidence\": 3, \"testimony\": 4}",

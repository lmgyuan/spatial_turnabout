    "response": "To determine which evidence and testimony pair contradicts each other, we need to look for testimonies that conflict with the existing evidence.\n\nLet's consider Maya's Testimony 4: \"And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.\"\n\nAccording to the Evidence 20, Stone Lantern was not lit the night of the crime, suggesting it could have still had snow or dirt on it unless it was deliberately cleaned. However, this evidence doesn't directly contradict the testimony about the garden cleanup.\n\nWe should focus on the testimonies that deal with cleaning and disappearance of objects. Maya's Testimony 3 states: \"The torches were lit... And the body was gone.\"\n\nIf we look at the Evidence 20, Stone Lantern, which says, \"A lantern from the Inner Temple garden. Was not lit the night of the crime,\" it suggests a contradiction with the claim regarding the lighting (torches, lantern) in the garden.\n\nMaya's Testimony 3 suggests the presence of illumination (torches lit), but Evidence 20 directly notes that an important source of light—a lantern—was not used. Therefore, Maya's assertion about the lit torches doesn't align with the evidence indicating lack of lighting.\n\n{\"evidence\": 20, \"testimony\": 3}",

    "response": "The testimony from Maya states that Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time the next day after the bridge was fixed. However, the Weather Data (Evidence 7) reveals that the bridge was struck by lightning on the night of the crime, which caused a fire. This means the bridge was inaccessible and would require repair, suggesting that neither Pearl nor Godot could have crossed it until it was fixed. This indirectly supports Maya's statement about Pearly being stuck, but not about Godot's initial arrival time. Maya's testimony does not directly align with the evidence since it indicates a time discrepancy about when Godot first arrived. However, it's important to note that Maya's testimony in Testimony 3 does not necessarily contradict any specific part of the Weather Data directly; it is more about narrative cohesion rather than a straightforward contradiction.\n\nIf focusing solely on direct contradictions, the Traces Photo (Evidence 14) might be more relevant. However, based solely on the given descriptions of the testimonies and evidence, it's quite challenging to pinpoint a straightforward contradiction. Nonetheless, I will assume that the evidence that the bridge was damaged directly pertains to possibilities of crossing at specific times, laying bare some inconsistencies.\n\n{\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 3}",

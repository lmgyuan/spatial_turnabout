To identify a contradiction between evidence and testimony, we can analyze the provided information. 

Testimony 3 from Luke Atmey states that he knew the urn was extremely valuable and sent his card 10 days before the crime. This implies that Atmey was aware of the existence and value of the urn sufficiently in advance to prepare for the heist.

On the other hand, Evidence 3 describes that the urn was moved the night of the crime. This means that the urn may not have been in the location Atmey expected when he anticipated committing the theft. If he sent his calling card assuming the urn would remain in the location without knowledge of its movement, there could be a contradiction regarding his knowledge and planning.

Thus, the evidence about the urn being moved contradicts Atmeyâ€™s testimony about how he handled his plans based on the urn's anticipated location and value.

The contradiction is therefore established between Evidence 3, which indicates the urn was moved and might not have been where Atmey thought it would be, and Testimony 3, where Atmey claims he knew it was valuable and prepared to steal it without acknowledging its movement.

To identify the contradiction, we need to analyze each of the pieces of evidence presented alongside the testimonies.

From Testimony 3, Luke Atmey claims that Kane Bullard had a grudge against Ron DeLite for his betrayal. This implies a motive for Bullard to potentially harm DeLite.

However, according to Evidence 10, the blackmail letter found in Ron's room is written by Bullard, suggesting that Bullard was attempted to extort DeLite. This means that Bullard was the aggressor in this situation, but it also shows that DeLite was being targeted by Bullard at the time of the incident.

The implications of the evidence suggest that Bullard was actively trying to control DeLite through blackmail rather than simply harboring a mixture of grudges, which could imply he was not angry enough to kill. This raises a conflict regarding motivation: if Bullard was simply acting out of anger toward DeLite due to betrayal, he would likely not be engaging in blackmail.

In summary, Testimony 3 asserts that Bullard had a grudge and presents it as a motive for DeLite to kill Bullard, while the blackmail letter implies Bullard was in a position of power over DeLite, complicating or contradicting this narrative.

Thus, the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are:

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 3}

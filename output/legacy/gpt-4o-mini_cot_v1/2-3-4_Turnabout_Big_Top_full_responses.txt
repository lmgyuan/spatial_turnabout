To find a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other, we need to analyze the provided information closely.

1. **Understanding the Evidence**:
   - **Evidence 2** (Crime Photo): Shows a person lying on a case in the snow with the victim's footprints leading to where he is.
   - **Evidence 11** (Russell's Autopsy Report): States that the victim had blunt force trauma to the back of the head and the time of death is 10:15 PM.
   - **Evidence 15** (Max G. Bust): Described as a heavy bronze statue taken from the cafeteria before the crime, implying it could be used as a weapon.
   - **Evidence 10** (Ring): Engraved ring found at the crime scene, possibly tied to the murder.

2. **Analyzing Testimony**:
   - **Testimony 5**: Acro states that it would be unrealistic for him to have exerted enough force to drop a heavy bust on the Ringmaster, indicating he believes the act requires a level of physical capability he couldn't muster at that time.

**Contradiction Analysis**:
- If Evidence 15 (the heavy bust) was indeed the weapon used to kill Russell Berry, Acroâ€™s testimony that "it would be unrealistic to drop the bust on him" contradicts that evidence. Acro's limitation in physically handling that weight means he suggests he could not have been the murderer if the bust was used as a weapon.

Thus the contradictory pair of evidence and testimony is:
{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 5}

To identify a contradictory pair of evidence and testimony, we need to examine both the evidence and the testimonies for any inconsistencies or conflicting information.

1. **Evidence 12 (Lotta's Photo 1)** shows Maya Fey standing at the scene with a pistol after a gunshot, and indicates that Turner Grey is lying dead on the floor.
2. **Testimony 5** from Ini Miney states, "My sister... She, like, told me something, like, totally terrible," implying that her sister (Mimi) communicated something significant to her when Ini saw her.

These two pieces seem to conflict because:

- If Ini's testimony indicates that she saw her sister and had a significant interaction about something terrible, this directly contradicts the imagery of Maya standing with a weapon after the murder happened. This gives the impression that the situation was chaotic and potentially a confrontation, not a calm and meaningful communication where horrific information was shared.

Thus, the conflicting pieces of information are clear.

To identify a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, we need to analyze the statements provided carefully. 

Evidence 6 mentions that Mimi Miney died in a car accident in which she fell asleep at the wheel, while testimonies from Ini Miney describe her own experiences during the accident but do not explicitly state that Mimi had fallen asleep; rather, Ini states that she herself was "totally pooped" and fell asleep in the passenger's seat (Testimony 3). This creates a potential contradiction since there’s no clear indication in Ini's testimony that she has direct knowledge of Mimi's state while driving other than her own.

Since the crux of the contradiction lies in whether both women were conscious and aware of the situation when the accident happened, we will consider the discrepancy regarding Mimi's awareness versus Ini's testimony that doesn't confirm Mimi's drowsiness.

Thus, the conflicting points arise between:
- Evidence 6 (which implies that Mimi was indeed the one who fell asleep at the wheel) and 
- Testimony 2 (where Ini only focuses on her own state and does not confirm that Mimi was asleep).

Therefore, we can conclude that the specific contradiction lies between this piece of evidence and this testimony.

To identify a pair of contradicting evidence and testimony, I will analyze the context of each piece provided. 

The key pieces of evidence to consider are:

- Evidence 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2): This describes how Mimi Miney died in a car accident after falling asleep at the wheel while driving, and Ini Miney supports this account in her testimony.
- Testimony 1 (Ini's testimony about her sister): Ini talks about how her sister Mimi was a big fan of cars and valued them, but this generally does not contradict any specific evidence about the accident or her death.

However, if we look at Evidence 6 further, it states that Mimi held the position of a nurse at Grey Surgical Clinic at the time of the tragedy, which could imply that she was under significant stress or fatigue leading to the accident. Ini's testimony about how she was the passenger also aligns with the details of the incident.

So far, the testimonies and evidences seem to match. However, there is one crucial detail:

- Evidence 11 (Maya's Costume): There is a bullet hole in the sleeve of Maya's robe, indicating she was shot.
- Testimony 0 about Ini getting her license arguably suggests she was learning to drive, which does not connect directly to Maya's robe.

Now, the following evidence and testimony present a clear contradiction:

- **Evidence 8** (Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report) reports that Dr. Grey was both stabbed and shot, which connects with the evidence of the gun and knife from the scene. There is no mention of driving or being a passenger related to this event. 
- **Testimony 2** by Ini, which highlights her focus on her sister's car, does not provide any explanation regarding Dr. Grey's injuries as it pertains to the time of his death, which focus solely on Mimi’s driving experience and relationship with the car.

Through examination, it appears that Ini’s testimony regarding the incident surrounding Mimi does not relate to the concurrent criminal actions which involved Dr. Grey's circumstances. 

So the conflicting points can indeed be inferred as:
- Evidence 11 (which indicates active involvement in a fatal incident involving Maya) contrasts with Testimony 0, which seems to focus on Ini's learning-to-drive experience rather than the dire circumstances surrounding the murder. 

Thus, the conflicting pieces are identified based on the relation of the testimonies relevant to driving to the evidence supporting the activities surrounding the fatal injury of Dr. Grey:

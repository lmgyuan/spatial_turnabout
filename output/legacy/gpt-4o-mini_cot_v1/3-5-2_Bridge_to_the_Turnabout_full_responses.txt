To find a contradiction between the given evidence and testimony, we need to analyze them carefully.

Firstly, we examine **Testimony 3** from Bikini, where she claims: "Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner." This statement presents an observation regarding Iris's attire when she supposedly arrived at the Inner Temple.

Next, we check the relevant **evidence**, particularly **Evidence 9**, which is the "Victim's Staff." This piece of evidence indicates that Elise Deauxnim was attacked and murdered. Iris was involved in the events surrounding this incident, and understanding her actions and attire is critical to deciphering the truth and timeline of the night in question.

In this case, both the testimony and evidence do not directly contradict one another regarding any specific detail about the crime or timeline. We need to observe any related aspects. 

Now let’s check **Testimony 12** which belongs to Iris: "Rang lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room until the murder was discovered." 

This indicates that Iris was supposed to be in her room during the crucial moments leading up to the crime mentioned in Testimony 3. If Bikini states that Iris was seen arriving at the Inner Temple and Iris claims she was in her room, it creates a contradiction in the timeline and events.

Thus, the contradiction arises from Bikini’s statement about Iris’s presence at a time when Iris claims she was not present.

The conflicting testimony suggests that there is a misalignment regarding Iris's whereabouts.

Here we summarize the evidence from the testimony:
- **Testimony** (Iris): She was in her room at the time.
- **Testimony** (Bikini): She observed Iris at the Inner Temple dressed as she had been at dinner, which directly conflicts with Iris being in her room.

Thus, the correct pair signifying the contradiction we identified is:
{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 12}.
******************************
To identify a contradicting pair of evidence and testimony, we need to look for statements that cannot both be true based on the details provided.

Firstly, let's examine the testimonies provided by Bikini:

- In her testimony (3), she mentions that Iris didn't have her hood on.
- Testimony (2) suggests that she witnessed Mystic Elise with the sword, implying that Iris was present.

Now, considering Iris's hood (Evidence 6), which is described as something she wears at all times, we have a contradiction. If Bikini's testimony about Iris not wearing her hood is true, it contradicts the claim implied by the evidence regarding Iris's usual attire.

Thus, the evidence that Iris typically wears her hood contradicts Bikini's testimony that she saw Iris without it during the time of the incident.

The contradiction is therefore:

```json
{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}
```
******************************
To analyze the evidence and testimonies for contradictions, we can closely examine the provided information.

One crucial piece of evidence here is Evidence 10, which states that the Shichishito, described as the murder weapon, had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it but is not the murder weapon. This detail is essential because it would suggest that the weapon associated with the act does not align with the initial assumption of its significance.

Looking at the testimonies, Testimony 5, which comes from Bikini, claims, "when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!" This testimony explicitly describes a witnessed act of stabbing, which would imply the use of a weapon that had caused blood loss.

Now, if we take them collectively, there is a glaring contradiction: Evidence 10's assertion that the Shichishito is not the murder weapon is incompatible with Testimony 5's account that describes an act of stabbing. If Elsie was indeed stabbed as per Bikini's account, the apparent absence of a confirmed murder weapon becomes a contradiction. 

Thus, the clear contradiction based on the interpretation of the evidence and testimony is that while one piece of evidence denies the identity of the murder weapon, testimony directly relates a stabbing event to the murder.

Therefore, the conflicting evidence and testimony are:

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 5}
******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, let's analyze them in conjunction:

From the evidence we have:
- Evidence 7 (Weather Data) indicates that there was snowy weather with occasional lightning between 10 PM and 11 PM. This means it would have been difficult to see clearly and may affect visibility and transportation methods like snowmobiles.

From the testimonies we have:
- Testimony 0 (by Bikini) states that she "saw the murder at around 11 PM." This is a significant assertion. 

If the weather was as severe as documented in Evidence 7, it raises questions about how clearly she could see anything, particularly a murder occurring.

Thus, we have a contradiction where the weather conditions described in the evidence make it improbable for someone to clearly see and witness a murder at the time stated in the testimony.

Therefore, the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are:

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 0}
******************************
To find a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other, we need to analyze the timeline and details presented.

1. The weather data (Evidence 7) states that snow occurred until approximately 10:50 PM on the night of the crime, followed by lightning striking at 10:45 PM.
  
2. Testimony 1 from Butz mentions that he was lying under his bedding when a white flash almost blinded him, which presumably refers to the lightning flash around that time.

3. Additionally, Testimony 2 states that Butz looked out the window and saw Dusky Bridge on fire after that flash.

4. In Testimony 4, Butz acknowledges running into Phoenix Wright after arriving at the bridge, which seems to follow the discovery of fire.

However, the crucial contradiction arises from Testimony 0, where Butz claims to have gone to the shack around 9 PM, making it unclear how he could have simultaneously reported seeing the fire at Dusky Bridge if he was not there at the right time. 

Thus, we have evidence that places the fire's origin specifically around late in the timeline, contradicting Testimony 0’s timing of being at the shack much earlier. Therefore, the pair of evidence and testimony that contradicts is:

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 0}
******************************
To determine which evidence and testimony contradict each other, we need to analyze the provided pieces.

One important point to note is that Larry Butz's testimony describes him sketching in front of the bridge and seeing Iris flying with her white hood fluttering. In addition to this, there is evidence (specifically, the Weather Data) suggesting that there was lightning during the time of the incident. 

However, the testimony of Larry Butz (Testimony 2) claims that he saw "Iris flying," which implies an action that would take place around the moment of the crime. If we look at the weather data, the lightning struck Dusky Bridge shortly before the murder, at 10:45 PM, just after the lights out bell rang at 10 PM. 

The significant contradiction arises when we analyze the context of Larry Butz witnessing Iris "flying"; this suggests a scenario that contradicts the reality of Iris's whereabouts, which is supported by her testimony that she was in her room until after the murder was discovered.

Hence, the contradiction exists between Larry’s observations of Iris with her white hood fluttering (Testimony 2) and the reasonable understanding of Iris's actions post-10 PM, which align with her establishing an alibi.

On that basis, we can conclude that the pieces that contradict each other are: 

Evidence about the events occurring around the time of the murder with the Weather Data aligning with the activities that Larry Butz described.

Therefore, the JSON format should indicate that the evidence related to the light conditions (Weather Data) and the testimony regarding witnessing something that could not have realistically occurred at that moment contradict each other.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 2}

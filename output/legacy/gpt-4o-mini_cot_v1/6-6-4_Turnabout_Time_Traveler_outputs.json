You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else. Let's think step by step:",
    "response": "To identify a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies, we need to analyze the given information for conflicts in statements and the supporting evidence.\n\n1. **Testimony from Pierce Nichody**:\n   - He claims, \"I was always in the company of others. I didn't have the opportunity to murder Gloomsbury.\" This statement implies he had alibis since he was never alone and did not have the chance to commit the murder.\n\n2. **Evidence Related to the Murder**:\n   - Evidence 14 (Autopsy Report) suggests that Gloomsbury was hit twice with the Time Keeper (the murder weapon). If whoever committed the murder was presumably in the company of others and didn’t have an opportunity to act alone, this creates a situation for contradiction.\n\n3. **Contradictory Analysis**:\n   - If Nichody was always with others, he could not have committed the murder alone. However, the evidence reflects that Gloomsbury was indeed attacked, indicating there was an opportunity for someone to commit the crime.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that there is a contradiction between Nichody's assertion of being in constant company and the circumstances surrounding the murder of Gloomsbury which allows for the possibility of an individual acting alone or unnoticed.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\"evidence\": 14, \"testimony\": 5}",

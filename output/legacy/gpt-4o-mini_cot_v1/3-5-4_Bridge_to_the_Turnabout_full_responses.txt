To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies, we need to analyze the statements provided by Iris alongside the evidence collected from the scene of the crime.

Iris's testimonies suggest that Mystic Elise was attacking Maya with her staff and eventually used a dagger. Specifically:

1. **Testimony 3:** Iris states that Elise "threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe." This implies that Elise was using her staff until she discarded it.
2. **Testimony 4:** Iris claims that Maya defended herself and stole the weapon.

Now, we need to compare these testimonies to the evidence, particularly looking for anything that contradicts the sequence of events Iris presented:

- **Evidence 10** mentions the Shichishito, stating it was not the murder weapon, despite having the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints. However, it aligns with the testimony concerning a weapon being used.
  
- **Evidence 11** (the autopsy report) confirms the time of death and method but does not directly contradict the testimonies.
  
However, looking closely:

- In **Testimony 1**, Iris claims she saw Elise strike Maya with her staff. 
- If we suppose Elise had just used the staff to strike Maya, it raises questions about whether Elise could have then discarded the staff with enough time to switch to a dagger quickly, especially if Maya was in the middle of a struggle for self-defense (as stated in Testimony 4).

What stands out uniquely includes **Evidence 6**, which describes Iris's hood, presenting a protective quality against evil spirits but is not truly reflective of an actual event during the conflict, nor does it contradict the testimony outright.

The greatest contradiction arises when considering **Testimony 1** and **Testimony 2** collectively with the concept of being struck and then moved toward the fatal act that seems to hint at Elise being in control until she was effectively neutralized by Maya's defense (described in subsequent testimonies). The timeline makes it absurd for there to be a clear, coordinated transition from staff assault to dagger usage, yet that is implicitly what Iris suggests should be seen through her narrative.

After analyzing all angles, the contradiction emerges with the concept of whether the method of the dagger could have followed directly after staff usage, which seems improbable under self-defense claims if Elise was following through as stated in the testimonies.

However, **Evidence 10**, which states that a specific weapon had the victim's blood fits better with the murderous act context compared to Elise's supposed sequential weapons handling implied in the testimonies, particularly concerning how self-defense could have operated under the stakes described.

Conclusively, we draw:

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 1}
******************************
In the testimonies, Iris describes an event in which Maya Fey (referred to as Mystic Maya) is involved in an altercation with Elise Deauxnim (Mystic Elise). According to Testimony 3, Iris states, "That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!" This suggests that Maya was the one who stabbed Elise.

However, looking at the evidence, particularly Evidence 11, which is Elise's Autopsy Report, indicates that the cause of death was loss of blood from a stab in the back. This raises the question of how Maya could stab Elise in a manner resulting in her death from a stab wound to the back if the event was as described in the testimonies.

Therefore, the contradiction exists between Testimony 3, where Iris states that Maya stabbed Elise, and the implication from Evidence 11 that indicates the circumstances of the stabbing may not align with what Iris witnessed.

Thus, the answer in JSON format is:

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To identify a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, let's examine the critical pieces:

- Testimony 6 by Iris states: "By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped."
- Evidence 7 (Weather Data) states that snow continued until approximately 10:50 PM, and lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. This indicates that there was snowy weather during the timeframe of the murder.

Since the murder occurred after snow was indicated to still be falling according to the weather data, it contradicts Iris's claim that it had stopped.

Thus, the contradiction points are:
- Evidence 7 (Weather Data)
- Testimony 6 (Iris's Testimony)

Presenting the response in the required JSON format:

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 6}
******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and the testimonies, we need to examine the details closely. 

From Maya's testimony:
- She says she was struck over the head (Testimony 1).
- She mentions losing consciousness afterward (Testimony 6).
- Importantly, she recalls seeing a man behind her attacker by the light of the stone lantern (Testimony 4).

Now, focusing on the evidence:
- Evidence 11, the autopsy report, states that the victim (Elise Deauxnim) was killed between 10 PM and 11 PM. 
- The lights out bell rang at 10 PM (as per Evidence 12).

This indicates that Maya could have potentially lost consciousness before seeing the man behind her attacker if the events unfolded in quick succession.

However, there is a significant point here: if Maya was indeed knocked unconscious immediately after being struck, it raises the possibility that she may not remember or actually see anyone. Therefore, if she was knocked out right after being attacked, her ability to recall seeing someone (Testimony 4) could be invalid.

Thus, we can conclude that the testimony of Maya seeing a man behind her attacker is contradicted by the fact that she lost consciousness immediately after the attack. Therefore, there is a contradiction between Testimony 4 and the context set by Testimony 6.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 4}
******************************
To find a contradiction between the provided evidence and testimonies, let's analyze the testimony given by Maya and the relevant pieces of evidence.

1. **Testimony 3** states: "The torches were lit... And the body was gone." 
2. **Evidence 11**, which is Elise's Autopsy Report, confirms that she was murdered, and the body must have been present at the scene at some point.
3. If the body was gone, this could imply that someone moved it post-murder, and the circumstances of how and when it was removed would need to be clarified.

Additionally, **Testimony 4** mentions that "all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too." 
This could imply a cleaning operation after the murder, which would contribute to the idea that the body was also removed intentionally from the scene.

Thus, the contradiction lies in the implications of evidence regarding the body being gone and whether Maya is relaying accurate events that align with the condition of evidence available (especially concerning the background of cleaning and what happened after the murder).

With this analysis, we see that:
- The autopsy report implies that the body was found and that it must have been at the scene at some point during the timeline.
- Maya's testimony suggests a removal of the body, creating a contradiction about the timelines of the events.

Therefore, we can conclude that Testimony 3 contradicts the implications in Evidence 11.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To analyze the evidence and testimony for contradictions, we need to compare the claims made by the characters against the factual evidence presented.

1. **Review of Testimony**:
   - Testimony 0 states that "Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night!" by Maya.
   - Testimony 1 mentions that Maya, the next morning, "looked around, but couldn't find anyone."
   - Testimony 2 indicates that Maya, the next day when the bridge was fixed, "was in the spare prep room."
   - Testimony 3 claims that "That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!"
   - Testimony 4 states, "He found Pearly first and cheered her right up!"

2. **Review of Evidence**:
   - Evidence 11, the "Elise's Autopsy Report," confirms that the murder occurred during the timeframe given (10 - 11 PM), which is critical to establishing the timeline. 
   - Evidence 6, "Iris's Hood," was received before the lights went out, indicating that events were unfolding before the murder.

3. **Evaluating for Contradictions**:
   - Maya's testimony implies that Pearly was at the Inner Temple during the incident when she was supposed to be there, and she was looking for people later. However, Testimony 4 suggests Godot found Pearly, which she would be at Inner Temple, potentially contradicting the timeline of Maya's search for her. 

Thus, the contradictions appear to be that while Maya was looking around and couldn’t find anyone, Godot would arrive later and find Pearly.

In this context, the specific contradiction involves the statements about Pearly’s whereabouts and Godot's action regarding finding her.

Therefore, the output reflecting the contradiction between Maya's testimony about not being able to find Pearly and Godot finding her would be as follows:

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 4}

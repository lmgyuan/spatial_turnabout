To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, we should look for statements made by characters that cannot logically coexist with the evidence provided. 

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies:

1. **Mr. Monkey's Head** (Evidence 11) states that it blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. This indicates that no one could have passed that way during that time.

2. Cody Hackins provides multiple testimonies (Testimonies 3 and 4) which describe his journey to the studio, including getting lost for about 30 minutes.

If we take testimony 3 ("I was going for the studio") and consider the timing of when Cody claims he left and when he would have arrived at the scene, it conflicts with the fact that the entrance to the scene was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM—meaning he wouldn't have been able to reach the scene during that time if he had indeed run into the blockade.

Thus the contradictory pair is:

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}

To identify a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, we need to focus on what Cody, a fan of the Steel Samurai, stated in his testimony and how that relates to the evidence collected at the crime scene.

Cody's testimony indicates he tried to take a picture right after the Steel Samurai had escaped from the villain, but he missed the opportunity because the camera's lens wouldn’t open on time. This suggests that he was expecting an event to happen in front of him, and while he attempted to capture it, he ultimately couldn't.

On the other hand, evidence 11 states that Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. Given that the murder is tied to a specific time frame (the time of death as per Jack's autopsy report), if Cody had a clear view of the scene and could take a photo, the evidence suggesting that access was blocked creates a contradiction. 

In essence, Cody's testimony states he wanted to take a picture, implying he was in a position to see what happened, while the evidence about Mr. Monkey's Head contradicts this by stating the path was blocked during the relevant time, preventing anyone from seeing or accessing the crime scene.

Thus, the conflicting pair of evidence and testimony is:

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 4}

To identify contradictions, we need to examine the evidence and testimonies closely. 

The testimonies provided by Trilo indicate that he had an engagement ring that he was planning to give to Regina, and he specifically states that he always kept it in his pocket, especially the night of the incident.

However, the evidence that can contradict this is the "Ring" found, which is described as a cheap ring with an eerie sparkle and has the engraving "From T to R." This suggests that the ring found belongs to Trilo and is potentially the same engagement ring he claims to have been carrying.

To find a contradiction, we should compare an assertion of Trilo's that implies he had the ring with evidence of the ring's condition or circumstances surrounding its discovery.

The key contradiction arises between Trilo's claim that he had the ring in his pocket that night (Testimony 4) and the possible implication that the ring is a cheap one discovered after the crime, suggesting it may not have been with him all along. However, since the ring is found at the crime scene and he claimed to have it, that raises doubts about the reliability of his testimony. Therefore, we focus on the testimony that explicitly mentions possession.

Thus, the pair that best contradicts is Testimony 4 (where Trilo claims to have kept the engagement ring in his pocket that night) and the evidence of the Ring found (the condition of the ring raises doubts if it was his).

Finally, I will conclude with the required JSON format:

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 4}

To determine which evidence and testimony contradict each other, we should analyze the available evidence and corresponding testimonies with respect to each character's involvement in the murder of Russell Berry.

1. **Moe's Testimonies**: Moe claims to have seen Max at the crime scene, describing various details of his appearance including symbols, silk hat, and cloak. He emphasizes the certainty of his identification.
   
2. **Max's Evidence**: There is a particular piece of evidence that suggests Max's involvement in the murder — the crime photo showing a person lying on the case in the snow with visible footprints, along with the silk hat found at the scene which is a distinctive symbol of Max.

3. **Contradictions in Identification**: If Moe's testimonies are accurate in identifying Max as the one present at the crime scene, it aligns with the evidence. However, if Max has a solid alibi or if there is evidence suggesting another individual, it reflects a contradiction.

However, upon analyzing the details of Moe's testimonies, he describes a clear identification of Max, while contradictions could arise if it is revealed that during the time of the crime, Max was elsewhere.

4. **Critical Examination**: Upon careful review of existing statements, the Crime Photo shows that someone was lying on the case in the snow at the time, which implies Max (if he is the identified figure by Moe) could not have been at another location.

Thus, no contradictions exist with Moe's testimonies confirming Max's presence at the crime scene, while the evidence directly correlates.

Therefore, we find that **Moe's testimony about the silhouette and presence of Max** can indeed contradict with Max’s ultimate position if evidence surfaces stating otherwise, particularly concerning the timeline and identity.

In particular, we can highlight Moe's testimony about Max's appearance suggesting that he was carrying something to contradict the points raised in the testimony regarding sighting characters amidst conflicting scenarios concerning his presence.

Ultimately leading us to indicate that:
- Testimony: Moe claims he saw Max unmistakably at the scene.
- Evidence: Initially suggests that Max’s items were involved, but does not confirm his actual presence there.

Thus, the specific evidence and the testimony highlighting a contradiction would be constructed as follows.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 1}
******************************
To find a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other, we should first identify the main points from the testimony and the evidence provided.

From Moe's testimonies, particularly:
- Testimony 0 states, "There were no white roses that night!"
- Testimony 1 states that all other symbols were there.
- Testimony 2 emphasizes the presence of the silk hat.
- Testimony 3 asserts that the silk hat was worn on the scene the entire time.

Now let’s examine the evidence:
- Evidence 4 (Max G. Promo Poster) includes symbols associated with Max, specifically mentioning silk hats, cloaks, and white roses.

Looking closely at Moe's statements:
- In Testimony 0, he asserts that there were no white roses, which directly contradicts the image represented in Evidence 4, which indicates that white roses are part of Max's theme and were present at the scene since he was there.

Therefore, we have a conflict between the assertion in Testimony 0 regarding the absence of white roses and the implication from Evidence 4 that these symbols, including white roses, are an integral part of the environment surrounding Max.

The contradiction can thus be summarized as:
{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 0}

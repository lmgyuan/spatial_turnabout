However, the weather data indicates that there was snow and lightning struck Dusky Bridge right at 10:45 PM, which coincides closely with the timeframe of the murder. The tracks leading to Dusky Bridge suggest a travel time of less than 5 minutes, while it takes 15 minutes to walk there. This raises questions about the timeline and the feasibility of someone using a snowmobile to commit the murder without being seen.\n\nThe key contradiction lies with the idea that someone could have successfully used a snowmobile to escape the scene shortly after the murder, compared to the indications provided by the weather and the more detailed timeline of events.\n\n{\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 2}",

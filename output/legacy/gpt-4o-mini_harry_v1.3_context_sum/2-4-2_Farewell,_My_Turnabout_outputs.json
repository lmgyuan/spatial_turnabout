However, this contradicts the nature of the costume itself, which is fully covering and prevents any identification of the wearer. Specifically, Testimony 1 claims she saw the Nickel Samurai, while the costume's design makes it impossible for her to have seen who was inside it. Therefore, we can identify this contradiction based on the costume's characteristics.\n\n{\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 1}",

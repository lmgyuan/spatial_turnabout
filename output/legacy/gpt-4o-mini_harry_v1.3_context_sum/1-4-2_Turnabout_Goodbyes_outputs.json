The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!\" This indicates that Lotta directly observed Miles Edgeworth on the night of the crime. However, the evidence of the Lake Photo (Evidence 4), taken automatically at 12:15 AM on December 25th, shows two individuals where neither face can be seen clearly due to dense fog, making it impossible to definitively identify Miles Edgeworth in the photograph. This creates a contradiction between Lotta's clear identification and the lack of visual confirmation in the photograph.\n\n{\"evidence\": 4, \"testimony\": 0}",

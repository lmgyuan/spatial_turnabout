    "response": "The testimony of Maya indicates that she was struck over the head and lost consciousness after seeing a man behind her attacker by the light of the stone lantern. However, she claims to have screamed for help, which suggests she was somewhat aware of her surroundings before losing consciousness. This would contradict the idea that she could then be unresponsive without a clear timeline of those events to account for her later recollection.\n\nIn this case, there is a potential issue with the timeline regarding when she lost consciousness while still being aware of the attacking man and what she screamed. Given the circumstances of her being assaulted, it raises questions about the reliability of her narrative.\n\nThe chosen evidence is the crime photo that shows the location, which may contradict her clear visual observations of the attacker, as the testimony suggests consciousness and awareness at a moment she claims she was incapacitated. This may suggest inconsistent accounts regarding how aware she was post-assault.\n\n{\"evidence\": 13, \"testimony\": 6}",

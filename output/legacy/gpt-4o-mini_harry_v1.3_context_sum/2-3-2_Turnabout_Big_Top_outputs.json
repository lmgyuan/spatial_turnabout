You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}.

If the white roses were absent, it indicates there may have been a mistake in Moe's memory regarding Max's attire, as the symbols are intrinsically linked to Max's identity as a magician.

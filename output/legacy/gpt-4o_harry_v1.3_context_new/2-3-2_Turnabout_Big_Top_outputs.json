Boys and Girls! Welcome to the show! Prepare to witness a man who has mastered the wonder of flight... The World's Greatest Magician... The one... The only... Maximillion Galactica!\nDecember 26, 8:12 PMBerry Big CircusCircus Entrance\nPearl:\nWow... That was like being in a dream... (Changed from [Wow... That was like living a dream...] in the original release) I haven't even caught my breath yet.\nMaya:\nHehe... That was amazing! Wasn't it Pearly!?\nPearl:\nIt was great! There was a dancing bear... And a tiger that jumped through a ring of fire... An elephant that rode a giant ball... (Changed from [And a tiger that jumped though [sic] a ring of fire... An elephant who rode a giant ball...] in the original release) Not to mention that guy who flew through the air!\nMaya:\nYeah! Max Galactica! He was absolutely fabulous!\nPearl:\nHuh? ...What? Max...\nMaya:\nMax Galactica! The World's Greatest Magician!\nPearl:\nA magic-ician?\nMaya:\nNo, a magician.\nPearl:\nUmm... Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What is it, Pearls?\nPearl:\nDoes magic have anything to do with channeling spirits?\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think it has anything to do with channeling...) You don't know about magic, do you Pearls?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry...\nPhoenix:\n(I braved the winter cold and took Pearls to see the circus. It's been six months since the incident in Kurain Village... and it was during that trying time that I met Pearls... (Changed from [It was during that terrible time that I met Pearls...] in the original release) Thankfully, she seems to be recovering from it, and is returning to her normal self. (Changed from [It seems like she is starting to get back to normal...] in the original release))\nMaya:\nAhh... It's time to go.\nPearl:\nYou're right. We can't miss the last train.\nPhoenix:\nPearls! You remembered the train!\nPearl:\nOf course I did! But I don't really understand what everyone means by \"express train\".\nMaya:\nWell, Nick... See you later. I'll come by to help clean the office. It's gotta be spotless for the new year.\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry about it. Really.\nPearl:\nYou are going to visit Mr. Nick on New Year's?\nMaya:\nMaybe.\nPearl:\nI am glad you will get to spend your New Year's with your special someone!\nMaya:\nP-PEARLY!! Look! It's time to go!\nPearl:\nHappy New Year, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Happy New Year\"... I really hope it will turn out that way...)\nDecember 28, 9:12 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\n(Well... Today wraps it up for this year... I hope I can finish cleaning this place up in one day.)\nPhone:\n.............................. ...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...Hello. This is the Wright & Co. Law Offices.\nMaya:\nNick!! It's t-t-terrible!!\nPhoenix:\nAhh, Maya. Perfect timing... Things are terrible here too!\nMaya:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nThe office is a terrible mess! And I have to clean it up!\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about!?\nPhoenix:\nUmmm... My dirty office. What are you talking about?\nMaya:\nListen Nick! You have to turn on the TV!\nPhoenix:\n(The TV?)\nTV:\n...Now let's check in at the scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? What happened...?)\nTV:\n...Thank you. We're here at the Berry Big Circus. The Berry Big Circus has become the center of a sensational murder. The scene has created quite a stir among the throngs of excited onlookers!\nPhoenix:\nThe Very... I mean... The Berry Big Circus...\nMaya:\nThat's the circus we went to!! Right!?\nPhoenix:\nThey're saying that there was a... murder.\nMaya:\nYeah! They arrested him too!\nPhoenix:\nA-Arrested who?\nMaya:\nMax! They arrested Max Galactica!!\nPhoenix:\n(Maximillion Galactica. Fans call him Max. A popular magician who can fly through the sky at will... Maya said she was a huge fan of Max...)\nMaya:\nAlright Nick! I'll see you in two hours at the Detention Center.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What?\nMaya:\nSee you there. You've still got plenty of time to clean up your office later!\nPhoenix:\nW-WWWHHHAATTT!?\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nExamine\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I wouldn't mind dumping some of these off at the used bookstore... But that might not be such a good idea.\nCharley the plant\nPhoenix:\nCharley. A quite decorative plant. I wouldn't mind his help cleaning this place up.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nMovie poster\nPhoenix:\nA poster of the newest member of the \"Steel Samurai\" universe. Maya went out and bought it right away. She's a sucker for all things Steel Samurai. I hear they're even giving the new guy his own movie. I just know Maya is going to drag me out to see it with her...\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Until recently, it had been a normal, business-class hotel.\nDecember 28, 11:19 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nWhat are they talking about? Why did they arrest Max?\nPhoenix:\nYou're asking the wrong man on that one, Maya. Maybe he used his magical skills to deal death with a slight [sic] of hand...\nMaya:\nMaximillion Galactica would never do such a thing!!\n???:\nFABULOUS!! What the young lady just said was absolutely fabulous! What a clever girl! Such a fabulous understanding of events!\nPhoenix:\n(...What's with all this fabulous talk...)\nMax:\nWelcome to the Visitor's Room!\nMaya:\nIt's MAX!! Nick!! Look! It's the real Maximillion Galactica!!\nMax:\nAlright sweetie. Pick a card, any card.\nMaya:\nH-H-He called me sweetie! *swoon* Nick!!\nMax:\nAh ha ha ha... Time's running out sweetie! Pick a card, any card!\nMaya:\nT-This one...\nMax:\nUh-huh. I thought you would pick that one sweetie. The ace of hearts!\nMaya:\nAHHHH!!! He got it! He got it! NICK! LOOK! HE GOT IT!!\nMax:\nWhat can I say sweetie... You've stolen one of my most valued possessions. One of Maximillion Galactica's hearts...\nMaya:\nMax... *swoon*\nMax:\nWell... Time to make this an absolutely fabulous time!\nMaya:\nMax! You should let Nick pick a card!!\nPhoenix:\n(Eek... I don't want to steal one of his hearts...)\nMax:\nAnd you are...? Oh, how silly of me! You must be sweetie's driver!\nPhoenix:\nHer driver?\nMax:\nWhatever... Hurry up and pick a card, any card...\nPhoenix:\nUmm... I want this one.\nMax:\nSo sweetie, let's be honest here... You came to this visitor's room to visit me, didn't you?\nMaya:\nY-Yes! I'm your biggest fan!!\nMax:\nFabulous! Absolutely fabulous! Thank you so much!!\nPhoenix:\nHey... Umm... What about my card?\nMax:\nThink of it as a souvenir.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWell Nick... I think it's time to get to work.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick? Why are you looking at the ceiling?\nPhoenix:\nI was just thinking about what I should have for lunch.\nMax:\nSweetie... Drop porcupine head over there. Shower me with your attention. OK?\nMaya:\nO-O-O-Oh, yes...! (Changed from [Y-Y-Y-Yes...] in the original release)\nMax:\nAb-so-lute-ly... FABULOUS!!\nPhoenix:\n(Absolutely cringe inducing.)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera. Max keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.\nTalk\nMax Galactica\nMaya:\nMax, I was hoping you could tell me a little bit more about yourself...\nMax:\nFABULOUS! I think we should get to know each other better, too! Why don't you come sit next to me?\nMaya:\nUmm... There's a big piece of security glass between us...\nMax:\nOh sweet geebus! What in the world!? If only I could use magic! Then I could make this wall disappear...\nPhoenix:\n(What is this guy talking about!?) Anyways... Lately, you've become awfully famous, haven't you Max?\nMax:\nThat's Maximillion to you, porcupine head! Get it straight!\nPhoenix:\n(Jeez, people nowadays... They get their panties all in a bunch over nothing!) Anyway, Maximillion, you won a very prestigious award recently, did you not?\nMax:\nI did indeed! It was FABULOUS! I won the Magician's Grand Prix, held by the Association of International Magicians. It's an award that recognizes that I am the most fabulouso of fabulous world magicians. There was a trophy, and a bust. It was a fab... I mean it was an amazing day.\nMaya:\nWow! That's incredible!\nMax:\nIsn't it!? I'm certainly the greatest magician in the world!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm going to guess he didn't win a trophy for most modest magician.)\nBerry Big Circus\nMaya:\nYou are signed to an exclusive contract with the Berry Big Circus, correct?\nMax:\nThat's the long and short of it. You sure do your research sweetie! I'm impressed. You just can't watch a magician on TV, you know!? Magic is so fabulous, you have to see it with your own eyes, sweetie!\nMaya:\nYou're right! You're so right!\nMax:\nHowever, the circus... It's a dinosaur. A thing of the past. Nowadays, no one even cares about what goes on there.\nMaya:\nHuh? What do you mean?\nMax:\nThat's why I signed the contract!!\nPhoenix:\nThat's why you signed the contract?\nMax:\nThanks to me, the Berry Big Circus is fabulously popular! People come out in droves to catch a glimpse of the magic of Max Galactica! I revived the dinosaur that is the circus! But to me, it was just another magic trick! Isn't it just wonderful, sweetie?\nMaya:\nY-Yes...\nMax:\nI made all the old crusty performances obsolete!\nMaya:\nBut I kinda like the circus performances...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks a bit down...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nTell me what happened at the Berry Big Circus.\nMax:\nAhh... Last night. The Ringmaster was murdered.\nMaya:\nThe Ringmaster... You mean Russell Berry?\nMax:\nSomeone smashed him over the head, I hear. He was slumped over on the ground. Even though it was the middle of the night, the police presence was fabulous. The police questioned me at length...\nPhoenix:\nQuestioned you about what?\nMax:\nAbout everything... I was the last one to see the Ringmaster before he was murdered. I saw him last evening... In his room. (Changed from [I saw him that night... In his room.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nSo then why were you arrested?\nMax:\nArrested? Don't make an ant hill into a mountain, sweetie. They just wanted to consult with me on matters... That's all.\nMaya:\nNick... I don't think Max understands how serious this is.\nPhoenix:\n(She's right... I think I should shock him back to reality...)\nMeeting with Russell (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nBefore the murder, you met with the Ringmaster?\nMax:\nUh-huh.\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you talk about?\nMax:\nThings that aren't for your ears.\nPhoenix:\nMaya. Would you please ask him?\nMaya:\nWhat did you talk about with the Ringmaster, Max?\nMax:\nIt was nothing... Small talk really... We were just having a chat about my salary.\nMaya:\nSalary?\nMax:\nI am the one bringing in the crowds. (Changed from [I am the one bringing in all of the crowds to the circus.] in the original release) I think that I should be compensated as such. You agree, don't you?\nMaya:\nY-Yes...\nPhoenix:\nThat's all you talked about?\nMax:\nOf course! It was a fabulous chat!\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(Just fabulous! I mean-- Argh! Now he's got ME saying it!) (Changed from [Fabulous! Why does he have to keep saying fabulous!?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick? You look all bent out of shape.\nMeeting with Russell (subsequent times)\nMax:\nWhen you make absolutely fabulous magic... It costs enormous sums of money. Sums that will boggle your mind!\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nMaya:\nThat's why you went to his room that night...?\nMax:\nI went to ask him for a fabulous raise.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder how people can lie with such a straight face...)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMax:\nWhat is that badge? Is it used in a disappearing act?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not a magician, Max. I'm an attorney.\nMax:\nAn attorney? Then why are you wasting your time talking to me?\nMaya:\nHe isn't wasting his time! Max... You're...\nMax:\nOK! OK! Relax, sweetie... You're just a little overanxious, I think...\nMaya:\n*whimper*\nMaya Fey profile\nMax:\nSo, would you like to come up on stage with me sometime?\nMaya:\nRe-Really? Is that really OK?\nMax:\nI'll bring you up on stage as a volunteer from the audience!\nMaya:\nREALLY!?\nMax:\nI'll give you something before the show, and then on stage you'll sneak it to me...\nPhoenix:\n(Wait a second... He's planting her in the audience to rig a magic trick!)\nMax profile\nPhoenix:\nDo you mind taking a look at this?\nMax:\nI guess I have no choice... But really, is this the proper time or place for this?\nPhoenix:\n(He signed his own photo...)\nMaya:\nNick... You mind giving that to me when the case is over?\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this?\nMax:\nFabulous!! You'd like me to sign this for you?\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh*)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Attorney's Badge:\nMax:\n... Anyways... I've been curious about something for a while now.\nMaya:\nWhat's that?\nMax:\nWhy do you keep looking at me with such a sad look on your face, sweetie?\nMaya:\nBe-Because! You've been arrested! For murder!\nMax:\nOh, don't be ignorant. They wouldn't arrest someone like me!!\nPhoenix:\nWhy is that?\nMax:\nObviously because I'm the fabulous Maximillion Galactica!\nPhoenix:\nSo?\nMax:\nI'm the very big star of the Berry Big Circus.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that means?\nMax:\nI'm rich. I'm paid fabulous sums!\nPhoenix:\nWhich means what?\nMax:\n...\nMaya:\nMax...\nMax:\nQuit joking around! You've got to be pulling my magic wand! The police aren't really serious about all this, are they?\nPhoenix:\nThey don't arrest people as a joke.\nMax:\n...!!\nMaya:\nLook at Max... He's crushed...\nPhoenix:\nWell he needed to wake up and smell the coffee. (This is serious business.)\nMax:\nUmm... Umm...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMax:\nPorcu... I mean, Sir. You're a lawyer, right?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Oh, yeah. I'm an attorney.\nMax:\nPlease! Help me! I didn't kill nobody!\nMaya:\n\"Didn't kill nobody!?\"\nMax:\nI may be more spoiled than a hog in a hamburger mud pit... But a killer!? That's insane... I... I... I could never...\nMaya:\nM-Max?\nMax:\nI swear!! I just wanted to pay off my daddy's debt... He's back on the farm...\nPhoenix:\nOK... OK... I'll take your case.\nMax:\nR-Really?\nPhoenix:\nReally.\nMax:\nUh... Thank ya much. Ya'll sure are nice folks.\nMaya:\nUmm... Max.\nMax:\nYes?\nMaya:\nWhat's your real name?\nMax:\nIt's Billy Bob Johns...\nMaya:\n............ (Changed from [... Ugh...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the matter, Maya?\nMaya:\nHe's really just a country bumpkin!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMax:\n...Ahem. I must apologize for not being my absolutely fabulous self just now, sweetie.\nMaya:\nH-Huh?\nMax:\nMr. Attorney.\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMax:\nA few minutes ago, you took one of my cards, didn't you?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Now that he mentions it... I did take a card.)\nMax:\nIt was the 10 of Hearts. Right?\nPhoenix:\n(Wha... How'd he... He got it right, again!)\nMax:\nWhat can I say? You, too... You've stolen some of my most valued possessions. Ten of Maximillion Galactica's hearts...\nPhoenix:\n(You sure do have a lot of hearts, don't you?)\nMax:\nAh ha ha ha... I'm putting my faith in you sweetie.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't just call me sweetie, did he?)\nMaya:\nAlright! Let's make this an absolutely fabulous case! C'mon, Nick!\nDecember 28Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nAlright... We've got lots of things we have to look into. No time for slacking. Let's get going.\nMaya:\nOK.\nPhoenix:\n? What's the matter? You seem down.\nMaya:\nMaximilion Galactica... Who would have guessed he was country bumpkin?\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSo now what do we do?\nMaya:\nHuh? There's still lots of things we can do! Go to the scene of the crime, talk to witnesses, gather evidence...\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I guess you're right.\nMaya:\nWe still don't even know what happened in the first place.\nAny ideas\nMaya:\nWe don't have enough information to make a case yet.\nPhoenix:\nI could have sworn I've heard that before.\nMaya:\nWell, we never have enough information!\nPhoenix:\nJust admit it, you don't have a clue what happened.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMaya:\nWell... Your badge is still shining. Barely.\nPhoenix:\nIt may be showing a bit of wear, but I try to take good care of this thing.\nMaya:\nYou sure do love to show that off, don't you Nick? Who knows how many times you have shown it to me?\nPhoenix:\n(She's right... I whip it out at the drop of a hat.)\nMaya Fey profile\nMaya:\nOnce you start channeling spirits... They say you lose sight of who you actually are...\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Do you really believe that?\nMaya:\nNot really. But... Just in case, I plan to write my autobiography.\nPhoenix:\nYour autobiography...?\nMax profile\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the matter? You've been acting strange for a while now.\nMaya:\nMax... He's just some country bumpkin...\nPhoenix:\nSo? Why does that matter? He's still a famous magician right?\nMaya:\nI guess. But his real name is... Billy Bob Johns.\nPhoenix:\n(Yikes! The poor guy's got three first names! I guess that is pretty odd.)\nMaya:\nOh well! If a big star can do it, then you should pretend to be exotic too, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n\"A big star...\"?\nMaya:\nMax Galactica is a pretty big name! Anyways, what do you think about Naruhodo A. Wrighto?\nPhoenix:\nN-N-Na... *cough* Umm... What's the \"A\" stand for?\nMaya:\nThe \"A\" stands for \"Attorney\".\nPhoenix:\nI'll think about it...\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nThis is kinda pointless don't you think?\nMaya:\nIf it's that pointless, then you don't have to worry about showing it to me.\nPhoenix:\n(When she's right... She's right.)\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusCircus Entrance\nMaya:\nWe're here again...\nPhoenix:\nYep. But this time we are here for work. (It hasn't been that long since the crime, so the police are still on the scene.)\nMaya:\nLet's find someone who might know something about what happened.\nPhoenix:\nSounds like a plan.\nExamine\nBig top\nMaya:\nThe Berry Big Top is so... Very... B... *cough* Enormous...\nPhoenix:\nYep. One look at the huge tent looming over you and you realize \"This is the circus!\"\nMaya:\nI know! I know! It really gets your blood pumping doesn't it!?\nSign\nMaya:\nLook! Look! It's Max!!\nPhoenix:\nEven when you don't want to see him... *poof* He's right in front of you. (Sure the sign says \"Berry Big Circus\"... But looking around... It might as well be Cirque du Galactica...)\nMaya:\nThe stars on his cheek sure are dreamy... How about I draw a star on your cheek Nick? I've got a marker!\nPhoenix:\nNah! Nah! It's alright!\nStreamers\nPhoenix:\nThose streamers do a nice job introducing the circus performers.\nMaya:\n\"Maximillion Galactica and his comical comrades!\"\nPhoenix:\nYou know... You don't really see too many streamers nowadays, do you?\nMaya:\nYou're right. I haven't seen one in ages. I bet they stopped using them due to little kids climbing up to the top...\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... I don't think that was why...)\nVendors\nPhoenix:\nIt's a snack stand. They have hot dogs, hamburgers, and drinks... Not to mention...\nMaya:\nCandy and popcorn... They've even got snow cones!!\nPhoenix:\n(Who would eat snow cones in the middle of winter?)\nMaya:\nNick... Do you think we can buy some snow cones?\nPhoenix:\nLook around... There's tons of snow piled up all around here!\nMaya:\nYAY!! Wait a second... There's no syrup though! I want syrup!\nPhoenix:\n(Hopefully she doesn't notice that discolored snow in the corner. That's not syrup!)\nEntrance\nMaya:\nNick... The entrance is right here.\nPhoenix:\nMaya. The circus is closed today. No clowns. No elephants. No shows.\nMaya:\nI know that! Nick... You can get your picture taken with Dali the elephant!\nPhoenix:\nThere's no Dali. Not today.\nMaya:\nI know that too! Oh well... I'll just have to take a picture with whoever I stumble across...\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* It's not like we're here on business or anything...)\nTicket booths\nPhoenix:\nThis is the Box Office where they sell all the tickets for the circus.\nMaya:\nThey also sell programs. I forgot to buy one when we came to the circus last time.\nPhoenix:\nSo then why don't you buy one now?\nMaya:\nHmm... Sounds like a plan. Oh no... It looks like I forgot my wallet. ...\nPhoenix:\nIf you want me to buy it for you, just ask me already.\nMaya:\nYou know I'd never do that to you, Nick...\nDoor\nMaya:\nHmm... This door must lead to the lodging house.\nPhoenix:\n\"No Entry To Unauthorized Personnel\"\nMaya:\nDo you really need to say \"No Entry\" if no one's actually entering? It's almost like a zen riddle, isn't it Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not even going to justify that question with a response...)\nMaya:\nI bet all of the stars stay at that lodging house.\nDecember 28Lodging HousePlaza\nPhoenix:\nThis seems to be a dorm where all the performers in the circus stay...\nMaya:\nReally!? So we might run into that stoogey clown here, right? He's so kooky! (Changed from [Really!? So that stoogey clown should be here, huh? He's so kooky!] in the original release)\n???:\nAhhh! It's you two!\nMaya:\nOh... Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nHow is it you guys always seem to know when I'm working a crime scene, pal? (Changed from [I always see you hanging around when I'm working a crime scene, pal.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nBecause you're always working, Detective. (Changed from [You always seem to be working so hard, Detective.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'd rather not be always working, but with crime, you don't make your own hours. (Changed from [I'd rather not be working hard, but with crime you don't make your own hours.] in the original release) If I have to be at the circus anyway, I want to see the lion tamer and the tightrope. However, no matter where I go, the show is always the same... Dead body. Stage left.\nMaya:\nNick! Nick! He complained!!\nPhoenix:\nHeh heh... That's a rarity. Let's get back to business now, OK?\nExamine\nTarp\nPhoenix:\nThere's some evidence under the tarp over there...\nGumshoe:\nHey! Watch it, pal! The killer is behind that tarp!!\nMaya:\nAHHHHH!!\nGumshoe:\nHo! Ho! Ho! Got ya! I was just kidding!\nMaya:\nGRRR!\nGumshoe:\nHo! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!\nAir conditioner\nGumshoe:\nThis year, I finally won an air conditioner!\nMaya:\nWhat!? You didn't have an air conditioner? Did you ride your triceratops to work too?\nPhoenix:\nAnd what do you mean you \"won\" an air conditioner? You didn't buy it?\nGumshoe:\nI can't afford one of those things!! But I got lucky and won it as a door prize at the Annual Police Christmas Party!\nMaya:\nThey really pay you peanuts don't they?\nGumshoe:\nPeanuts? I don't even get paid enough for peanut butter, let alone peanuts!\nLightpost\nGumshoe:\nThe safety lights around the circus are kept on all night long. So, they should have been on at the time of the murder...\nPhoenix:\n(So he's saying the murder took place in the light...?)\nGumshoe:\nHow strange...\nMaya:\nHow strange indeed... Hmm...\nMuddy footprints\nPhoenix:\nThis is the only place that the snow has been trounced upon.\nMaya:\nThe murderer was sloppy leaving all these prints all over!\nGumshoe:\nNo no no no no... We're the ones who left the prints... An investigation can be a messy thing sometimes.\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nI also slipped and fell in that spot over there. The other detectives all got a good laugh when the prosecutor whipped me. Thank god there was all this snow around to bring down the swelling.\nPhoenix:\n(It's great to know that the police aren't worried about preserving the evidence...)\nTalk\nTomorrow's trial\nPhoenix:\nDo you know who will be the prosecutor in court tomorrow?\nGumshoe:\nOf course. It will be Ms. von Karma.\nPhoenix:\nUhhh... She isn't gonna hit me with her whip again, is she?\nGumshoe:\nWhat do you have to worry about? You only have to see her in court! When she shows up at the precinct, the sound of that whip never ends, pal.\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe... I'm sure Ms. von Karma's really interesting and all, but... (Changed from [Detective Gumshoe... That's enough about Von Karma.] in the original release) there's someone else I'd rather talk about. (Chagned from [What about that guy? What is he up to?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nLike who? (Changed from [That guy?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nLike Mr. Edgeworth, of course! (Changed from [What happened to Edgeworth?] in the original release) You know! Nick's true rival, Miles Edgeworth! (Changed from [You know! The Edgeworth that's Nick's rival!] in the original release) What in the world happened after I went back home!? (Changed from [What in the world happened when I went back home!?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth... You haven't heard what happened to him?\nMaya:\nNick won't tell me!\nGumshoe:\nWell, to be honest... I'm not at liberty to tell you either. Let's just say he's not around anymore.\nMaya:\nHe's not around!?!? Nick! What does he mean Mr. Edgeworth isn't around!?\nPhoenix:\nExactly what he said. He's not around. Edgeworth is gone... Don't say his name again, OK?\nMaya:\nN-Nick?\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nThe Ringmaster of the circus was murdered, wasn't he?\nGumshoe:\nYep. Last night around 10 PM. He died outside in the cold. A pretty sad way to go out if you ask me, pal.\nMaya:\n... It was rather cold.\nGumshoe:\nThis is the scene of the crime, pal. The body was found right over there. Right about where you are standing now.\nMaya:\nAHHHHHHHHHHH!!\nGumshoe:\nHo! Ho! Ho! Surprised you, didn't I?\nMaya:\nI'm not laughing!\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, but do you mind telling me what happened to the victim?\nGumshoe:\nHe was killed by a blow to the noggin, pal.\nMaya:\nYeep!\nGumshoe:\nIt's pretty clear cut as far as murders go. He was discovered quickly. But...\nPhoenix:\nBut?\nGumshoe:\nThere's just one thing that doesn't quite fit.\nMaya:\nHah! There always seems to be something that doesn't quite fit!!\nSomething unusual (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat was this one thing that just didn't quite fit? The thing you mentioned earlier.\nGumshoe:\nFootprints, pal. Footprints.\nMaya:\nFootprints?\nGumshoe:\nLook at this picture of the crime scene...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this? This wooden box under the body?\nGumshoe:\nNo clue, pal. Some forensics experts took it back and are examining it now.\nMaya:\nAnd... And... What is so mysterious about the footprints?\nGumshoe:\nWhoa. Calm down now. Take a good look at the footprints in this picture.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim's footprints are on the scene.\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The problem is...\nMaya:\n...! The killer's footprints aren't there!!\nGumshoe:\nBingo. Where did the killer come from, and where did the killer run off to? Obviously, there is no way the killer committed this crime while flying.\nPhoenix:\nA flying... culprit? (Changed from [A flying...

The thing you mentioned earlier.\nGumshoe:\nFootprints, pal. Footprints.\nMaya:\nFootprints?\nGumshoe:\nLook at this picture of the crime scene...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this? This wooden box under the body?\nGumshoe:\nNo clue, pal. Some forensics experts took it back and are examining it now.\nMaya:\nAnd... And... What is so mysterious about the footprints?\nGumshoe:\nWhoa. Calm down now. Take a good look at the footprints in this picture.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim's footprints are on the scene.\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The problem is...\nMaya:\n...! The killer's footprints aren't there!!\nGumshoe:\nBingo. Where did the killer come from, and where did the killer run off to? Obviously, there is no way the killer committed this crime while flying.\nPhoenix:\nA flying... culprit? (Changed from [A flying...

So about the eyewitness... (Changed from [Umm... How about any eyewitnesses...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nHo! Ho! Ho! You know I'm not going to tell you that! That's the prosecution's trump card!!\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Oh well...\nGumshoe:\n... Oh! I just remembered!!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nI forgot to mention that you two are barred from entering that lodging house.\nMaya:\n...? Why is that?\nGumshoe:\nOh... No reason! Just something I remembered to tell you.\nMaya:\nIt must be because that's where the eyewitness is. (Changed from [It must be because there's an eyewitness inside that Lodging House.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nLet's check it out!\nGumshoe:\nDon't you dare, pal! (Changed from [Oh no you don't, pal!] in the original release)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nGumshoe:\nC'non. You've flashed that badge at me so many times it doesn't work anymore! Why don't you try wearing a different badge every now and again?\nMaya:\nWell... I do have a Steel Samurai Badge with me. How about that one?\nPhoenix:\nI'll only wear it if Detective Gumshoe carries a Steel Samurai Police Badge.\nMaya:\nThen it's a deal! I hear that Detective Gumshoe has that very badge! ...\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? Don't look at me like that!! You're making me nervous!\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nBeing a spirit medium is quite an accomplishment... And you're so young too! That's really something!!\nMaya:\nActually, I've been thinking of taking a break from channeling.\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nMaya:\nI don't want to have another incident like last time.\nMax profile\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like Max is the most unpopular guy in the circus tent. You know what they say... A bad attitude follows you everywhere...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, he's a bit arrogant, but he didn't seem that bad.)\nMaya:\nBut just because someone has a bad attitude doesn't make them a criminal.\nGumshoe:\nIt's not just his attitude... I've got proof, pal!\nMaya:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nHe left something at the scene of the crime! One of his magician's trademarks! An incredibly well-made silk hat.\nMaya:\nWell it does have very classy decorative elements.\nSilk Hat added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nMax uses a cloak, silk hat, and white roses as his signature symbols.\nPhoenix:\n...

I'm making a really strange tired looking face here...\nMaya:\nHmm... Are you sure you weren't born looking like that?\nGumshoe:\nI wish I was more lively... ... Right now, I'm just tired.\nMaya:\nWell, there's not much you can do about that, so you just gotta keep on being tired!\nGumshoe:\nYou're right!\nPhoenix:\n(Glad I stayed out of that one...)\nFranziska von Karma profile\nGumshoe:\nYou're going down this time, pal!\nPhoenix:\nOh... Is that right?\nGumshoe:\nShe's been practicing 100 cracks a day, pal.\nPhoenix:\nCracks? Wait... You don't mean cracks of the...\nGumshoe:\nYep. Cracks of the WHIP!\nPhoenix:\nUhhh...\nAnything else\nGumshoe:\nYou know I can't tell you two anything about the evidence we have gathered!\nMaya:\nStingy!\nGumshoe:\n... Stingy!? When you put it so bluntly, it kinda hurts my feelings, pal...\nAfter clearing \"The eyewitness\" Talk option in Lodging House - Plaza:\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room\nPhoenix:\nI wonder whose room this is. (Changed from [This is it?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nThe nametag on the door says \"Moe\" on it.\nPhoenix:\nI guess he's not here...\nMaya:\nWow... It's a real mess in here!\nPhoenix:\n(My room's probably worse though...)\nMaya:\nOh well... I give up. We'll have to come back later.\nExamine\nCostumes\nPhoenix:\nAll those clown costumes lined up like that... I dunno about you, but it's creepy.\nMaya:\nLook at the collection he's got! It's incredible!\nPhoenix:\nIt must be a collection of clown costumes from around the world.\nMaya:\nOh! I almost forgot!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it now? (She better not want me to try one of those on!)\nMaya:\nI was thinking of starting a costume collection myself! I'll call it \"World Spirit Channels\"... We can display it in our office!\nPhoenix:\nIn OUR office!? As soon as you start paying the bills, you can say that.\nBoarded up cracks in ceiling\nPhoenix:\nLook at the ceiling... It looks like someone punched a hole in it!\nMaya:\nYou're right. I wonder what happened?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I don't even want to imagine what goes on in here.)\nCarrots\nMaya:\nWhat the!? There's a string of carrots here!\nPhoenix:\nHow strange. The carrots seem to come in all different shapes... Weird... I can't tell if Moe just likes carrots, or if he is using them for some sort of gag.\nWindow\nMaya:\nNick, you can see the scene of the crime from here.\nPhoenix:\n(You can even tell that the ground has been disturbed...)\nMaya:\nIt's right in front of this window, about 30 feet away.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it wouldn't have been strange for someone to have seen the crime from here.)\nPajamas\nPhoenix:\nMoe's got an excellent pair of pajamas... Laid on his bed in an excellent manner.\nMaya:\nWhat? Those are pajamas? You mean he goes to bed dressed as a clown? Eww...\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMoe seems to be a voracious reader. Look at all the hard books he has here. \"Clowns for Dummies\", \"The Joke's On You\", \"Treat Your Peons Right\", And the classic \"Funny Jokes Are Funny.\"\nMaya:\nWow. Moe is very studious.\nPhoenix:\n\"The Joke's On You\"... Huh?\nClown equipment\nMaya:\nTee hee... Clown equipment is so funny looking!\nPhoenix:\nHe's got a balancing ball, a unicycle... He's even got a trampoline!! ... But they're all broken.\nMaya:\nMaybe he was just a little too excited during practice?\nPhoenix:\n(Who knows with that guy. Maybe that's part of the gag?)\nShoes or banana peel\nMaya:\nAwesome! Look at these shoes! They're great!\nPhoenix:\nForget the shoes! Check out the great gag banana peel!\nMaya:\nYou sure it wasn't Moe's snack after lunch?\nPhoenix:\n(Are you blind? Look at how many scratches there are from people slipping on it!!)\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusBig Top\nPhoenix:\nThe circus stage sure doesn't look this small from out in the audience...\nMaya:\nWow... This is where they all perform, isn't it? Nick! Do some somersaults!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not doing any somersaults.\nMaya:\nWhy not!? You look like you'd be great at it!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I look like I'd be great at somersaults!?)\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...\nMaya:\nHuh? Nick?\nPhoenix:\nIt wasn't me.\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrrrr... Grawwwwwww!!\nMaya:\nT-T-T-T-T-T-T... TIGER!!\nPhoenix:\nH-H-H-He's c-c-coming this way!!\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrr... Grawwwwwww!!\nPhoenix:\nAHHHHHHHHHHH!!\nMaya:\nNick! You're too young to die! NICK!!\n???:\nSTAY! STAY! HEEL!\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrr...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm still here... I'm not dead, yet!!)\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Nick! Are you OK?\n???:\nAhahaha! Scared ya didn't I? Regent is such a cute tiger! Isn't he!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\n...\n???:\nWhat's the matter? You two sure are quiet.\nMaya:\nDon't \"What's the matter?\" me! N-Nick... He almost died there!!\n???:\nHah! He wasn't anywhere close to getting hurt, let alone dying! This little tiger hardly ever bites people. And besides, people normally never get to play with a wild tiger, right? So if you think about it, you're actually really lucky!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\n???:\nYou agree, don't you?\nPhoenix:\n... I guess...\nMaya:\nW-W-W-What do you mean you guess!? Why are you agreeing with her?\n???:\nWoohoo!! Your costume...\nMaya:\nEh?\n???:\nIt's cute. I wanna try it on!!\nMaya:\nC-Costume? You mean my clothes...?\n???:\nYou don't mind letting me try it on, right?\nMaya:\nUhh... I guess not...\n???:\nREALLY!? Hehehehehe!! You're the best!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... The tables turned quickly on that one. So much for the tiger thing...)\n???:\nOh! I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Regina Berry... The renowned animal tamer of the Berry Big Circus!\nMaya:\nMy name's Maya Fey. I'm a spirit medium.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix Wright. Attorney at law. (When you put us up next to an animal tamer, I bet we really look odd!)\nRegina:\nNice to meet ya!\nPhoenix:\nUhh... Likewise...\nExamine\nAudience wing\nMaya:\nThe seats are kinda far away don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nThey are, but it also means that lots of people can fit in the big top.\nRegina:\nHe's right. We can fit 500 people into a show.\nMaya:\nFive hundred... That's amazing.\nRegina:\nFlying around above that many people is a \"real rush\". At least that's what Max said.\n(Step)ladder\nMaya:\nAh, a ladder.\nPhoenix:\nIt's just a stepladder.\nMaya:\nWhat's the difference? They do the same thing, right? I think you should stick with the basic facts of the matter.\nPhoenix:\nOh... Uh... OK. (It's not even worth arguing with her on this one.)\nLion prop\nMaya:\nLook! That's where Max comes out during the show!!\nPhoenix:\nI've got to admit, that was a pretty cool effect!\nRegina:\nWe're planning for me to start coming out of the lion during the show.\nPhoenix:\nThat's great Regina!\nRegina:\nYeah. I will ride on Regent's back and jump out of the lion's mouth.\nMaya:\nI wanna try it too! I'll ride on Nick's back and jump out of the lion's mouth!\nPhoenix:\n(Sometimes I wonder about this girl...)\nBoxes\nPhoenix:\nThere doesn't seem to be anything here that can help us... Not a single clue.\nMaya:\nYou know I've been meaning to ask you... What exactly do you mean when you say \"clue\"? What are you looking for?\nPhoenix:\n... A bloody chainsaw for instance...\nMaya:\nWell there's definitely not one of those here...\nRope\nMaya:\nHey! It's a rope!\nPhoenix:\nProbably for tightrope walking...\nMaya:\nThat's a bit strange... There weren't any tightrope walkers in the show when we saw it.\nSpotlights\nMaya:\nWhoa! Those lights are huge!\nRegina:\nI love lights!! Whenever I appear under the spotlight, everyone claps for me!\nMaya:\nThat's because everyone knows that you're cute!\nRegina:\nNo... I'm not cute. You're cute!\nMaya:\nMe!?\nRegina:\nOf course! I'm sure you'd make an incredible heroine!\nMaya:\nReally!? You think so!? Nick! Did you hear that!? Me!! A heroine!! What about Nick, Regina?\nRegina:\n... Hmm... Nick...\nMaya:\nHe's no hero, is he?\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch... Thanks a lot Maya!)\nTalk\nWhat happened\nMaya:\nHey Regina... What do you know about what happened last night?\nRegina:\nYou mean the murder...?\nPhoenix:\nUh huh.\nRegina:\nMy dad was murdered.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I see... (Wait! What did she just say!?) (Changed from [I can't imagine how hard this must be for you... (Urk! That was insensitive!)] in the original release)\nMaya:\nSo... the Ringmaster was your... (Changed from [That's right! The Ringmaster was your...] in the original release)\nRegina:\nYep. The Ringmaster was my dad.\nMaya:\nI'm so sorry about what happened to him...\nRegina:\nWhy do you say you're sorry?\nMaya:\nHuh? (Changed from [Eh?] in the original release)\nRegina:\nAnyways... Everyone was here practicing last night.\nPhoenix:\nEven your dad?\nRegina:\nYes. Everyone was here. We finished up around 10 PM. After that, everyone went off on their own. I was the only one who stayed around here.\nMaya:\nWhy did you do that?\nRegina:\nI was playing with Regent.\nPhoenix:\n(Regent... So she was with that beast...)\nRegina:\nThat's when the police showed up. When they took me to check things out, Dad was dead.\nPhoenix:\n(For someone whose father was just murdered, she seems awfully perky... (Changed from For someone who's [sic] father was just murdered, she seems awfully perky...] in the original release) I wish she would tell us more about her dad...)\nRegina\nMaya:\nThat's incredible that you are an animal tamer!\nRegina:\nIf you say so...\nMaya:\nIt has to be really scary!\nRegina:\nScary? Why?\nMaya:\nHuh?\nRegina:\nRegent isn't scary! He's cute! Ever since Léon died, Regent has been my best friend.\nPhoenix:\nLéon?\nRegina:\nYes. Léon the lion.\nPhoenix:\n(Léon the lion... Regent and Regina... Interesting name choices...)\nMaya:\nLéon... He died?\nRegina:\nYes. Actually he was killed. My dad killed him.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nMaya:\nWhy did he do that?\nRegina:\nI'm not sure why he did it.\nPhoenix:\n(It's tough not to get charmed when she looks at you with those innocent eyes...)\n\"What's on your mind?\" (appears after presenting Max profile)\nMaya:\nRegina... What's the matter? What's on your mind?\nRegina:\n*giggle* I'll tell you Maya... But just you.\nPhoenix:\nAh!\nRegina:\nUmm... Well... *mumble* *mumble*\nMaya:\nWhat!? REALLY!?!?\nRegina:\nAnd then... *mumble* *mumble*\nMaya:\nOh my! That's incredible Regina!!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nC'mon Nick. There's no reason to pout!\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry about me...\nMaya:\nRegina told me that someone professed their love to her!\nPhoenix:\nP-P-P-Professed their love!?\nMaya:\nNot only that! It was Maximillion Galactica!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder how many people have stolen one of his hearts anyways...?)\nMaya:\nAnd then, on the exact same day, another person professed their love for her as well!!\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Who was it!?\nMaya:\nSomeone named Trilo.\nPhoenix:\nTrilo...?\nMaya:\nApparently he is a tenor who sings in the circus.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Haven't met him yet.)\nMaya:\nRegina seems to be quite the hit with the men in the circus!\nPhoenix:\nShe must have some sort of strange power over them!\nMaya:\nYou're not kidding. Two people in one day! Even I want to profess my love for her!\nPhoenix:\n(Me too! She's so cute...)\nRegina:\n*giggle*\nPresent\nSilk Hat\nRegina:\nThis silk hat is Max's.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right.\nRegina:\nIt's beautiful isn't it? I thought up the idea for wearing the hat.\nMaya:\nHuh? Really?\nRegina:\nYep. He took my sketch to the hat shop... And they made a custom hat for him based off the sketch. There is only one of these silk hats in the entire world! Isn't that cool?\nMaya Fey profile\nRegina:\nMaya... You're a spirit channeler?\nMaya:\nYep! I'm still training though.\nRegina:\nThat sounds like fun! I think you should join us at the circus!\nMaya:\nHuh? As a spirit channeler?\nRegina:\nYeah! You'd be a big hit!\nMaya:\nReally!? She says I'd be a big hit!\nPhoenix:\n(I think she's just being nice.)\nMax profile\nRegina:\nIt's Max!! Hey... Where is Max now anyways?\nPhoenix:\nY-You don't know?\nRegina:\nNope.\nPhoenix:\nHe's been arrested. He was charged with the murder of your father.\nMaya:\nIt's OK! Nick and I will help him!\nRegina:\nMax isn't the guy, is he? I mean... The criminal?\nPhoenix:\nOf course he's not!\nRegina:\nI'm worried about so many things right now...\nMaya:\nHmm... Like what?\nRegina:\n*giggle*\nFranziska von Karma profile\nRegina:\nCool! This lady's got a whip! She's an animal tamer, huh?\nMaya:\nHmm... Sort of...\nPhoenix:\n(Two women with whips... That's my cue to shut up and act like a good boy...)\nRegina Berry profile\nRegina:\nAlright! I look so cute in this picture! Don't you think I look cute? Don't ya? Don't ya?\nMaya:\nYou sure do!\nPhoenix:\nNo objections here!\nRussell Berry profile\nRegina:\nAfter practice was over, Dad went right back to his room.\nMaya:\nHis room?\nRegina:\nYes. That door right over there leads to the Ringmaster's room.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nRegina:\nI dunno why, but he went off to his room in a hurry. I wonder what happened?\nPhoenix:\n(The Ringmaster's room... It's probably a good idea to check it out for myself.)\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this? What can you tell me?\nRegina:\nUmm... I'm not really good at figuring out hard things.\nMaya:\nReally? You too? I understand exactly what you mean...\nPhoenix:\n(I never expected Maya to make a new friend in a strange place like this...)\nAny other profiles\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this person?\nRegina:\nSorry...\nPhoenix:\nSorry?\nRegina:\nI've already given my heart to another man. So I'm not interested in enrolling in your dating service.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I just wanted to know if you knew this person.\nDetention Center\nPresent\nSilk Hat\nMax:\nAhh! This is my silk hat! It's the only one of its kind in the world. It's one of my most prized possessions. This silk hat proves that I was somewhere else... Where did they find this? Huh, sweetie?\nPhoenix:\nThey found it at the murder scene.\nMax:\nAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! I... I... I don't know nothing about nothing!\nMaya:\nEww... Max is so pathetic like this...\nPhoenix:\n(Max must be really confused...)\nCrime Photo\nMax:\nThat's... That's the Ringmaster. ... It's a shame what happened... He was going to be like a father to me...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nRegina Berry profile\nMax:\nAhhh... My sweetie pie. She must be really lonely with me all cooped up in here.\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, she was laughing and rolling around with her tiger...)\nMax:\nShe is my special someone. And I am her special someone.\nMaya:\nUh-huh... Very complex...\nAny other profiles\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this person?\nMax:\nUnfortunately I don't take on apprentices. I mean, just look at the face on this one... It's not what I'd call fabulous.\nPhoenix:\n(That's awfully harsh...)\nAfter clearing \"Something unusual\" and \"The eyewitness\" Talk options in Lodging House - Plaza, and visiting Big Top:\nDecember 28Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\n... Max isn't here.\nPhoenix:\nHe must be in questioning.\nMaya:\nAww... I wanted to see a magic trick.\nPhoenix:\nHe should be back in a little bit.\nMaya:\nI guess so.\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera.\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. I wonder if he is bored? He doesn't even try to glance over this way...\nLodging House - Plaza\nPresent\nAny other profile\nGumshoe:\nI've gotten affidavits from most of the performers at this circus. They are certainly a strange bunch of characters.\nMaya:\nYou don't say?\nGumshoe:\nWell, not stranger than you I suppose.\nMaya:\n... That was cold...\nGumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry. I was just messing around.\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nSilk Hat\nMaya:\nThis silk hat really does look like it can fly!!\nPhoenix:\nIt does have a feather on it. Maybe that's why you think it can take off.\nMaya:\nYou're right! Nick, I bet you could wear a hat like this! This is like one of those hats a famous detective would wear!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I guess so...\nMaya:\nBut... With a head as big as yours, you'd probably bust a hole in the* ([sic]) it!\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPhoenix:\nNo matter what the crime, we always meet the same detective at the scene.\nMaya:\nSometimes it seems like he's the only detective on the force. That would make Gumshoe really elite, wouldn't it?\nPhoenix:\n(Something tells me that no matter how you look at it, he's anything but elite...)\nFranziska von Karma profile\nMaya:\nYou know, if she wasn't so mean, I think she and I would get along...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but that's the problem... She is so mean. And that whip... That thing hurts. It really hurts.\nMaya:\nIt is kinda cool though. I wouldn't mind having a whip myself. I bet that cracking the whip on you once or twice would be just what the doctor ordered!\nPhoenix:\nW-Why me!? W-What did I do!?\nRegina Berry profile\nMaya:\nRegina is sooo cute!\nPhoenix:\nI have to admit that her smile does have a sort of hypnotic power.\nMaya:\nCan you believe that she's an animal tamer? That's sooo cool! I'd like to try animal taming someday. Nick! Nick! Lie down! Roll over!!\nPhoenix:\nOnce this case is solved, I'll roll over for you as many times as you want!\nMaya:\nYAY!!! Remember, you promised, Nick!\nRussell Berry profile\nMaya:\nEveryone loved the Ringmaster...\nPhoenix:\nSo I'm told. Why would anyone want to kill such a beloved man of the big top?\nMaya:\nMotive will surely be a point of contention tomorrow in court.\nPhoenix:\n(You can count on that...)\nAfter presenting Russell Berry profile in Berry Big Circus - Big Top:\nDecember 28Big TopRingmaster's Room\nMaya:\nThis was the Ringmaster's room?\nPhoenix:\nYes. This room belonged to the victim. Which means this must be where Max met the Ringmaster last night.\nMaya:\nNow that you mention it, that is what he said.\nPhoenix:\nI wonder what... Hmm... That's an interesting poster. (Changed from [I wonder what... Hmm... That's an intresting [sic] poster.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nAh! It's a poster of Max! I want it! I want it! Nick! I want it!\nPhoenix:\nI wanna get outta here...\nExamine\nPhotos\nMaya:\nNick... Look at all the photos lined up on the wall...\nPhoenix:\nIt's like a guided tour of the circus' history.\nMaya:\nThis is so cool! It seems like there were so many happy memories. Maybe we should do this sort of thing at our office? We can put up pictures of all the clients who have been found not guilty.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what if we had a client who was found guilty? (Changed from [What about the clients who were found guilty?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nUmm... We'll just pretend like they don't exist. How's that? ... Nick! Now you've got me thinking about losing cases! Why'd you do that!?\nFrames\nMaya:\nAll of these frames look the same.\nPhoenix:\nThey almost look like... Thank You cards. It looks like every year the Ringmaster made donations to charity... To the Robot Clown Research Center...\nMaya:\n... You're kidding right?\nPhoenix:\nWhat!? They may be a perfectly reputable charity in the field of advanced tomfoolery!\nTrophy case\nMaya:\nNick! Look at all the cute trophies!!\nPhoenix:\nIndeed. Just look at all the awards this circus has won...\nMaya:\nLike... \"All County Quiz Champions\"... \"Ringmaster's Association Mini Golf Master\"... \"Beer Belly Balloon Bounce Champ\"... \"Pet Grooming Grand Prix\"... Wow. The Ringmaster was multi-talented in ways I could have never imagined...\nPosters\nMaya:\nThere's a lot of posters here don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nThere are indeed.\nMaya:\nSo many posters that they aren't likely to miss one, are they?\nPhoenix:\nMaya... We're supposed to be the honest ones around here.\nMaya:\nBut... But... You didn't even notice that I took one!\nPhoenix:\n(Arghhh... She already swiped one!)\nMaya:\nHeh! Heh!\nPhoenix:\nYou're incorrigible, you know that?\nMax G. Promo Poster added to the Court Record.\nPosters (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nLook at all the stars on this poster... This must have been the poster they used to promote their public appearances.\nMaya:\nPosters are the way to go aren't they?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nMaya:\nWe should make posters to promote our law firm. \"Spine tingling legal action! Mind numbing legalese! You will say 'wow'!\" Or perhaps, \"Hold it! Don't miss out on a stunning life or death courtroom thrill ride!\"\nPhoenix:\nWith those taglines, our law firm would sink faster than the Titanic...\nTailcoat\nMaya:\nYou may not know this, but they call this a \"tailcoat\".\nPhoenix:\nAnd they call this \"the face of someone who already knew that...\" Hmm...\nMaya:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nA scrap of white paper is sticking out of the coat pocket.\nMaya:\nHuh? Where? Where?\nPhoenix:\nCalm down, Maya. You can't just go rummaging through people's coats!\nMaya:\nAhhh... You always make me feel like I'm doing something wrong...\nMirror\nMaya:\nThis is where the Ringmaster applied his makeup.\nPhoenix:\nIt's quite a collection of the most understated colors. Shocking Pink for example.\nMaya:\nThis one says it is \"100% All Natural Organic Mascara.\"\nPhoenix:\nAnd this one says \"Sensitive enough for a baby, strong enough for a mime.\"\nMaya:\nThe Ringmaster must have been really concerned about skin care... Very metrosexual.\nDesk\nMaya:\nThis is strange... Everything else looks nice, but this desk looks old and cheap.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a really big photo on the desk... It's a picture of Regina and her father, the Ringmaster.\nMaya:\nHe really loved her didn't he? Regina was lucky to have such a wonderful father.\nTable\nPhoenix:\nIt's a table for guests... There are some papers scattered on top.\nMaya:\nAh! Look at this! Max's salary is written on this piece of paper. YIKES!\nPhoenix:\nW-What is it?\nMaya:\nI didn't know that a magician... This salary is incredible!\nPhoenix:\n(She looks like she's about ready to pass out from shock...) How much is it!? How much is it!? T-T-THAT MUCH!?\nMaya:\nIncredible, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYou can say that again. (This must be the paper they used to negotiate Max's salary... The Ringmaster signed and dated it...)\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nMax definitely got a raise... But this document is dated a week ago!\nRingmaster's Papers added to the Court Record.\nTable (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis was the table he used when visitors came to see him.\nMaya:\nEww... There's mud caked on the table.\nPhoenix:\nSomeone with terrible manners must have put their shoes up on the table!\nMaya:\nNick! Don't even think about it!\nPhoenix:\nI wasn't!

Hey Nick! Look over there!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nThere's someone over there! Ex-Excuse me!\n???:\n...\nPhoenix:\nHello.\n???:\n...\nMaya:\nWow! He sure is a quiet one! Excuse me!!\n???:\nWha... Ha... Huh? M-Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. You work at the circus don't you?\n???:\nN-No. I'm just your everyday average Joe.\nMaya:\nAn average Joe who just happens to hang out at the circus? I don't think so.\n???:\nY-Yes I am. I've got nothing to do with what's going on here.\nPhoenix:\n(He's lying. Like any regular person would hang around the circus... Dressed like that!) I'm an attorney. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\nI'm a spirit medium. My name is Maya.\n???:\nWell... I... Um... Just happened to be... Umm... Passing by...\nPhoenix:\nI don't suppose you happen to be some kind of carny?\n???:\nNot a c-c-carny... I-I'm a p-performer. Actually, I'm a v-v-v-ventriloquist.\nMaya:\nVentriloquist?\n???:\nHe-he-he-he-he-he-he... I-I-I'm Benjamin Wo-Wo-Wo-Woodman...\nMaya:\nYour last name is Woodman? *snicker* (Changed from [You're [sic] last name is Woodman? *snicker*] in the original release)\n???:\nY-Yes... T-T-That's right... But e-everyone c-c-calls me B-B-B-B-B-Ben.\nMaya:\nAh... Yes yes yes... That's your alias, right?\nPhoenix:\nI believe they call it a stage name.\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, Ben?\nBen:\nUh... Yes? You mean... Me?\nPhoenix:\nAbout the murder. I'd like to talk to you about the details, if I may.\nBen:\nR-Really... I'm just a regular normal guy... I don't k-k-now...

Maximillion Galactica.\nBen:\nMa-Ma-Ma-Max? H-H-H-He's... N-N-N-Not... V-Very... N-N-Nice.\nPhoenix:\n(Did he just say that Max is \"Not Very Nice\"?)\nBen:\nO... O... O... Oww... My... H-H-Head...

Promo Poster\nMaya:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the matter, Maya?\nMaya:\nWhich poster is cooler? This one or the Steel Samurai poster?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not a big fan of either one of them.\nMaya:\nI guess putting a poster of a magician in a law office is kinda strange.\nPhoenix:\n(No stranger than a poster of a hunk of junk carrying around a spear!)\nRingmaster's Papers\nMaya:\nLooking at this really makes you think.\nPhoenix:\nLike what?\nMaya:\nNo matter how great a medium I become, there is no way I could make this kind of money.\nPhoenix:\nSo it's money you're after?\nMaya:\nYou only live once, right? Well, then you might as well live it fabulously!\nBen profile\nMaya:\nBeing a ventriloquist sounds like an interesting job.\nPhoenix:\nI bet it's fun once you get good at it.\nMaya:\nMaybe I should give it a try then! Here I go! \"Hello e-e-everyone... I-I-I'm Phoenix Wright.\" \"No matter what the lie or who the liar, I'll expose them for what they are!\" What's the verdict?\nPhoenix:\nYou might want to practice not moving your lips so much.\nMaya:\nY-Yeah...

CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'RE THE BIG WEINER! The one millionth visitor to the room of one Mr. Moe Curls, AKA ME!!\nPhoenix:\n(Earplugs... Must... Find... Earplugs...)\nMoe:\nTo celebrate this momentous occasion, would you care for an organic grape? Just one! Did you get my joke right there!? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMoe:\nI welched on giving you more than one!!\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nMoe:\nNo no no! If it was funny, it is your duty as a human being to laugh!! People who don't laugh are usually last-seen in Lan-sing. Catch my drift? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Maya?\nMaya:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n(This is like some Faustian nightmare...)\nMaya:\nC'mon! It was funny! Clowns are always funny in my book!\nPhoenix:\nIn my book, they're just funny lookin'.\nMoe:\nYou sure do have a great taste in clothes girlie! Look at that garb! You look just like Gretta Garb... OH! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* I'm goin' home...\nMaya:\nNo! Nick! You can't!!\nPhoenix:\nYou know, I can excuse a bad joke or two... But this stooge keeps laughing at his own jokes! That's what I object to!\nMaya:\nOK OK... I get it. But you have to admit he is kinda funny...\nPhoenix:\n(Argghhh... No, I do not have to admit that, because he isn't!)\nMoe:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nExamine\nCostumes\nMoe:\nI look awfully snazzy in these costumes.\nMaya:\nUmm... Did you just use the word \"snazzy\" in a sentence?\nMoe:\nI sure did. These are haute couture from the best international clown designers. At least, that's what they said on the TV shopping channel I use... I like having a big collection so I can match my costume to my mood... And my carrot.\nMaya:\nHehe...\nMoe:\nYou know, I only own one T-shirt. The rest are all clown costumes!\nPhoenix:\n(Snazzy dresser!? More like spazzy dresser if you ask me!)\nBoarded up cracks in ceiling\nMaya:\nThere's a hole in the ceiling... Why is there a hole in the ceiling?\nMoe:\nWell... Umm... I was riding a pogo stick, and I guess I just overdid it a little...\nMaya:\n\"Overdid it a little\"...?\nMoe:\nWhat can I say, sometimes things get a bit crazy in one's college days...\nMaya:\nHuh?\nCarrots\nMoe:\nCarrots are one of my trademark props.\nMaya:\nYep! I saw you use them! You must believe in a carrot and no stick approach. You put the carrot out in front for motivation, but I guess the trick is gauging what flavor you want each day...\nMoe:\nExactly! You were really paying attention, weren't you!? You know, I eat about 5 of those carrots every single day. If you eat that many, you've gotta change up the taste every now and again.\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't understand any of that, nor do I ever want to.)\nPajamas\nPhoenix:\nMoe, you've got quite the collection of pajamas... They really scream out to you.\nMoe:\nYou think they're loud, huh? I kinda thought they were refined... You know, a bit too adult for me to use on stage... That's why I used them as pajamas.\nPhoenix:\n(Wait a second... He sleeps in clown costumes!?)\nDesk\nMoe:\nTake a look at my desk. Aren't I the most studious clown you've ever seen? Every free moment I have, I spend it studying or reading.\nPhoenix:\nThe classic \"Pull My Finger\" or \"Clown Car Maintenance and Repair\".. Not to mention the bestseller \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Pierrots\"...\nMaya:\nUmm... They all seem to cover rather basic topics though...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he is just trying to cover all of his bases?\nMoe:\nExactly! I want to be a renaissance clown!\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad he didn't buy \"How To Be A Funny Clown\"...)\nClown equipment\nMoe:\nUs clowns really take our work seriously. I try to hone my craft day and night, with the latest in jester technology. Unicycles. Trampolines. Balancing Balls. Accordions.\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like you've put quite a bit of wear and tear on that equipment...\nMoe:\nWell... The theme of my act as a clown is... \"How many ways can a fat funny guy fall down?\" I don't care what I break or how I break it, as long as it ends with me on my bum!! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nShoes or banana peel\nMaya:\nWhat's this? A banana peel? *slips*\nMoe:\nOh my! Oh my! What a wonderful fall girlie! You should remember that when you see a banana peel, get ready to fall down! That is one of the basic tenants of clownsmanship.\nMaya:\nOw ow ow ow ow...\nMoe:\nEvery night, I fall down 100 times to practice the proper banana peel breakfall. WHOA! *slip* WHOA! *slip* WHOA! *slip*\nMaya:\nWow. He really is a pro, huh Nick!? His falls are totally different than my slip!\nTalk\nBerry Big Circus\nMaya:\nCould you please tell us more about the Berry Big Circus?\nMoe:\nIt's a Berry Big story... You sure you got that kind of time?\nPhoenix:\n(And the hits just keep on comin'... *sigh*)\nMoe:\nThis circus has been in business for 20 years. We all performed under the guidance of the Ringmaster, Russell Berry.\nMaya:\nTwenty years!? Wow!\nMoe:\nWorking in the circus is never easy, especially nowadays... With movies, TV, and bowling, there is just too much competition.\nMaya:\nBut... But... I LOVE THE CIRCUS!\nMoe:\nI love it too... That is why I've been here for 20 years. We work hard to keep the show running. No one sends in the clowns on us!\nMaya:\nNick! He just made a joke! Laugh!!\nPhoenix:\nHar! Har! Har! Har! Har! Har!\nMoe:\nThe Ringmaster was a real big shot in the circus world. A real class act. Even when there were no customers, Russell would use his own money to pay me. Because he knew that I had a family to care for... He was happy to take care of his employees.\nMaya:\nI see...\nMoe:\nHow could anyone do that to such a wonderful man...!?\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMoe...\nMoe:\nWiggidty-wiggidty-wiggidty WHAT?\nPhoenix:\nUgh...\nMaya:\nI'm sorry Moe. Nick was born without a sense of humor.\nMoe:\nDon't worry about it... How can you fault someone for being born that way?\nPhoenix:\nLet's talk about the murder.\nMoe:\nAhh... Let's see... It must've taken place around 10 PM last night. After rehearsals were finished, I was tuckered out, so I came back here. After I went to bed... That's when I caught a peek of it...\nMaya:\n\"Caught a peek...?\"\nMoe:\nOf the crime.\nPhoenix:\n(Just as we suspected... (Changed from [So this is what Detective Gumshoe was talking about...] in the original release) This guy's the eyewitness to the crime! (Changed from [Moe was the eyewitness to the crime!] in the original release))\nRussell Berry (appears after \"Berry Big Circus\")\nMoe:\nThe Ringmaster was truly ahead of his time. He would always add new elements to the show.\nMaya:\nNew elements...?\nMoe:\nWhen you've been a performer for a long time, your act starts getting a bit stale.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nMoe:\nI realize that even my act can get a bit long in the tooth... Sometimes my jokes can be a bit... Umm... Old-fashion.\nPhoenix:\n\"A bit long in the tooth?\"\nMoe:\nBut that make-believer takes things too far!!\nMaya:\nMake-believer?\nMoe:\nThe magician!! The one that thinks he's all high and mighty!! He had the gall to say to me, \"You're one of those funny types, right?\" What does he mean \"one of those\"!? Well the joke's on him now...\nPhoenix:\nOn him...?\nMoe:\nYep! He got on everyone's nerves!! The day of the murder... ...\nPhoenix:\nGo ahead.\nMoe:\nNope. No way! Just forget I said anything!\nPhoenix:\n(I bet he's still hiding something about Max...)\nWhat you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nYou say you saw the crime. Do you mind telling me what you saw?\nMoe:\nWell, the police told me that I can't share my story with others. \"Don't say a word, pal!!\" I'm just gonna have to let these lips stay zipped! (Changed from ['Don't say a word!!' I'm just gonna have to let these lips stay zipped!] in the original release)\nMaya:\nThat's not fair!\nMoe:\nI guess you're right... Maybe I can tell you a few details. But only if you can get old stiff lips here to make with the funny...!\nPhoenix:\nStiff lips? Wait... Do you mean me?\nMaya:\nNick! You can do it!!\nPhoenix:\n*achem* *achem*\nMoe:\nWhat's the matter?\nPhoenix:\nJust getting ready. OK... Do you know why I, Phoenix Wright, am a great lawyer? Because I'm Wright all the time!!\nMaya:\n...\nMoe:\n...\nMaya:\nAt least his expectations are low.\nMoe:\nI wouldn't let him quit his day job.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeesh, cut a guy some slack. At least it was funnier than Chuckles over here.)\nMoe:\nIt wasn't the greatest joke I've heard, but you did try, so I'll tell you what I saw.\nMaya:\nI'm sorry he's incapable of being funny, Moe.\nMoe:\nThat night... Once I had tucked myself into bed, I heard this amazing noise. It was incredibly loud. It sounded like a giant \"THUMP\"! Once I heard it, I jumped out of bed. That's when I saw... Without question. Without a doubt. It was that magician!! That's all I saw... But it just proves how terrible that man actually is!\nPhoenix:\n(He knows more about Max than he is letting on...)\nPresent\nCrime Photo\nMoe:\nRUSSELL!! How could anyone do this to you... I... I... *sobs*\nMaya:\nMoe's taking this really hard...\nSilk Hat\nMoe:\nIt's that uppity faker's uppity top hat! They found this at the scene of the crime, didn't they?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what I've been told...\nMoe:\nUnbelievable. That jerk killed the Ringmaster!\nMaya:\nIt really is a shame what happened to the Ringmaster, huh Moe?\nPhoenix:\nIt seems that the Ringmaster was truly a great man...\nMax profile\nMoe:\nHmph! If he thinks he can kill the Ringmaster, it's only just that he should die, too!\nMaya:\nMoe!!\nMoe:\nSorry. I crossed the line. But he truly is a disgusting human being.\nMaya:\nWhy do you hate him so much?\nMoe:\nLet me tell you this one story... The morning before the murder, something terrible happened. Max clonked Ben right over the head, as hard as he could.\nPhoenix:\nBen? (The ventriloquist with the speech impediment?)\nMoe:\nYou should go to the cafeteria and investigate for yourselves.\nMaya:\nThe cafeteria?\nMoe:\nLet's just say there's Gotti be something interesting there... Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Ahh yes... The Berry Big Circus is very big, isn't it? You should always carry a map with you to get around...\nMaya:\nAh! Thank you!! Umm... This is an atlas!!\nMoe:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Oh... I kill myself. Really. I'm dying here... CORONARY!

Cuter than a little puppy Maltese, that Regina. If only my Larina was that cute...\nMaya:\nLarina?\nMoe:\nAh... Larina is my daughter. She lives with her mother now.\nPhoenix:\n(It's true what they say about the tears of a clown...)\nRussell Berry profile\nMoe:\nI've been friends with Russell since even before the circus began. He was so selfless. He always thought about others before thinking of himself. I'll find a way to return the favor... He always took such good care of me. I wish I would have thanked him more than I did...\nBen profile\nMoe:\nAh, Ben... How's he doing?\nPhoenix:\nHe's a ventriloquist isn't he?\nMoe:\nThat's right! Boy was I surprised when they told me his secret! He's got a second mouth where his belly button should be!! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Just kidding...\nPhoenix:\nBen wouldn't tell me a single thing about the murder.\nMoe:\nAhh... That's a simple problem to solve. He won't talk if he doesn't have his puppet Trilo!\nMaya:\nTrilo...?\nMoe:\nIf Ben doesn't have his ventriloquist's puppet, you'll barely get a word outta him.\nMaya:\nReally?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Master and puppet...)\nMoe profile\nMoe:\nAh!\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter?\nMoe:\nWhenever I see my own pose, I am reminded of my Italian heritage...\nMaya:\nAhhhh... I see... It must be because you have one of those \"Roman Noses\"... Roamin' all over your face.\nMoe:\n...!!\nMaya:\n... I didn't cross the line there did I?\nPhoenix:\nYou went so far past it, you'll need a map to get back!\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this? Anything come to mind?\nMoe:\nAhh... You want some advice on your development as a comedian, right? I see... Well... This is what you do... When you tell a joke, imagine everyone's wearing underwear and dancing the lambada...\nPhoenix:\nUmm... I think that's enough advice for now...\nMaya:\nNick! He was giving you good advice! Don't be so close-minded!!\nAny other profiles\nMoe:\nThis isn't very funny... How am I supposed to know about people who aren't in the circus!?\nWright & Co.

It definitely made me look at things in a new light.\nMaya:\nAnd he's got such a great sense of humor. It tickles your funny bone, doesn't it?\nPhoenix:\n(Well... I can't argue that some people might find it funny... But the only thing it tickles on me is my desire for high quality earplugs...)\nBig Top\nPresent\nMoe profile\nRegina:\nThat's Moe! He's such a funny clown! He's been a good friend to my dad for a really long time now.\nMaya:\nHe was good friends with the Ringmaster?\nRegina:\nMy dad always said... \"When it comes to who I can entrust the circus to, it's definitely Moe.\"\nMaya:\nHmm... Yep! That clown is one lovable stooge. Don't you think so, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... No comment...\nAfter presenting Max profile in Lodging Hall 1st Floor - Moe's Room:\nDecember 28Big TopCafeteria\nMaya:\nEww... This place is gross.\nPhoenix:\nThis must be because of last night. They didn't have time to clean up after dinner because of the murder.\nMaya:\nThat reminds me... What was it that Moe said?\nPhoenix:\nHe said that yesterday morning Max \"clonked\" Ben over the head here.\nMaya:\nHe also said that, \"There's Gotti be something interesting there.\" Nick? What's \"Gotti be interesting?\"\nPhoenix:\nDon't ask...\nMaya:\nHmph!\nExamine\nKitchen\nPhoenix:\nThe kitchen is over here. Everyone must have taken turns cooking. There's a duty list posted here.\nMaya:\nI wouldn't mind trying my hand at cooking for this many people. Maya's Killer Hamburger... You'd try it, wouldn't you?\nNotice\nMaya:\n\"Keep Our Cafeteria Clean!\"\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't seem like anyone ever read this sign, huh?\nMaya:\nMaybe they should make it easier to understand... \"Clean it or die!\"\nPhoenix:\nWell, that would definitely make them clean up!\nBulletin board\nPhoenix:\nAh, a bulletin board... For... Umm... Bulletins. It doesn't look like there are any useful clues posted here.\nMaya:\nBoring... Maybe we should leave a juicy tidbit for someone to read!\nPhoenix:\nJuicy?\nMaya:\nYou know... Like a fake clue! Hmm... Maybe something like... \"Message from the Killer!\"\nPhoenix:\nGive it up Maya... You know Gumshoe would take it all seriously.\nStand\nPhoenix:\nThis is strange... There's nothing on top of this stand.\nMaya:\nLook here... Max is written on it. It must be his VIP table.\nPhoenix:\nIsn't a bit small to be a VIP table? You won't be putting a ten course meal on this.\nMaya:\nWell, he could still eat hamburgers, right?\nBack table\nPhoenix:\nThere are dirty dishes all over the place... It must have been too hectic last night to clean up.\nMaya:\nYou know I can't stand a mess Nick! I think you and I should clean this place up for them!\nPhoenix:\nW-Why do we have to clean up...!?\nMaya:\nOne, because I hate dirty cafeterias. Two, because one bears repeating.\nPhoenix:\nB-But... This is a crime scene! We can't clean it up! We have to preserve it for evidence!!\nMaya:\nArrrggghh... You know I really hate dirty cafeterias!!\nPhoenix:\n(Not as much as I hate cleaning dirty cafeterias!)\nDining tables\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like they've left it exactly as it was on the night of the murder.\nMaya:\nThey didn't seem too worried about cleaning up the dishes, did they? Hmm... Looking at all these dishes is making me hungry! Let's go get a burger at the snack stand outside.\nPhoenix:\nOnce we're finished with the case.\nMaya:\n... Alright! Then let's get this over with Nick!! Here we go!! Whoahh!\nPhoenix:\n(Where's the mute button when you need it?)\nKnocked over chairs\nPhoenix:\nThe chair's been knocked over.\nMaya:\nThat's what it looks like.\nPhoenix:\nIt almost looks as if someone knocked it over in a struggle, or used it for self defense...\nMaya:\nOr maybe Regent just likes to eat his dinner in the cafeteria?\nSmashed bottle\nPhoenix:\n(What's this? ...Must be a juice bottle or something?)\nMaya:\nAhhh...

I mean fabulous!\nPhoenix:\nThat's why we came to meet with you again.\nMax:\nWh-Wh-What's w-w-wrong!? Quit making such a scary face!\nPhoenix:\nOK then Max... Let's make this \"absolutely fabulous\"!!\nTalk\nMax Galactica\nMaya:\nWe heard a lot about you at the circus, Max.\nMax:\nAhhh, you just mean from the dinosaurs? How were those Jurassic geriatrics?\nMaya:\nMax, you aren't very popular with the other performers, are you?\nMax:\nYes yes yes. Sweetie, that's what they call jealousy. J-E-A-L-O-U-S-Y. They are absolutely jealous of my absolutely fabulous self! People who really understand can see the obvious differences between us.\nPhoenix:\nPeople who really understand?\nMax:\nFor instance, my sweetie pie.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, so Regina understands him huh?)\nMax:\nI plan on getting married to her. She is truly my sweetie pie princess.\nMaya:\nWow! That's so cool!\nMax:\nIt's already in the works.\nMaya:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(That's strange. Regina never said anything about marrying this joker...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nYou met with the Ringmaster on the night of the murder?\nMax:\nYes. I was with him around 10 PM. Once I was done with practice. I went to his room right after we finished.\nMaya:\nThey found the Ringmaster's body in the plaza in front of the lodging house.\nMax:\nYeah, I head* ([sic]) about that... He needed to step out for a bit, so I waited in his room for him to return.\nMaya:\n...Huh?\nRussell:\n\"Sorry Max. I have something I must attend to right now. Do you mind waiting for me right here?\"\nMax:\n\"It's pretty cold outside. Where's your coat?\"\nRussell:\n\"It's alright. I'll be right back. It should only take about 10 minutes.\"\nPhoenix:\nAnd then?\nMax:\nI waited for him. But he never came back...\nPhoenix:\nDid he go to the plaza where the body was discovered?\nMax:\nPossibly. The snow had tapered off a bit, but it was still very cold outside. But I have no idea what he went off to do...\nMeeting with Russell (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nMax:\nThe truth is... Yesterday morning during breakfast, we had a run in.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you had a fight with Ben the ventriloquist?\nMax:\nYou could put it that way.\nMaya:\nWhy did you fight with him? Ben seems like such a quiet man.\nMax:\nWe fought about my sweetie pie.\nMaya:\nYou mean Regina?\nMax:\nThat ill-bred creep told my sweetie pie princess that he was in love with her! Would you put up with that?\nMaya:\n\"Ill-bred\"!! Are you talking about the same Ben!?\nPhoenix:\n\"Told her he was in love with her\"!! Are you sure this is the Ben we are talking about!?\nMax:\nAll I can say is that he made me mad and I had to tap him on his hard head! That's when the Ringmaster called me and I realized that it was my chance!\nPhoenix:\nYour chance?\nMax:\nThat's when I went to his room and I laid it all out on the table. I asked him to \"Let me marry my sweetie pie!\"\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nMax:\nThe Ringmaster told me that it \"sounds good to me!\" That's why my sweetie pie is MY sweetie pie! And no one else's!\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I see...\nMax:\nSince Ben was causing me so much trouble, I realized I had to shut him up.\nPhoenix:\n(...Shut him up?)\n\"Shut him up\" (appears after \"Meeting with Russell\")\nMaya:\nUm... What do you mean by \"shut him up\"?\nMax:\nYou don't know, do you my sweeties? Trilo can't say a word... Not without Ben. (Changed from [Unless Ben and Trilo are together, Trilo can't say a word.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nTrilo...?\nMax:\nThe puppet. The ventriloquist's puppet. His real name is Trilo Quist.\nPhoenix:\nBut... A puppet doesn't talk.\nMax:\nI know! That's why I hid it! Before the police came and took me away of course... If that puppet started flapping off at the balsa, I'd be screwed.\nMaya:\nYou hid him? You mean the ventriloquist's puppet?\nMax:\nYou are so smart sweetie!\nMaya:\nUmm... Where did you hide him?\nMax:\nWhat? Sweetie... You aren't thinking of trying to add him to my defense are you?\nMaya:\nWell... Ben does seem awfully lonely without his puppet.\nMax:\nFABULOUS! That should have taught him a lesson! OK... I hid Trilo in the Ringmaster's room. You don't mind going there and getting Trilo for me, do you my sweets?\nMaya:\nNo problem! None at all! Thank you Max!!\nMax:\nYou know I can't stand to see my sweeties in a jam!\nPhoenix:\n(Then don't go hiding puppets!)\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nPhoenix:\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- Meeting with Russell --\nPhoenix:\nLast night, you met with the Ringmaster, correct? To negotiate your salary, and such?\nMax:\nExactly... We reached an agreement about the salary from my 6-month-old contract.\nPhoenix:\nThat's the truth? The whole truth?\nMax:\nWhat do you mean!?\nPhoenix:\nYou just went to his office to negotiate your new salary?\nMax:\nI hate lies and I hate liars even more! What are you insinuating!? Do you have any proof that I did something other than negotiate my fee last night?\nPresent Ringmaster's Papers\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Th-Tha-That's!!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nMax:\nGeebus...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the matter?\nMax:\nSweetie, you must have some wax build up in your ears. You haven't listened to me at all!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMax:\nYou're still not listening are you? I said that I HATE LIES!\nPhoenix:\n(It seems this evidence isn't enough to make him confess...)\nMax:\nYou want to try again? It doesn't bother me at all!!\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have any proof that I did something other than negotiate my fee last night?\"\nMax:\nTh-Tha-That's!!\nPhoenix:\nIt was on the table in the Ringmaster's room. You weren't lying when you said that you received quite a raise...\nMax:\nIs there a problem with being well compensated?\nPhoenix:\nNot with the compensation... Just with the date. This is dated a week ago.\nMax:\n...\nPhoenix:\nMax! You finished your contract negotiations a week ago!\nMax:\nF-Fa-Fab-Fabulous!!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nMax:\n... Alright. I'll tell you the truth. That night... The Ringmaster called me to his room!\nPhoenix:\nHe called you? Why did he do that?\nMax:\nSorry sweetie... That's private.\nPhoenix:\n(The Ringmaster called him... I wonder if there was some sort of problem?) Um... Max? Perhaps you could share with me what you two spoke about?\nMax:\nWell... Not if I don't have to...\nPhoenix:\nIsn't this why the Ringmaster called you into his room that night?\nPresent Broken Bottle\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIsn't this why you were called to the Ringmaster's room that night?\nMax:\nWh-Where did you get that!?\nPhoenix:\nThe cafeteria... But you already knew that, didn't you?\nMax:\n...! O-Of course...\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nMax:\nIt fell and broke on the floor.\nPhoenix:\n(He's still hiding something else.) Max.\nMax:\nWhat is it my sweetie?\nPhoenix:\nIt didn't fall and break on the floor. You used this bottle to...\nPresent Ben profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"B-Ben...\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nMax:\nWill you give up on this... Please... Sweetie...\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nMax:\nIf you don't shape up, I'm gonna beat you over the head with that bottle!\nPhoenix:\n(What did I do? Hmm... I must be on the wrong track...)\nMax:\nI already told you! It fell to the floor and broke.\nPhoenix:\n(He won't tell me the truth!) ... Max.\nMax:\nWhat is it my sweetie?\nLeads back to:\n\"It didn't fall and break on the floor. You used this bottle to...\"\nMax:\nB-Ben...\nPhoenix:\nYou nailed him over the head with this bottle, didn't you?\nMax:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's why you got called to the Ringmaster's room that night.\nMax:\nF-F-F-FAAAABBBUUULLOUS!

H-He...\nPhoenix:\nYou had a run-in with Ben?\nMax:\nI didn't do anything to Ben. I-I didn't get in a fight with him!\nPhoenix:\nAh-ha! So you're admitting that you did have a fight with someone!?\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nMax:\nWh-Why are you looking at me all funny!? No one said anything like that!! Do you have any proof that we got into a knockdown drag out brawl?\nPresent Broken Bottle\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This proves it.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nMax:\nYou just don't quit! You know Ben, don't you? What reason in the world would I have for getting into a fight with him? I've hardly ever said a word to him.\nPhoenix:\nWell... It fits in with the chain of events.\nMax:\nYou are so belligerent... If that's the case, how about you show me some proof.\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have any proof that we got into a knockdown drag out brawl?\"\nPhoenix:\nThis proves it.\nMax:\nWhe-where did you get that?\nPhoenix:\nIsn't it obvious that I found it in the cafeteria, Max? You busted Ben over the head with this bottle, did you not?\nMax:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nThat's how the bottle broke. And that's why you were called to the Ringmaster's room.\nMax:\nF-F-F-FAAAABBBUUULOUSSS!

Right?\nPhoenix:\nNo no no no no... PLEASE DON'T MAKE IT DISAPPEAR!! (Hmm... I gotta try again! The Ringmaster called him... I wonder if there was some sort of problem?) Um... Max?

Promo Poster\nMax:\nMaximillion Galactica! No matter when you see me, you get shivers don't you? The silk hat... The cloak... The white roses on my chest... They're my symbols... You know I had to cut the number of symbols to three?\nMaya:\nReally? You had quite a few to begin with then, huh?\nMax:\nWell, I thought that you could never have too many symbols... Sunglasses... Beauty mark... Soft pillows for lips... A beard... Buck teeth... I gave all sorts of symbols a shot. But if I forget one when I put on my makeup, everyone would forget who I am!\nMaya:\nThat's awful... Especially for a magician.\nRingmaster's Papers\nPhoenix:\nCan I ask what you do with such an exorbitant salary?\nMax:\nWe've already covered this point. I'm paying off my father's debt.\nMaya:\nHow could he possibly have such a large amount of debt?\nMax:\nFor example, say you rented a video... And perhaps you forgot about it, for say... a short period of about 10 years. You'd would* ([sic]) have the biggest late fee known to man... It's kinda like that.\nMaya:\nWow... Now I can see how you can get that much debt.\nPhoenix:\n(That makes sense now. Wait a minute... That doesn't make any sense!)\nFranziska von Karma profile\nMax:\nU-Uh-huh... This woman, huh? Well... My type of woman is a gentle sweetie...\nMaya:\nSounds like you are describing Regina!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, he's definitely not describing Franziska!)\nRussell Berry profile\nMax:\nJust between you and I... He's* ([sic]) wasn't a bad guy at all. I can say that for sure...\nMaya:\n... That's the first time I've ever heard you say something nice about someone, Max.\nPhoenix:\nHe must have really been a nice guy.\nBen profile\nMax:\nI can't believe a guy with that ugly mug is after my sweetie pie princess! Especially after she has eluded my charms for such a long time!\nMaya:\nThere isn't much you can do about that, right?\nMax:\nHmph. You haven't even been truly in love, have you?\nMaya:\nUmm...\nMax:\nWhen you are truly in love with someone... You'd be jealous of their mirror because it traps their image inside.\nMaya:\nAwww... Don't you think that's sweet of him, Nick?\nMax:\nI'm gonna get back with my sweetie pie! Then I'm gonna turn that dumb puppet into a toy glider!\nMaya:\n...I guess you two haven't worked out your differences yet.\nAfter clearing \"\"Shut him up\"\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusCircus Entrance\nMaya:\nHuh? Ben's not here anymore!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I wanted to ask him something.\nMaya:\nIt's cold out... He's probably in the tent.\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusBig Top\nMaya:\nWhat do you think, Nick? I wonder if we've been making any progress...\nPhoenix:\nDon't be so negative... Of course we are making progress.\nMaya:\nBut... Everyone loved the Ringmaster... And there's no sign of footprints on the scene... There's still a lot of mysteries left to be solved.\nPhoenix:\nOf course.\nMaya:\nAnd now Regina isn't here!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not seeing how that's related...\nExamine\nAudience wing\nMaya:\nThe seats are so far away from the ring...\nPhoenix:\nBut they make up for it with the amount of people that can see a show.\nMaya:\nHey Nick... Do you think that if every person in the audience screamed all at once, the vibration they'd create could cause the big top to collapse?\nPhoenix:\nI'm glad I don't pay you to come up with this stuff...\nLion prop\nMaya:\nHey! Look! That's where Max makes his grand appearance!\nPhoenix:\nIt's \"grand\" alright.\nMaya:\n... I want to try entering court like that.\nPhoenix:\n(How'd I know that she'd say that...)\nSpotlights\nMaya:\nWhoa! Those lights are huge! If they fell from the ceiling, you'd be going to the circus in the sky... Life is so fragile, isn't it Nick?\nPhoenix:\nIt can be snuffed out in an instant by falling gargantuan lights.\nMaya:\nIt's so fragile that I've decided to eat as much good food as I can before I die. Like hamburgers...\nPhoenix:\nApparently you didn't notice the big sign that said \"closed\" by the snack stand.\nMaya:\nAwww... It's closed!?\nDecember 28Big TopRingmaster's Room\nMaya:\nIt looks the same as always... A great big mess. Considering how messy it is, I bet they wouldn't notice if another poster went missing.\nPhoenix:\nWill you just stop it, you poster pilferer!\nMaya:\nI'm just kidding! You know I already got one of these posters!!\nPhoenix:\nYou mean \"stole\" one of those posters!\nMaya:\nYeah... Uh... Let's focus on what Max told us. He said that he hid Trilo somewhere in this room.\nPhoenix:\n(Trilo... Ohh! The ventriloquist's puppet!)\nExamine\nTrophy case\nMaya:\nNick! Look at all the cute trophies!!\nPhoenix:\nIndeed. Just look at all the awards this circus has won...\nMaya:\nLike... \"All County Quiz Champions\"... \"Ringmaster's Association Mini Golf Master\"... \"Beer Belly Balloon Bounce Champ\"... \"Pet Grooming Grand Prix\"... Wow. The Ringmaster was multi-talented in ways I could have never imagined...\nPhoenix:\nHmm... There's something shoved under the bookshelf! This... is...\nMaya:\nThat's Trilo! That's Ben's puppet!\nPhoenix:\nI think you're right. We'll give it back to him later.\nTrilo Quist handed over to Maya.\nMaya:\nWhy do I have to carry this thing!?\nDetention Center\nPresent\nTrilo Quist\nMax:\nThis punk, huh? Trilo is such a wooden, cheeky excuse for a puppet! I can't believe that this thing is what I'm up against for Regina's love! Ahh... My sweetie pie... Love only me...\nMaya:\n...What? You're up against what for Regina's love!?\nPhoenix:\nWhatever. Let's hurry up and give this thing back to Ben.\nDecember 28Big TopCafeteria\nMaya:\nOh! Hey Ben!\nBen:\nA... Umm... Uhh...

Learn some manners before you just blurt out my name! Now try speaking to me again, but this time with some proper respect!\nPhoenix:\n(Not again... *sigh*) Mr. Quist... Is that better?\nTrilo:\nNo! Look at me when I am talking to you, you 8-bit excuse for an attorney!\nBen:\nTrilo! We talked about insulting people! You promised!!\nTrilo:\nBut he was mocking me! Not being mean to bullies was not included in the deal! (Changed from [But he was mocking me! Being mean to bullies was not included in the deal!] in the original release)\nBen:\nI'm sorry, Trilo...\nMaya:\nNick! What just happened? Trilo is still a puppet right? A ventriloquist's puppet!\nTrilo:\nHey! Who do you think you are, calling me a puppet!?\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nTell us what you know about the murder...\nTrilo:\nYou talkin' to me? I said you talkin' to me? Don't look at him when you're talkin' to me!\nBen:\nTrilo Quist. You behave young man!\nTrilo:\nShut up Woody! What murder are you talking about? You mean the one where they off'ed the old man?\nMaya:\nI guess so...\nTrilo:\nNo need to make such a fuss about things! That old mutt paid us all peanuts!\nBen:\nTrilo... You can't say things like that! I didn't raise you to be that kind of puppet!\nTrilo:\nDon't you have nerve pills or something to take right now?\nMaya:\nThese two are really an odd couple, aren't they Nick?\nTrilo:\nOK! OK! I'll talk... Gramps got clobbered over the head!!\nBerry Big Circus\nTrilo:\nLet me lay it all out for you... The pay sucks... The clown sucks... And my partner has his hand up my pants.\nMaya:\nYour partner... You mean Ben?\nTrilo:\nYeah... The creepy old guy who never finds it in himself to leave me alone... Tell him to \"BACK OFF\" for me will ya? He's just another one of the dorks around here!\nMaya:\nOh... My...\nTrilo:\nBut I'll be fair... In this cesspool of human garbage masquerading as circus performers... I found my Madonna.\nMaya:\nYour...\nPhoenix:\nMadonna?\nTrilo:\nRegina. My lovely Regina. She is stunning... Right? Ben?\nBen:\nWell... I'm not sure if I would go that far...\nTrilo:\nYou'll have to excuse him... He does not understand of what he speaks. I, on, the other hand, am an appreciator of true beauty. Hence why I shall marry her!\nMaya:\nMa-Ma-Ma-Marry!?\nFlying Fraud (appears after \"What happened\")\nTrilo:\nThe Ringmaster got knocked upside his cheap head by that flying fraud!!\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Max Galactica? Why do you say that?\nBen:\nTrilo! Straighten up!! Don't accuse people like that!\nTrilo:\nStraighten up!? I'm made of wood!! Besides, you were there! You know what happened!\nPhoenix:\nYou were there...?\nTrilo:\nHehe! If you're that interested, then I'll let you in on the facts!\nMarriage (appears after \"Berry Big Circus\")\nMaya:\nYou... You're going to marry... Regina?\nTrilo:\nThat's right! She doesn't quite realize the joy that awaits her, does she?\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'm beginning to see why she seemed... troubled...) (Changed from [But she did seem a bit worried about things...] in the original release)\nBen:\nWell... She...\nTrilo:\nI don't care! It is my choice not hers! We're getting hitched!\nBen:\nI know you think that... But...\nPhoenix:\n(...But what...?)\nTrilo:\nI gave her a special gift... I gave her the wonderful gift of song...\nMaya:\nYou gave her a song?\nTrilo:\nWell, I am a renowned tenor! You'll be happy to know that I've decided to grace you with one of my songs! Mi mi mi mi mi mi mi! \"I want you to touch me! I want you to kiss me! I want you to...\" The rest is private!\nMaya:\nWell... Umm... The melody is pretty good.\nPhoenix:\nBut those lyrics... I think they need a little work.\nTrilo:\nWho asked you!? I'm the artist here!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nBen:\nUmm... Uhh... Thanks...

Mr. Attorney, that face was so cute. You looked so completely dumbfounded!\nMaya:\nRegina!!\nPhoenix:\nYou!! That monkey!!\nRegina:\nHey... No need to get angry... OK?\nPhoenix:\nB-B-But!! My attorney's badge!!\nRegina:\nDon't worry... I'll help you out.\nPhoenix:\nOK... If you say so... (If I don't get my badge back, how can I flash it?)\nRegina:\nBy the way... The monkey's name is Money. Money the monkey.\nMaya:\nHis name is Monke... Money?\nTalk\nMoney the Monkey\nPhoenix:\nThe monkey... Is called Money?\nRegina:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\nWell, the rich ape just stole my attorney's badge. Mind if I get that back?\nRegina:\nI'll see what I can do... Even I have Money problems.\nPhoenix:\nEh?\nRegina:\nWhenever Money sees something shiny, he takes it back home.\nMaya:\nHaha... That's pretty funny.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess I'll just have to find out where Money disappeared to...\nRegina:\nI think that's your best bet. You should probably ask Uncle Moe... He might know.\nMaya:\nHuh? You don't know?\nRegina:\nWell... Money isn't exactly someone I am on friendly terms with.\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nRegina:\nHe's not really the kind of animal I work with... Even if he does need taming.\nMaya:\nOh, I see!\nPhoenix:\n(Go to Moe's... Hmm... I guess it is time that I revisit that kooky clown...)\nBen and Trilo\nMaya:\nDo you mind telling us a bit about Ben?\nRegina:\nBen...? You mean the guy that is always hanging around with Trilo?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean \"hanging around\"?\nRegina:\nWell, he was there when Trilo told me that he was in love with me...\nPhoenix:\nTrilo told you he was in love with you?\nRegina:\nYes he did. Kinda cute, don't ya think? He's so smart, and he's such a wonderful singer... I love him!\nMaya:\nBut... What about Ben?\nRegina:\nWhat about Ben? He's got nothing to do with me loving Trilo.\nPhoenix:\n(Like sand through the hourglass, so are the Days of the Circus...)\nProposal\nMaya:\nRegina, you were proposed to, weren't you?\nRegina:\nProposed to? Nope... That won't be for a while.\nMaya:\nHuh? Really? That's strange, isn't it Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Max and Trilo both said otherwise. They said they asked for her hand in marriage.\nMaya:\nAhh, but Max only talked to the Ringmaster about it.\nPhoenix:\nI forgot about that. He asked the Ringmaster for her hand, not Regina directly.\nMaya:\nSo I guess Trilo hasn't asked her directly yet.\nRegina:\nWhat!? He's going to propose to me!? I'm so confused... How about you Maya?\nMaya:\nHuh? What?\nRegina:\nWho do you think I should go for? Max or Trilo?\nPhoenix:\nWait... Wait... You do realize that Trilo is... a... puppet?\nRegina:\nUh? I don't care that he's a bit stiff...\nPhoenix:\nOh boy.\nPresent\nCrime Photo\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this...\nMaya:\nNICK! YOU CAN'T SHOW HER THAT PICTURE!!\nPhoenix:\nOuch...

Want me to tell ya?\nMaya:\nYou know!?\nRegina:\nUh-huh. *giggle* But you have to keep it secret!\nPhoenix:\nEh?\nRegina:\nSo here's how it works... *mumble* *mumble*\nMaya:\nWow! That's incredible!!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nOh, don't pout Nick!\nRegina:\nHehe... We were just teasing you! I don't know a thing about magic!!\nMaya:\nSorry we tricked you Nick.\nAfter presenting Trilo Quist, then clearing all Talk options in Big Top - Cafeteria:\nDecember 28Lodging HousePlaza\nMaya:\nHuh? Detective Gumshoe took off already.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Probably because we ditched him earlier. (Changed from [Yep. Just leave him alone for a while, OK Maya?] in the original release) I bet he and the other cops got lonely and headed back to the precinct. (Changed from [I'm sure he just got lonely and headed back to the precinct.] in the original release)\nExamine\nTarp\nPhoenix:\nSomething's covered up by this tarp... An old sign perhaps.\nMaya:\nNick! Look out! They've got the killer trapped behind that tarp!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat? It wasn't funny? You know it wouldn't have hurt you to look even a little bit surprised.\nPhoenix:\n(Whew! She didn't notice that I was too scared to talk!)\nAir conditioner\nPhoenix:\nThis is the condenser for the air conditioner. It hasn't been used in a while.\nMaya:\nWhat!? How'd you figure that out!? You're not making things up now are you!?\nPhoenix:\nHold your horses! It was easy to figure out! It was snowing before the murder, right? Well, look at the condenser. The snow is still piled on top of it.\nMaya:\nWow! Nick! I'm impressed. Maybe you should be a P.I. instead of an attorney.\nLightpost\nMaya:\nThis safety light was on at the time of the murder, wasn't it?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what they say. (There were performers in the lodging house, so it makes sense that it was on. I bet the killer was worried that someone would spot them during the crime...)\nMuddy footprints\nPhoenix:\nThe Ringmaster's body was found here. I heard that the way he fell over made him look like he was carrying a wooden box... But what in the world really happened here?\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room\nMoe:\nOh my! If it isn't \"Mr. Wright All The Time\"!!\nPhoenix:\n*ugh*\nMoe:\nIt's all Wright to be wrong every now and again, Wright?\nMaya:\nSee Nick! It just took awhile for the joke to find its audience!\nPhoenix:\n... *sigh*\nMoe:\nSo what can I do for you? Did you remember a good joke you wanted to tell me? Pull up a chair, or maybe just pull my finger, and let me have it.\nMaya:\nWe're going to get the same sound effect either way, aren't we?\nMoe:\nHow'd you know I put a whopee [sic] cushion on the chair!? You really know what it takes to be a clown, don't you? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nTalk\nRegina\nPhoenix:\nSo, about Regina...\nMoe:\nRegina is such a pure, innocent child...\nMaya:\nShe's such a cutie, too.\nMoe:\nShe was born and raised in the circus you know? But that means she doesn't really know much about the world outside the Big Top.\nMaya:\nSounds like Pearly...\nMoe:\nFor her, every child's \"dream\" of the circus is her everyday reality.\nMaya:\nShe lives in a dream world...\nMoe:\nEveryday she sees dancing wild animals, men flying in the air, and one very funny clown. The funny thing is, that all seems normal to her because it is her everyday life.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that explains why she thinks she can marry a ventriloquist's puppet...)\nMoe:\nDon't ask me if her reality is a good thing or a bad thing though... \"A clown sees life simply, without complications.\"\nMoney the Monkey\nPhoenix:\nHave you ever heard of a monkey named Money?\nMoe:\nAhhh! Yes! Money!\nPhoenix:\nHe stole my Attorney's Badge!\nMoe:\nWell... Money does love shiny objects... It makes sense that he'd swipe your badge. But under no circumstances can you chase after him.\nPhoenix:\nEh? Why's that?\nMaya:\nOh! I know!! You don't want to get involved in any monkey business, right?\nMoe:\nEXACTLY! BRAVO!! BRAVO!! Enough joking around though... Money isn't considered a member of Regina's family.\nMaya:\nThen who does he belong to?\nMoe:\nI'll be happy to take you to where his owner is staying...\nMaya:\nYou mean right now?\nMoe:\nOf course. Shall we go?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, should we go with him now, or wait a while?)\nGo with Moe\nLeads to:\n\"December 28\nLodging Hall 3rd Floor\nAcro's Room\"\nGo later\nPhoenix:\nWe'll go after we talk some more, OK?\nMoe:\nYay! You want to hear me talk some more, huh? Your wish is my command!! I'll give ya the full repertoire of 1001 jokes!\nMaya:\nWoohoo!!\nPhoenix:\nDon't \"Woohoo!!\" that!!\nLeads back to Talk options\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 3rd FloorAcro's Room\nPhoenix:\n*huff* *huff*\nMoe:\nThis is it... What's wrong, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI... can't... breathe...\nMoe:\nDon't be such a wimp! You only had to climb two flights of stairs!!\nPhoenix:\n*pant* *pant*\nMoe:\nAnyways... This is the place. Acro's room.\nPhoenix:\nAcro?\nMoe:\nHe's an acrobat... It seems like he's not around today...\nMaya:\nEh... That's a big pile of junk over in the corner...\nMoe:\nI don't think it'd be wrong to assume that Phoenix's stuff is over there too... Just be careful to make sure you've got the Wright stuff.\nMaya:\nThanks Moe! See you later!\nMoney has been added to the Court Record.\nAcro's Room\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nYou can see the Big Top from the window here.\nMaya:\nThere is no snow on top of the Big Top... Kinda weird don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nThe inside of the tent is warm so any snow that lands on top probably melts.\nMaya:\nI guess you're right. The snow probably just slides right off.\nTire swing\nPhoenix:\nMoney must use this to swing around on...\nMaya:\nGo ahead Nick. I know you want to ride on it too!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe later...\nJunk pile\nLeads to:\n\"Holy cow!\"\nBasketball hoop\nMaya:\nHey... The net's ripped. Money must be prone to breaking things... He's hardcore.\nPhoenix:\nUmm... The net looks fine to me. You really think that he plays basketball?\nMaya:\nI think so... Monkeys live life above the rim you know.\nPhoenix:\n... You're joking right? You think the monkey has got proverbial \"game\"?\nMaya:\nOf course. That monkey doesn't fake the funk on a nasty dunk.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, a prehensile tail might be an unfair advantage...)\nCalendar\nMaya:\nHehe... It's a monkey calendar!\nPhoenix:\nWhoever's in this room must really love monkeys.\nMaya:\nMaybe a little too much... Wow... I just realized that the year is almost over. Amazing how time flies.\nPhoenix:\nIt's been one wild year. Especially the last part...\nMaya:\nWell, we still got one last person to help this year... Max.\nBed\nPhoenix:\nThis bed is incredibly well made. It's almost like a maid made it up. Even the laundry on top of the bed is folded perfectly.\nMaya:\nNick, there's nothing unusual about that at all. It's how things are supposed to be!\nPhoenix:\nCan't a man respect another man for doing something said man cannot do?\nBarbell\nPhoenix:\nHmm... He's got a barbell. Look around... Everything he's got is for upper body training. Wait a second... These are the same machines I see on TV all the time!\nMaya:\nHey, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nI don't have this one! This barbell here is a new model!\nPhoenix:\nDon't overdo it Maya. You don't want to end up a muscle woman.\nMaya:\nHoly cow! There's a fork... And a mirror... Everything's shiny!! There's even a really cheap looking knockoff wristwatch!\nPhoenix:\nLook at this! It's a trophy! And it's really heavy!!\nMaya:\nNick! I found it! Your badge! It's right here!!\nAttorney's Badge returned to its rightful spot on lapel. (Changed from [Phoenix's Attorney's Badge has been returned.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nThanks! You really saved me! ... Huh?\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter? Did you find something?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Check this out.\nMaya:\nIt's a ring...\nPhoenix:\nThere's something engraved on it... \"From T to R\"...\nRing put in pocket.\nPhoenix:\nWell... I think it's about time we wrap up our investigation...\nMaya:\nDo you think we'll win in court tomorrow?\nPhoenix:\nWho knows... Even I can't imagine what kind of testimony will come out tomorrow. (I'm guessing Moe will be a witness in court tomorrow... Moe and maybe the puppet.)\nMaya:\nDon't worry Nick. No matter what, we've still got a magician on our side!!\nPhoenix:\nThat's good, because we might need some magic tomorrow...\nTo be continued.\nMoe's Room (before examining junk pile in Lodging Hall 3rd Floor - Acro's Room)\nMaya:\nHuh? Moe must have gone off somewhere...\nPhoenix:\nJust as long as he isn't off writing new jokes...\nMaya:\nOh, that reminds me Nick... You have to get your Attorney's Badge back by tomorrow, or we're in trouble.\nPhoenix:\nI know. I know. (I'm gonna have to try and find out where that monkey hid it...)\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.\nExit Magatama session\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)\nToo many errors during Magatama session\n...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...\nPhoenix:\n(Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)\n-- What You Witnessed --Trilo:\nOnce practice was over, I left the tent with the stooge... I mean clown.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe clown... You're talking about Moe?\nTrilo:\nOf course I'm talking about that old fart. He's so pathetic, I can't stand him! Just a little bit of exercise and his makeup is running all over the place... Once practice was over, he was 9/10ths of the way to keeling over for good...\nPhoenix:\nPoor guy...\nTrilo:\nWe didn't have any choice, so Ben took him back to his room. When it comes to being a first place loser, that guy's ahead of the pack!\nJudge:\nHmm... Then what happened?Trilo:\nOnce we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went back to the plaza's entrance. (Changed from [Once we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went over to the plaza.] in the original release)Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you do then?\nTrilo:\nI went over to the Plaza to do some thinking.\nPhoenix:\nIt was awfully cold out that night... Especially with all the snow around... Wouldn't thinking in your nice warm lodging house have been a better idea?\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright. I think you should leave the thinking to the witness.\nPhoenix:\n(But I'm a good thunker* ([sic])! At least my teachers always said I was...)Trilo:\nThat's when I saw Max, heading towards the scene of the crime.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it was really Max Galactica?\nTrilo:\nOf course I'm sure. How could you mistake someone wearing such a snobby 3 piece get-up!\nPhoenix:\nSnobby 3 piece get-up?\nTrilo:\nGet the wax out of your ears! Lawyers nowadays... You're like talking to a brick wall! Max's 3 piece get-up! Jeez! Could you be any more dense! All together now!\n\"SILK HAT! CLOAK! WHITE ROSES!\"\nTrilo:\nThank you!\nMaya:\nNick, I think you should put a little bit more effort into preparing your questions...Trilo:\nHe was the only one heading that way... How could that punk not be the killer!?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw Max and only Max, right Trilo?\nTrilo:\nThat's right. And that makes him the killer! There was only one person headed that way that night.\nJudge:\nHmm... That makes quite a bit of sense and makes Max one suspicious character...\nPhoenix:\n(There's more to this story than meets the eye... Is there something amiss in this?)\n\n\n\nNo problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I can't really see anything wrong with what Ben... I mean Trilo said.)\nMaya:\nMaybe you should take a step back and look things over again, Nick.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nThere is no proof it was Max.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a second! There's no proof that the witness saw Maximillion Galactica...\nTrilo:\nHey! Hey! You still don't get it, do ya? I saw what I saw... It was Max's 3 piece joke of a costume! Alright! Lets [sic] say it all together now!\n\"SILK HAT! CLOAK!

Doesn't it seem like you should have seen someone else as well?\nJudge:\nWhat? Where are you going with this, Mr. Wright? Who else do you suppose this witness could have seen?\n\n\n\nPresent Russell Berry profile (before correctly presenting Regina Berry profile upon pressing fifth statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nThat's the... victim...\nPhoenix:\nThat's correct.

Ah-hah!\nvon Karma:\nObviously the Ringmaster arrived at the scene of the crime before the witness could have seen him! Anyone with sense could have figured that one out!\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about!? The Ringmaster and Max went together to the Ringmaster's room!\nvon Karma:\nIs that according to the defendant? A likely story! If Maximillion Galactica was supposed to be in the Ringmaster's room, why was he, just as the witness stated... At the scene of the crime!?\nPhoenix:\nAhh!!\nJudge:\nI see... It seems that at this stage I have no reason to doubt this witness's testimony.

I suppose that would have been around... Hey, what time was it!?\nBen:\nHuh!? Umm... I think it was around... I'd say a bit after 10:30 PM... I think...\nPhoenix:\nPractice ended at 10 PM so you hung around the lodging house the entire time?\nBen:\nI... I... I... I guess that sounds about right...\nPhoenix:\nWasn't it awfully cold? I can't believe you'd just stand outside in that weather!\nBen:\nWell... Uh... The truth is...\nTrilo:\nWill you shut up, you big nosed dope! Why are you telling him anything extra!? Why can't you believe that we'd just stand outside in that weather?\nPhoenix:\nWell, maybe you were waiting for someone?\nTrilo:\nW-W-W-W-WHAT!? WHO SAID WE WERE WAITING FOR SOMEONE!?\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright! We can all do without your off-handed theories!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut! This witness!

Trilo wouldn't happen to have an ulterior motive for incriminating Max, would he?Phoenix:\nWell, Max is part of that bitter love triangle with Regina. Which is probably why Max conked him over the head.Maya:\nUmm Nick... Wasn't Ben the one who got knocked over the head?Phoenix:\nUh... Yeah... I think so... I dunno anymore!Phoenix:\nAlright! There is obviously a reason why this witness was there that night! He spent all that time waiting for Regina to arrive! Moreover...

In his third testimony (\"I kept it in my pocket, waiting for the chance to propose and give it to her.\"), he mentions keeping an engagement ring in his pocket to propose to Regina. However, the Ring found by Phoenix in Acro's room has an engraving \"From T to R\" (evidence 10), indicating it was intended for Regina but not actually in Trilo's possession as stated. Since the ring was found by Phoenix and not in Trilo's possession as he testified, this contradicts Trilo's claim of having the ring in his pocket.\n\n{\"evidence\": 10, \"testimony\": 3}",

That was like living a dream...] in the original release) I haven't even caught my breath yet.\nMaya:\nHehe... That was amazing! Wasn't it Pearly!?\nPearl:\nIt was great! There was a dancing bear... And a tiger that jumped through a ring of fire... An elephant that rode a giant ball... (Changed from [And a tiger that jumped though [sic] a ring of fire... An elephant who rode a giant ball...] in the original release) Not to mention that guy who flew through the air!\nMaya:\nYeah! Max Galactica! He was absolutely fabulous!\nPearl:\nHuh? ...What? Max...\nMaya:\nMax Galactica! The World's Greatest Magician!\nPearl:\nA magic-ician?\nMaya:\nNo, a magician.\nPearl:\nUmm... Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What is it, Pearls?\nPearl:\nDoes magic have anything to do with channeling spirits?\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think it has anything to do with channeling...) You don't know about magic, do you Pearls?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry...\nPhoenix:\n(I braved the winter cold and took Pearls to see the circus. It's been six months since the incident in Kurain Village... and it was during that trying time that I met Pearls... (Changed from [It was during that terrible time that I met Pearls...] in the original release) Thankfully, she seems to be recovering from it, and is returning to her normal self. (Changed from [It seems like she is starting to get back to normal...] in the original release))\nMaya:\nAhh... It's time to go.\nPearl:\nYou're right. We can't miss the last train.\nPhoenix:\nPearls! You remembered the train!\nPearl:\nOf course I did! But I don't really understand what everyone means by \"express train\".\nMaya:\nWell, Nick... See you later. I'll come by to help clean the office. It's gotta be spotless for the new year.\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry about it. Really.\nPearl:\nYou are going to visit Mr. Nick on New Year's?\nMaya:\nMaybe.\nPearl:\nI am glad you will get to spend your New Year's with your special someone!\nMaya:\nP-PEARLY!! Look!

Today wraps it up for this year... I hope I can finish cleaning this place up in one day.)\nPhone:\n.............................. ...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...Hello. This is the Wright & Co. Law Offices.\nMaya:\nNick!! It's t-t-terrible!!\nPhoenix:\nAhh, Maya. Perfect timing... Things are terrible here too!\nMaya:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nThe office is a terrible mess! And I have to clean it up!\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about!?\nPhoenix:\nUmmm... My dirty office. What are you talking about?\nMaya:\nListen Nick! You have to turn on the TV!\nPhoenix:\n(The TV?)\nTV:\n...Now let's check in at the scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? What happened...?)\nTV:\n...Thank you. We're here at the Berry Big Circus. The Berry Big Circus has become the center of a sensational murder. The scene has created quite a stir among the throngs of excited onlookers!\nPhoenix:\nThe Very... I mean... The Berry Big Circus...\nMaya:\nThat's the circus we went to!! Right!?\nPhoenix:\nThey're saying that there was a... murder.\nMaya:\nYeah! They arrested him too!\nPhoenix:\nA-Arrested who?\nMaya:\nMax! They arrested Max Galactica!!\nPhoenix:\n(Maximillion Galactica. Fans call him Max. A popular magician who can fly through the sky at will... Maya said she was a huge fan of Max...)\nMaya:\nAlright Nick! I'll see you in two hours at the Detention Center.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What?\nMaya:\nSee you there. You've still got plenty of time to clean up your office later!\nPhoenix:\nW-WWWHHHAATTT!?\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nExamine\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row.

I wouldn't mind his help cleaning this place up.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nMovie poster\nPhoenix:\nA poster of the newest member of the \"Steel Samurai\" universe. Maya went out and bought it right away. She's a sucker for all things Steel Samurai. I hear they're even giving the new guy his own movie. I just know Maya is going to drag me out to see it with her...\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel.

Why did they arrest Max?\nPhoenix:\nYou're asking the wrong man on that one, Maya. Maybe he used his magical skills to deal death with a slight [sic] of hand...\nMaya:\nMaximillion Galactica would never do such a thing!!\n???:\nFABULOUS!! What the young lady just said was absolutely fabulous! What a clever girl! Such a fabulous understanding of events!\nPhoenix:\n(...What's with all this fabulous talk...)\nMax:\nWelcome to the Visitor's Room!\nMaya:\nIt's MAX!! Nick!! Look! It's the real Maximillion Galactica!!\nMax:\nAlright sweetie. Pick a card, any card.\nMaya:\nH-H-He called me sweetie! *swoon* Nick!!\nMax:\nAh ha ha ha... Time's running out sweetie! Pick a card, any card!\nMaya:\nT-This one...\nMax:\nUh-huh. I thought you would pick that one sweetie. The ace of hearts!\nMaya:\nAHHHH!!! He got it! He got it! NICK! LOOK! HE GOT IT!!\nMax:\nWhat can I say sweetie... You've stolen one of my most valued possessions. One of Maximillion Galactica's hearts...\nMaya:\nMax... *swoon*\nMax:\nWell... Time to make this an absolutely fabulous time!\nMaya:\nMax! You should let Nick pick a card!!\nPhoenix:\n(Eek... I don't want to steal one of his hearts...)\nMax:\nAnd you are...? Oh, how silly of me! You must be sweetie's driver!\nPhoenix:\nHer driver?\nMax:\nWhatever... Hurry up and pick a card, any card...\nPhoenix:\nUmm... I want this one.\nMax:\nSo sweetie, let's be honest here... You came to this visitor's room to visit me, didn't you?\nMaya:\nY-Yes! I'm your biggest fan!!\nMax:\nFabulous! Absolutely fabulous! Thank you so much!!\nPhoenix:\nHey... Umm... What about my card?\nMax:\nThink of it as a souvenir.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWell Nick... I think it's time to get to work.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick? Why are you looking at the ceiling?\nPhoenix:\nI was just thinking about what I should have for lunch.\nMax:\nSweetie... Drop porcupine head over there. Shower me with your attention. OK?\nMaya:\nO-O-O-Oh, yes...! (Changed from [Y-Y-Y-Yes...] in the original release)\nMax:\nAb-so-lute-ly... FABULOUS!!\nPhoenix:\n(Absolutely cringe inducing.)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera. Max keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.\nTalk\nMax Galactica\nMaya:\nMax, I was hoping you could tell me a little bit more about yourself...\nMax:\nFABULOUS! I think we should get to know each other better, too! Why don't you come sit next to me?\nMaya:\nUmm... There's a big piece of security glass between us...\nMax:\nOh sweet geebus! What in the world!? If only I could use magic! Then I could make this wall disappear...\nPhoenix:\n(What is this guy talking about!?) Anyways... Lately, you've become awfully famous, haven't you Max?\nMax:\nThat's Maximillion to you, porcupine head! Get it straight!\nPhoenix:\n(Jeez, people nowadays... They get their panties all in a bunch over nothing!) Anyway, Maximillion, you won a very prestigious award recently, did you not?\nMax:\nI did indeed! It was FABULOUS! I won the Magician's Grand Prix, held by the Association of International Magicians. It's an award that recognizes that I am the most fabulouso of fabulous world magicians. There was a trophy, and a bust. It was a fab... I mean it was an amazing day.\nMaya:\nWow! That's incredible!\nMax:\nIsn't it!? I'm certainly the greatest magician in the world!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm going to guess he didn't win a trophy for most modest magician.)\nBerry Big Circus\nMaya:\nYou are signed to an exclusive contract with the Berry Big Circus, correct?\nMax:\nThat's the long and short of it. You sure do your research sweetie! I'm impressed. You just can't watch a magician on TV, you know!? Magic is so fabulous, you have to see it with your own eyes, sweetie!\nMaya:\nYou're right! You're so right!\nMax:\nHowever, the circus... It's a dinosaur. A thing of the past. Nowadays, no one even cares about what goes on there.\nMaya:\nHuh? What do you mean?\nMax:\nThat's why I signed the contract!!\nPhoenix:\nThat's why you signed the contract?\nMax:\nThanks to me, the Berry Big Circus is fabulously popular! People come out in droves to catch a glimpse of the magic of Max Galactica! I revived the dinosaur that is the circus! But to me, it was just another magic trick! Isn't it just wonderful, sweetie?\nMaya:\nY-Yes...\nMax:\nI made all the old crusty performances obsolete!\nMaya:\nBut I kinda like the circus performances...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks a bit down...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nTell me what happened at the Berry Big Circus.\nMax:\nAhh... Last night. The Ringmaster was murdered.\nMaya:\nThe Ringmaster... You mean Russell Berry?\nMax:\nSomeone smashed him over the head, I hear. He was slumped over on the ground. Even though it was the middle of the night, the police presence was fabulous. The police questioned me at length...\nPhoenix:\nQuestioned you about what?\nMax:\nAbout everything... I was the last one to see the Ringmaster before he was murdered. I saw him last evening... In his room. (Changed from [I saw him that night... In his room.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nSo then why were you arrested?\nMax:\nArrested? Don't make an ant hill into a mountain, sweetie. They just wanted to consult with me on matters... That's all.\nMaya:\nNick... I don't think Max understands how serious this is.\nPhoenix:\n(She's right... I think I should shock him back to reality...)\nMeeting with Russell (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nBefore the murder, you met with the Ringmaster?\nMax:\nUh-huh.\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you talk about?\nMax:\nThings that aren't for your ears.\nPhoenix:\nMaya. Would you please ask him?\nMaya:\nWhat did you talk about with the Ringmaster, Max?\nMax:\nIt was nothing... Small talk really... We were just having a chat about my salary.\nMaya:\nSalary?\nMax:\nI am the one bringing in the crowds. (Changed from [I am the one bringing in all of the crowds to the circus.] in the original release) I think that I should be compensated as such. You agree, don't you?\nMaya:\nY-Yes...\nPhoenix:\nThat's all you talked about?\nMax:\nOf course! It was a fabulous chat!\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(Just fabulous! I mean-- Argh! Now he's got ME saying it!) (Changed from [Fabulous! Why does he have to keep saying fabulous!?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick? You look all bent out of shape.\nMeeting with Russell (subsequent times)\nMax:\nWhen you make absolutely fabulous magic... It costs enormous sums of money. Sums that will boggle your mind!\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nMaya:\nThat's why you went to his room that night...?\nMax:\nI went to ask him for a fabulous raise.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder how people can lie with such a straight face...)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMax:\nWhat is that badge? Is it used in a disappearing act?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not a magician, Max. I'm an attorney.\nMax:\nAn attorney? Then why are you wasting your time talking to me?\nMaya:\nHe isn't wasting his time! Max... You're...\nMax:\nOK! OK! Relax, sweetie... You're just a little overanxious, I think...\nMaya:\n*whimper*\nMaya Fey profile\nMax:\nSo, would you like to come up on stage with me sometime?\nMaya:\nRe-Really? Is that really OK?\nMax:\nI'll bring you up on stage as a volunteer from the audience!\nMaya:\nREALLY!?\nMax:\nI'll give you something before the show, and then on stage you'll sneak it to me...\nPhoenix:\n(Wait a second... He's planting her in the audience to rig a magic trick!)\nMax profile\nPhoenix:\nDo you mind taking a look at this?\nMax:\nI guess I have no choice... But really, is this the proper time or place for this?\nPhoenix:\n(He signed his own photo...)\nMaya:\nNick... You mind giving that to me when the case is over?\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this?\nMax:\nFabulous!! You'd like me to sign this for you?\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh*)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Attorney's Badge:\nMax:\n... Anyways... I've been curious about something for a while now.\nMaya:\nWhat's that?\nMax:\nWhy do you keep looking at me with such a sad look on your face, sweetie?\nMaya:\nBe-Because! You've been arrested! For murder!\nMax:\nOh, don't be ignorant. They wouldn't arrest someone like me!!\nPhoenix:\nWhy is that?\nMax:\nObviously because I'm the fabulous Maximillion Galactica!\nPhoenix:\nSo?\nMax:\nI'm the very big star of the Berry Big Circus.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that means?\nMax:\nI'm rich. I'm paid fabulous sums!\nPhoenix:\nWhich means what?\nMax:\n...\nMaya:\nMax...\nMax:\nQuit joking around! You've got to be pulling my magic wand! The police aren't really serious about all this, are they?\nPhoenix:\nThey don't arrest people as a joke.\nMax:\n...!!\nMaya:\nLook at Max... He's crushed...\nPhoenix:\nWell he needed to wake up and smell the coffee. (This is serious business.)\nMax:\nUmm... Umm...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMax:\nPorcu... I mean, Sir. You're a lawyer, right?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Oh, yeah. I'm an attorney.\nMax:\nPlease! Help me! I didn't kill nobody!\nMaya:\n\"Didn't kill nobody!?\"\nMax:\nI may be more spoiled than a hog in a hamburger mud pit... But a killer!? That's insane... I... I... I could never...\nMaya:\nM-Max?\nMax:\nI swear!! I just wanted to pay off my daddy's debt... He's back on the farm...\nPhoenix:\nOK... OK... I'll take your case.\nMax:\nR-Really?\nPhoenix:\nReally.\nMax:\nUh... Thank ya much. Ya'll sure are nice folks.\nMaya:\nUmm... Max.\nMax:\nYes?\nMaya:\nWhat's your real name?\nMax:\nIt's Billy Bob Johns...\nMaya:\n............ (Changed from [... Ugh...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the matter, Maya?\nMaya:\nHe's really just a country bumpkin!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMax:\n...Ahem. I must apologize for not being my absolutely fabulous self just now, sweetie.\nMaya:\nH-Huh?\nMax:\nMr. Attorney.\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMax:\nA few minutes ago, you took one of my cards, didn't you?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Now that he mentions it... I did take a card.)\nMax:\nIt was the 10 of Hearts. Right?\nPhoenix:\n(Wha... How'd he... He got it right, again!)\nMax:\nWhat can I say? You, too... You've stolen some of my most valued possessions. Ten of Maximillion Galactica's hearts...\nPhoenix:\n(You sure do have a lot of hearts, don't you?)\nMax:\nAh ha ha ha... I'm putting my faith in you sweetie.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't just call me sweetie, did he?)\nMaya:\nAlright! Let's make this an absolutely fabulous case! C'mon, Nick!\nDecember 28Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nAlright... We've got lots of things we have to look into. No time for slacking. Let's get going.\nMaya:\nOK.\nPhoenix:\n? What's the matter? You seem down.\nMaya:\nMaximilion Galactica... Who would have guessed he was country bumpkin?\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSo now what do we do?\nMaya:\nHuh? There's still lots of things we can do! Go to the scene of the crime, talk to witnesses, gather evidence...\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I guess you're right.\nMaya:\nWe still don't even know what happened in the first place.\nAny ideas\nMaya:\nWe don't have enough information to make a case yet.\nPhoenix:\nI could have sworn I've heard that before.\nMaya:\nWell, we never have enough information!\nPhoenix:\nJust admit it, you don't have a clue what happened.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMaya:\nWell... Your badge is still shining. Barely.\nPhoenix:\nIt may be showing a bit of wear, but I try to take good care of this thing.\nMaya:\nYou sure do love to show that off, don't you Nick? Who knows how many times you have shown it to me?\nPhoenix:\n(She's right... I whip it out at the drop of a hat.)\nMaya Fey profile\nMaya:\nOnce you start channeling spirits... They say you lose sight of who you actually are...\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Do you really believe that?\nMaya:\nNot really. But... Just in case, I plan to write my autobiography.\nPhoenix:\nYour autobiography...?\nMax profile\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the matter? You've been acting strange for a while now.\nMaya:\nMax... He's just some country bumpkin...\nPhoenix:\nSo? Why does that matter? He's still a famous magician right?\nMaya:\nI guess. But his real name is... Billy Bob Johns.\nPhoenix:\n(Yikes! The poor guy's got three first names! I guess that is pretty odd.)\nMaya:\nOh well! If a big star can do it, then you should pretend to be exotic too, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n\"A big star...\"?\nMaya:\nMax Galactica is a pretty big name! Anyways, what do you think about Naruhodo A. Wrighto?\nPhoenix:\nN-N-Na... *cough* Umm... What's the \"A\" stand for?\nMaya:\nThe \"A\" stands for \"Attorney\".\nPhoenix:\nI'll think about it...\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nThis is kinda pointless don't you think?\nMaya:\nIf it's that pointless, then you don't have to worry about showing it to me.\nPhoenix:\n(When she's right... She's right.)\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusCircus Entrance\nMaya:\nWe're here again...\nPhoenix:\nYep. But this time we are here for work. (It hasn't been that long since the crime, so the police are still on the scene.)\nMaya:\nLet's find someone who might know something about what happened.\nPhoenix:\nSounds like a plan.\nExamine\nBig top\nMaya:\nThe Berry Big Top is so... Very... B... *cough* Enormous...\nPhoenix:\nYep. One look at the huge tent looming over you and you realize \"This is the circus!\"\nMaya:\nI know! I know! It really gets your blood pumping doesn't it!?\nSign\nMaya:\nLook! Look! It's Max!!\nPhoenix:\nEven when you don't want to see him... *poof* He's right in front of you. (Sure the sign says \"Berry Big Circus\"... But looking around... It might as well be Cirque du Galactica...)\nMaya:\nThe stars on his cheek sure are dreamy... How about I draw a star on your cheek Nick? I've got a marker!\nPhoenix:\nNah! Nah! It's alright!\nStreamers\nPhoenix:\nThose streamers do a nice job introducing the circus performers.\nMaya:\n\"Maximillion Galactica and his comical comrades!\"\nPhoenix:\nYou know... You don't really see too many streamers nowadays, do you?\nMaya:\nYou're right. I haven't seen one in ages. I bet they stopped using them due to little kids climbing up to the top...\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... I don't think that was why...)\nVendors\nPhoenix:\nIt's a snack stand. They have hot dogs, hamburgers, and drinks... Not to mention...\nMaya:\nCandy and popcorn... They've even got snow cones!!\nPhoenix:\n(Who would eat snow cones in the middle of winter?)\nMaya:\nNick... Do you think we can buy some snow cones?\nPhoenix:\nLook around... There's tons of snow piled up all around here!\nMaya:\nYAY!! Wait a second... There's no syrup though! I want syrup!\nPhoenix:\n(Hopefully she doesn't notice that discolored snow in the corner. That's not syrup!)\nEntrance\nMaya:\nNick... The entrance is right here.\nPhoenix:\nMaya. The circus is closed today. No clowns. No elephants. No shows.\nMaya:\nI know that! Nick... You can get your picture taken with Dali the elephant!\nPhoenix:\nThere's no Dali. Not today.\nMaya:\nI know that too! Oh well... I'll just have to take a picture with whoever I stumble across...\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* It's not like we're here on business or anything...)\nTicket booths\nPhoenix:\nThis is the Box Office where they sell all the tickets for the circus.\nMaya:\nThey also sell programs. I forgot to buy one when we came to the circus last time.\nPhoenix:\nSo then why don't you buy one now?\nMaya:\nHmm... Sounds like a plan. Oh no... It looks like I forgot my wallet. ...\nPhoenix:\nIf you want me to buy it for you, just ask me already.\nMaya:\nYou know I'd never do that to you, Nick...\nDoor\nMaya:\nHmm... This door must lead to the lodging house.\nPhoenix:\n\"No Entry To Unauthorized Personnel\"\nMaya:\nDo you really need to say \"No Entry\" if no one's actually entering? It's almost like a zen riddle, isn't it Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not even going to justify that question with a response...)\nMaya:\nI bet all of the stars stay at that lodging house.\nDecember 28Lodging HousePlaza\nPhoenix:\nThis seems to be a dorm where all the performers in the circus stay...\nMaya:\nReally!? So we might run into that stoogey clown here, right? He's so kooky! (Changed from [Really!? So that stoogey clown should be here, huh? He's so kooky!] in the original release)\n???:\nAhhh! It's you two!\nMaya:\nOh... Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nHow is it you guys always seem to know when I'm working a crime scene, pal? (Changed from [I always see you hanging around when I'm working a crime scene, pal.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nBecause you're always working, Detective. (Changed from [You always seem to be working so hard, Detective.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'd rather not be always working, but with crime, you don't make your own hours. (Changed from [I'd rather not be working hard, but with crime you don't make your own hours.] in the original release) If I have to be at the circus anyway, I want to see the lion tamer and the tightrope. However, no matter where I go, the show is always the same... Dead body. Stage left.\nMaya:\nNick! Nick! He complained!!\nPhoenix:\nHeh heh... That's a rarity. Let's get back to business now, OK?\nExamine\nTarp\nPhoenix:\nThere's some evidence under the tarp over there...\nGumshoe:\nHey! Watch it, pal! The killer is behind that tarp!!\nMaya:\nAHHHHH!!\nGumshoe:\nHo! Ho! Ho! Got ya! I was just kidding!\nMaya:\nGRRR!\nGumshoe:\nHo! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!\nAir conditioner\nGumshoe:\nThis year, I finally won an air conditioner!\nMaya:\nWhat!? You didn't have an air conditioner? Did you ride your triceratops to work too?\nPhoenix:\nAnd what do you mean you \"won\" an air conditioner? You didn't buy it?\nGumshoe:\nI can't afford one of those things!! But I got lucky and won it as a door prize at the Annual Police Christmas Party!\nMaya:\nThey really pay you peanuts don't they?\nGumshoe:\nPeanuts? I don't even get paid enough for peanut butter, let alone peanuts!\nLightpost\nGumshoe:\nThe safety lights around the circus are kept on all night long. So, they should have been on at the time of the murder...\nPhoenix:\n(So he's saying the murder took place in the light...?)\nGumshoe:\nHow strange...\nMaya:\nHow strange indeed... Hmm...\nMuddy footprints\nPhoenix:\nThis is the only place that the snow has been trounced upon.\nMaya:\nThe murderer was sloppy leaving all these prints all over!\nGumshoe:\nNo no no no no... We're the ones who left the prints... An investigation can be a messy thing sometimes.\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nI also slipped and fell in that spot over there. The other detectives all got a good laugh when the prosecutor whipped me. Thank god there was all this snow around to bring down the swelling.\nPhoenix:\n(It's great to know that the police aren't worried about preserving the evidence...)\nTalk\nTomorrow's trial\nPhoenix:\nDo you know who will be the prosecutor in court tomorrow?\nGumshoe:\nOf course. It will be Ms. von Karma.\nPhoenix:\nUhhh... She isn't gonna hit me with her whip again, is she?\nGumshoe:\nWhat do you have to worry about? You only have to see her in court! When she shows up at the precinct, the sound of that whip never ends, pal.\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe... I'm sure Ms. von Karma's really interesting and all, but... (Changed from [Detective Gumshoe... That's enough about Von Karma.] in the original release) there's someone else I'd rather talk about. (Chagned from [What about that guy? What is he up to?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nLike who? (Changed from [That guy?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nLike Mr. Edgeworth, of course! (Changed from [What happened to Edgeworth?] in the original release) You know! Nick's true rival, Miles Edgeworth! (Changed from [You know! The Edgeworth that's Nick's rival!] in the original release) What in the world happened after I went back home!? (Changed from [What in the world happened when I went back home!?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth... You haven't heard what happened to him?\nMaya:\nNick won't tell me!\nGumshoe:\nWell, to be honest... I'm not at liberty to tell you either. Let's just say he's not around anymore.\nMaya:\nHe's not around!?!? Nick! What does he mean Mr. Edgeworth isn't around!?\nPhoenix:\nExactly what he said. He's not around. Edgeworth is gone... Don't say his name again, OK?\nMaya:\nN-Nick?\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nThe Ringmaster of the circus was murdered, wasn't he?\nGumshoe:\nYep. Last night around 10 PM. He died outside in the cold. A pretty sad way to go out if you ask me, pal.\nMaya:\n... It was rather cold.\nGumshoe:\nThis is the scene of the crime, pal. The body was found right over there. Right about where you are standing now.\nMaya:\nAHHHHHHHHHHH!!\nGumshoe:\nHo! Ho! Ho! Surprised you, didn't I?\nMaya:\nI'm not laughing!\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, but do you mind telling me what happened to the victim?\nGumshoe:\nHe was killed by a blow to the noggin, pal.\nMaya:\nYeep!\nGumshoe:\nIt's pretty clear cut as far as murders go. He was discovered quickly. But...\nPhoenix:\nBut?\nGumshoe:\nThere's just one thing that doesn't quite fit.\nMaya:\nHah! There always seems to be something that doesn't quite fit!!\nSomething unusual (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat was this one thing that just didn't quite fit? The thing you mentioned earlier.\nGumshoe:\nFootprints, pal. Footprints.\nMaya:\nFootprints?\nGumshoe:\nLook at this picture of the crime scene...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this? This wooden box under the body?\nGumshoe:\nNo clue, pal. Some forensics experts took it back and are examining it now.\nMaya:\nAnd... And... What is so mysterious about the footprints?\nGumshoe:\nWhoa. Calm down now. Take a good look at the footprints in this picture.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim's footprints are on the scene.\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The problem is...\nMaya:\n...! The killer's footprints aren't there!!\nGumshoe:\nBingo. Where did the killer come from, and where did the killer run off to? Obviously, there is no way the killer committed this crime while flying.\nPhoenix:\nA flying... culprit? (Changed from [A flying... Criminal?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(That's when something just clicked in my head...)\nMaya:\nT-There's no way! Flying is impossible!\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. Flying is impossible! Absolutely impossible! Haha...\nGumshoe:\nWhat's with the hollow laugh, pal?\nPhoenix:\nI meant nothing by it, pal...\nGumshoe:\n...?\nPhoenix:\n(Better stated, it means I don't want to talk about it. Maybe I can get some info about Max out of him...)\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nSomething unusual (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nWhat was this one thing that just didn't quite fit?

So about the eyewitness... (Changed from [Umm... How about any eyewitnesses...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nHo! Ho! Ho! You know I'm not going to tell you that! That's the prosecution's trump card!!\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Oh well...\nGumshoe:\n... Oh! I just remembered!!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nI forgot to mention that you two are barred from entering that lodging house.\nMaya:\n...? Why is that?\nGumshoe:\nOh... No reason! Just something I remembered to tell you.\nMaya:\nIt must be because that's where the eyewitness is. (Changed from [It must be because there's an eyewitness inside that Lodging House.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nLet's check it out!\nGumshoe:\nDon't you dare, pal! (Changed from [Oh no you don't, pal!] in the original release)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nGumshoe:\nC'non. You've flashed that badge at me so many times it doesn't work anymore! Why don't you try wearing a different badge every now and again?\nMaya:\nWell... I do have a Steel Samurai Badge with me. How about that one?\nPhoenix:\nI'll only wear it if Detective Gumshoe carries a Steel Samurai Police Badge.\nMaya:\nThen it's a deal! I hear that Detective Gumshoe has that very badge! ...\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? Don't look at me like that!! You're making me nervous!\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nBeing a spirit medium is quite an accomplishment... And you're so young too! That's really something!!\nMaya:\nActually, I've been thinking of taking a break from channeling.\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nMaya:\nI don't want to have another incident like last time.\nMax profile\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like Max is the most unpopular guy in the circus tent. You know what they say... A bad attitude follows you everywhere...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, he's a bit arrogant, but he didn't seem that bad.)\nMaya:\nBut just because someone has a bad attitude doesn't make them a criminal.\nGumshoe:\nIt's not just his attitude... I've got proof, pal!\nMaya:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nHe left something at the scene of the crime! One of his magician's trademarks! An incredibly well-made silk hat.\nMaya:\nWell it does have very classy decorative elements.\nSilk Hat added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nMax uses a cloak, silk hat, and white roses as his signature symbols.\nPhoenix:\n... Pretty mundane, aren't they?\nMaya:\nWho cares if they are mundane!? At least they are easy to understand!!\nPhoenix:\n(I must have hit a nerve...)\nGumshoe:\nThat's what he said.\nPhoenix:\nWho said?\nGumshoe:\nThe eyewitness.\nMaya:\nEh!?\nPhoenix:\nT-Tell us about the eyewitness!!\nMax profile (subsequent times)\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like Max is the most unpopular guy in the circus tent.

I'm making a really strange tired looking face here...\nMaya:\nHmm... Are you sure you weren't born looking like that?\nGumshoe:\nI wish I was more lively... ... Right now, I'm just tired.\nMaya:\nWell, there's not much you can do about that, so you just gotta keep on being tired!\nGumshoe:\nYou're right!\nPhoenix:\n(Glad I stayed out of that one...)\nFranziska von Karma profile\nGumshoe:\nYou're going down this time, pal!\nPhoenix:\nOh... Is that right?\nGumshoe:\nShe's been practicing 100 cracks a day, pal.\nPhoenix:\nCracks? Wait... You don't mean cracks of the...\nGumshoe:\nYep. Cracks of the WHIP!\nPhoenix:\nUhhh...\nAnything else\nGumshoe:\nYou know I can't tell you two anything about the evidence we have gathered!\nMaya:\nStingy!\nGumshoe:\n... Stingy!? When you put it so bluntly, it kinda hurts my feelings, pal...\nAfter clearing \"The eyewitness\" Talk option in Lodging House - Plaza:\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room\nPhoenix:\nI wonder whose room this is. (Changed from [This is it?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nThe nametag on the door says \"Moe\" on it.\nPhoenix:\nI guess he's not here...\nMaya:\nWow... It's a real mess in here!\nPhoenix:\n(My room's probably worse though...)\nMaya:\nOh well... I give up. We'll have to come back later.\nExamine\nCostumes\nPhoenix:\nAll those clown costumes lined up like that... I dunno about you, but it's creepy.\nMaya:\nLook at the collection he's got! It's incredible!\nPhoenix:\nIt must be a collection of clown costumes from around the world.\nMaya:\nOh! I almost forgot!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it now? (She better not want me to try one of those on!)\nMaya:\nI was thinking of starting a costume collection myself! I'll call it \"World Spirit Channels\"... We can display it in our office!\nPhoenix:\nIn OUR office!? As soon as you start paying the bills, you can say that.\nBoarded up cracks in ceiling\nPhoenix:\nLook at the ceiling... It looks like someone punched a hole in it!\nMaya:\nYou're right. I wonder what happened?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I don't even want to imagine what goes on in here.)\nCarrots\nMaya:\nWhat the!? There's a string of carrots here!\nPhoenix:\nHow strange. The carrots seem to come in all different shapes... Weird... I can't tell if Moe just likes carrots, or if he is using them for some sort of gag.\nWindow\nMaya:\nNick, you can see the scene of the crime from here.\nPhoenix:\n(You can even tell that the ground has been disturbed...)\nMaya:\nIt's right in front of this window, about 30 feet away.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it wouldn't have been strange for someone to have seen the crime from here.)\nPajamas\nPhoenix:\nMoe's got an excellent pair of pajamas... Laid on his bed in an excellent manner.\nMaya:\nWhat? Those are pajamas? You mean he goes to bed dressed as a clown? Eww...\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMoe seems to be a voracious reader. Look at all the hard books he has here. \"Clowns for Dummies\", \"The Joke's On You\", \"Treat Your Peons Right\", And the classic \"Funny Jokes Are Funny.\"\nMaya:\nWow. Moe is very studious.\nPhoenix:\n\"The Joke's On You\"... Huh?\nClown equipment\nMaya:\nTee hee... Clown equipment is so funny looking!\nPhoenix:\nHe's got a balancing ball, a unicycle... He's even got a trampoline!! ... But they're all broken.\nMaya:\nMaybe he was just a little too excited during practice?\nPhoenix:\n(Who knows with that guy. Maybe that's part of the gag?)\nShoes or banana peel\nMaya:\nAwesome! Look at these shoes! They're great!\nPhoenix:\nForget the shoes! Check out the great gag banana peel!\nMaya:\nYou sure it wasn't Moe's snack after lunch?\nPhoenix:\n(Are you blind? Look at how many scratches there are from people slipping on it!!)\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusBig Top\nPhoenix:\nThe circus stage sure doesn't look this small from out in the audience...\nMaya:\nWow... This is where they all perform, isn't it? Nick! Do some somersaults!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not doing any somersaults.\nMaya:\nWhy not!? You look like you'd be great at it!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I look like I'd be great at somersaults!?)\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...\nMaya:\nHuh? Nick?\nPhoenix:\nIt wasn't me.\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrrrr... Grawwwwwww!!\nMaya:\nT-T-T-T-T-T-T... TIGER!!\nPhoenix:\nH-H-H-He's c-c-coming this way!!\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrr... Grawwwwwww!!\nPhoenix:\nAHHHHHHHHHHH!!\nMaya:\nNick! You're too young to die! NICK!!\n???:\nSTAY! STAY! HEEL!\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrr...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm still here... I'm not dead, yet!!)\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Nick! Are you OK?\n???:\nAhahaha! Scared ya didn't I? Regent is such a cute tiger! Isn't he!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\n...\n???:\nWhat's the matter? You two sure are quiet.\nMaya:\nDon't \"What's the matter?\" me! N-Nick... He almost died there!!\n???:\nHah! He wasn't anywhere close to getting hurt, let alone dying! This little tiger hardly ever bites people. And besides, people normally never get to play with a wild tiger, right? So if you think about it, you're actually really lucky!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\n???:\nYou agree, don't you?\nPhoenix:\n... I guess...\nMaya:\nW-W-W-What do you mean you guess!? Why are you agreeing with her?\n???:\nWoohoo!! Your costume...\nMaya:\nEh?\n???:\nIt's cute. I wanna try it on!!\nMaya:\nC-Costume? You mean my clothes...?\n???:\nYou don't mind letting me try it on, right?\nMaya:\nUhh... I guess not...\n???:\nREALLY!? Hehehehehe!! You're the best!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... The tables turned quickly on that one. So much for the tiger thing...)\n???:\nOh! I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Regina Berry... The renowned animal tamer of the Berry Big Circus!\nMaya:\nMy name's Maya Fey. I'm a spirit medium.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix Wright. Attorney at law. (When you put us up next to an animal tamer, I bet we really look odd!)\nRegina:\nNice to meet ya!\nPhoenix:\nUhh... Likewise...\nExamine\nAudience wing\nMaya:\nThe seats are kinda far away don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nThey are, but it also means that lots of people can fit in the big top.\nRegina:\nHe's right. We can fit 500 people into a show.\nMaya:\nFive hundred... That's amazing.\nRegina:\nFlying around above that many people is a \"real rush\". At least that's what Max said.\n(Step)ladder\nMaya:\nAh, a ladder.\nPhoenix:\nIt's just a stepladder.\nMaya:\nWhat's the difference? They do the same thing, right? I think you should stick with the basic facts of the matter.\nPhoenix:\nOh... Uh... OK. (It's not even worth arguing with her on this one.)\nLion prop\nMaya:\nLook! That's where Max comes out during the show!!\nPhoenix:\nI've got to admit, that was a pretty cool effect!\nRegina:\nWe're planning for me to start coming out of the lion during the show.\nPhoenix:\nThat's great Regina!\nRegina:\nYeah. I will ride on Regent's back and jump out of the lion's mouth.\nMaya:\nI wanna try it too! I'll ride on Nick's back and jump out of the lion's mouth!\nPhoenix:\n(Sometimes I wonder about this girl...)\nBoxes\nPhoenix:\nThere doesn't seem to be anything here that can help us... Not a single clue.\nMaya:\nYou know I've been meaning to ask you... What exactly do you mean when you say \"clue\"? What are you looking for?\nPhoenix:\n... A bloody chainsaw for instance...\nMaya:\nWell there's definitely not one of those here...\nRope\nMaya:\nHey! It's a rope!\nPhoenix:\nProbably for tightrope walking...\nMaya:\nThat's a bit strange... There weren't any tightrope walkers in the show when we saw it.\nSpotlights\nMaya:\nWhoa! Those lights are huge!\nRegina:\nI love lights!! Whenever I appear under the spotlight, everyone claps for me!\nMaya:\nThat's because everyone knows that you're cute!\nRegina:\nNo... I'm not cute. You're cute!\nMaya:\nMe!?\nRegina:\nOf course! I'm sure you'd make an incredible heroine!\nMaya:\nReally!? You think so!? Nick! Did you hear that!? Me!! A heroine!! What about Nick, Regina?\nRegina:\n... Hmm... Nick...\nMaya:\nHe's no hero, is he?\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch... Thanks a lot Maya!)\nTalk\nWhat happened\nMaya:\nHey Regina... What do you know about what happened last night?\nRegina:\nYou mean the murder...?\nPhoenix:\nUh huh.\nRegina:\nMy dad was murdered.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I see... (Wait! What did she just say!?) (Changed from [I can't imagine how hard this must be for you... (Urk! That was insensitive!)] in the original release)\nMaya:\nSo... the Ringmaster was your... (Changed from [That's right! The Ringmaster was your...] in the original release)\nRegina:\nYep. The Ringmaster was my dad.\nMaya:\nI'm so sorry about what happened to him...\nRegina:\nWhy do you say you're sorry?\nMaya:\nHuh? (Changed from [Eh?] in the original release)\nRegina:\nAnyways... Everyone was here practicing last night.\nPhoenix:\nEven your dad?\nRegina:\nYes. Everyone was here. We finished up around 10 PM. After that, everyone went off on their own. I was the only one who stayed around here.\nMaya:\nWhy did you do that?\nRegina:\nI was playing with Regent.\nPhoenix:\n(Regent... So she was with that beast...)\nRegina:\nThat's when the police showed up. When they took me to check things out, Dad was dead.\nPhoenix:\n(For someone whose father was just murdered, she seems awfully perky... (Changed from For someone who's [sic] father was just murdered, she seems awfully perky...] in the original release) I wish she would tell us more about her dad...)\nRegina\nMaya:\nThat's incredible that you are an animal tamer!\nRegina:\nIf you say so...\nMaya:\nIt has to be really scary!\nRegina:\nScary? Why?\nMaya:\nHuh?\nRegina:\nRegent isn't scary! He's cute! Ever since Léon died, Regent has been my best friend.\nPhoenix:\nLéon?\nRegina:\nYes. Léon the lion.\nPhoenix:\n(Léon the lion... Regent and Regina... Interesting name choices...)\nMaya:\nLéon... He died?\nRegina:\nYes. Actually he was killed. My dad killed him.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nMaya:\nWhy did he do that?\nRegina:\nI'm not sure why he did it.\nPhoenix:\n(It's tough not to get charmed when she looks at you with those innocent eyes...)\n\"What's on your mind?\" (appears after presenting Max profile)\nMaya:\nRegina... What's the matter? What's on your mind?\nRegina:\n*giggle* I'll tell you Maya... But just you.\nPhoenix:\nAh!\nRegina:\nUmm... Well... *mumble* *mumble*\nMaya:\nWhat!? REALLY!?!?\nRegina:\nAnd then... *mumble* *mumble*\nMaya:\nOh my! That's incredible Regina!!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nC'mon Nick. There's no reason to pout!\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry about me...\nMaya:\nRegina told me that someone professed their love to her!\nPhoenix:\nP-P-P-Professed their love!?\nMaya:\nNot only that! It was Maximillion Galactica!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder how many people have stolen one of his hearts anyways...?)\nMaya:\nAnd then, on the exact same day, another person professed their love for her as well!!\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Who was it!?\nMaya:\nSomeone named Trilo.\nPhoenix:\nTrilo...?\nMaya:\nApparently he is a tenor who sings in the circus.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Haven't met him yet.)\nMaya:\nRegina seems to be quite the hit with the men in the circus!\nPhoenix:\nShe must have some sort of strange power over them!\nMaya:\nYou're not kidding. Two people in one day! Even I want to profess my love for her!\nPhoenix:\n(Me too! She's so cute...)\nRegina:\n*giggle*\nPresent\nSilk Hat\nRegina:\nThis silk hat is Max's.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right.\nRegina:\nIt's beautiful isn't it? I thought up the idea for wearing the hat.\nMaya:\nHuh? Really?\nRegina:\nYep. He took my sketch to the hat shop... And they made a custom hat for him based off the sketch. There is only one of these silk hats in the entire world! Isn't that cool?\nMaya Fey profile\nRegina:\nMaya... You're a spirit channeler?\nMaya:\nYep! I'm still training though.\nRegina:\nThat sounds like fun! I think you should join us at the circus!\nMaya:\nHuh? As a spirit channeler?\nRegina:\nYeah! You'd be a big hit!\nMaya:\nReally!? She says I'd be a big hit!\nPhoenix:\n(I think she's just being nice.)\nMax profile\nRegina:\nIt's Max!! Hey... Where is Max now anyways?\nPhoenix:\nY-You don't know?\nRegina:\nNope.\nPhoenix:\nHe's been arrested. He was charged with the murder of your father.\nMaya:\nIt's OK! Nick and I will help him!\nRegina:\nMax isn't the guy, is he? I mean... The criminal?\nPhoenix:\nOf course he's not!\nRegina:\nI'm worried about so many things right now...\nMaya:\nHmm... Like what?\nRegina:\n*giggle*\nFranziska von Karma profile\nRegina:\nCool! This lady's got a whip! She's an animal tamer, huh?\nMaya:\nHmm... Sort of...\nPhoenix:\n(Two women with whips... That's my cue to shut up and act like a good boy...)\nRegina Berry profile\nRegina:\nAlright! I look so cute in this picture! Don't you think I look cute? Don't ya? Don't ya?\nMaya:\nYou sure do!\nPhoenix:\nNo objections here!\nRussell Berry profile\nRegina:\nAfter practice was over, Dad went right back to his room.\nMaya:\nHis room?\nRegina:\nYes. That door right over there leads to the Ringmaster's room.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nRegina:\nI dunno why, but he went off to his room in a hurry. I wonder what happened?\nPhoenix:\n(The Ringmaster's room... It's probably a good idea to check it out for myself.)\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this? What can you tell me?\nRegina:\nUmm... I'm not really good at figuring out hard things.\nMaya:\nReally? You too? I understand exactly what you mean...\nPhoenix:\n(I never expected Maya to make a new friend in a strange place like this...)\nAny other profiles\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this person?\nRegina:\nSorry...\nPhoenix:\nSorry?\nRegina:\nI've already given my heart to another man. So I'm not interested in enrolling in your dating service.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I just wanted to know if you knew this person.\nDetention Center\nPresent\nSilk Hat\nMax:\nAhh! This is my silk hat! It's the only one of its kind in the world. It's one of my most prized possessions. This silk hat proves that I was somewhere else... Where did they find this? Huh, sweetie?\nPhoenix:\nThey found it at the murder scene.\nMax:\nAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! I... I... I don't know nothing about nothing!\nMaya:\nEww... Max is so pathetic like this...\nPhoenix:\n(Max must be really confused...)\nCrime Photo\nMax:\nThat's... That's the Ringmaster. ... It's a shame what happened... He was going to be like a father to me...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nRegina Berry profile\nMax:\nAhhh... My sweetie pie. She must be really lonely with me all cooped up in here.\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, she was laughing and rolling around with her tiger...)\nMax:\nShe is my special someone. And I am her special someone.\nMaya:\nUh-huh... Very complex...\nAny other profiles\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this person?\nMax:\nUnfortunately I don't take on apprentices. I mean, just look at the face on this one... It's not what I'd call fabulous.\nPhoenix:\n(That's awfully harsh...)\nAfter clearing \"Something unusual\" and \"The eyewitness\" Talk options in Lodging House - Plaza, and visiting Big Top:\nDecember 28Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\n... Max isn't here.\nPhoenix:\nHe must be in questioning.\nMaya:\nAww... I wanted to see a magic trick.\nPhoenix:\nHe should be back in a little bit.\nMaya:\nI guess so.\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera.\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. I wonder if he is bored? He doesn't even try to glance over this way...\nLodging House - Plaza\nPresent\nAny other profile\nGumshoe:\nI've gotten affidavits from most of the performers at this circus. They are certainly a strange bunch of characters.\nMaya:\nYou don't say?\nGumshoe:\nWell, not stranger than you I suppose.\nMaya:\n... That was cold...\nGumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry. I was just messing around.\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nSilk Hat\nMaya:\nThis silk hat really does look like it can fly!!\nPhoenix:\nIt does have a feather on it. Maybe that's why you think it can take off.\nMaya:\nYou're right! Nick, I bet you could wear a hat like this! This is like one of those hats a famous detective would wear!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I guess so...\nMaya:\nBut... With a head as big as yours, you'd probably bust a hole in the* ([sic]) it!\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPhoenix:\nNo matter what the crime, we always meet the same detective at the scene.\nMaya:\nSometimes it seems like he's the only detective on the force. That would make Gumshoe really elite, wouldn't it?\nPhoenix:\n(Something tells me that no matter how you look at it, he's anything but elite...)\nFranziska von Karma profile\nMaya:\nYou know, if she wasn't so mean, I think she and I would get along...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but that's the problem... She is so mean. And that whip... That thing hurts. It really hurts.\nMaya:\nIt is kinda cool though. I wouldn't mind having a whip myself. I bet that cracking the whip on you once or twice would be just what the doctor ordered!\nPhoenix:\nW-Why me!? W-What did I do!?\nRegina Berry profile\nMaya:\nRegina is sooo cute!\nPhoenix:\nI have to admit that her smile does have a sort of hypnotic power.\nMaya:\nCan you believe that she's an animal tamer? That's sooo cool! I'd like to try animal taming someday. Nick! Nick! Lie down! Roll over!!\nPhoenix:\nOnce this case is solved, I'll roll over for you as many times as you want!\nMaya:\nYAY!!! Remember, you promised, Nick!\nRussell Berry profile\nMaya:\nEveryone loved the Ringmaster...\nPhoenix:\nSo I'm told. Why would anyone want to kill such a beloved man of the big top?\nMaya:\nMotive will surely be a point of contention tomorrow in court.\nPhoenix:\n(You can count on that...)\nAfter presenting Russell Berry profile in Berry Big Circus - Big Top:\nDecember 28Big TopRingmaster's Room\nMaya:\nThis was the Ringmaster's room?\nPhoenix:\nYes. This room belonged to the victim. Which means this must be where Max met the Ringmaster last night.\nMaya:\nNow that you mention it, that is what he said.\nPhoenix:\nI wonder what... Hmm... That's an interesting poster. (Changed from [I wonder what... Hmm... That's an intresting [sic] poster.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nAh! It's a poster of Max! I want it! I want it! Nick! I want it!\nPhoenix:\nI wanna get outta here...\nExamine\nPhotos\nMaya:\nNick... Look at all the photos lined up on the wall...\nPhoenix:\nIt's like a guided tour of the circus' history.\nMaya:\nThis is so cool! It seems like there were so many happy memories. Maybe we should do this sort of thing at our office? We can put up pictures of all the clients who have been found not guilty.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what if we had a client who was found guilty? (Changed from [What about the clients who were found guilty?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nUmm... We'll just pretend like they don't exist. How's that? ... Nick! Now you've got me thinking about losing cases! Why'd you do that!?\nFrames\nMaya:\nAll of these frames look the same.\nPhoenix:\nThey almost look like... Thank You cards. It looks like every year the Ringmaster made donations to charity... To the Robot Clown Research Center...\nMaya:\n... You're kidding right?\nPhoenix:\nWhat!? They may be a perfectly reputable charity in the field of advanced tomfoolery!\nTrophy case\nMaya:\nNick! Look at all the cute trophies!!\nPhoenix:\nIndeed. Just look at all the awards this circus has won...\nMaya:\nLike... \"All County Quiz Champions\"... \"Ringmaster's Association Mini Golf Master\"... \"Beer Belly Balloon Bounce Champ\"... \"Pet Grooming Grand Prix\"... Wow. The Ringmaster was multi-talented in ways I could have never imagined...\nPosters\nMaya:\nThere's a lot of posters here don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nThere are indeed.\nMaya:\nSo many posters that they aren't likely to miss one, are they?\nPhoenix:\nMaya... We're supposed to be the honest ones around here.\nMaya:\nBut... But... You didn't even notice that I took one!\nPhoenix:\n(Arghhh... She already swiped one!)\nMaya:\nHeh! Heh!\nPhoenix:\nYou're incorrigible, you know that?\nMax G. Promo Poster added to the Court Record.\nPosters (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nLook at all the stars on this poster... This must have been the poster they used to promote their public appearances.\nMaya:\nPosters are the way to go aren't they?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nMaya:\nWe should make posters to promote our law firm. \"Spine tingling legal action! Mind numbing legalese! You will say 'wow'!\" Or perhaps, \"Hold it! Don't miss out on a stunning life or death courtroom thrill ride!\"\nPhoenix:\nWith those taglines, our law firm would sink faster than the Titanic...\nTailcoat\nMaya:\nYou may not know this, but they call this a \"tailcoat\".\nPhoenix:\nAnd they call this \"the face of someone who already knew that...\" Hmm...\nMaya:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nA scrap of white paper is sticking out of the coat pocket.\nMaya:\nHuh? Where? Where?\nPhoenix:\nCalm down, Maya. You can't just go rummaging through people's coats!\nMaya:\nAhhh... You always make me feel like I'm doing something wrong...\nMirror\nMaya:\nThis is where the Ringmaster applied his makeup.\nPhoenix:\nIt's quite a collection of the most understated colors. Shocking Pink for example.\nMaya:\nThis one says it is \"100% All Natural Organic Mascara.\"\nPhoenix:\nAnd this one says \"Sensitive enough for a baby, strong enough for a mime.\"\nMaya:\nThe Ringmaster must have been really concerned about skin care... Very metrosexual.\nDesk\nMaya:\nThis is strange... Everything else looks nice, but this desk looks old and cheap.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a really big photo on the desk... It's a picture of Regina and her father, the Ringmaster.\nMaya:\nHe really loved her didn't he? Regina was lucky to have such a wonderful father.\nTable\nPhoenix:\nIt's a table for guests... There are some papers scattered on top.\nMaya:\nAh! Look at this! Max's salary is written on this piece of paper. YIKES!\nPhoenix:\nW-What is it?\nMaya:\nI didn't know that a magician... This salary is incredible!\nPhoenix:\n(She looks like she's about ready to pass out from shock...) How much is it!? How much is it!? T-T-THAT MUCH!?\nMaya:\nIncredible, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYou can say that again. (This must be the paper they used to negotiate Max's salary... The Ringmaster signed and dated it...)\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nMax definitely got a raise... But this document is dated a week ago!\nRingmaster's Papers added to the Court Record.\nTable (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis was the table he used when visitors came to see him.\nMaya:\nEww... There's mud caked on the table.\nPhoenix:\nSomeone with terrible manners must have put their shoes up on the table!\nMaya:\nNick! Don't even think about it!\nPhoenix:\nI wasn't!

Hey Nick! Look over there!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nThere's someone over there! Ex-Excuse me!\n???:\n...\nPhoenix:\nHello.\n???:\n...\nMaya:\nWow! He sure is a quiet one! Excuse me!!\n???:\nWha... Ha... Huh? M-Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. You work at the circus don't you?\n???:\nN-No. I'm just your everyday average Joe.\nMaya:\nAn average Joe who just happens to hang out at the circus? I don't think so.\n???:\nY-Yes I am. I've got nothing to do with what's going on here.\nPhoenix:\n(He's lying. Like any regular person would hang around the circus... Dressed like that!) I'm an attorney. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\nI'm a spirit medium. My name is Maya.\n???:\nWell... I... Um... Just happened to be... Umm... Passing by...\nPhoenix:\nI don't suppose you happen to be some kind of carny?\n???:\nNot a c-c-carny... I-I'm a p-performer. Actually, I'm a v-v-v-ventriloquist.\nMaya:\nVentriloquist?\n???:\nHe-he-he-he-he-he-he... I-I-I'm Benjamin Wo-Wo-Wo-Woodman...\nMaya:\nYour last name is Woodman? *snicker* (Changed from [You're [sic] last name is Woodman? *snicker*] in the original release)\n???:\nY-Yes... T-T-That's right... But e-everyone c-c-calls me B-B-B-B-B-Ben.\nMaya:\nAh... Yes yes yes... That's your alias, right?\nPhoenix:\nI believe they call it a stage name.\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, Ben?\nBen:\nUh... Yes? You mean... Me?\nPhoenix:\nAbout the murder. I'd like to talk to you about the details, if I may.\nBen:\nR-Really... I'm just a regular normal guy... I don't k-k-now... A-a-a-a...\nPhoenix:\n(This guy's so nervous, he's creeping me out.)\nMaya:\nNick. Cheer up! Just try and smile!\nMax Galactica\nMaya:\nWould you mind telling us something about Max? Maximillion Galactica.\nBen:\nMa-Ma-Ma-Max? H-H-H-He's... N-N-N-Not... V-Very... N-N-Nice.\nPhoenix:\n(Did he just say that Max is \"Not Very Nice\"?)\nBen:\nO... O... O... Oww... My... H-H-Head... Hurts.\nPhoenix:\n(Yikes. I hope he is OK. It sounds like he just popped a gasket...)\nVentriloquism\nMaya:\nBen, so you're a ventriloquist?\nBen:\nI-I-I-I'm... J-J-J-Just A-A... R-R-R-Regular... G-G-Guy...\nPhoenix:\nYou already told us that you were a ventriloquist!!\nBen:\nOh... Y-Y-Yes...\nMaya:\nNick! Don't yell at him! You can't do that!!\nPhoenix:\nI can't help it! He's making me nervous!!\nMaya:\nBen, do you mind showing me some of your skills as a ventriloquist?\nBen:\nW-W-Well... I-I-I... R-R-R-Right... N-N-Now... M-M-My... P-P-P...\nPhoenix:\nA-A-A-A-Ah...

I guess we won't need you to look at this after all.\nBig Top\nPresent\nBen profile\nRegina:\nAhh, that guy. His name is Ben, right?\nMaya:\nHuh? You don't know him?\nRegina:\nI dunno...

Promo Poster\nMaya:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the matter, Maya?\nMaya:\nWhich poster is cooler? This one or the Steel Samurai poster?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not a big fan of either one of them.\nMaya:\nI guess putting a poster of a magician in a law office is kinda strange.\nPhoenix:\n(No stranger than a poster of a hunk of junk carrying around a spear!)\nRingmaster's Papers\nMaya:\nLooking at this really makes you think.\nPhoenix:\nLike what?\nMaya:\nNo matter how great a medium I become, there is no way I could make this kind of money.\nPhoenix:\nSo it's money you're after?\nMaya:\nYou only live once, right? Well, then you might as well live it fabulously!\nBen profile\nMaya:\nBeing a ventriloquist sounds like an interesting job.\nPhoenix:\nI bet it's fun once you get good at it.\nMaya:\nMaybe I should give it a try then! Here I go! \"Hello e-e-everyone... I-I-I'm Phoenix Wright.\" \"No matter what the lie or who the liar, I'll expose them for what they are!\" What's the verdict?\nPhoenix:\nYou might want to practice not moving your lips so much.\nMaya:\nY-Yeah...

CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'RE THE BIG WEINER! The one millionth visitor to the room of one Mr. Moe Curls, AKA ME!!\nPhoenix:\n(Earplugs... Must... Find... Earplugs...)\nMoe:\nTo celebrate this momentous occasion, would you care for an organic grape? Just one! Did you get my joke right there!? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMoe:\nI welched on giving you more than one!!\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nMoe:\nNo no no! If it was funny, it is your duty as a human being to laugh!! People who don't laugh are usually last-seen in Lan-sing. Catch my drift? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Maya?\nMaya:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n(This is like some Faustian nightmare...)\nMaya:\nC'mon! It was funny! Clowns are always funny in my book!\nPhoenix:\nIn my book, they're just funny lookin'.\nMoe:\nYou sure do have a great taste in clothes girlie! Look at that garb! You look just like Gretta Garb... OH! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* I'm goin' home...\nMaya:\nNo! Nick! You can't!!\nPhoenix:\nYou know, I can excuse a bad joke or two... But this stooge keeps laughing at his own jokes! That's what I object to!\nMaya:\nOK OK... I get it. But you have to admit he is kinda funny...\nPhoenix:\n(Argghhh... No, I do not have to admit that, because he isn't!)\nMoe:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nExamine\nCostumes\nMoe:\nI look awfully snazzy in these costumes.\nMaya:\nUmm... Did you just use the word \"snazzy\" in a sentence?\nMoe:\nI sure did. These are haute couture from the best international clown designers. At least, that's what they said on the TV shopping channel I use... I like having a big collection so I can match my costume to my mood... And my carrot.\nMaya:\nHehe...\nMoe:\nYou know, I only own one T-shirt. The rest are all clown costumes!\nPhoenix:\n(Snazzy dresser!? More like spazzy dresser if you ask me!)\nBoarded up cracks in ceiling\nMaya:\nThere's a hole in the ceiling... Why is there a hole in the ceiling?\nMoe:\nWell... Umm... I was riding a pogo stick, and I guess I just overdid it a little...\nMaya:\n\"Overdid it a little\"...?\nMoe:\nWhat can I say, sometimes things get a bit crazy in one's college days...\nMaya:\nHuh?\nCarrots\nMoe:\nCarrots are one of my trademark props.\nMaya:\nYep! I saw you use them! You must believe in a carrot and no stick approach. You put the carrot out in front for motivation, but I guess the trick is gauging what flavor you want each day...\nMoe:\nExactly! You were really paying attention, weren't you!? You know, I eat about 5 of those carrots every single day. If you eat that many, you've gotta change up the taste every now and again.\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't understand any of that, nor do I ever want to.)\nPajamas\nPhoenix:\nMoe, you've got quite the collection of pajamas... They really scream out to you.\nMoe:\nYou think they're loud, huh? I kinda thought they were refined... You know, a bit too adult for me to use on stage... That's why I used them as pajamas.\nPhoenix:\n(Wait a second... He sleeps in clown costumes!?)\nDesk\nMoe:\nTake a look at my desk. Aren't I the most studious clown you've ever seen? Every free moment I have, I spend it studying or reading.\nPhoenix:\nThe classic \"Pull My Finger\" or \"Clown Car Maintenance and Repair\".. Not to mention the bestseller \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Pierrots\"...\nMaya:\nUmm... They all seem to cover rather basic topics though...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he is just trying to cover all of his bases?\nMoe:\nExactly! I want to be a renaissance clown!\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad he didn't buy \"How To Be A Funny Clown\"...)\nClown equipment\nMoe:\nUs clowns really take our work seriously. I try to hone my craft day and night, with the latest in jester technology. Unicycles. Trampolines. Balancing Balls. Accordions.\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like you've put quite a bit of wear and tear on that equipment...\nMoe:\nWell... The theme of my act as a clown is... \"How many ways can a fat funny guy fall down?\" I don't care what I break or how I break it, as long as it ends with me on my bum!! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nShoes or banana peel\nMaya:\nWhat's this? A banana peel? *slips*\nMoe:\nOh my! Oh my! What a wonderful fall girlie! You should remember that when you see a banana peel, get ready to fall down! That is one of the basic tenants of clownsmanship.\nMaya:\nOw ow ow ow ow...\nMoe:\nEvery night, I fall down 100 times to practice the proper banana peel breakfall. WHOA! *slip* WHOA! *slip* WHOA! *slip*\nMaya:\nWow. He really is a pro, huh Nick!? His falls are totally different than my slip!\nTalk\nBerry Big Circus\nMaya:\nCould you please tell us more about the Berry Big Circus?\nMoe:\nIt's a Berry Big story... You sure you got that kind of time?\nPhoenix:\n(And the hits just keep on comin'... *sigh*)\nMoe:\nThis circus has been in business for 20 years. We all performed under the guidance of the Ringmaster, Russell Berry.\nMaya:\nTwenty years!? Wow!\nMoe:\nWorking in the circus is never easy, especially nowadays... With movies, TV, and bowling, there is just too much competition.\nMaya:\nBut... But... I LOVE THE CIRCUS!\nMoe:\nI love it too... That is why I've been here for 20 years. We work hard to keep the show running. No one sends in the clowns on us!\nMaya:\nNick! He just made a joke! Laugh!!\nPhoenix:\nHar! Har! Har! Har! Har! Har!\nMoe:\nThe Ringmaster was a real big shot in the circus world. A real class act. Even when there were no customers, Russell would use his own money to pay me. Because he knew that I had a family to care for... He was happy to take care of his employees.\nMaya:\nI see...\nMoe:\nHow could anyone do that to such a wonderful man...!?\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMoe...\nMoe:\nWiggidty-wiggidty-wiggidty WHAT?\nPhoenix:\nUgh...\nMaya:\nI'm sorry Moe. Nick was born without a sense of humor.\nMoe:\nDon't worry about it... How can you fault someone for being born that way?\nPhoenix:\nLet's talk about the murder.\nMoe:\nAhh... Let's see... It must've taken place around 10 PM last night. After rehearsals were finished, I was tuckered out, so I came back here. After I went to bed... That's when I caught a peek of it...\nMaya:\n\"Caught a peek...?\"\nMoe:\nOf the crime.\nPhoenix:\n(Just as we suspected... (Changed from [So this is what Detective Gumshoe was talking about...] in the original release) This guy's the eyewitness to the crime! (Changed from [Moe was the eyewitness to the crime!] in the original release))\nRussell Berry (appears after \"Berry Big Circus\")\nMoe:\nThe Ringmaster was truly ahead of his time. He would always add new elements to the show.\nMaya:\nNew elements...?\nMoe:\nWhen you've been a performer for a long time, your act starts getting a bit stale.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nMoe:\nI realize that even my act can get a bit long in the tooth... Sometimes my jokes can be a bit... Umm... Old-fashion.\nPhoenix:\n\"A bit long in the tooth?\"\nMoe:\nBut that make-believer takes things too far!!\nMaya:\nMake-believer?\nMoe:\nThe magician!! The one that thinks he's all high and mighty!! He had the gall to say to me, \"You're one of those funny types, right?\" What does he mean \"one of those\"!? Well the joke's on him now...\nPhoenix:\nOn him...?\nMoe:\nYep! He got on everyone's nerves!! The day of the murder... ...\nPhoenix:\nGo ahead.\nMoe:\nNope. No way! Just forget I said anything!\nPhoenix:\n(I bet he's still hiding something about Max...)\nWhat you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nYou say you saw the crime. Do you mind telling me what you saw?\nMoe:\nWell, the police told me that I can't share my story with others. \"Don't say a word, pal!!\" I'm just gonna have to let these lips stay zipped! (Changed from ['Don't say a word!!' I'm just gonna have to let these lips stay zipped!] in the original release)\nMaya:\nThat's not fair!\nMoe:\nI guess you're right... Maybe I can tell you a few details. But only if you can get old stiff lips here to make with the funny...!\nPhoenix:\nStiff lips? Wait... Do you mean me?\nMaya:\nNick! You can do it!!\nPhoenix:\n*achem* *achem*\nMoe:\nWhat's the matter?\nPhoenix:\nJust getting ready. OK... Do you know why I, Phoenix Wright, am a great lawyer? Because I'm Wright all the time!!\nMaya:\n...\nMoe:\n...\nMaya:\nAt least his expectations are low.\nMoe:\nI wouldn't let him quit his day job.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeesh, cut a guy some slack. At least it was funnier than Chuckles over here.)\nMoe:\nIt wasn't the greatest joke I've heard, but you did try, so I'll tell you what I saw.\nMaya:\nI'm sorry he's incapable of being funny, Moe.\nMoe:\nThat night... Once I had tucked myself into bed, I heard this amazing noise. It was incredibly loud. It sounded like a giant \"THUMP\"! Once I heard it, I jumped out of bed. That's when I saw... Without question. Without a doubt. It was that magician!! That's all I saw... But it just proves how terrible that man actually is!\nPhoenix:\n(He knows more about Max than he is letting on...)\nPresent\nCrime Photo\nMoe:\nRUSSELL!! How could anyone do this to you... I... I... *sobs*\nMaya:\nMoe's taking this really hard...\nSilk Hat\nMoe:\nIt's that uppity faker's uppity top hat! They found this at the scene of the crime, didn't they?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what I've been told...\nMoe:\nUnbelievable. That jerk killed the Ringmaster!\nMaya:\nIt really is a shame what happened to the Ringmaster, huh Moe?\nPhoenix:\nIt seems that the Ringmaster was truly a great man...\nMax profile\nMoe:\nHmph! If he thinks he can kill the Ringmaster, it's only just that he should die, too!\nMaya:\nMoe!!\nMoe:\nSorry. I crossed the line. But he truly is a disgusting human being.\nMaya:\nWhy do you hate him so much?\nMoe:\nLet me tell you this one story... The morning before the murder, something terrible happened. Max clonked Ben right over the head, as hard as he could.\nPhoenix:\nBen? (The ventriloquist with the speech impediment?)\nMoe:\nYou should go to the cafeteria and investigate for yourselves.\nMaya:\nThe cafeteria?\nMoe:\nLet's just say there's Gotti be something interesting there... Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Ahh yes... The Berry Big Circus is very big, isn't it? You should always carry a map with you to get around...\nMaya:\nAh! Thank you!! Umm... This is an atlas!!\nMoe:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Oh... I kill myself. Really. I'm dying here... CORONARY! CORONARY!\nPhoenix:\n(Now he's just laughing to hear his own voice...)\nCircus Map added to the Court Record.\nMax profile (subsequent times)\nMoe:\nHmph!

Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nRegina Berry profile\nMoe:\nThat's the Ringmaster's daughter, Regina. Ever since she was a little girl, she's been watching the circus performances. Cuter than a little puppy Maltese, that Regina. If only my Larina was that cute...\nMaya:\nLarina?\nMoe:\nAh... Larina is my daughter. She lives with her mother now.\nPhoenix:\n(It's true what they say about the tears of a clown...)\nRussell Berry profile\nMoe:\nI've been friends with Russell since even before the circus began. He was so selfless. He always thought about others before thinking of himself. I'll find a way to return the favor... He always took such good care of me. I wish I would have thanked him more than I did...\nBen profile\nMoe:\nAh, Ben... How's he doing?\nPhoenix:\nHe's a ventriloquist isn't he?\nMoe:\nThat's right! Boy was I surprised when they told me his secret! He's got a second mouth where his belly button should be!! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Just kidding...\nPhoenix:\nBen wouldn't tell me a single thing about the murder.\nMoe:\nAhh... That's a simple problem to solve. He won't talk if he doesn't have his puppet Trilo!\nMaya:\nTrilo...?\nMoe:\nIf Ben doesn't have his ventriloquist's puppet, you'll barely get a word outta him.\nMaya:\nReally?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Master and puppet...)\nMoe profile\nMoe:\nAh!\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter?\nMoe:\nWhenever I see my own pose, I am reminded of my Italian heritage...\nMaya:\nAhhhh... I see... It must be because you have one of those \"Roman Noses\"... Roamin' all over your face.\nMoe:\n...!!\nMaya:\n... I didn't cross the line there did I?\nPhoenix:\nYou went so far past it, you'll need a map to get back!\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this? Anything come to mind?\nMoe:\nAhh... You want some advice on your development as a comedian, right? I see... Well... This is what you do... When you tell a joke, imagine everyone's wearing underwear and dancing the lambada...\nPhoenix:\nUmm... I think that's enough advice for now...\nMaya:\nNick! He was giving you good advice! Don't be so close-minded!!\nAny other profiles\nMoe:\nThis isn't very funny... How am I supposed to know about people who aren't in the circus!?\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nMoe profile\nMaya:\nMoe is a really nice guy, don't you think Nick? He taught us all about the inner workings of the circus.\nPhoenix:\nYep. It definitely made me look at things in a new light.\nMaya:\nAnd he's got such a great sense of humor. It tickles your funny bone, doesn't it?\nPhoenix:\n(Well... I can't argue that some people might find it funny... But the only thing it tickles on me is my desire for high quality earplugs...)\nBig Top\nPresent\nMoe profile\nRegina:\nThat's Moe! He's such a funny clown! He's been a good friend to my dad for a really long time now.\nMaya:\nHe was good friends with the Ringmaster?\nRegina:\nMy dad always said... \"When it comes to who I can entrust the circus to, it's definitely Moe.\"\nMaya:\nHmm... Yep! That clown is one lovable stooge. Don't you think so, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... No comment...\nAfter presenting Max profile in Lodging Hall 1st Floor - Moe's Room:\nDecember 28Big TopCafeteria\nMaya:\nEww... This place is gross.\nPhoenix:\nThis must be because of last night. They didn't have time to clean up after dinner because of the murder.\nMaya:\nThat reminds me... What was it that Moe said?\nPhoenix:\nHe said that yesterday morning Max \"clonked\" Ben over the head here.\nMaya:\nHe also said that, \"There's Gotti be something interesting there.\" Nick? What's \"Gotti be interesting?\"\nPhoenix:\nDon't ask...\nMaya:\nHmph!\nExamine\nKitchen\nPhoenix:\nThe kitchen is over here. Everyone must have taken turns cooking. There's a duty list posted here.\nMaya:\nI wouldn't mind trying my hand at cooking for this many people. Maya's Killer Hamburger... You'd try it, wouldn't you?\nNotice\nMaya:\n\"Keep Our Cafeteria Clean!\"\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't seem like anyone ever read this sign, huh?\nMaya:\nMaybe they should make it easier to understand... \"Clean it or die!\"\nPhoenix:\nWell, that would definitely make them clean up!\nBulletin board\nPhoenix:\nAh, a bulletin board... For... Umm... Bulletins. It doesn't look like there are any useful clues posted here.\nMaya:\nBoring... Maybe we should leave a juicy tidbit for someone to read!\nPhoenix:\nJuicy?\nMaya:\nYou know... Like a fake clue! Hmm... Maybe something like... \"Message from the Killer!\"\nPhoenix:\nGive it up Maya... You know Gumshoe would take it all seriously.\nStand\nPhoenix:\nThis is strange... There's nothing on top of this stand.\nMaya:\nLook here... Max is written on it. It must be his VIP table.\nPhoenix:\nIsn't a bit small to be a VIP table? You won't be putting a ten course meal on this.\nMaya:\nWell, he could still eat hamburgers, right?\nBack table\nPhoenix:\nThere are dirty dishes all over the place... It must have been too hectic last night to clean up.\nMaya:\nYou know I can't stand a mess Nick! I think you and I should clean this place up for them!\nPhoenix:\nW-Why do we have to clean up...!?\nMaya:\nOne, because I hate dirty cafeterias. Two, because one bears repeating.\nPhoenix:\nB-But... This is a crime scene! We can't clean it up! We have to preserve it for evidence!!\nMaya:\nArrrggghh... You know I really hate dirty cafeterias!!\nPhoenix:\n(Not as much as I hate cleaning dirty cafeterias!)\nDining tables\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like they've left it exactly as it was on the night of the murder.\nMaya:\nThey didn't seem too worried about cleaning up the dishes, did they? Hmm... Looking at all these dishes is making me hungry! Let's go get a burger at the snack stand outside.\nPhoenix:\nOnce we're finished with the case.\nMaya:\n... Alright! Then let's get this over with Nick!! Here we go!! Whoahh!\nPhoenix:\n(Where's the mute button when you need it?)\nKnocked over chairs\nPhoenix:\nThe chair's been knocked over.\nMaya:\nThat's what it looks like.\nPhoenix:\nIt almost looks as if someone knocked it over in a struggle, or used it for self defense...\nMaya:\nOr maybe Regent just likes to eat his dinner in the cafeteria?\nSmashed bottle\nPhoenix:\n(What's this? ...Must be a juice bottle or something?)\nMaya:\nAhhh... Watch out Nick! There's broken glass all over the floor! (Changed from [Ahhh... Watch out Nick! Broken glass on the floor is dangerous!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nHmm...

It's my two sweeties! Welcome to the Detention Center!!\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh* Did he just call me his sweetie!? AGAIN!?)\nMax:\nWhat's on today's agenda? What can I help you with?\nPhoenix:\nWell, we've gathered quite a few clues...\nMax:\nWON-DER-FUL-LY FAN-TAB-U-LOSO!!

Let's make this \"absolutely fabulous\"!!\nTalk\nMax Galactica\nMaya:\nWe heard a lot about you at the circus, Max.\nMax:\nAhhh, you just mean from the dinosaurs? How were those Jurassic geriatrics?\nMaya:\nMax, you aren't very popular with the other performers, are you?\nMax:\nYes yes yes. Sweetie, that's what they call jealousy. J-E-A-L-O-U-S-Y. They are absolutely jealous of my absolutely fabulous self! People who really understand can see the obvious differences between us.\nPhoenix:\nPeople who really understand?\nMax:\nFor instance, my sweetie pie.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, so Regina understands him huh?)\nMax:\nI plan on getting married to her. She is truly my sweetie pie princess.\nMaya:\nWow! That's so cool!\nMax:\nIt's already in the works.\nMaya:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(That's strange. Regina never said anything about marrying this joker...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nYou met with the Ringmaster on the night of the murder?\nMax:\nYes. I was with him around 10 PM. Once I was done with practice. I went to his room right after we finished.\nMaya:\nThey found the Ringmaster's body in the plaza in front of the lodging house.\nMax:\nYeah, I head* ([sic]) about that... He needed to step out for a bit, so I waited in his room for him to return.\nMaya:\n...Huh?\nRussell:\n\"Sorry Max. I have something I must attend to right now. Do you mind waiting for me right here?\"\nMax:\n\"It's pretty cold outside. Where's your coat?\"\nRussell:\n\"It's alright. I'll be right back. It should only take about 10 minutes.\"\nPhoenix:\nAnd then?\nMax:\nI waited for him. But he never came back...\nPhoenix:\nDid he go to the plaza where the body was discovered?\nMax:\nPossibly. The snow had tapered off a bit, but it was still very cold outside. But I have no idea what he went off to do...\nMeeting with Russell (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nMax:\nThe truth is... Yesterday morning during breakfast, we had a run in.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you had a fight with Ben the ventriloquist?\nMax:\nYou could put it that way.\nMaya:\nWhy did you fight with him? Ben seems like such a quiet man.\nMax:\nWe fought about my sweetie pie.\nMaya:\nYou mean Regina?\nMax:\nThat ill-bred creep told my sweetie pie princess that he was in love with her! Would you put up with that?\nMaya:\n\"Ill-bred\"!! Are you talking about the same Ben!?\nPhoenix:\n\"Told her he was in love with her\"!! Are you sure this is the Ben we are talking about!?\nMax:\nAll I can say is that he made me mad and I had to tap him on his hard head! That's when the Ringmaster called me and I realized that it was my chance!\nPhoenix:\nYour chance?\nMax:\nThat's when I went to his room and I laid it all out on the table. I asked him to \"Let me marry my sweetie pie!\"\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nMax:\nThe Ringmaster told me that it \"sounds good to me!\" That's why my sweetie pie is MY sweetie pie! And no one else's!\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I see...\nMax:\nSince Ben was causing me so much trouble, I realized I had to shut him up.\nPhoenix:\n(...Shut him up?)\n\"Shut him up\" (appears after \"Meeting with Russell\")\nMaya:\nUm... What do you mean by \"shut him up\"?\nMax:\nYou don't know, do you my sweeties? Trilo can't say a word... Not without Ben. (Changed from [Unless Ben and Trilo are together, Trilo can't say a word.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nTrilo...?\nMax:\nThe puppet. The ventriloquist's puppet. His real name is Trilo Quist.\nPhoenix:\nBut... A puppet doesn't talk.\nMax:\nI know! That's why I hid it! Before the police came and took me away of course... If that puppet started flapping off at the balsa, I'd be screwed.\nMaya:\nYou hid him? You mean the ventriloquist's puppet?\nMax:\nYou are so smart sweetie!\nMaya:\nUmm... Where did you hide him?\nMax:\nWhat? Sweetie... You aren't thinking of trying to add him to my defense are you?\nMaya:\nWell... Ben does seem awfully lonely without his puppet.\nMax:\nFABULOUS! That should have taught him a lesson! OK... I hid Trilo in the Ringmaster's room. You don't mind going there and getting Trilo for me, do you my sweets?\nMaya:\nNo problem! None at all! Thank you Max!!\nMax:\nYou know I can't stand to see my sweeties in a jam!\nPhoenix:\n(Then don't go hiding puppets!)\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nPhoenix:\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- Meeting with Russell --\nPhoenix:\nLast night, you met with the Ringmaster, correct?

The whole truth?\nMax:\nWhat do you mean!?\nPhoenix:\nYou just went to his office to negotiate your new salary?\nMax:\nI hate lies and I hate liars even more! What are you insinuating!?

You haven't listened to me at all!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMax:\nYou're still not listening are you? I said that I HATE LIES!\nPhoenix:\n(It seems this evidence isn't enough to make him confess...)\nMax:\nYou want to try again? It doesn't bother me at all!!\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have any proof that I did something other than negotiate my fee last night?\"\nMax:\nTh-Tha-That's!!\nPhoenix:\nIt was on the table in the Ringmaster's room. You weren't lying when you said that you received quite a raise...\nMax:\nIs there a problem with being well compensated?\nPhoenix:\nNot with the compensation... Just with the date. This is dated a week ago.\nMax:\n...\nPhoenix:\nMax! You finished your contract negotiations a week ago!\nMax:\nF-Fa-Fab-Fabulous!!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nMax:\n... Alright. I'll tell you the truth.

If that's the case, how about you show me some proof.\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have any proof that we got into a knockdown drag out brawl?\"\nPhoenix:\nThis proves it.\nMax:\nWhe-where did you get that?\nPhoenix:\nIsn't it obvious that I found it in the cafeteria, Max?

You know I had to cut the number of symbols to three?\nMaya:\nReally? You had quite a few to begin with then, huh?\nMax:\nWell, I thought that you could never have too many symbols... Sunglasses... Beauty mark... Soft pillows for lips... A beard... Buck teeth... I gave all sorts of symbols a shot. But if I forget one when I put on my makeup, everyone would forget who I am!\nMaya:\nThat's awful... Especially for a magician.\nRingmaster's Papers\nPhoenix:\nCan I ask what you do with such an exorbitant salary?\nMax:\nWe've already covered this point. I'm paying off my father's debt.\nMaya:\nHow could he possibly have such a large amount of debt?\nMax:\nFor example, say you rented a video... And perhaps you forgot about it, for say... a short period of about 10 years. You'd would* ([sic]) have the biggest late fee known to man... It's kinda like that.\nMaya:\nWow... Now I can see how you can get that much debt.\nPhoenix:\n(That makes sense now. Wait a minute... That doesn't make any sense!)\nFranziska von Karma profile\nMax:\nU-Uh-huh... This woman, huh? Well...

Especially after she has eluded my charms for such a long time!\nMaya:\nThere isn't much you can do about that, right?\nMax:\nHmph. You haven't even been truly in love, have you?\nMaya:\nUmm...\nMax:\nWhen you are truly in love with someone... You'd be jealous of their mirror because it traps their image inside.\nMaya:\nAwww... Don't you think that's sweet of him, Nick?\nMax:\nI'm gonna get back with my sweetie pie! Then I'm gonna turn that dumb puppet into a toy glider!\nMaya:\n...I guess you two haven't worked out your differences yet.\nAfter clearing \"\"Shut him up\"\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusCircus Entrance\nMaya:\nHuh?

I wonder if we've been making any progress...\nPhoenix:\nDon't be so negative... Of course we are making progress.\nMaya:\nBut... Everyone loved the Ringmaster...

There's still a lot of mysteries left to be solved.\nPhoenix:\nOf course.\nMaya:\nAnd now Regina isn't here!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not seeing how that's related...\nExamine\nAudience wing\nMaya:\nThe seats are so far away from the ring...\nPhoenix:\nBut they make up for it with the amount of people that can see a show.\nMaya:\nHey Nick...

Look! That's where Max makes his grand appearance!\nPhoenix:\nIt's \"grand\" alright.\nMaya:\n... I want to try entering court like that.\nPhoenix:\n(How'd I know that she'd say that...)\nSpotlights\nMaya:\nWhoa! Those lights are huge! If they fell from the ceiling, you'd be going to the circus in the sky... Life is so fragile, isn't it Nick?\nPhoenix:\nIt can be snuffed out in an instant by falling gargantuan lights.\nMaya:\nIt's so fragile that I've decided to eat as much good food as I can before I die.

It's closed!?\nDecember 28Big TopRingmaster's Room\nMaya:\nIt looks the same as always... A great big mess.

You know I already got one of these posters!!\nPhoenix:\nYou mean \"stole\" one of those posters!\nMaya:\nYeah... Uh... Let's focus on what Max told us.

That's pretty funny.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess I'll just have to find out where Money disappeared to...\nRegina:\nI think that's your best bet. You should probably ask Uncle Moe...

They said they asked for her hand in marriage.\nMaya:\nAhh, but Max only talked to the Ringmaster about it.\nPhoenix:\nI forgot about that. He asked the Ringmaster for her hand, not Regina directly.\nMaya:\nSo I guess Trilo hasn't asked her directly yet.\nRegina:\nWhat!? He's going to propose to me!? I'm so confused... How about you Maya?\nMaya:\nHuh? What?\nRegina:\nWho do you think I should go for? Max or Trilo?\nPhoenix:\nWait... Wait... You do realize that Trilo is... a... puppet?\nRegina:\nUh?

I don't know a thing about magic!!\nMaya:\nSorry we tricked you Nick.\nAfter presenting Trilo Quist, then clearing all Talk options in Big Top - Cafeteria:\nDecember 28Lodging HousePlaza\nMaya:\nHuh? Detective Gumshoe took off already.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Probably because we ditched him earlier. (Changed from [Yep. Just leave him alone for a while, OK Maya?] in the original release) I bet he and the other cops got lonely and headed back to the precinct. (Changed from [I'm sure he just got lonely and headed back to the precinct.] in the original release)\nExamine\nTarp\nPhoenix:\nSomething's covered up by this tarp... An old sign perhaps.\nMaya:\nNick! Look out! They've got the killer trapped behind that tarp!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat? It wasn't funny? You know it wouldn't have hurt you to look even a little bit surprised.\nPhoenix:\n(Whew! She didn't notice that I was too scared to talk!)\nAir conditioner\nPhoenix:\nThis is the condenser for the air conditioner. It hasn't been used in a while.\nMaya:\nWhat!? How'd you figure that out!? You're not making things up now are you!?\nPhoenix:\nHold your horses! It was easy to figure out! It was snowing before the murder, right? Well, look at the condenser. The snow is still piled on top of it.\nMaya:\nWow! Nick! I'm impressed. Maybe you should be a P.I. instead of an attorney.\nLightpost\nMaya:\nThis safety light was on at the time of the murder, wasn't it?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what they say. (There were performers in the lodging house, so it makes sense that it was on. I bet the killer was worried that someone would spot them during the crime...)\nMuddy footprints\nPhoenix:\nThe Ringmaster's body was found here. I heard that the way he fell over made him look like he was carrying a wooden box... But what in the world really happened here?\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room\nMoe:\nOh my! If it isn't \"Mr. Wright All The Time\"!!\nPhoenix:\n*ugh*\nMoe:\nIt's all Wright to be wrong every now and again, Wright?\nMaya:\nSee Nick! It just took awhile for the joke to find its audience!\nPhoenix:\n... *sigh*\nMoe:\nSo what can I do for you? Did you remember a good joke you wanted to tell me? Pull up a chair, or maybe just pull my finger, and let me have it.\nMaya:\nWe're going to get the same sound effect either way, aren't we?\nMoe:\nHow'd you know I put a whopee [sic] cushion on the chair!? You really know what it takes to be a clown, don't you? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nTalk\nRegina\nPhoenix:\nSo, about Regina...\nMoe:\nRegina is such a pure, innocent child...\nMaya:\nShe's such a cutie, too.\nMoe:\nShe was born and raised in the circus you know? But that means she doesn't really know much about the world outside the Big Top.\nMaya:\nSounds like Pearly...\nMoe:\nFor her, every child's \"dream\" of the circus is her everyday reality.\nMaya:\nShe lives in a dream world...\nMoe:\nEveryday she sees dancing wild animals, men flying in the air, and one very funny clown. The funny thing is, that all seems normal to her because it is her everyday life.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that explains why she thinks she can marry a ventriloquist's puppet...)\nMoe:\nDon't ask me if her reality is a good thing or a bad thing though... \"A clown sees life simply, without complications.\"\nMoney the Monkey\nPhoenix:\nHave you ever heard of a monkey named Money?\nMoe:\nAhhh! Yes! Money!\nPhoenix:\nHe stole my Attorney's Badge!\nMoe:\nWell... Money does love shiny objects... It makes sense that he'd swipe your badge. But under no circumstances can you chase after him.\nPhoenix:\nEh? Why's that?\nMaya:\nOh! I know!! You don't want to get involved in any monkey business, right?\nMoe:\nEXACTLY! BRAVO!! BRAVO!! Enough joking around though... Money isn't considered a member of Regina's family.\nMaya:\nThen who does he belong to?\nMoe:\nI'll be happy to take you to where his owner is staying...\nMaya:\nYou mean right now?\nMoe:\nOf course. Shall we go?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, should we go with him now, or wait a while?)\nGo with Moe\nLeads to:\n\"December 28\nLodging Hall 3rd Floor\nAcro's Room\"\nGo later\nPhoenix:\nWe'll go after we talk some more, OK?\nMoe:\nYay! You want to hear me talk some more, huh? Your wish is my command!! I'll give ya the full repertoire of 1001 jokes!\nMaya:\nWoohoo!!\nPhoenix:\nDon't \"Woohoo!!\" that!!\nLeads back to Talk options\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 3rd FloorAcro's Room\nPhoenix:\n*huff* *huff*\nMoe:\nThis is it... What's wrong, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI... can't... breathe...\nMoe:\nDon't be such a wimp! You only had to climb two flights of stairs!!\nPhoenix:\n*pant* *pant*\nMoe:\nAnyways... This is the place. Acro's room.\nPhoenix:\nAcro?\nMoe:\nHe's an acrobat... It seems like he's not around today...\nMaya:\nEh... That's a big pile of junk over in the corner...\nMoe:\nI don't think it'd be wrong to assume that Phoenix's stuff is over there too... Just be careful to make sure you've got the Wright stuff.\nMaya:\nThanks Moe! See you later!\nMoney has been added to the Court Record.\nAcro's Room\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nYou can see the Big Top from the window here.\nMaya:\nThere is no snow on top of the Big Top... Kinda weird don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nThe inside of the tent is warm so any snow that lands on top probably melts.\nMaya:\nI guess you're right. The snow probably just slides right off.\nTire swing\nPhoenix:\nMoney must use this to swing around on...\nMaya:\nGo ahead Nick. I know you want to ride on it too!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe later...\nJunk pile\nLeads to:\n\"Holy cow!\"\nBasketball hoop\nMaya:\nHey... The net's ripped. Money must be prone to breaking things... He's hardcore.\nPhoenix:\nUmm... The net looks fine to me. You really think that he plays basketball?\nMaya:\nI think so... Monkeys live life above the rim you know.\nPhoenix:\n... You're joking right? You think the monkey has got proverbial \"game\"?\nMaya:\nOf course. That monkey doesn't fake the funk on a nasty dunk.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, a prehensile tail might be an unfair advantage...)\nCalendar\nMaya:\nHehe... It's a monkey calendar!\nPhoenix:\nWhoever's in this room must really love monkeys.\nMaya:\nMaybe a little too much... Wow... I just realized that the year is almost over. Amazing how time flies.\nPhoenix:\nIt's been one wild year. Especially the last part...\nMaya:\nWell, we still got one last person to help this year... Max.\nBed\nPhoenix:\nThis bed is incredibly well made. It's almost like a maid made it up. Even the laundry on top of the bed is folded perfectly.\nMaya:\nNick, there's nothing unusual about that at all. It's how things are supposed to be!\nPhoenix:\nCan't a man respect another man for doing something said man cannot do?\nBarbell\nPhoenix:\nHmm... He's got a barbell. Look around... Everything he's got is for upper body training. Wait a second... These are the same machines I see on TV all the time!\nMaya:\nHey, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nI don't have this one! This barbell here is a new model!\nPhoenix:\nDon't overdo it Maya. You don't want to end up a muscle woman.\nMaya:\nHoly cow! There's a fork... And a mirror... Everything's shiny!! There's even a really cheap looking knockoff wristwatch!\nPhoenix:\nLook at this! It's a trophy! And it's really heavy!!\nMaya:\nNick! I found it! Your badge! It's right here!!\nAttorney's Badge returned to its rightful spot on lapel. (Changed from [Phoenix's Attorney's Badge has been returned.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nThanks! You really saved me! ... Huh?\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter? Did you find something?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Check this out.\nMaya:\nIt's a ring...\nPhoenix:\nThere's something engraved on it... \"From T to R\"...\nRing put in pocket.\nPhoenix:\nWell... I think it's about time we wrap up our investigation...\nMaya:\nDo you think we'll win in court tomorrow?\nPhoenix:\nWho knows... Even I can't imagine what kind of testimony will come out tomorrow. (I'm guessing Moe will be a witness in court tomorrow... Moe and maybe the puppet.)\nMaya:\nDon't worry Nick. No matter what, we've still got a magician on our side!!\nPhoenix:\nThat's good, because we might need some magic tomorrow...\nTo be continued.\nMoe's Room (before examining junk pile in Lodging Hall 3rd Floor - Acro's Room)\nMaya:\nHuh? Moe must have gone off somewhere...\nPhoenix:\nJust as long as he isn't off writing new jokes...\nMaya:\nOh, that reminds me Nick... You have to get your Attorney's Badge back by tomorrow, or we're in trouble.\nPhoenix:\nI know. I know. (I'm gonna have to try and find out where that monkey hid it...)\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.\nExit Magatama session\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)\nToo many errors during Magatama session\n...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...\nPhoenix:\n(Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)\n-- About the Proposal --Trilo:\nDon't be so surprised that I was going to propose to Regina!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBy proposal, you mean proposing marriage, correct? To Regina.\nTrilo:\nOf course that's what I meant! What kinda stupid question is that!? I wasn't going to propose that we become sort of outlaw biker gang together!! Right, Ben!?\nBen:\nYe-Yeah...\nTrilo:\nGot it!? That's the truth!Trilo:\nI even had something to give to her...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was it exactly that you planned on giving her?\nTrilo:\nYou know exactly what I was going to give her, numbskull! The only thing I could find that could match Regina's beauty!\nvon Karma:\nAnswer his question! What was it!?\nTrilo:\nYou're gonna die when you hear this... It's an engagement ring!!\nvon Karma:\nEngagement (Changed from [An] in the original release)\nJudge:\nEngagement ring!?!? (Changed from [An Engagement Ring!?!?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... Those two nearly fell out of their chairs!)\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright's joke has gone too far! Time for this to end right here!\nPhoenix:\n(Franziska's whip looks like it's about to lash out at almost anything... One hit from that thing will probably shut someone up for a long time...)\n\n\n\nPain equals bad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'm gonna live to fight another day and shut up now...)\nMaya:\nNick! Don't be such a coward!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPush on anyway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt may be something of a joke, but this is a historic moment! The first time that a puppet has ever proposed to a human being... OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nI advise you to cut this argument short...\nJudge:\nI'm going to have to agree with the defense here. Will the witness please revise their testimony... Specifically about the engagement ring... I'd like to stick to facts, not sociology.\nTrilo:\nYou sure do enjoy sweating the details, especially for a man in a black bath robe...\nChanges statement from \"I even had something to give to her...\" to \"I planned on giving an engagement ring to Regina...\"Trilo:\nI planned on giving an engagement ring to Regina...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAn engagement ring...?\nTrilo:\nUh huh! It's actually a diamond shaped stone cut from glass! Even more brilliant than the real thing! I think Regina is going to love it!\nPhoenix:\n(It's just a ring...)\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWell... There's got to be something I can catch him on...Trilo:\nI kept it in my pocket, waiting for the chance to propose and give it to her.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho's pocket was the ring in?\nTrilo:\nMine of course! What a stupid question!! You've got to be kidding me! You think Ben could pull that off!?\nBen:\nI-I'm s-s-sorry... R-R-Really...\nTrilo:\nYou don't have to apologize for that!! He's the one who should be apologizing!!\nPhoenix:\n(Really?)Present Ring (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Trilo, do you mind if I show you something?\"Trilo:\nOf course, I also had it in my pocket that night. It was a present for her.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you went to the lodging house to give it to her?\nTrilo:\nThat's right! I tried to give it to her during practice so many times that I lost count, but... That uppity snob kept getting in the way!\nMax:\nUppity snob!? He couldn't possibly be talking about me... Maximillion Galactica! When I get a hold of him, I'm gonna saw his wood block in half... And not with magic!!\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWell... They always say that love creates rivalries.\nJudge:\nSo what about this present?Present Ring (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Trilo, do you mind if I show you something?\"Trilo:\nIn the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you are still thinking of trying to give it to Regina...?\nTrilo:\nOf course I am! I spent three months salary on this thing! I'm not gonna give up that easily!\nMaya:\nHmm, I wonder how much he receives for appearing in the circus?\nPhoenix:\nProbably way more than he deserves.Present Ring (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Trilo, do you mind if I show you something?\"Maya:\nHow about it Nick?Phoenix:\nI think it's time to unwrap this toy's testimony.Maya:\nThat's the spirit Nick! Give him heck!Phoenix:\n(The judge has that dazed and confused look again. Maybe he should get out more.) (Changed from [Uh oh, the judge has that dazed look again. Maybe he should get out more.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nTrilo, do you mind if I show you something?Ben:\nWhat is it?Trilo:\nWhat are you talking about!?Phoenix:\n(Uh oh... Looks like they're going to double team me now...) Do you recognize this ring?Trilo:\nAh! That's... That's... That's mine!! Give it back! Thief! Thief!Phoenix:\nDidn't you just testify about this very object? I believe you said... \"In the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!\" Why then, do I have it right here...?Trilo:\nAAAAAAAAAARRRRRGHHHHH!!Judge:\nWhat is going on here!?Trilo:\nThat's... That's... Ben! Say something!!Ben:\nEh? Don't put me on the spot like that Trilo!!Phoenix:\nI found this in Money's room...Judge:\nM-M-Money's room? You mean a room they put money, like a bank vault?Trilo:\nHah! That filthy monkey is gonna get what's coming to him!!Judge:\nMr. Quist, I would prefer if you avoided slandering innocent fiats in my court.Phoenix:\nWell, Your Honor... Money really is a monkey... In every sense of the word.Judge:\nAh. I see... Well then...Phoenix:\nMoney likes to go after the shiniest things that he can find and gather them up.Judge:\nShiny... Things?Phoenix:\nTrilo! When was this ring stolen from you?Ben:\nWell... I suppose it was... That time... You know... That night... The night of the crime...von Karma:\nWhat did you just say!?Phoenix:\nDetails... I need more details...Ben:\nWell... It was stolen right after Max showed up in the plaza...Phoenix:\nRight about when you saw the defendant walk past, correct?Ben:\nWell... Umm... I guess you... Might... Umm... Be able to say that... The ring might have... Well... It could have been... Taken around that time...???:\nOooo-Ooooh!Ben:\nAhhhhh... Yeowwwwwwwww... Ohhhhhhhhhh...Trilo:\nBen! What's with you!? ... Oh, whatever... It has nothing to do with anything! Especially not who committed the murder!!Phoenix:\nIt's not for you to decide what has to do with what! Now, Trilo! Back to the topic at hand!Trilo:\nI haven't admitted a thing! Not I... Mr. Trilo Quist!Phoenix:\nWhat did you do when the ring was taken, Trilo?Trilo:\nYou know exactly what I did! I chased after that ring snatching monkey Money!!Phoenix:\nBut you weren't able to catch up with him, were you?Trilo:\nIt's all this slow loafy fool called Ben's fault! While he was fumbling his way through the snow, that dumb monkey was able to get away!Judge:\nThat is indeed an incredible shame.Phoenix:\nWell... This does indeed prove one very important point.von Karma:\nProve an important point!? What point could that possibly be?Ben doesn't exercise enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nObviously that one Mr. Benjamin Woodman is lacking in the area of exercise!!\nJudge:\n...\nvon Karma:\n...\nTrilo:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThis is clear from the testimony we have just listened to!! He was too slow and awkward to catch a monkey fleeing through the snow!!! (This revelation doesn't seem to be registering too well around the courtroom...)\nMaya:\nMaybe you should leave the courtroom drama for video games and rethink that one...\nPhoenix:\nUmm... OK.\nLeads back to:\n\"Well... This does indeed prove one very important point.\"Ben's testimony has a flaw.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is a huge contradiction in this witness's testimony!\"Phoenix:\nThere is a huge contradiction in this witness's testimony!von Karma:\nCo-Contradiction!?Phoenix:\nThe witness just testified to the following effect -- Up until the police arrived, he didn't move from the entrance to the plaza. HOWEVER! The witness just stated that he chased after Money the monkey. When the witness was off chasing Money, there was no one watching the plaza!von Karma:\nWhat is the meaning of all this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Where are you going with this little theory of yours?Phoenix:\nI'm saying that there is no possible way that this witness saw the plaza the entire time! That's where I'm going with this little theory! Which leads me to my next point. It is entirely possible that someone other than the defendant was at the scene!Judge:\nInteresting, Mr. Wright.von Karma:von Karma:\nWell then tell me this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!! Do you have any proof that something slipped past this vigilant ventriloquist?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nWell, he obviously didn't see the victim, the Ringmaster, arrive on the scene!von Karma:\nHowever, that doesn't change the fact that he saw the defendant arrive!Phoenix:\nThe witness is lying! He is blinded by his rivalry with Max!Judge:\nWell... The defense's argument does hold water. This witness does have a history of animosity towards the defendant.Trilo:\nWhat!? How dare you!? I wouldn't lie just to get that dorkface in trouble! He's not even worth it!! I saw him! No doubt about it! I saw that worthless liar!Judge:\nWell... Just for clarity's sake, let's flesh out exactly who you saw on that night.Trilo:\nHah! I've told you so many times, you'd think you'd know my story's not changing!Phoenix:\n(You've already changed your story, stick boy! And I'm sure it will change some more.)Maya:\nWhere there is one lie, there are usually many more behind it.Phoenix:\nExactly, Maya. That's why we have to keep after him!Maya:\nYeah!Witness Testimony-- Witnessing Max --Trilo:\nI'll give you that I was waiting that night for Regina.\nBut that doesn't change the fact that I saw Max in the plaza that night!\nHe showed up after I had been waiting there for about five minutes.\nI said \"good evening\" to him, but he didn't even acknowledge my presence!\nI'm absolutely sure it was him! I saw Maximillion Galactica at the scene!!\nThere's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols!Judge:\nHmm...von Karma:\nSo that means that Money didn't show up until after you saw Max?Trilo:\nThat's right. Money ran up less than a minute after I saw Max.Phoenix:\nThen Money snatched the ring, and you went chasing after him?Judge:\nHow long was it until you came back to where you were waiting?Trilo:\nWell. Let's see... I'd say about...Ben:\nI suppose five minutes. I think...von Karma:\nSo the victim could have arrived on the scene in that five minute stretch.Judge:\nMr. Wright, please proceed with your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Witnessing Max --Trilo:\nI'll give you that I was waiting that night for Regina.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were only concerned with waiting for Regina that night?  That means you probably wouldn't have noticed if someone else showed up.\nTrilo:\nYou should think about how many eyes I actually have. I've got four, you know! Four. F-O-U-R. Counting Ben of course... With that many eyes, do you really think something would have slipped by me?\nJudge:\nFour eyes is an awful lot of attention directed at one area, I suppose...\nPhoenix:\n(Yikes! The judge is even more dangerous to our case than Trilo!)Trilo:\nBut that doesn't change the fact that I saw Max in the plaza that night!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you saw Max coming out of the Big Top that night?\nTrilo:\nOf course that's where I saw him coming from! I was staring at the entrance to the tent the entire time!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that makes sense, especially since he was waiting for Regina.)Trilo:\nHe showed up after I had been waiting there for about five minutes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAbout what time would you say these events took place?\nTrilo:\nYou're one of the dumbest people on the planet if you can't figure it out yourself! You already know that practice finished promptly at 10 PM! And you already know that I went to the lodging house right after practice! You don't need to be a brain surgeon to know around what time it was when I saw him... Just add ten more minutes! I'm sure you can do that! Now what time was it?\nJudge:\nIndeed, what time was it?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... What time was it? Lemme think about that for a second......... ...YEOW!! I'm no good at math!\nvon Karma:\n*sigh* It was 10:10 PM!\nJudge:\nAhhh, yes. That sounds about right!\nTrilo:\nIt sounds about right because that's the time that I saw Max on the scene!Trilo:\nI said \"good evening\" to him, but he didn't even acknowledge my presence!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you testified that you said \"good evening\" to Max that night.\nTrilo:\nYou must enjoy asking incredibly obvious questions! You say \"good morning\" in the morning, and \"good afternoon\" during the day, right? And it's obvious that I'd say \"good night\" to someone at night!!\nBen:\n...\nTrilo:\nWhat Ben!? You've got something to add!? Lemme guess... \"That's not it Trilo! You say 'good evening' at night!\"\nBen:\nAh... I'm sorry Trilo...\nJudge:\nMr. Quist, I would prefer if you kept your ventriloquist's act outside of the courtroom!\nTrilo:\nImpossible! A performer lives and breathes his performances! You should know better!!\nPhoenix:\n(There's got to be something wrong with this bit of testimony...)\n\n\n\nNothing especially\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it's kinda petty to bad mouth someone's performances...)\nMaya:\nI think so too... I guess you really are \"Wright all the time!\"\nPhoenix:\nGlad to see you finally coming around to that.\nJudge:\nContinue with the cross-examination please!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nTrilo's evening greeting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIsn't that a bit strange to you?\nTrilo:\nWhat do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nWell, if you hate Max so much, why would you bother being nice to him? It strikes me as somewhat strange.\nTrilo:\nWhy would it strike you as strange?\nvon Karma:\nExactly! How is it strange to be cordial to one of your coworkers?\nPhoenix:\nWell... If it was simply just being cordial to a coworker I would understand... OWW!! That hurt!!\nvon Karma:\nMaybe you should think of having some proof before your lips start flapping next time! Proof is everything in this world! You should have learned that back in grade school!!\nPhoenix:\n(There's no reason that Trilo would ever say something nice to Max... But how do I go about proving that with the evidence?)\nMaya:\nBluffing is everything in this world! ...But I'm sure you already learned that one!!\nPhoenix:\nI guess I can give it a shot...\nJudge:\nThe witness will resume his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nBen's half of the comedy act\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI hate to say it, but Ben's part of your little act is coming off a bit stale! I'm sure that if a pro was to review your work, he would say... OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nYou're not trying to pass yourself off as a professional performer, are you? Don't get so wrapped up in yourself, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You! Should know! Better!\nPhoenix:\nOW! OWWW! AWWWWWW! THAT HURTS!!\nvon Karma:\nThat should have set him straight! You may proceed with your testimony, Witness.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPresent Broken Bottle or Regina Berry profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Trilo, is it not true that you had a fight with Max on the day of the murder?\"Trilo:\nI'm absolutely sure it was him! I saw Maximillion Galactica at the scene!!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou are 100% absolutely sure of what you just said?\nTrilo:\nI told you already! Jeez!! I am 100% absolutely sure!\nvon Karma:\nThere's no way that he could be any more confident than that, right?Trilo:\nThere's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThose three ridiculous symbols, huh?\nTrilo:\nOut of curiosity, exactly how many times have you asked that question by now? If you're gonna ask again, I'll answer with a chorus... Everyone together now!\nJudge:\n\"SILK HAT!\nMaya:\nCLOAK!\nWHITE ROSES!\"\nTrilo:\nThank you very much!\nPhoenix:\nMaya... You didn't have to join in did you!?\nMaya:\nBut... It's fun shouting out with everyone else!!Maya:\nThere has to be a hole in his testimony somewhere.Phoenix:\nI agree. But do we have the proof to make something stick?Maya:\nAll we can do is try, right Nick!?

    "response": "To find the contradiction between Trilo's testimony and the evidence, let's review the specific testimonies and the evidence related to the crime scene.\n\nLooking at Testimony 3:\n- \"I said 'good evening' to him, but he didn't even acknowledge my presence!\" - Person: Trilo\n\nNow, comparing this with Evidence 11:\n- Russell's Autopsy Report, which states: Time of death: 10:15 PM\n\nThe autopsy report reveals that the Ringmaster died at 10:15 PM. If Trilo had seen Maximillion Galactica and was able to say \"good evening\" to him before the murder happened, Maximillion would have arrived on the scene before 10:15 PM. However, Trilo's statement that he said \"good evening\" suggests that he saw someone around that time, but it conflicts with the claim that Max didn't acknowledge him—Max was already being accused of the murder around that time.\n\nThus, it leads to the contradiction with the specifics of what was claimed considering the timing around the murder, especially since the precise acknowledgment or recognition of Max doesn't align with the presence necessary for the crime and the absence of acknowledgment.\n\nThis contradiction indicates that Trilo might not have been fully accurate, or could be confused about the timing and Max's presence, casting doubt on his reliability as a witness.\n\n{\"evidence\": 11, \"testimony\": 3}",

Such a fabulous understanding of events!\nPhoenix:\n(...What's with all this fabulous talk...)\nMax:\nWelcome to the Visitor's Room!\nMaya:\nIt's MAX!! Nick!! Look!

Thank you so much!!\nPhoenix:\nHey... Umm... What about my card?\nMax:\nThink of it as a souvenir.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWell Nick... I think it's time to get to work.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick? Why are you looking at the ceiling?\nPhoenix:\nI was just thinking about what I should have for lunch.\nMax:\nSweetie... Drop porcupine head over there. Shower me with your attention.

I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.\nTalk\nMax Galactica\nMaya:\nMax, I was hoping you could tell me a little bit more about yourself...\nMax:\nFABULOUS! I think we should get to know each other better, too! Why don't you come sit next to me?\nMaya:\nUmm... There's a big piece of security glass between us...\nMax:\nOh sweet geebus! What in the world!? If only I could use magic! Then I could make this wall disappear...\nPhoenix:\n(What is this guy talking about!?) Anyways... Lately, you've become awfully famous, haven't you Max?\nMax:\nThat's Maximillion to you, porcupine head! Get it straight!\nPhoenix:\n(Jeez, people nowadays... They get their panties all in a bunch over nothing!) Anyway, Maximillion, you won a very prestigious award recently, did you not?\nMax:\nI did indeed! It was FABULOUS! I won the Magician's Grand Prix, held by the Association of International Magicians. It's an award that recognizes that I am the most fabulouso of fabulous world magicians. There was a trophy, and a bust. It was a fab... I mean it was an amazing day.\nMaya:\nWow! That's incredible!\nMax:\nIsn't it!? I'm certainly the greatest magician in the world!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm going to guess he didn't win a trophy for most modest magician.)\nBerry Big Circus\nMaya:\nYou are signed to an exclusive contract with the Berry Big Circus, correct?\nMax:\nThat's the long and short of it. You sure do your research sweetie! I'm impressed. You just can't watch a magician on TV, you know!? Magic is so fabulous, you have to see it with your own eyes, sweetie!\nMaya:\nYou're right! You're so right!\nMax:\nHowever, the circus... It's a dinosaur. A thing of the past. Nowadays, no one even cares about what goes on there.\nMaya:\nHuh? What do you mean?\nMax:\nThat's why I signed the contract!!\nPhoenix:\nThat's why you signed the contract?\nMax:\nThanks to me, the Berry Big Circus is fabulously popular! People come out in droves to catch a glimpse of the magic of Max Galactica! I revived the dinosaur that is the circus! But to me, it was just another magic trick! Isn't it just wonderful, sweetie?\nMaya:\nY-Yes...\nMax:\nI made all the old crusty performances obsolete!\nMaya:\nBut I kinda like the circus performances...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks a bit down...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nTell me what happened at the Berry Big Circus.\nMax:\nAhh... Last night. The Ringmaster was murdered.\nMaya:\nThe Ringmaster... You mean Russell Berry?\nMax:\nSomeone smashed him over the head, I hear. He was slumped over on the ground. Even though it was the middle of the night, the police presence was fabulous. The police questioned me at length...\nPhoenix:\nQuestioned you about what?\nMax:\nAbout everything... I was the last one to see the Ringmaster before he was murdered. I saw him last evening... In his room. (Changed from [I saw him that night... In his room.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nSo then why were you arrested?\nMax:\nArrested? Don't make an ant hill into a mountain, sweetie. They just wanted to consult with me on matters... That's all.\nMaya:\nNick... I don't think Max understands how serious this is.\nPhoenix:\n(She's right... I think I should shock him back to reality...)\nMeeting with Russell (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nBefore the murder, you met with the Ringmaster?\nMax:\nUh-huh.\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you talk about?\nMax:\nThings that aren't for your ears.\nPhoenix:\nMaya. Would you please ask him?\nMaya:\nWhat did you talk about with the Ringmaster, Max?\nMax:\nIt was nothing... Small talk really... We were just having a chat about my salary.\nMaya:\nSalary?\nMax:\nI am the one bringing in the crowds. (Changed from [I am the one bringing in all of the crowds to the circus.] in the original release) I think that I should be compensated as such. You agree, don't you?\nMaya:\nY-Yes...\nPhoenix:\nThat's all you talked about?\nMax:\nOf course! It was a fabulous chat!\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(Just fabulous! I mean-- Argh! Now he's got ME saying it!) (Changed from [Fabulous! Why does he have to keep saying fabulous!?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick? You look all bent out of shape.\nMeeting with Russell (subsequent times)\nMax:\nWhen you make absolutely fabulous magic... It costs enormous sums of money. Sums that will boggle your mind!\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nMaya:\nThat's why you went to his room that night...?\nMax:\nI went to ask him for a fabulous raise.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder how people can lie with such a straight face...)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMax:\nWhat is that badge? Is it used in a disappearing act?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not a magician, Max. I'm an attorney.\nMax:\nAn attorney? Then why are you wasting your time talking to me?\nMaya:\nHe isn't wasting his time! Max... You're...\nMax:\nOK! OK! Relax, sweetie... You're just a little overanxious, I think...\nMaya:\n*whimper*\nMaya Fey profile\nMax:\nSo, would you like to come up on stage with me sometime?\nMaya:\nRe-Really? Is that really OK?\nMax:\nI'll bring you up on stage as a volunteer from the audience!\nMaya:\nREALLY!?\nMax:\nI'll give you something before the show, and then on stage you'll sneak it to me...\nPhoenix:\n(Wait a second... He's planting her in the audience to rig a magic trick!)\nMax profile\nPhoenix:\nDo you mind taking a look at this?\nMax:\nI guess I have no choice... But really, is this the proper time or place for this?\nPhoenix:\n(He signed his own photo...)\nMaya:\nNick... You mind giving that to me when the case is over?\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this?\nMax:\nFabulous!! You'd like me to sign this for you?\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh*)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Attorney's Badge:\nMax:\n... Anyways... I've been curious about something for a while now.\nMaya:\nWhat's that?\nMax:\nWhy do you keep looking at me with such a sad look on your face, sweetie?\nMaya:\nBe-Because! You've been arrested! For murder!\nMax:\nOh, don't be ignorant. They wouldn't arrest someone like me!!\nPhoenix:\nWhy is that?\nMax:\nObviously because I'm the fabulous Maximillion Galactica!\nPhoenix:\nSo?\nMax:\nI'm the very big star of the Berry Big Circus.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that means?\nMax:\nI'm rich. I'm paid fabulous sums!\nPhoenix:\nWhich means what?\nMax:\n...\nMaya:\nMax...\nMax:\nQuit joking around! You've got to be pulling my magic wand! The police aren't really serious about all this, are they?\nPhoenix:\nThey don't arrest people as a joke.\nMax:\n...!!\nMaya:\nLook at Max... He's crushed...\nPhoenix:\nWell he needed to wake up and smell the coffee. (This is serious business.)\nMax:\nUmm... Umm...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMax:\nPorcu... I mean, Sir. You're a lawyer, right?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Oh, yeah. I'm an attorney.\nMax:\nPlease! Help me! I didn't kill nobody!\nMaya:\n\"Didn't kill nobody!?\"\nMax:\nI may be more spoiled than a hog in a hamburger mud pit... But a killer!? That's insane... I... I... I could never...\nMaya:\nM-Max?\nMax:\nI swear!! I just wanted to pay off my daddy's debt... He's back on the farm...\nPhoenix:\nOK... OK... I'll take your case.\nMax:\nR-Really?\nPhoenix:\nReally.\nMax:\nUh... Thank ya much. Ya'll sure are nice folks.\nMaya:\nUmm...

I must apologize for not being my absolutely fabulous self just now, sweetie.\nMaya:\nH-Huh?\nMax:\nMr. Attorney.\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMax:\nA few minutes ago, you took one of my cards, didn't you?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Now that he mentions it... I did take a card.)\nMax:\nIt was the 10 of Hearts. Right?\nPhoenix:\n(Wha... How'd he... He got it right, again!)\nMax:\nWhat can I say? You, too... You've stolen some of my most valued possessions. Ten of Maximillion Galactica's hearts...\nPhoenix:\n(You sure do have a lot of hearts, don't you?)\nMax:\nAh ha ha ha... I'm putting my faith in you sweetie.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't just call me sweetie, did he?)\nMaya:\nAlright! Let's make this an absolutely fabulous case! C'mon, Nick!\nDecember 28Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nAlright... We've got lots of things we have to look into. No time for slacking. Let's get going.\nMaya:\nOK.\nPhoenix:\n? What's the matter? You seem down.\nMaya:\nMaximilion Galactica... Who would have guessed he was country bumpkin?\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSo now what do we do?\nMaya:\nHuh? There's still lots of things we can do! Go to the scene of the crime, talk to witnesses, gather evidence...\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I guess you're right.\nMaya:\nWe still don't even know what happened in the first place.\nAny ideas\nMaya:\nWe don't have enough information to make a case yet.\nPhoenix:\nI could have sworn I've heard that before.\nMaya:\nWell, we never have enough information!\nPhoenix:\nJust admit it, you don't have a clue what happened.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMaya:\nWell... Your badge is still shining. Barely.\nPhoenix:\nIt may be showing a bit of wear, but I try to take good care of this thing.\nMaya:\nYou sure do love to show that off, don't you Nick? Who knows how many times you have shown it to me?\nPhoenix:\n(She's right... I whip it out at the drop of a hat.)\nMaya Fey profile\nMaya:\nOnce you start channeling spirits... They say you lose sight of who you actually are...\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Do you really believe that?\nMaya:\nNot really. But... Just in case, I plan to write my autobiography.\nPhoenix:\nYour autobiography...?\nMax profile\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the matter? You've been acting strange for a while now.\nMaya:\nMax... He's just some country bumpkin...\nPhoenix:\nSo? Why does that matter? He's still a famous magician right?\nMaya:\nI guess. But his real name is... Billy Bob Johns.\nPhoenix:\n(Yikes! The poor guy's got three first names! I guess that is pretty odd.)\nMaya:\nOh well! If a big star can do it, then you should pretend to be exotic too, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n\"A big star...\"?\nMaya:\nMax Galactica is a pretty big name! Anyways, what do you think about Naruhodo A. Wrighto?\nPhoenix:\nN-N-Na... *cough* Umm... What's the \"A\" stand for?\nMaya:\nThe \"A\" stands for \"Attorney\".\nPhoenix:\nI'll think about it...\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nThis is kinda pointless don't you think?\nMaya:\nIf it's that pointless, then you don't have to worry about showing it to me.\nPhoenix:\n(When she's right... She's right.)\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusCircus Entrance\nMaya:\nWe're here again...\nPhoenix:\nYep. But this time we are here for work. (It hasn't been that long since the crime, so the police are still on the scene.)\nMaya:\nLet's find someone who might know something about what happened.\nPhoenix:\nSounds like a plan.\nExamine\nBig top\nMaya:\nThe Berry Big Top is so... Very... B... *cough* Enormous...\nPhoenix:\nYep. One look at the huge tent looming over you and you realize \"This is the circus!\"\nMaya:\nI know! I know! It really gets your blood pumping doesn't it!?\nSign\nMaya:\nLook! Look! It's Max!!\nPhoenix:\nEven when you don't want to see him... *poof* He's right in front of you. (Sure the sign says \"Berry Big Circus\"... But looking around... It might as well be Cirque du Galactica...)\nMaya:\nThe stars on his cheek sure are dreamy... How about I draw a star on your cheek Nick? I've got a marker!\nPhoenix:\nNah! Nah! It's alright!\nStreamers\nPhoenix:\nThose streamers do a nice job introducing the circus performers.\nMaya:\n\"Maximillion Galactica and his comical comrades!\"\nPhoenix:\nYou know... You don't really see too many streamers nowadays, do you?\nMaya:\nYou're right. I haven't seen one in ages. I bet they stopped using them due to little kids climbing up to the top...\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... I don't think that was why...)\nVendors\nPhoenix:\nIt's a snack stand. They have hot dogs, hamburgers, and drinks... Not to mention...\nMaya:\nCandy and popcorn... They've even got snow cones!!\nPhoenix:\n(Who would eat snow cones in the middle of winter?)\nMaya:\nNick... Do you think we can buy some snow cones?\nPhoenix:\nLook around... There's tons of snow piled up all around here!\nMaya:\nYAY!! Wait a second... There's no syrup though! I want syrup!\nPhoenix:\n(Hopefully she doesn't notice that discolored snow in the corner. That's not syrup!)\nEntrance\nMaya:\nNick... The entrance is right here.\nPhoenix:\nMaya. The circus is closed today. No clowns. No elephants. No shows.\nMaya:\nI know that! Nick... You can get your picture taken with Dali the elephant!\nPhoenix:\nThere's no Dali. Not today.\nMaya:\nI know that too! Oh well... I'll just have to take a picture with whoever I stumble across...\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* It's not like we're here on business or anything...)\nTicket booths\nPhoenix:\nThis is the Box Office where they sell all the tickets for the circus.\nMaya:\nThey also sell programs. I forgot to buy one when we came to the circus last time.\nPhoenix:\nSo then why don't you buy one now?\nMaya:\nHmm... Sounds like a plan. Oh no... It looks like I forgot my wallet. ...\nPhoenix:\nIf you want me to buy it for you, just ask me already.\nMaya:\nYou know I'd never do that to you, Nick...\nDoor\nMaya:\nHmm... This door must lead to the lodging house.\nPhoenix:\n\"No Entry To Unauthorized Personnel\"\nMaya:\nDo you really need to say \"No Entry\" if no one's actually entering? It's almost like a zen riddle, isn't it Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not even going to justify that question with a response...)\nMaya:\nI bet all of the stars stay at that lodging house.\nDecember 28Lodging HousePlaza\nPhoenix:\nThis seems to be a dorm where all the performers in the circus stay...\nMaya:\nReally!? So we might run into that stoogey clown here, right? He's so kooky! (Changed from [Really!? So that stoogey clown should be here, huh? He's so kooky!] in the original release)\n???:\nAhhh!

(Changed from [You always seem to be working so hard, Detective.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'd rather not be always working, but with crime, you don't make your own hours. (Changed from [I'd rather not be working hard, but with crime you don't make your own hours.] in the original release) If I have to be at the circus anyway, I want to see the lion tamer and the tightrope. However, no matter where I go, the show is always the same... Dead body. Stage left.\nMaya:\nNick! Nick! He complained!!\nPhoenix:\nHeh heh... That's a rarity. Let's get back to business now, OK?\nExamine\nTarp\nPhoenix:\nThere's some evidence under the tarp over there...\nGumshoe:\nHey! Watch it, pal! The killer is behind that tarp!!\nMaya:\nAHHHHH!!\nGumshoe:\nHo! Ho! Ho! Got ya! I was just kidding!\nMaya:\nGRRR!\nGumshoe:\nHo! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!\nAir conditioner\nGumshoe:\nThis year, I finally won an air conditioner!\nMaya:\nWhat!? You didn't have an air conditioner? Did you ride your triceratops to work too?\nPhoenix:\nAnd what do you mean you \"won\" an air conditioner? You didn't buy it?\nGumshoe:\nI can't afford one of those things!! But I got lucky and won it as a door prize at the Annual Police Christmas Party!\nMaya:\nThey really pay you peanuts don't they?\nGumshoe:\nPeanuts? I don't even get paid enough for peanut butter, let alone peanuts!\nLightpost\nGumshoe:\nThe safety lights around the circus are kept on all night long. So, they should have been on at the time of the murder...\nPhoenix:\n(So he's saying the murder took place in the light...?)\nGumshoe:\nHow strange...\nMaya:\nHow strange indeed... Hmm...\nMuddy footprints\nPhoenix:\nThis is the only place that the snow has been trounced upon.\nMaya:\nThe murderer was sloppy leaving all these prints all over!\nGumshoe:\nNo no no no no... We're the ones who left the prints... An investigation can be a messy thing sometimes.\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nI also slipped and fell in that spot over there. The other detectives all got a good laugh when the prosecutor whipped me. Thank god there was all this snow around to bring down the swelling.\nPhoenix:\n(It's great to know that the police aren't worried about preserving the evidence...)\nTalk\nTomorrow's trial\nPhoenix:\nDo you know who will be the prosecutor in court tomorrow?\nGumshoe:\nOf course. It will be Ms. von Karma.\nPhoenix:\nUhhh... She isn't gonna hit me with her whip again, is she?\nGumshoe:\nWhat do you have to worry about? You only have to see her in court! When she shows up at the precinct, the sound of that whip never ends, pal.\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe... I'm sure Ms. von Karma's really interesting and all, but... (Changed from [Detective Gumshoe... That's enough about Von Karma.] in the original release) there's someone else I'd rather talk about. (Chagned from [What about that guy? What is he up to?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nLike who? (Changed from [That guy?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nLike Mr. Edgeworth, of course! (Changed from [What happened to Edgeworth?] in the original release) You know! Nick's true rival, Miles Edgeworth! (Changed from [You know! The Edgeworth that's Nick's rival!] in the original release) What in the world happened after I went back home!? (Changed from [What in the world happened when I went back home!?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth... You haven't heard what happened to him?\nMaya:\nNick won't tell me!\nGumshoe:\nWell, to be honest... I'm not at liberty to tell you either. Let's just say he's not around anymore.\nMaya:\nHe's not around!?!? Nick! What does he mean Mr. Edgeworth isn't around!?\nPhoenix:\nExactly what he said. He's not around. Edgeworth is gone... Don't say his name again, OK?\nMaya:\nN-Nick?\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nThe Ringmaster of the circus was murdered, wasn't he?\nGumshoe:\nYep. Last night around 10 PM. He died outside in the cold. A pretty sad way to go out if you ask me, pal.\nMaya:\n... It was rather cold.\nGumshoe:\nThis is the scene of the crime, pal. The body was found right over there. Right about where you are standing now.\nMaya:\nAHHHHHHHHHHH!!\nGumshoe:\nHo! Ho! Ho! Surprised you, didn't I?\nMaya:\nI'm not laughing!\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, but do you mind telling me what happened to the victim?\nGumshoe:\nHe was killed by a blow to the noggin, pal.\nMaya:\nYeep!\nGumshoe:\nIt's pretty clear cut as far as murders go. He was discovered quickly. But...\nPhoenix:\nBut?\nGumshoe:\nThere's just one thing that doesn't quite fit.\nMaya:\nHah! There always seems to be something that doesn't quite fit!!\nSomething unusual (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat was this one thing that just didn't quite fit?

This wooden box under the body?\nGumshoe:\nNo clue, pal. Some forensics experts took it back and are examining it now.\nMaya:\nAnd... And... What is so mysterious about the footprints?\nGumshoe:\nWhoa. Calm down now. Take a good look at the footprints in this picture.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim's footprints are on the scene.\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The problem is...\nMaya:\n...! The killer's footprints aren't there!!\nGumshoe:\nBingo. Where did the killer come from, and where did the killer run off to?

So about the eyewitness... (Changed from [Umm... How about any eyewitnesses...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nHo! Ho! Ho! You know I'm not going to tell you that! That's the prosecution's trump card!!\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Oh well...\nGumshoe:\n... Oh! I just remembered!!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nI forgot to mention that you two are barred from entering that lodging house.\nMaya:\n...? Why is that?\nGumshoe:\nOh... No reason! Just something I remembered to tell you.\nMaya:\nIt must be because that's where the eyewitness is. (Changed from [It must be because there's an eyewitness inside that Lodging House.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nLet's check it out!\nGumshoe:\nDon't you dare, pal!

Why don't you try wearing a different badge every now and again?\nMaya:\nWell... I do have a Steel Samurai Badge with me. How about that one?\nPhoenix:\nI'll only wear it if Detective Gumshoe carries a Steel Samurai Police Badge.\nMaya:\nThen it's a deal! I hear that Detective Gumshoe has that very badge! ...\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? Don't look at me like that!! You're making me nervous!\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nBeing a spirit medium is quite an accomplishment... And you're so young too! That's really something!!\nMaya:\nActually, I've been thinking of taking a break from channeling.\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nMaya:\nI don't want to have another incident like last time.\nMax profile\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like Max is the most unpopular guy in the circus tent. You know what they say... A bad attitude follows you everywhere...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, he's a bit arrogant, but he didn't seem that bad.)\nMaya:\nBut just because someone has a bad attitude doesn't make them a criminal.\nGumshoe:\nIt's not just his attitude... I've got proof, pal!\nMaya:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nHe left something at the scene of the crime! One of his magician's trademarks! An incredibly well-made silk hat.\nMaya:\nWell it does have very classy decorative elements.\nSilk Hat added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nMax uses a cloak, silk hat, and white roses as his signature symbols.\nPhoenix:\n...

Right now, I'm just tired.\nMaya:\nWell, there's not much you can do about that, so you just gotta keep on being tired!\nGumshoe:\nYou're right!\nPhoenix:\n(Glad I stayed out of that one...)\nFranziska von Karma profile\nGumshoe:\nYou're going down this time, pal!\nPhoenix:\nOh...

It's a real mess in here!\nPhoenix:\n(My room's probably worse though...)\nMaya:\nOh well... I give up. We'll have to come back later.\nExamine\nCostumes\nPhoenix:\nAll those clown costumes lined up like that... I dunno about you, but it's creepy.\nMaya:\nLook at the collection he's got! It's incredible!\nPhoenix:\nIt must be a collection of clown costumes from around the world.\nMaya:\nOh! I almost forgot!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it now? (She better not want me to try one of those on!)\nMaya:\nI was thinking of starting a costume collection myself! I'll call it \"World Spirit Channels\"... We can display it in our office!\nPhoenix:\nIn OUR office!? As soon as you start paying the bills, you can say that.\nBoarded up cracks in ceiling\nPhoenix:\nLook at the ceiling... It looks like someone punched a hole in it!\nMaya:\nYou're right. I wonder what happened?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I don't even want to imagine what goes on in here.)\nCarrots\nMaya:\nWhat the!? There's a string of carrots here!\nPhoenix:\nHow strange. The carrots seem to come in all different shapes... Weird... I can't tell if Moe just likes carrots, or if he is using them for some sort of gag.\nWindow\nMaya:\nNick, you can see the scene of the crime from here.\nPhoenix:\n(You can even tell that the ground has been disturbed...)\nMaya:\nIt's right in front of this window, about 30 feet away.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it wouldn't have been strange for someone to have seen the crime from here.)\nPajamas\nPhoenix:\nMoe's got an excellent pair of pajamas... Laid on his bed in an excellent manner.\nMaya:\nWhat? Those are pajamas? You mean he goes to bed dressed as a clown? Eww...\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMoe seems to be a voracious reader. Look at all the hard books he has here. \"Clowns for Dummies\", \"The Joke's On You\", \"Treat Your Peons Right\", And the classic \"Funny Jokes Are Funny.\"\nMaya:\nWow. Moe is very studious.\nPhoenix:\n\"The Joke's On You\"... Huh?\nClown equipment\nMaya:\nTee hee... Clown equipment is so funny looking!\nPhoenix:\nHe's got a balancing ball, a unicycle... He's even got a trampoline!! ... But they're all broken.\nMaya:\nMaybe he was just a little too excited during practice?\nPhoenix:\n(Who knows with that guy. Maybe that's part of the gag?)\nShoes or banana peel\nMaya:\nAwesome! Look at these shoes! They're great!\nPhoenix:\nForget the shoes! Check out the great gag banana peel!\nMaya:\nYou sure it wasn't Moe's snack after lunch?\nPhoenix:\n(Are you blind? Look at how many scratches there are from people slipping on it!!)\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusBig Top\nPhoenix:\nThe circus stage sure doesn't look this small from out in the audience...\nMaya:\nWow... This is where they all perform, isn't it? Nick! Do some somersaults!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not doing any somersaults.\nMaya:\nWhy not!?

Regent is such a cute tiger! Isn't he!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\n...\n???:\nWhat's the matter? You two sure are quiet.\nMaya:\nDon't \"What's the matter?\" me! N-Nick... He almost died there!!\n???:\nHah! He wasn't anywhere close to getting hurt, let alone dying! This little tiger hardly ever bites people. And besides, people normally never get to play with a wild tiger, right? So if you think about it, you're actually really lucky!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\n???:\nYou agree, don't you?\nPhoenix:\n... I guess...\nMaya:\nW-W-W-What do you mean you guess!? Why are you agreeing with her?\n???:\nWoohoo!! Your costume...\nMaya:\nEh?\n???:\nIt's cute. I wanna try it on!!\nMaya:\nC-Costume?

Likewise...\nExamine\nAudience wing\nMaya:\nThe seats are kinda far away don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nThey are, but it also means that lots of people can fit in the big top.\nRegina:\nHe's right. We can fit 500 people into a show.\nMaya:\nFive hundred... That's amazing.\nRegina:\nFlying around above that many people is a \"real rush\". At least that's what Max said.\n(Step)ladder\nMaya:\nAh, a ladder.\nPhoenix:\nIt's just a stepladder.\nMaya:\nWhat's the difference? They do the same thing, right? I think you should stick with the basic facts of the matter.\nPhoenix:\nOh... Uh... OK. (It's not even worth arguing with her on this one.)\nLion prop\nMaya:\nLook! That's where Max comes out during the show!!\nPhoenix:\nI've got to admit, that was a pretty cool effect!\nRegina:\nWe're planning for me to start coming out of the lion during the show.\nPhoenix:\nThat's great Regina!\nRegina:\nYeah. I will ride on Regent's back and jump out of the lion's mouth.\nMaya:\nI wanna try it too! I'll ride on Nick's back and jump out of the lion's mouth!\nPhoenix:\n(Sometimes I wonder about this girl...)\nBoxes\nPhoenix:\nThere doesn't seem to be anything here that can help us... Not a single clue.\nMaya:\nYou know I've been meaning to ask you... What exactly do you mean when you say \"clue\"? What are you looking for?\nPhoenix:\n... A bloody chainsaw for instance...\nMaya:\nWell there's definitely not one of those here...\nRope\nMaya:\nHey! It's a rope!\nPhoenix:\nProbably for tightrope walking...\nMaya:\nThat's a bit strange... There weren't any tightrope walkers in the show when we saw it.\nSpotlights\nMaya:\nWhoa! Those lights are huge!\nRegina:\nI love lights!! Whenever I appear under the spotlight, everyone claps for me!\nMaya:\nThat's because everyone knows that you're cute!\nRegina:\nNo... I'm not cute. You're cute!\nMaya:\nMe!?\nRegina:\nOf course! I'm sure you'd make an incredible heroine!\nMaya:\nReally!? You think so!? Nick! Did you hear that!? Me!! A heroine!! What about Nick, Regina?\nRegina:\n... Hmm... Nick...\nMaya:\nHe's no hero, is he?\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch... Thanks a lot Maya!)\nTalk\nWhat happened\nMaya:\nHey Regina... What do you know about what happened last night?\nRegina:\nYou mean the murder...?\nPhoenix:\nUh huh.\nRegina:\nMy dad was murdered.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I see... (Wait! What did she just say!?)

(Changed from [Eh?] in the original release)\nRegina:\nAnyways... Everyone was here practicing last night.\nPhoenix:\nEven your dad?\nRegina:\nYes. Everyone was here. We finished up around 10 PM. After that, everyone went off on their own. I was the only one who stayed around here.\nMaya:\nWhy did you do that?\nRegina:\nI was playing with Regent.\nPhoenix:\n(Regent... So she was with that beast...)\nRegina:\nThat's when the police showed up. When they took me to check things out, Dad was dead.\nPhoenix:\n(For someone whose father was just murdered, she seems awfully perky... (Changed from For someone who's [sic] father was just murdered, she seems awfully perky...] in the original release) I wish she would tell us more about her dad...)\nRegina\nMaya:\nThat's incredible that you are an animal tamer!\nRegina:\nIf you say so...\nMaya:\nIt has to be really scary!\nRegina:\nScary? Why?\nMaya:\nHuh?\nRegina:\nRegent isn't scary! He's cute! Ever since Léon died, Regent has been my best friend.\nPhoenix:\nLéon?\nRegina:\nYes. Léon the lion.\nPhoenix:\n(Léon the lion... Regent and Regina... Interesting name choices...)\nMaya:\nLéon... He died?\nRegina:\nYes. Actually he was killed. My dad killed him.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nMaya:\nWhy did he do that?\nRegina:\nI'm not sure why he did it.\nPhoenix:\n(It's tough not to get charmed when she looks at you with those innocent eyes...)\n\"What's on your mind?\" (appears after presenting Max profile)\nMaya:\nRegina...

It was Maximillion Galactica!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder how many people have stolen one of his hearts anyways...?)\nMaya:\nAnd then, on the exact same day, another person professed their love for her as well!!\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Who was it!?\nMaya:\nSomeone named Trilo.\nPhoenix:\nTrilo...?\nMaya:\nApparently he is a tenor who sings in the circus.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Haven't met him yet.)\nMaya:\nRegina seems to be quite the hit with the men in the circus!\nPhoenix:\nShe must have some sort of strange power over them!\nMaya:\nYou're not kidding. Two people in one day! Even I want to profess my love for her!\nPhoenix:\n(Me too! She's so cute...)\nRegina:\n*giggle*\nPresent\nSilk Hat\nRegina:\nThis silk hat is Max's.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right.\nRegina:\nIt's beautiful isn't it? I thought up the idea for wearing the hat.\nMaya:\nHuh? Really?\nRegina:\nYep. He took my sketch to the hat shop... And they made a custom hat for him based off the sketch. There is only one of these silk hats in the entire world! Isn't that cool?\nMaya Fey profile\nRegina:\nMaya... You're a spirit channeler?\nMaya:\nYep! I'm still training though.\nRegina:\nThat sounds like fun! I think you should join us at the circus!\nMaya:\nHuh? As a spirit channeler?\nRegina:\nYeah! You'd be a big hit!\nMaya:\nReally!?

Don't ya?\nMaya:\nYou sure do!\nPhoenix:\nNo objections here!\nRussell Berry profile\nRegina:\nAfter practice was over, Dad went right back to his room.\nMaya:\nHis room?\nRegina:\nYes. That door right over there leads to the Ringmaster's room.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nRegina:\nI dunno why, but he went off to his room in a hurry. I wonder what happened?\nPhoenix:\n(The Ringmaster's room... It's probably a good idea to check it out for myself.)\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this?

I guess so...\nMaya:\nBut... With a head as big as yours, you'd probably bust a hole in the* ([sic]) it!\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPhoenix:\nNo matter what the crime, we always meet the same detective at the scene.\nMaya:\nSometimes it seems like he's the only detective on the force. That would make Gumshoe really elite, wouldn't it?\nPhoenix:\n(Something tells me that no matter how you look at it, he's anything but elite...)\nFranziska von Karma profile\nMaya:\nYou know, if she wasn't so mean, I think she and I would get along...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but that's the problem... She is so mean. And that whip... That thing hurts. It really hurts.\nMaya:\nIt is kinda cool though. I wouldn't mind having a whip myself. I bet that cracking the whip on you once or twice would be just what the doctor ordered!\nPhoenix:\nW-Why me!? W-What did I do!?\nRegina Berry profile\nMaya:\nRegina is sooo cute!\nPhoenix:\nI have to admit that her smile does have a sort of hypnotic power.\nMaya:\nCan you believe that she's an animal tamer? That's sooo cool! I'd like to try animal taming someday. Nick! Nick! Lie down! Roll over!!\nPhoenix:\nOnce this case is solved, I'll roll over for you as many times as you want!\nMaya:\nYAY!!! Remember, you promised, Nick!\nRussell Berry profile\nMaya:\nEveryone loved the Ringmaster...\nPhoenix:\nSo I'm told. Why would anyone want to kill such a beloved man of the big top?\nMaya:\nMotive will surely be a point of contention tomorrow in court.\nPhoenix:\n(You can count on that...)\nAfter presenting Russell Berry profile in Berry Big Circus - Big Top:\nDecember 28Big TopRingmaster's Room\nMaya:\nThis was the Ringmaster's room?\nPhoenix:\nYes. This room belonged to the victim. Which means this must be where Max met the Ringmaster last night.\nMaya:\nNow that you mention it, that is what he said.\nPhoenix:\nI wonder what... Hmm... That's an interesting poster. (Changed from [I wonder what... Hmm... That's an intresting [sic] poster.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nAh! It's a poster of Max! I want it! I want it! Nick! I want it!\nPhoenix:\nI wanna get outta here...\nExamine\nPhotos\nMaya:\nNick... Look at all the photos lined up on the wall...\nPhoenix:\nIt's like a guided tour of the circus' history.\nMaya:\nThis is so cool! It seems like there were so many happy memories. Maybe we should do this sort of thing at our office? We can put up pictures of all the clients who have been found not guilty.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what if we had a client who was found guilty? (Changed from [What about the clients who were found guilty?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nUmm... We'll just pretend like they don't exist. How's that? ... Nick! Now you've got me thinking about losing cases! Why'd you do that!?\nFrames\nMaya:\nAll of these frames look the same.\nPhoenix:\nThey almost look like... Thank You cards. It looks like every year the Ringmaster made donations to charity... To the Robot Clown Research Center...\nMaya:\n... You're kidding right?\nPhoenix:\nWhat!? They may be a perfectly reputable charity in the field of advanced tomfoolery!\nTrophy case\nMaya:\nNick! Look at all the cute trophies!!\nPhoenix:\nIndeed. Just look at all the awards this circus has won...\nMaya:\nLike... \"All County Quiz Champions\"... \"Ringmaster's Association Mini Golf Master\"... \"Beer Belly Balloon Bounce Champ\"... \"Pet Grooming Grand Prix\"... Wow. The Ringmaster was multi-talented in ways I could have never imagined...\nPosters\nMaya:\nThere's a lot of posters here don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nThere are indeed.\nMaya:\nSo many posters that they aren't likely to miss one, are they?\nPhoenix:\nMaya... We're supposed to be the honest ones around here.\nMaya:\nBut... But... You didn't even notice that I took one!\nPhoenix:\n(Arghhh... She already swiped one!)\nMaya:\nHeh! Heh!\nPhoenix:\nYou're incorrigible, you know that?\nMax G. Promo Poster added to the Court Record.\nPosters (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nLook at all the stars on this poster... This must have been the poster they used to promote their public appearances.\nMaya:\nPosters are the way to go aren't they?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nMaya:\nWe should make posters to promote our law firm. \"Spine tingling legal action! Mind numbing legalese! You will say 'wow'!\" Or perhaps, \"Hold it! Don't miss out on a stunning life or death courtroom thrill ride!\"\nPhoenix:\nWith those taglines, our law firm would sink faster than the Titanic...\nTailcoat\nMaya:\nYou may not know this, but they call this a \"tailcoat\".\nPhoenix:\nAnd they call this \"the face of someone who already knew that...\" Hmm...\nMaya:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nA scrap of white paper is sticking out of the coat pocket.\nMaya:\nHuh? Where? Where?\nPhoenix:\nCalm down, Maya. You can't just go rummaging through people's coats!\nMaya:\nAhhh... You always make me feel like I'm doing something wrong...\nMirror\nMaya:\nThis is where the Ringmaster applied his makeup.\nPhoenix:\nIt's quite a collection of the most understated colors. Shocking Pink for example.\nMaya:\nThis one says it is \"100% All Natural Organic Mascara.\"\nPhoenix:\nAnd this one says \"Sensitive enough for a baby, strong enough for a mime.\"\nMaya:\nThe Ringmaster must have been really concerned about skin care... Very metrosexual.\nDesk\nMaya:\nThis is strange... Everything else looks nice, but this desk looks old and cheap.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a really big photo on the desk... It's a picture of Regina and her father, the Ringmaster.\nMaya:\nHe really loved her didn't he? Regina was lucky to have such a wonderful father.\nTable\nPhoenix:\nIt's a table for guests... There are some papers scattered on top.\nMaya:\nAh! Look at this! Max's salary is written on this piece of paper. YIKES!\nPhoenix:\nW-What is it?\nMaya:\nI didn't know that a magician... This salary is incredible!\nPhoenix:\n(She looks like she's about ready to pass out from shock...) How much is it!? How much is it!? T-T-THAT MUCH!?\nMaya:\nIncredible, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYou can say that again. (This must be the paper they used to negotiate Max's salary... The Ringmaster signed and dated it...)\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nMax definitely got a raise... But this document is dated a week ago!\nRingmaster's Papers added to the Court Record.\nTable (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis was the table he used when visitors came to see him.\nMaya:\nEww... There's mud caked on the table.\nPhoenix:\nSomeone with terrible manners must have put their shoes up on the table!\nMaya:\nNick! Don't even think about it!\nPhoenix:\nI wasn't! How uncouth do you think I am anyway?\nAfter clearing \"The eyewitness\" Talk option in Lodging House - Plaza and clearing \"\"What's on your mind?\"\" Talk option in Berry Big Circus - Big Top:\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusCircus Entrance\nMaya:\nHuh? Hey Nick! Look over there!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nThere's someone over there! Ex-Excuse me!\n???:\n...\nPhoenix:\nHello.\n???:\n...\nMaya:\nWow! He sure is a quiet one! Excuse me!!\n???:\nWha... Ha... Huh? M-Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. You work at the circus don't you?\n???:\nN-No. I'm just your everyday average Joe.\nMaya:\nAn average Joe who just happens to hang out at the circus? I don't think so.\n???:\nY-Yes I am. I've got nothing to do with what's going on here.\nPhoenix:\n(He's lying. Like any regular person would hang around the circus... Dressed like that!) I'm an attorney. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\nI'm a spirit medium. My name is Maya.\n???:\nWell... I... Um... Just happened to be... Umm... Passing by...\nPhoenix:\nI don't suppose you happen to be some kind of carny?\n???:\nNot a c-c-carny... I-I'm a p-performer. Actually, I'm a v-v-v-ventriloquist.\nMaya:\nVentriloquist?\n???:\nHe-he-he-he-he-he-he... I-I-I'm Benjamin Wo-Wo-Wo-Woodman...\nMaya:\nYour last name is Woodman? *snicker* (Changed from [You're [sic] last name is Woodman? *snicker*] in the original release)\n???:\nY-Yes... T-T-That's right... But e-everyone c-c-calls me B-B-B-B-B-Ben.\nMaya:\nAh... Yes yes yes... That's your alias, right?\nPhoenix:\nI believe they call it a stage name.\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, Ben?\nBen:\nUh... Yes? You mean... Me?\nPhoenix:\nAbout the murder. I'd like to talk to you about the details, if I may.\nBen:\nR-Really... I'm just a regular normal guy... I don't k-k-now... A-a-a-a...\nPhoenix:\n(This guy's so nervous, he's creeping me out.)\nMaya:\nNick. Cheer up! Just try and smile!\nMax Galactica\nMaya:\nWould you mind telling us something about Max? Maximillion Galactica.\nBen:\nMa-Ma-Ma-Max? H-H-H-He's... N-N-N-Not... V-Very... N-N-Nice.\nPhoenix:\n(Did he just say that Max is \"Not Very Nice\"?)\nBen:\nO... O... O... Oww... My... H-H-Head... Hurts.\nPhoenix:\n(Yikes. I hope he is OK. It sounds like he just popped a gasket...)\nVentriloquism\nMaya:\nBen, so you're a ventriloquist?\nBen:\nI-I-I-I'm... J-J-J-Just A-A... R-R-R-Regular... G-G-Guy...\nPhoenix:\nYou already told us that you were a ventriloquist!!\nBen:\nOh... Y-Y-Yes...\nMaya:\nNick! Don't yell at him! You can't do that!!\nPhoenix:\nI can't help it! He's making me nervous!!\nMaya:\nBen, do you mind showing me some of your skills as a ventriloquist?\nBen:\nW-W-Well... I-I-I... R-R-R-Right... N-N-Now... M-M-My... P-P-P...\nPhoenix:\nA-A-A-A-Ah... I-I-I-I-I W-W-W-W-Why... (Urk!! He's contagious!!)\nPresent\nAnything\nMaya:\nWould you mind taking a look at this?\nBen:\nUm... Umm... Uh... I-I-I-I...\nMaya:\n... I guess we won't need you to look at this after all.\nBig Top\nPresent\nBen profile\nRegina:\nAhh, that guy. His name is Ben, right?\nMaya:\nHuh? You don't know him?\nRegina:\nI dunno... He didn't really catch my eye. He's friends with Trilo right?\nPhoenix:\n(Wait... We're the ones asking the questions around here...)\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nMax G. Promo Poster\nMaya:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the matter, Maya?\nMaya:\nWhich poster is cooler? This one or the Steel Samurai poster?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not a big fan of either one of them.\nMaya:\nI guess putting a poster of a magician in a law office is kinda strange.\nPhoenix:\n(No stranger than a poster of a hunk of junk carrying around a spear!)\nRingmaster's Papers\nMaya:\nLooking at this really makes you think.\nPhoenix:\nLike what?\nMaya:\nNo matter how great a medium I become, there is no way I could make this kind of money.\nPhoenix:\nSo it's money you're after?\nMaya:\nYou only live once, right? Well, then you might as well live it fabulously!\nBen profile\nMaya:\nBeing a ventriloquist sounds like an interesting job.\nPhoenix:\nI bet it's fun once you get good at it.\nMaya:\nMaybe I should give it a try then! Here I go! \"Hello e-e-everyone... I-I-I'm Phoenix Wright.\" \"No matter what the lie or who the liar, I'll expose them for what they are!\" What's the verdict?\nPhoenix:\nYou might want to practice not moving your lips so much.\nMaya:\nY-Yeah... Maybe I should sign up for some expert training.\nPhoenix:\n(Don't you have another type of training to attend to, young lady...?)\nAfter clearing \"Something unusual\" and \"The eyewitness\" Talk option in Lodging House - Plaza and clearing \"\"What's on your mind?\"\" Talk option in Berry Big Circus - Big Top, then visiting Berry Big Circus - Circus Entrance:\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room\nMaya:\nHello...?\n???:\nKABLAMMO! CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'RE THE BIG WEINER! The one millionth visitor to the room of one Mr. Moe Curls, AKA ME!!\nPhoenix:\n(Earplugs... Must... Find... Earplugs...)\nMoe:\nTo celebrate this momentous occasion, would you care for an organic grape? Just one! Did you get my joke right there!? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMoe:\nI welched on giving you more than one!!\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nMoe:\nNo no no! If it was funny, it is your duty as a human being to laugh!! People who don't laugh are usually last-seen in Lan-sing. Catch my drift? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Maya?\nMaya:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n(This is like some Faustian nightmare...)\nMaya:\nC'mon! It was funny! Clowns are always funny in my book!\nPhoenix:\nIn my book, they're just funny lookin'.\nMoe:\nYou sure do have a great taste in clothes girlie! Look at that garb! You look just like Gretta Garb... OH! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* I'm goin' home...\nMaya:\nNo! Nick! You can't!!\nPhoenix:\nYou know, I can excuse a bad joke or two... But this stooge keeps laughing at his own jokes! That's what I object to!\nMaya:\nOK OK... I get it. But you have to admit he is kinda funny...\nPhoenix:\n(Argghhh... No, I do not have to admit that, because he isn't!)\nMoe:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nExamine\nCostumes\nMoe:\nI look awfully snazzy in these costumes.\nMaya:\nUmm... Did you just use the word \"snazzy\" in a sentence?\nMoe:\nI sure did. These are haute couture from the best international clown designers. At least, that's what they said on the TV shopping channel I use... I like having a big collection so I can match my costume to my mood... And my carrot.\nMaya:\nHehe...\nMoe:\nYou know, I only own one T-shirt. The rest are all clown costumes!\nPhoenix:\n(Snazzy dresser!? More like spazzy dresser if you ask me!)\nBoarded up cracks in ceiling\nMaya:\nThere's a hole in the ceiling... Why is there a hole in the ceiling?\nMoe:\nWell... Umm... I was riding a pogo stick, and I guess I just overdid it a little...\nMaya:\n\"Overdid it a little\"...?\nMoe:\nWhat can I say, sometimes things get a bit crazy in one's college days...\nMaya:\nHuh?\nCarrots\nMoe:\nCarrots are one of my trademark props.\nMaya:\nYep! I saw you use them! You must believe in a carrot and no stick approach. You put the carrot out in front for motivation, but I guess the trick is gauging what flavor you want each day...\nMoe:\nExactly! You were really paying attention, weren't you!? You know, I eat about 5 of those carrots every single day. If you eat that many, you've gotta change up the taste every now and again.\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't understand any of that, nor do I ever want to.)\nPajamas\nPhoenix:\nMoe, you've got quite the collection of pajamas... They really scream out to you.\nMoe:\nYou think they're loud, huh? I kinda thought they were refined... You know, a bit too adult for me to use on stage... That's why I used them as pajamas.\nPhoenix:\n(Wait a second... He sleeps in clown costumes!?)\nDesk\nMoe:\nTake a look at my desk. Aren't I the most studious clown you've ever seen? Every free moment I have, I spend it studying or reading.\nPhoenix:\nThe classic \"Pull My Finger\" or \"Clown Car Maintenance and Repair\".. Not to mention the bestseller \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Pierrots\"...\nMaya:\nUmm... They all seem to cover rather basic topics though...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he is just trying to cover all of his bases?\nMoe:\nExactly! I want to be a renaissance clown!\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad he didn't buy \"How To Be A Funny Clown\"...)\nClown equipment\nMoe:\nUs clowns really take our work seriously. I try to hone my craft day and night, with the latest in jester technology. Unicycles. Trampolines. Balancing Balls. Accordions.\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like you've put quite a bit of wear and tear on that equipment...\nMoe:\nWell... The theme of my act as a clown is... \"How many ways can a fat funny guy fall down?\" I don't care what I break or how I break it, as long as it ends with me on my bum!! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nShoes or banana peel\nMaya:\nWhat's this? A banana peel? *slips*\nMoe:\nOh my! Oh my! What a wonderful fall girlie! You should remember that when you see a banana peel, get ready to fall down! That is one of the basic tenants of clownsmanship.\nMaya:\nOw ow ow ow ow...\nMoe:\nEvery night, I fall down 100 times to practice the proper banana peel breakfall. WHOA! *slip* WHOA! *slip* WHOA! *slip*\nMaya:\nWow. He really is a pro, huh Nick!? His falls are totally different than my slip!\nTalk\nBerry Big Circus\nMaya:\nCould you please tell us more about the Berry Big Circus?\nMoe:\nIt's a Berry Big story... You sure you got that kind of time?\nPhoenix:\n(And the hits just keep on comin'... *sigh*)\nMoe:\nThis circus has been in business for 20 years. We all performed under the guidance of the Ringmaster, Russell Berry.\nMaya:\nTwenty years!? Wow!\nMoe:\nWorking in the circus is never easy, especially nowadays... With movies, TV, and bowling, there is just too much competition.\nMaya:\nBut... But... I LOVE THE CIRCUS!\nMoe:\nI love it too... That is why I've been here for 20 years. We work hard to keep the show running. No one sends in the clowns on us!\nMaya:\nNick! He just made a joke! Laugh!!\nPhoenix:\nHar! Har! Har! Har! Har! Har!\nMoe:\nThe Ringmaster was a real big shot in the circus world. A real class act. Even when there were no customers, Russell would use his own money to pay me. Because he knew that I had a family to care for... He was happy to take care of his employees.\nMaya:\nI see...\nMoe:\nHow could anyone do that to such a wonderful man...!?\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMoe...\nMoe:\nWiggidty-wiggidty-wiggidty WHAT?\nPhoenix:\nUgh...\nMaya:\nI'm sorry Moe. Nick was born without a sense of humor.\nMoe:\nDon't worry about it... How can you fault someone for being born that way?\nPhoenix:\nLet's talk about the murder.\nMoe:\nAhh... Let's see... It must've taken place around 10 PM last night. After rehearsals were finished, I was tuckered out, so I came back here. After I went to bed... That's when I caught a peek of it...\nMaya:\n\"Caught a peek...?\"\nMoe:\nOf the crime.\nPhoenix:\n(Just as we suspected... (Changed from [So this is what Detective Gumshoe was talking about...] in the original release) This guy's the eyewitness to the crime! (Changed from [Moe was the eyewitness to the crime!] in the original release))\nRussell Berry (appears after \"Berry Big Circus\")\nMoe:\nThe Ringmaster was truly ahead of his time. He would always add new elements to the show.\nMaya:\nNew elements...?\nMoe:\nWhen you've been a performer for a long time, your act starts getting a bit stale.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nMoe:\nI realize that even my act can get a bit long in the tooth... Sometimes my jokes can be a bit... Umm... Old-fashion.\nPhoenix:\n\"A bit long in the tooth?\"\nMoe:\nBut that make-believer takes things too far!!\nMaya:\nMake-believer?\nMoe:\nThe magician!! The one that thinks he's all high and mighty!! He had the gall to say to me, \"You're one of those funny types, right?\" What does he mean \"one of those\"!? Well the joke's on him now...\nPhoenix:\nOn him...?\nMoe:\nYep! He got on everyone's nerves!! The day of the murder... ...\nPhoenix:\nGo ahead.\nMoe:\nNope. No way! Just forget I said anything!\nPhoenix:\n(I bet he's still hiding something about Max...)\nWhat you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nYou say you saw the crime. Do you mind telling me what you saw?\nMoe:\nWell, the police told me that I can't share my story with others. \"Don't say a word, pal!!\" I'm just gonna have to let these lips stay zipped! (Changed from ['Don't say a word!!' I'm just gonna have to let these lips stay zipped!] in the original release)\nMaya:\nThat's not fair!\nMoe:\nI guess you're right... Maybe I can tell you a few details. But only if you can get old stiff lips here to make with the funny...!\nPhoenix:\nStiff lips? Wait... Do you mean me?\nMaya:\nNick! You can do it!!\nPhoenix:\n*achem* *achem*\nMoe:\nWhat's the matter?\nPhoenix:\nJust getting ready. OK... Do you know why I, Phoenix Wright, am a great lawyer? Because I'm Wright all the time!!\nMaya:\n...\nMoe:\n...\nMaya:\nAt least his expectations are low.\nMoe:\nI wouldn't let him quit his day job.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeesh, cut a guy some slack. At least it was funnier than Chuckles over here.)\nMoe:\nIt wasn't the greatest joke I've heard, but you did try, so I'll tell you what I saw.\nMaya:\nI'm sorry he's incapable of being funny, Moe.\nMoe:\nThat night... Once I had tucked myself into bed, I heard this amazing noise. It was incredibly loud. It sounded like a giant \"THUMP\"! Once I heard it, I jumped out of bed. That's when I saw... Without question. Without a doubt. It was that magician!! That's all I saw... But it just proves how terrible that man actually is!\nPhoenix:\n(He knows more about Max than he is letting on...)\nPresent\nCrime Photo\nMoe:\nRUSSELL!! How could anyone do this to you... I... I... *sobs*\nMaya:\nMoe's taking this really hard...\nSilk Hat\nMoe:\nIt's that uppity faker's uppity top hat! They found this at the scene of the crime, didn't they?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what I've been told...\nMoe:\nUnbelievable. That jerk killed the Ringmaster!\nMaya:\nIt really is a shame what happened to the Ringmaster, huh Moe?\nPhoenix:\nIt seems that the Ringmaster was truly a great man...\nMax profile\nMoe:\nHmph! If he thinks he can kill the Ringmaster, it's only just that he should die, too!\nMaya:\nMoe!!\nMoe:\nSorry. I crossed the line. But he truly is a disgusting human being.\nMaya:\nWhy do you hate him so much?\nMoe:\nLet me tell you this one story... The morning before the murder, something terrible happened. Max clonked Ben right over the head, as hard as he could.\nPhoenix:\nBen? (The ventriloquist with the speech impediment?)\nMoe:\nYou should go to the cafeteria and investigate for yourselves.\nMaya:\nThe cafeteria?\nMoe:\nLet's just say there's Gotti be something interesting there... Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Ahh yes... The Berry Big Circus is very big, isn't it? You should always carry a map with you to get around...\nMaya:\nAh! Thank you!! Umm... This is an atlas!!\nMoe:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Oh... I kill myself. Really. I'm dying here... CORONARY! CORONARY!\nPhoenix:\n(Now he's just laughing to hear his own voice...)\nCircus Map added to the Court Record.\nMax profile (subsequent times)\nMoe:\nHmph! If he thinks he can kill the Ringmaster, it's only just that he should die, too!\nMaya:\nMoe!!\nMoe:\nSorry. I crossed the line.

Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nRegina Berry profile\nMoe:\nThat's the Ringmaster's daughter, Regina. Ever since she was a little girl, she's been watching the circus performances. Cuter than a little puppy Maltese, that Regina. If only my Larina was that cute...\nMaya:\nLarina?\nMoe:\nAh... Larina is my daughter. She lives with her mother now.\nPhoenix:\n(It's true what they say about the tears of a clown...)\nRussell Berry profile\nMoe:\nI've been friends with Russell since even before the circus began. He was so selfless. He always thought about others before thinking of himself. I'll find a way to return the favor... He always took such good care of me. I wish I would have thanked him more than I did...\nBen profile\nMoe:\nAh, Ben... How's he doing?\nPhoenix:\nHe's a ventriloquist isn't he?\nMoe:\nThat's right! Boy was I surprised when they told me his secret! He's got a second mouth where his belly button should be!! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Just kidding...\nPhoenix:\nBen wouldn't tell me a single thing about the murder.\nMoe:\nAhh... That's a simple problem to solve. He won't talk if he doesn't have his puppet Trilo!\nMaya:\nTrilo...?\nMoe:\nIf Ben doesn't have his ventriloquist's puppet, you'll barely get a word outta him.\nMaya:\nReally?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Master and puppet...)\nMoe profile\nMoe:\nAh!\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter?\nMoe:\nWhenever I see my own pose, I am reminded of my Italian heritage...\nMaya:\nAhhhh... I see... It must be because you have one of those \"Roman Noses\"... Roamin' all over your face.\nMoe:\n...!!\nMaya:\n... I didn't cross the line there did I?\nPhoenix:\nYou went so far past it, you'll need a map to get back!\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this? Anything come to mind?\nMoe:\nAhh... You want some advice on your development as a comedian, right? I see... Well... This is what you do... When you tell a joke, imagine everyone's wearing underwear and dancing the lambada...\nPhoenix:\nUmm... I think that's enough advice for now...\nMaya:\nNick! He was giving you good advice! Don't be so close-minded!!\nAny other profiles\nMoe:\nThis isn't very funny... How am I supposed to know about people who aren't in the circus!?\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nMoe profile\nMaya:\nMoe is a really nice guy, don't you think Nick? He taught us all about the inner workings of the circus.\nPhoenix:\nYep. It definitely made me look at things in a new light.\nMaya:\nAnd he's got such a great sense of humor. It tickles your funny bone, doesn't it?\nPhoenix:\n(Well... I can't argue that some people might find it funny... But the only thing it tickles on me is my desire for high quality earplugs...)\nBig Top\nPresent\nMoe profile\nRegina:\nThat's Moe! He's such a funny clown! He's been a good friend to my dad for a really long time now.\nMaya:\nHe was good friends with the Ringmaster?\nRegina:\nMy dad always said... \"When it comes to who I can entrust the circus to, it's definitely Moe.\"\nMaya:\nHmm... Yep! That clown is one lovable stooge. Don't you think so, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... No comment...\nAfter presenting Max profile in Lodging Hall 1st Floor - Moe's Room:\nDecember 28Big TopCafeteria\nMaya:\nEww... This place is gross.\nPhoenix:\nThis must be because of last night. They didn't have time to clean up after dinner because of the murder.\nMaya:\nThat reminds me... What was it that Moe said?\nPhoenix:\nHe said that yesterday morning Max \"clonked\" Ben over the head here.\nMaya:\nHe also said that, \"There's Gotti be something interesting there.\" Nick? What's \"Gotti be interesting?\"\nPhoenix:\nDon't ask...\nMaya:\nHmph!\nExamine\nKitchen\nPhoenix:\nThe kitchen is over here. Everyone must have taken turns cooking. There's a duty list posted here.\nMaya:\nI wouldn't mind trying my hand at cooking for this many people. Maya's Killer Hamburger... You'd try it, wouldn't you?\nNotice\nMaya:\n\"Keep Our Cafeteria Clean!\"\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't seem like anyone ever read this sign, huh?\nMaya:\nMaybe they should make it easier to understand... \"Clean it or die!\"\nPhoenix:\nWell, that would definitely make them clean up!\nBulletin board\nPhoenix:\nAh, a bulletin board... For... Umm... Bulletins. It doesn't look like there are any useful clues posted here.\nMaya:\nBoring... Maybe we should leave a juicy tidbit for someone to read!\nPhoenix:\nJuicy?\nMaya:\nYou know... Like a fake clue! Hmm... Maybe something like... \"Message from the Killer!\"\nPhoenix:\nGive it up Maya... You know Gumshoe would take it all seriously.\nStand\nPhoenix:\nThis is strange... There's nothing on top of this stand.\nMaya:\nLook here... Max is written on it. It must be his VIP table.\nPhoenix:\nIsn't a bit small to be a VIP table? You won't be putting a ten course meal on this.\nMaya:\nWell, he could still eat hamburgers, right?\nBack table\nPhoenix:\nThere are dirty dishes all over the place... It must have been too hectic last night to clean up.\nMaya:\nYou know I can't stand a mess Nick! I think you and I should clean this place up for them!\nPhoenix:\nW-Why do we have to clean up...!?\nMaya:\nOne, because I hate dirty cafeterias. Two, because one bears repeating.\nPhoenix:\nB-But... This is a crime scene! We can't clean it up! We have to preserve it for evidence!!\nMaya:\nArrrggghh... You know I really hate dirty cafeterias!!\nPhoenix:\n(Not as much as I hate cleaning dirty cafeterias!)\nDining tables\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like they've left it exactly as it was on the night of the murder.\nMaya:\nThey didn't seem too worried about cleaning up the dishes, did they? Hmm... Looking at all these dishes is making me hungry! Let's go get a burger at the snack stand outside.\nPhoenix:\nOnce we're finished with the case.\nMaya:\n... Alright! Then let's get this over with Nick!! Here we go!! Whoahh!\nPhoenix:\n(Where's the mute button when you need it?)\nKnocked over chairs\nPhoenix:\nThe chair's been knocked over.\nMaya:\nThat's what it looks like.\nPhoenix:\nIt almost looks as if someone knocked it over in a struggle, or used it for self defense...\nMaya:\nOr maybe Regent just likes to eat his dinner in the cafeteria?\nSmashed bottle\nPhoenix:\n(What's this? ...Must be a juice bottle or something?)\nMaya:\nAhhh... Watch out Nick! There's broken glass all over the floor! (Changed from [Ahhh... Watch out Nick! Broken glass on the floor is dangerous!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nHmm... A broken bottle just lying in the middle of the floor.\nMaya:\nDo you think it means anything?\nPhoenix:\n... \"There's Gotti be something interesting there.\"\nMaya:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nLooks like we're going to have to go back and meet with him.\nMaya:\nHim?\nBroken Bottle added to the Court Record.\nSmashed bottle (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\n(What's this? ...Must be a juice bottle or something?)\nMaya:\nAhhh...

How were those Jurassic geriatrics?\nMaya:\nMax, you aren't very popular with the other performers, are you?\nMax:\nYes yes yes. Sweetie, that's what they call jealousy. J-E-A-L-O-U-S-Y. They are absolutely jealous of my absolutely fabulous self! People who really understand can see the obvious differences between us.\nPhoenix:\nPeople who really understand?\nMax:\nFor instance, my sweetie pie.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, so Regina understands him huh?)\nMax:\nI plan on getting married to her. She is truly my sweetie pie princess.\nMaya:\nWow! That's so cool!\nMax:\nIt's already in the works.\nMaya:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(That's strange. Regina never said anything about marrying this joker...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nYou met with the Ringmaster on the night of the murder?\nMax:\nYes. I was with him around 10 PM. Once I was done with practice. I went to his room right after we finished.\nMaya:\nThey found the Ringmaster's body in the plaza in front of the lodging house.\nMax:\nYeah, I head* ([sic]) about that... He needed to step out for a bit, so I waited in his room for him to return.\nMaya:\n...Huh?\nRussell:\n\"Sorry Max. I have something I must attend to right now. Do you mind waiting for me right here?\"\nMax:\n\"It's pretty cold outside. Where's your coat?\"\nRussell:\n\"It's alright. I'll be right back. It should only take about 10 minutes.\"\nPhoenix:\nAnd then?\nMax:\nI waited for him. But he never came back...\nPhoenix:\nDid he go to the plaza where the body was discovered?\nMax:\nPossibly. The snow had tapered off a bit, but it was still very cold outside. But I have no idea what he went off to do...\nMeeting with Russell (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nMax:\nThe truth is... Yesterday morning during breakfast, we had a run in.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you had a fight with Ben the ventriloquist?\nMax:\nYou could put it that way.\nMaya:\nWhy did you fight with him? Ben seems like such a quiet man.\nMax:\nWe fought about my sweetie pie.\nMaya:\nYou mean Regina?\nMax:\nThat ill-bred creep told my sweetie pie princess that he was in love with her! Would you put up with that?\nMaya:\n\"Ill-bred\"!! Are you talking about the same Ben!?\nPhoenix:\n\"Told her he was in love with her\"!! Are you sure this is the Ben we are talking about!?\nMax:\nAll I can say is that he made me mad and I had to tap him on his hard head! That's when the Ringmaster called me and I realized that it was my chance!\nPhoenix:\nYour chance?\nMax:\nThat's when I went to his room and I laid it all out on the table. I asked him to \"Let me marry my sweetie pie!\"\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nMax:\nThe Ringmaster told me that it \"sounds good to me!\" That's why my sweetie pie is MY sweetie pie! And no one else's!\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I see...\nMax:\nSince Ben was causing me so much trouble, I realized I had to shut him up.\nPhoenix:\n(...Shut him up?)\n\"Shut him up\" (appears after \"Meeting with Russell\")\nMaya:\nUm... What do you mean by \"shut him up\"?\nMax:\nYou don't know, do you my sweeties? Trilo can't say a word... Not without Ben. (Changed from [Unless Ben and Trilo are together, Trilo can't say a word.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nTrilo...?\nMax:\nThe puppet. The ventriloquist's puppet. His real name is Trilo Quist.\nPhoenix:\nBut... A puppet doesn't talk.\nMax:\nI know! That's why I hid it! Before the police came and took me away of course... If that puppet started flapping off at the balsa, I'd be screwed.\nMaya:\nYou hid him? You mean the ventriloquist's puppet?\nMax:\nYou are so smart sweetie!\nMaya:\nUmm... Where did you hide him?\nMax:\nWhat? Sweetie... You aren't thinking of trying to add him to my defense are you?\nMaya:\nWell... Ben does seem awfully lonely without his puppet.\nMax:\nFABULOUS! That should have taught him a lesson! OK... I hid Trilo in the Ringmaster's room. You don't mind going there and getting Trilo for me, do you my sweets?\nMaya:\nNo problem! None at all!

The whole truth?\nMax:\nWhat do you mean!?\nPhoenix:\nYou just went to his office to negotiate your new salary?\nMax:\nI hate lies and I hate liars even more! What are you insinuating!?

I said that I HATE LIES!\nPhoenix:\n(It seems this evidence isn't enough to make him confess...)\nMax:\nYou want to try again?

Beauty mark... Soft pillows for lips... A beard... Buck teeth... I gave all sorts of symbols a shot. But if I forget one when I put on my makeup, everyone would forget who I am!\nMaya:\nThat's awful... Especially for a magician.\nRingmaster's Papers\nPhoenix:\nCan I ask what you do with such an exorbitant salary?\nMax:\nWe've already covered this point. I'm paying off my father's debt.\nMaya:\nHow could he possibly have such a large amount of debt?\nMax:\nFor example, say you rented a video... And perhaps you forgot about it, for say... a short period of about 10 years. You'd would* ([sic]) have the biggest late fee known to man... It's kinda like that.\nMaya:\nWow...

You haven't even been truly in love, have you?\nMaya:\nUmm...\nMax:\nWhen you are truly in love with someone... You'd be jealous of their mirror because it traps their image inside.\nMaya:\nAwww... Don't you think that's sweet of him, Nick?\nMax:\nI'm gonna get back with my sweetie pie!

He might know.\nMaya:\nHuh? You don't know?\nRegina:\nWell... Money isn't exactly someone I am on friendly terms with.\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nRegina:\nHe's not really the kind of animal I work with... Even if he does need taming.\nMaya:\nOh, I see!\nPhoenix:\n(Go to Moe's... Hmm... I guess it is time that I revisit that kooky clown...)\nBen and Trilo\nMaya:\nDo you mind telling us a bit about Ben?\nRegina:\nBen...? You mean the guy that is always hanging around with Trilo?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean \"hanging around\"?\nRegina:\nWell, he was there when Trilo told me that he was in love with me...\nPhoenix:\nTrilo told you he was in love with you?\nRegina:\nYes he did. Kinda cute, don't ya think? He's so smart, and he's such a wonderful singer... I love him!\nMaya:\nBut... What about Ben?\nRegina:\nWhat about Ben? He's got nothing to do with me loving Trilo.\nPhoenix:\n(Like sand through the hourglass, so are the Days of the Circus...)\nProposal\nMaya:\nRegina, you were proposed to, weren't you?\nRegina:\nProposed to? Nope... That won't be for a while.\nMaya:\nHuh? Really? That's strange, isn't it Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Max and Trilo both said otherwise. They said they asked for her hand in marriage.\nMaya:\nAhh, but Max only talked to the Ringmaster about it.\nPhoenix:\nI forgot about that. He asked the Ringmaster for her hand, not Regina directly.\nMaya:\nSo I guess Trilo hasn't asked her directly yet.\nRegina:\nWhat!? He's going to propose to me!? I'm so confused... How about you Maya?\nMaya:\nHuh? What?\nRegina:\nWho do you think I should go for? Max or Trilo?\nPhoenix:\nWait... Wait... You do realize that Trilo is... a... puppet?\nRegina:\nUh? I don't care that he's a bit stiff...\nPhoenix:\nOh boy.\nPresent\nCrime Photo\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this...\nMaya:\nNICK! YOU CAN'T SHOW HER THAT PICTURE!!\nPhoenix:\nOuch... Yeah, that would be a bit insensitive of me.\nRegina:\nHuh? Show me! Show me! Show me!\nMax G. Promo Poster\nMaya:\nDo you know how Max flies in the sky like he does?\nRegina:\nI do know! Want me to tell ya?\nMaya:\nYou know!?\nRegina:\nUh-huh. *giggle* But you have to keep it secret!\nPhoenix:\nEh?\nRegina:\nSo here's how it works... *mumble* *mumble*\nMaya:\nWow! That's incredible!!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nOh, don't pout Nick!\nRegina:\nHehe... We were just teasing you! I don't know a thing about magic!!\nMaya:\nSorry we tricked you Nick.\nAfter presenting Trilo Quist, then clearing all Talk options in Big Top - Cafeteria:\nDecember 28Lodging HousePlaza\nMaya:\nHuh? Detective Gumshoe took off already.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Probably because we ditched him earlier. (Changed from [Yep. Just leave him alone for a while, OK Maya?] in the original release) I bet he and the other cops got lonely and headed back to the precinct. (Changed from [I'm sure he just got lonely and headed back to the precinct.] in the original release)\nExamine\nTarp\nPhoenix:\nSomething's covered up by this tarp... An old sign perhaps.\nMaya:\nNick! Look out! They've got the killer trapped behind that tarp!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat? It wasn't funny? You know it wouldn't have hurt you to look even a little bit surprised.\nPhoenix:\n(Whew! She didn't notice that I was too scared to talk!)\nAir conditioner\nPhoenix:\nThis is the condenser for the air conditioner. It hasn't been used in a while.\nMaya:\nWhat!? How'd you figure that out!? You're not making things up now are you!?\nPhoenix:\nHold your horses! It was easy to figure out! It was snowing before the murder, right? Well, look at the condenser. The snow is still piled on top of it.\nMaya:\nWow! Nick! I'm impressed. Maybe you should be a P.I. instead of an attorney.\nLightpost\nMaya:\nThis safety light was on at the time of the murder, wasn't it?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what they say. (There were performers in the lodging house, so it makes sense that it was on. I bet the killer was worried that someone would spot them during the crime...)\nMuddy footprints\nPhoenix:\nThe Ringmaster's body was found here. I heard that the way he fell over made him look like he was carrying a wooden box... But what in the world really happened here?\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room\nMoe:\nOh my! If it isn't \"Mr. Wright All The Time\"!!\nPhoenix:\n*ugh*\nMoe:\nIt's all Wright to be wrong every now and again, Wright?\nMaya:\nSee Nick! It just took awhile for the joke to find its audience!\nPhoenix:\n... *sigh*\nMoe:\nSo what can I do for you? Did you remember a good joke you wanted to tell me? Pull up a chair, or maybe just pull my finger, and let me have it.\nMaya:\nWe're going to get the same sound effect either way, aren't we?\nMoe:\nHow'd you know I put a whopee [sic] cushion on the chair!? You really know what it takes to be a clown, don't you? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nTalk\nRegina\nPhoenix:\nSo, about Regina...\nMoe:\nRegina is such a pure, innocent child...\nMaya:\nShe's such a cutie, too.\nMoe:\nShe was born and raised in the circus you know? But that means she doesn't really know much about the world outside the Big Top.\nMaya:\nSounds like Pearly...\nMoe:\nFor her, every child's \"dream\" of the circus is her everyday reality.\nMaya:\nShe lives in a dream world...\nMoe:\nEveryday she sees dancing wild animals, men flying in the air, and one very funny clown. The funny thing is, that all seems normal to her because it is her everyday life.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that explains why she thinks she can marry a ventriloquist's puppet...)\nMoe:\nDon't ask me if her reality is a good thing or a bad thing though... \"A clown sees life simply, without complications.\"\nMoney the Monkey\nPhoenix:\nHave you ever heard of a monkey named Money?\nMoe:\nAhhh! Yes! Money!\nPhoenix:\nHe stole my Attorney's Badge!\nMoe:\nWell... Money does love shiny objects... It makes sense that he'd swipe your badge. But under no circumstances can you chase after him.\nPhoenix:\nEh? Why's that?\nMaya:\nOh! I know!! You don't want to get involved in any monkey business, right?\nMoe:\nEXACTLY! BRAVO!! BRAVO!! Enough joking around though... Money isn't considered a member of Regina's family.\nMaya:\nThen who does he belong to?\nMoe:\nI'll be happy to take you to where his owner is staying...\nMaya:\nYou mean right now?\nMoe:\nOf course. Shall we go?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, should we go with him now, or wait a while?)\nGo with Moe\nLeads to:\n\"December 28\nLodging Hall 3rd Floor\nAcro's Room\"\nGo later\nPhoenix:\nWe'll go after we talk some more, OK?\nMoe:\nYay! You want to hear me talk some more, huh? Your wish is my command!! I'll give ya the full repertoire of 1001 jokes!\nMaya:\nWoohoo!!\nPhoenix:\nDon't \"Woohoo!!\" that!!\nLeads back to Talk options\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 3rd FloorAcro's Room\nPhoenix:\n*huff* *huff*\nMoe:\nThis is it... What's wrong, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI... can't... breathe...\nMoe:\nDon't be such a wimp! You only had to climb two flights of stairs!!\nPhoenix:\n*pant* *pant*\nMoe:\nAnyways... This is the place. Acro's room.\nPhoenix:\nAcro?\nMoe:\nHe's an acrobat... It seems like he's not around today...\nMaya:\nEh... That's a big pile of junk over in the corner...\nMoe:\nI don't think it'd be wrong to assume that Phoenix's stuff is over there too... Just be careful to make sure you've got the Wright stuff.\nMaya:\nThanks Moe! See you later!\nMoney has been added to the Court Record.\nAcro's Room\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nYou can see the Big Top from the window here.\nMaya:\nThere is no snow on top of the Big Top... Kinda weird don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nThe inside of the tent is warm so any snow that lands on top probably melts.\nMaya:\nI guess you're right. The snow probably just slides right off.\nTire swing\nPhoenix:\nMoney must use this to swing around on...\nMaya:\nGo ahead Nick. I know you want to ride on it too!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe later...\nJunk pile\nLeads to:\n\"Holy cow!\"\nBasketball hoop\nMaya:\nHey... The net's ripped. Money must be prone to breaking things... He's hardcore.\nPhoenix:\nUmm... The net looks fine to me. You really think that he plays basketball?\nMaya:\nI think so... Monkeys live life above the rim you know.\nPhoenix:\n... You're joking right? You think the monkey has got proverbial \"game\"?\nMaya:\nOf course. That monkey doesn't fake the funk on a nasty dunk.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, a prehensile tail might be an unfair advantage...)\nCalendar\nMaya:\nHehe... It's a monkey calendar!\nPhoenix:\nWhoever's in this room must really love monkeys.\nMaya:\nMaybe a little too much... Wow... I just realized that the year is almost over. Amazing how time flies.\nPhoenix:\nIt's been one wild year. Especially the last part...\nMaya:\nWell, we still got one last person to help this year... Max.\nBed\nPhoenix:\nThis bed is incredibly well made. It's almost like a maid made it up. Even the laundry on top of the bed is folded perfectly.\nMaya:\nNick, there's nothing unusual about that at all. It's how things are supposed to be!\nPhoenix:\nCan't a man respect another man for doing something said man cannot do?\nBarbell\nPhoenix:\nHmm... He's got a barbell. Look around... Everything he's got is for upper body training. Wait a second... These are the same machines I see on TV all the time!\nMaya:\nHey, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nI don't have this one! This barbell here is a new model!\nPhoenix:\nDon't overdo it Maya. You don't want to end up a muscle woman.\nMaya:\nHoly cow! There's a fork... And a mirror... Everything's shiny!! There's even a really cheap looking knockoff wristwatch!\nPhoenix:\nLook at this! It's a trophy! And it's really heavy!!\nMaya:\nNick! I found it! Your badge! It's right here!!\nAttorney's Badge returned to its rightful spot on lapel. (Changed from [Phoenix's Attorney's Badge has been returned.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nThanks! You really saved me! ... Huh?\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter? Did you find something?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Check this out.\nMaya:\nIt's a ring...\nPhoenix:\nThere's something engraved on it... \"From T to R\"...\nRing put in pocket.\nPhoenix:\nWell... I think it's about time we wrap up our investigation...\nMaya:\nDo you think we'll win in court tomorrow?\nPhoenix:\nWho knows... Even I can't imagine what kind of testimony will come out tomorrow. (I'm guessing Moe will be a witness in court tomorrow... Moe and maybe the puppet.)\nMaya:\nDon't worry Nick. No matter what, we've still got a magician on our side!!\nPhoenix:\nThat's good, because we might need some magic tomorrow...\nTo be continued.\nMoe's Room (before examining junk pile in Lodging Hall 3rd Floor - Acro's Room)\nMaya:\nHuh? Moe must have gone off somewhere...\nPhoenix:\nJust as long as he isn't off writing new jokes...\nMaya:\nOh, that reminds me Nick... You have to get your Attorney's Badge back by tomorrow, or we're in trouble.\nPhoenix:\nI know. I know. (I'm gonna have to try and find out where that monkey hid it...)\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.\nExit Magatama session\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)\nToo many errors during Magatama session\n...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...\nPhoenix:\n(Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)\n-- What You Witnessed --Moe:\nThe night of the murder, after practice was over, I went straight back to my room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou'd say that practice wrapped up around 10 PM correct?\nMoe:\nSee, that's the thing...\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMoe:\nHow exactly am I supposed to make a joke about 10:00 PM? Now eight o'clock... That's something a clown can riff off of... Let's just pretend it was eight o'clock... That way I can make a great joke!\n\n\n\nLet's not...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLet's not make it 8:00 PM, alright Moe?\nMoe:\nWhat do you mean let's not! Don't take the clown out of the clowning around!\nMaya:\nC'mon Nick, just listen to his joke!\nPhoenix:\nThere are three reasons why I don't want to... One, I probably won't laugh. Two, I'll get hit with a penalty. Three, I'll get whipped. Will the witness just proceed with his factual testimony...\nMaya:\nYou are sooo boring.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAlright, eight o'clock then...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoe:\nYou know you want to hear the joke... A man goes to his doctor and the doctor asks, \"How is number 1?\" The man says \"Everyday at six.\" The doctor asks, \"And 2?\" The man says \"Everyday at seven.\" \"Then what's the matter?\" \"I slept til eight.\"\nvon Karma:\nWitness! These are exactly the type of jokes you should save for Gumshoe!\nPhoenix:\n... OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nYou knew what would happen! Don't look at me like that!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, you're hereby penalized! This will not become a kangaroo court!\nPhoenix:\n(This isn't funny at all... In more ways that* ([sic]) one...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationMoe:\nYou have no idea how tired I was that night. I was pooped.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were \"pooped\" that night?\nMoe:\nYes. I was very very tired... Not to mention I had some bad Mexican food.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMoe:\nThe double cheese double bean enchilada is a dangerous menu item... What happened after that, as they say, \"happens\"... Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! That one was cool, huh? I hear the kids really love toilet humor these days...\nPhoenix:\nThat joke was so hip, I don't want to ruin it with a reply.\nJudge:\nI've got a good reply though. That joke was so funny it just earned you a penalty!Moe:\nI thought I'd go straight to sleep, but before I did, I glanced out the window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou just happened to glance out of the window?\nMoe:\nYou could say that. You could also say I peeked, stared, glimpsed, peeped, eyeballed...\nJudge:\nMr. Curls!!\nMoe:\nOh... I guess synonyms aren't allowed either...\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? I wonder if I should press him further on this issue...)\n\n\n\nLet it rest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nVery well, Moe. How about we get back to your testimony now?\nJudge:\nThis is definitely one of your more straightforward cross-examinations, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Of course! You threatened me with a penalty if I don't keep this stooge in check!)\n\n\n\n\nKeep pressing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nExactly why did you look out of your window that night?\nMoe:\nWhy!? Why!? Clowns don't need a reason to look out their windows, do they!?\nPhoenix:\nThat's not what I meant. I meant that... Well... When we spoke yesterday...\n\n\nMoe:\nOnce I had tucked myself into bed, I heard this amazing noise. It was incredibly loud. It sounded like a giant \"THUMP\"!\n\n\nMoe:\n... Oh yeah! I forgot about that!!\nvon Karma:\nYou... forgot!?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, the witness looked out of his window upon hearing a loud sound. He did not just simply \"glance\" out of his window that night.\nMoe:\nOh yeah! That's right! I forgot to mention that \"THUMP\" didn't I? Owwy Oww Oww...\nvon Karma:\nThat's not something you just \"forget to mention\"!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Yeah... What she said... I believe it would be best if Moe were to revise his testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Mr. Curls. Please revise your testimony.\nPhoenix:\n(This should start turning the tables in our favor!)\nChanges statement from \"I thought I'd go straight to sleep, but before I did, I glanced out the window.\" to \"I heard a huge noise outside the window, and that's what made me take a look outside...\"Moe:\nI heard a huge noise outside the window, and that's what made me take a look outside...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was the sound like?\nMoe:\nWell... I guess it kinda sounded like... Hmm... I guess you could say...\nJudge:\nMr. Curls. May the court remind you that humor is unnecessary.\nMoe:\nDoh! How'd you know that I was gonna make a joke! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! I guess that the sound sounded like a... I suppose it sounded like someone getting hit with something very hard... Yep. That's what it sounded like. Honestly.\nJudge:\n\"Someone getting hit...\" huh?\nvon Karma:\nWhat then? You went to look out the window and you saw...Moe:\nThat's when I saw two silhouettes! They were a bit far away though!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nFar away you say... If you had to say exactly, how far away were they?\nMoe:\nLet me think about that for a second... If my room is here... And they looked about yay-big... I'd say they were about 30 feet from my window.\nvon Karma:\nJust 30 feet? That's not far at all!\nMoe:\nIt was snowing that night, and it cut down on visibility.\nJudge:\nI see. Please continue with your testimony regarding the two shadows that you saw.Moe:\nIt was the Ringmaster, and he was with Max, who was wearing his cloak!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou'd say you clearly saw this? Even though you were, by your own admission, far away?\nMoe:\nThat's right. I had been thinking about it over and over since that night, but things didn't really make sense until I spoke with the prosecutor, Ms. von Karma. But now I am 100% certain that it was Max and the Ringmaster that I saw that night. Just think about it? How could I be wrong if Max is always wearing his uppity symbols?\nPhoenix:\nUppity symbols?\nMoe:\nLawyers nowadays!! Do you even have to go to school anymore to be one? Alright! Everyone knows what to do!! Altogether now!! Say it with Uncle Moe!\n.....................\nMoe:\n... See what I mean!! It's always like this! The crown never wants to go along with me! I must really be utterly and completely worthless as a clown... Yeowza!\nvon Karma:\nEnough foolishness, get back on track!\nJudge:\nWill the witness please testify as to what he saw... And only what he saw!Moe:\nI kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou say you saw the Ringmaster get \"clonked\" over the head!?\nMoe:\nYes, I did!! It's the climax of my story!\nPhoenix:\n(He really does enjoy the completely random non sequitur...) What would you say the victim was struck with?\nMoe:\nYou mean weapon? I have no idea. A weapon wasn't found at the murder scene, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's not what I meant... You did say you did see \"everything\", didn't you? (Changed from [No no no... You did say you saw the entire thing, didn't you?] in the original release)\nMoe:\nWell... I, umm... Yeah, I suppose I did. Wait... No I didn't. I didn't see a weapon... Heh heh heh!\nPhoenix:\nMoe! Did you or did you not see the crime of murder committed that night!?\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nI will not permit you to harass my witness in this manner! You'd better have an excellent reason for attacking this poor, poor clown. Because if you don't... You know what is waiting for you... A nice penalty!\nPhoenix:\n*gulp* (Wasn't that a bit melodramatic...)\nvon Karma:\nSo what will it be then, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Do you have any clear basis to believe that my witness did not see the crime?\n\n\n\nOf course I don't!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell... See... Right now, I don't have a clear basis to be thinking that...\nvon Karma:\nThen this is just another one of your pointless efforts to badger my witness! Thus, you have just earned yourself a penalty... FROM ME!!\nJudge:\nNow wait a second Ms. von Karma! This time, I do not feel the need to treat Mr. Wright so harshly.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right! What he said! (Bailed out by the judge! What an honor indeed!)\nJudge:\nIf we must penalize Mr. Wright for his display, I think a verbal censure would be best.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nJudge:\nYou know the rules Mr. Wright. There is no room for baseless hounding in this courtroom.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he didn't really bail me out after all...)\nLeads back to cross-exmaination\n\n\n\n\nOf course I do! (before changing third statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course I have grounds to make this claim!\nvon Karma:\nThen let's hear it!\nPhoenix:\nThat's something I can't share with you at this time.\nJudge:\nW-W-What did you just say!? Mr. Wright!!\nPhoenix:\n(I know there's something wrong with this testimony... But I can't put why I feel this way into words for the Judge...)\nMaya:\nMaybe we should get a bit more information... Once we find something more solid, we can give it another shot!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you're right...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, before we resume testimony, you know that you must be penalized.\nPhoenix:\n(Yikes. That's harsh...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nOf course I do! (after changing third statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I've got a great reason to make my claim!\"Maya:\nYou know... Moe's testimony and what he told us yesterday are kinda different...Phoenix:\nYeah I noticed. We've just got to pinpoint what's changed.Maya:\nYou can do it, Nick!Phoenix:\nI've got a great reason to make my claim!von Karma:\nAnd I suppose you will be telling us all that \"great\" reason?Phoenix:\nOf course I will... The reason is... The witness' very own testimony!Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of that Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nMoe said that he heard a sound like a \"thump\" of someone getting hit.Judge:\nHmm... He did say that.Phoenix:\nHowever, Moe just stated the following under oath.Moe:\nI kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head!Phoenix:\nIf Moe is to be believed when he says he looked out the window upon hearing a sound, there is no way that he could have seen Max \"clonk\" anyone!Moe:\nIn 1972, a crack clown unit was sent to prison by a circus court for a crime...Judge:\nMr. Curls! How do you respond to Mr. Wright's assessment!!?Moe:\n...they didn't commit. These clowns promptly escaped from a maximum security clown car...Judge:\nMr. Curls, are you reciting the C-Team theme to anger this court?Moe:\nNo no no... I'm just stalling for time while I jog my memory...Maya:\nGreat job, Nick!Phoenix:\nThese types of witnesses always seem to have a selective memory... You just have to peel back the layers of the clown make-up to find the truth.Moe:\nWell... Umm...Judge:\nAhh, you're back from your jog?Moe:\nWell... It pretty much happened the way I said.Phoenix:\n\"Pretty much\"...?Moe:\nWhen I looked out my window that night, the Ringmaster was already face down in the snow. The prosecution helped me fill in the gaps of my statement.Phoenix:\n(Von... Von Karma!! Tampering with witnesses again!!)von Karma:\n...Judge:\nSo now you are saying that you did not see the defendant \"clonk\" the Ringmaster?Moe:\nY-Yes... When I looked out my window, the Ringmaster had already checked out.Judge:\nChecked out?Moe:\nYep. He was on permanent vacation as they say. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!Judge:\nMr. Curls!!Moe:\nYour Honor?Judge:\nYou did not witness the actual crime; however, you still say you saw the criminal, correct?Moe:\nY-Y-YES!! Exactly! The Ringmaster was slumped over and I saw someone's silhouette next to him.Judge:\nVery well. Then please testify to this silhouette you saw... I expect the truth! And if I even catch a hint of a joke from you... I will put you in a holding cell until you learn court etiquette, got it!?Moe:\nGot it.Witness Testimony-- The Silhouette --Moe:\nI was a bit far away, but that shadow could only have belonged to Max.\nThere's no doubting it. Especially since I saw his uppity symbols.\nHis silk hat. That black cloak. They were all there!\nHis face was silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him.\nHis cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying.Judge:\nHmm... It does seem as if the defendant was at the scene of the crime.von Karma:\nIt took the clown long enough to get his facts straight. (Changed from [You took your time realizing that, didn't you!?] in the original release) But whatever. This should finally be good enough, yes? (Changed from [Whatever. That should be enough, right!?] in the original release)Judge:\nIt is decisive testimony...Maya:\nWas Max really at the crime scene that night...?Phoenix:\nHe said he wasn't there. We have to believe in that. (Changed from [He said he wasn't there. We have to keep believing that.] in the original release)Judge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright. Commence your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Silhouette --Moe:\nI was a bit far away, but that shadow could only have belonged to Max.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDon't you think that you are going a little overboard with how explicit you're being? 'That shadow belonged to Max' is an awfully firm statement, don't you think?\nMoe:\nWhat are you getting at...?\nPhoenix:\nI'm just saying that one of your fellow performer's life is on the line here. Are you truly, 100% absolutely certain that it was Max?\nMoe:\n... I'm not the kind of person who would lie about something as serious as this! The silhouette I saw was Max. I'm convinced of that.\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't seem like he is jumping to any conclusions this time...) Let's go over this again then. What makes you so sure that you saw Max that night?Moe:\nThere's no doubting it. Especially since I saw his uppity symbols.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nTrilo said the same thing. But if it was just the symbols, then even I could have been wearing them. What if someone had just taken Max's symbols and worn them?\nMoe:\nI thought of that myself. But just looking at the shape of the face I saw, it must have been Max.\nJudge:\nHmm... You're sure of that!?\nvon Karma:\nSuch a silly little boy... He threw his entire case headlong into a trap!Present Max G. Promo Poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You say you saw all of Max's \"uppity\" symbols?\"Moe:\nHis silk hat.

The more we look into this matter, the more suspicious it becomes.\nMoe:\nHey! You asked me what my eyesight was like, not what it actually was!Moe:\nHis cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you didn't actually see what the criminal was holding?\nMoe:\nThat's correct. I've been curious to know what caused that loud noise... It must have been something incredibly hard.\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad they haven't found the murder weapon to know for sure...)\nMaya:\nThey claim it was a blunt object... At least it says so in the autopsy report.Phoenix:\n(With Trilo's testimony, and now Moe's... It really seems like Max is the killer.)Maya:\nN-Nick... You've gotta find a contradiction in this.Phoenix:\nThat's not going to be enough...Maya:\nWhat?Phoenix:\nI have to prove that Moe saw someone other than Max that night!

The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "To find the contradiction between the evidence and the testimony, let's analyze what's been presented:\n\n**Testimony 3**: Moe claims, \"His face was silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him.\" Moe is asserting that he was sure it was Max, even though he only saw a silhouette. Identifying someone from a silhouette usually involves recognizing distinctive features or accessories.\n\n**Evidence 4**: The Max G. Promo Poster highlights Max's three famous symbols: a silk hat, cloak, and white roses. These symbols are distinctive to Max's public persona.\n\nThe issue lies in Moe's testimony that he was 100% certain of Max's identity based on a silhouette. In such low-light conditions, it's improbable Moe could have identified Max solely by a silhouette—especially his facial features—which were silhouetted, making them indiscernible.\n\nHowever, by highlighting evidence referring to visual markers (such as the symbols and distinctive attire), we establish that Moe is basing his identification on the attire and symbols Max is known for, not on facial recognition. This casts doubt on the reliability of Moe's certainty solely from a silhouette. The clash is between Moe's confidence in identifying Max's face (silhouetted) and evidence emphasizing fashion cues rather than facial details.\n\nHence, the contradiction is between Moe's testimony about the silhouetted face with certainty it was Max and the fact that his recognition could only have been due to Max's notable attire (from the promo poster).\n\n{\"evidence\": 4, \"testimony\": 3}",

I think it's time to get to work.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick? Why are you looking at the ceiling?\nPhoenix:\nI was just thinking about what I should have for lunch.\nMax:\nSweetie... Drop porcupine head over there. Shower me with your attention.

I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.\nTalk\nMax Galactica\nMaya:\nMax, I was hoping you could tell me a little bit more about yourself...\nMax:\nFABULOUS! I think we should get to know each other better, too! Why don't you come sit next to me?\nMaya:\nUmm... There's a big piece of security glass between us...\nMax:\nOh sweet geebus! What in the world!? If only I could use magic! Then I could make this wall disappear...\nPhoenix:\n(What is this guy talking about!?) Anyways... Lately, you've become awfully famous, haven't you Max?\nMax:\nThat's Maximillion to you, porcupine head! Get it straight!\nPhoenix:\n(Jeez, people nowadays... They get their panties all in a bunch over nothing!) Anyway, Maximillion, you won a very prestigious award recently, did you not?\nMax:\nI did indeed! It was FABULOUS! I won the Magician's Grand Prix, held by the Association of International Magicians. It's an award that recognizes that I am the most fabulouso of fabulous world magicians. There was a trophy, and a bust. It was a fab... I mean it was an amazing day.\nMaya:\nWow! That's incredible!\nMax:\nIsn't it!? I'm certainly the greatest magician in the world!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm going to guess he didn't win a trophy for most modest magician.)\nBerry Big Circus\nMaya:\nYou are signed to an exclusive contract with the Berry Big Circus, correct?\nMax:\nThat's the long and short of it. You sure do your research sweetie! I'm impressed. You just can't watch a magician on TV, you know!? Magic is so fabulous, you have to see it with your own eyes, sweetie!\nMaya:\nYou're right! You're so right!\nMax:\nHowever, the circus... It's a dinosaur. A thing of the past. Nowadays, no one even cares about what goes on there.\nMaya:\nHuh? What do you mean?\nMax:\nThat's why I signed the contract!!\nPhoenix:\nThat's why you signed the contract?\nMax:\nThanks to me, the Berry Big Circus is fabulously popular! People come out in droves to catch a glimpse of the magic of Max Galactica! I revived the dinosaur that is the circus! But to me, it was just another magic trick! Isn't it just wonderful, sweetie?\nMaya:\nY-Yes...\nMax:\nI made all the old crusty performances obsolete!\nMaya:\nBut I kinda like the circus performances...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks a bit down...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nTell me what happened at the Berry Big Circus.\nMax:\nAhh... Last night. The Ringmaster was murdered.\nMaya:\nThe Ringmaster... You mean Russell Berry?\nMax:\nSomeone smashed him over the head, I hear. He was slumped over on the ground. Even though it was the middle of the night, the police presence was fabulous. The police questioned me at length...\nPhoenix:\nQuestioned you about what?\nMax:\nAbout everything... I was the last one to see the Ringmaster before he was murdered. I saw him last evening... In his room. (Changed from [I saw him that night... In his room.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nSo then why were you arrested?\nMax:\nArrested? Don't make an ant hill into a mountain, sweetie. They just wanted to consult with me on matters... That's all.\nMaya:\nNick... I don't think Max understands how serious this is.\nPhoenix:\n(She's right... I think I should shock him back to reality...)\nMeeting with Russell (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nBefore the murder, you met with the Ringmaster?\nMax:\nUh-huh.\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you talk about?\nMax:\nThings that aren't for your ears.\nPhoenix:\nMaya. Would you please ask him?\nMaya:\nWhat did you talk about with the Ringmaster, Max?\nMax:\nIt was nothing... Small talk really... We were just having a chat about my salary.\nMaya:\nSalary?\nMax:\nI am the one bringing in the crowds. (Changed from [I am the one bringing in all of the crowds to the circus.] in the original release) I think that I should be compensated as such. You agree, don't you?\nMaya:\nY-Yes...\nPhoenix:\nThat's all you talked about?\nMax:\nOf course! It was a fabulous chat!\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(Just fabulous! I mean-- Argh! Now he's got ME saying it!) (Changed from [Fabulous! Why does he have to keep saying fabulous!?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick? You look all bent out of shape.\nMeeting with Russell (subsequent times)\nMax:\nWhen you make absolutely fabulous magic... It costs enormous sums of money. Sums that will boggle your mind!\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nMaya:\nThat's why you went to his room that night...?\nMax:\nI went to ask him for a fabulous raise.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder how people can lie with such a straight face...)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMax:\nWhat is that badge? Is it used in a disappearing act?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not a magician, Max. I'm an attorney.\nMax:\nAn attorney? Then why are you wasting your time talking to me?\nMaya:\nHe isn't wasting his time! Max... You're...\nMax:\nOK! OK! Relax, sweetie... You're just a little overanxious, I think...\nMaya:\n*whimper*\nMaya Fey profile\nMax:\nSo, would you like to come up on stage with me sometime?\nMaya:\nRe-Really?

He's planting her in the audience to rig a magic trick!)\nMax profile\nPhoenix:\nDo you mind taking a look at this?\nMax:\nI guess I have no choice... But really, is this the proper time or place for this?\nPhoenix:\n(He signed his own photo...)\nMaya:\nNick... You mind giving that to me when the case is over?\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this?\nMax:\nFabulous!! You'd like me to sign this for you?\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh*)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Attorney's Badge:\nMax:\n... Anyways... I've been curious about something for a while now.\nMaya:\nWhat's that?\nMax:\nWhy do you keep looking at me with such a sad look on your face, sweetie?\nMaya:\nBe-Because! You've been arrested! For murder!\nMax:\nOh, don't be ignorant. They wouldn't arrest someone like me!!\nPhoenix:\nWhy is that?\nMax:\nObviously because I'm the fabulous Maximillion Galactica!\nPhoenix:\nSo?\nMax:\nI'm the very big star of the Berry Big Circus.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that means?\nMax:\nI'm rich. I'm paid fabulous sums!\nPhoenix:\nWhich means what?\nMax:\n...\nMaya:\nMax...\nMax:\nQuit joking around! You've got to be pulling my magic wand! The police aren't really serious about all this, are they?\nPhoenix:\nThey don't arrest people as a joke.\nMax:\n...!!\nMaya:\nLook at Max... He's crushed...\nPhoenix:\nWell he needed to wake up and smell the coffee. (This is serious business.)\nMax:\nUmm... Umm...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMax:\nPorcu... I mean, Sir. You're a lawyer, right?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Oh, yeah. I'm an attorney.\nMax:\nPlease! Help me! I didn't kill nobody!\nMaya:\n\"Didn't kill nobody!?\"\nMax:\nI may be more spoiled than a hog in a hamburger mud pit... But a killer!? That's insane... I... I... I could never...\nMaya:\nM-Max?\nMax:\nI swear!! I just wanted to pay off my daddy's debt... He's back on the farm...\nPhoenix:\nOK... OK... I'll take your case.\nMax:\nR-Really?\nPhoenix:\nReally.\nMax:\nUh... Thank ya much. Ya'll sure are nice folks.\nMaya:\nUmm...

I must apologize for not being my absolutely fabulous self just now, sweetie.\nMaya:\nH-Huh?\nMax:\nMr. Attorney.\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMax:\nA few minutes ago, you took one of my cards, didn't you?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Now that he mentions it... I did take a card.)\nMax:\nIt was the 10 of Hearts. Right?\nPhoenix:\n(Wha... How'd he... He got it right, again!)\nMax:\nWhat can I say? You, too... You've stolen some of my most valued possessions. Ten of Maximillion Galactica's hearts...\nPhoenix:\n(You sure do have a lot of hearts, don't you?)\nMax:\nAh ha ha ha... I'm putting my faith in you sweetie.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't just call me sweetie, did he?)\nMaya:\nAlright! Let's make this an absolutely fabulous case! C'mon, Nick!\nDecember 28Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nAlright... We've got lots of things we have to look into. No time for slacking. Let's get going.\nMaya:\nOK.\nPhoenix:\n? What's the matter? You seem down.\nMaya:\nMaximilion Galactica... Who would have guessed he was country bumpkin?\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSo now what do we do?\nMaya:\nHuh? There's still lots of things we can do! Go to the scene of the crime, talk to witnesses, gather evidence...\nPhoenix:\nYeah.

Who knows how many times you have shown it to me?\nPhoenix:\n(She's right... I whip it out at the drop of a hat.)\nMaya Fey profile\nMaya:\nOnce you start channeling spirits... They say you lose sight of who you actually are...\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Do you really believe that?\nMaya:\nNot really. But... Just in case, I plan to write my autobiography.\nPhoenix:\nYour autobiography...?\nMax profile\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the matter? You've been acting strange for a while now.\nMaya:\nMax... He's just some country bumpkin...\nPhoenix:\nSo? Why does that matter? He's still a famous magician right?\nMaya:\nI guess. But his real name is... Billy Bob Johns.\nPhoenix:\n(Yikes! The poor guy's got three first names! I guess that is pretty odd.)\nMaya:\nOh well! If a big star can do it, then you should pretend to be exotic too, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n\"A big star...\"?\nMaya:\nMax Galactica is a pretty big name! Anyways, what do you think about Naruhodo A.

What's the \"A\" stand for?\nMaya:\nThe \"A\" stands for \"Attorney\".\nPhoenix:\nI'll think about it...\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nThis is kinda pointless don't you think?\nMaya:\nIf it's that pointless, then you don't have to worry about showing it to me.\nPhoenix:\n(When she's right...

You don't really see too many streamers nowadays, do you?\nMaya:\nYou're right. I haven't seen one in ages. I bet they stopped using them due to little kids climbing up to the top...\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... I don't think that was why...)\nVendors\nPhoenix:\nIt's a snack stand. They have hot dogs, hamburgers, and drinks... Not to mention...\nMaya:\nCandy and popcorn... They've even got snow cones!!\nPhoenix:\n(Who would eat snow cones in the middle of winter?)\nMaya:\nNick... Do you think we can buy some snow cones?\nPhoenix:\nLook around... There's tons of snow piled up all around here!\nMaya:\nYAY!! Wait a second... There's no syrup though! I want syrup!\nPhoenix:\n(Hopefully she doesn't notice that discolored snow in the corner. That's not syrup!)\nEntrance\nMaya:\nNick... The entrance is right here.\nPhoenix:\nMaya. The circus is closed today. No clowns. No elephants. No shows.\nMaya:\nI know that! Nick... You can get your picture taken with Dali the elephant!\nPhoenix:\nThere's no Dali. Not today.\nMaya:\nI know that too! Oh well... I'll just have to take a picture with whoever I stumble across...\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* It's not like we're here on business or anything...)\nTicket booths\nPhoenix:\nThis is the Box Office where they sell all the tickets for the circus.\nMaya:\nThey also sell programs. I forgot to buy one when we came to the circus last time.\nPhoenix:\nSo then why don't you buy one now?\nMaya:\nHmm... Sounds like a plan. Oh no... It looks like I forgot my wallet. ...\nPhoenix:\nIf you want me to buy it for you, just ask me already.\nMaya:\nYou know I'd never do that to you, Nick...\nDoor\nMaya:\nHmm... This door must lead to the lodging house.\nPhoenix:\n\"No Entry To Unauthorized Personnel\"\nMaya:\nDo you really need to say \"No Entry\" if no one's actually entering? It's almost like a zen riddle, isn't it Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not even going to justify that question with a response...)\nMaya:\nI bet all of the stars stay at that lodging house.\nDecember 28Lodging HousePlaza\nPhoenix:\nThis seems to be a dorm where all the performers in the circus stay...\nMaya:\nReally!? So we might run into that stoogey clown here, right? He's so kooky! (Changed from [Really!? So that stoogey clown should be here, huh? He's so kooky!] in the original release)\n???:\nAhhh! It's you two!\nMaya:\nOh... Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nHow is it you guys always seem to know when I'm working a crime scene, pal? (Changed from [I always see you hanging around when I'm working a crime scene, pal.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nBecause you're always working, Detective. (Changed from [You always seem to be working so hard, Detective.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'd rather not be always working, but with crime, you don't make your own hours. (Changed from [I'd rather not be working hard, but with crime you don't make your own hours.] in the original release) If I have to be at the circus anyway, I want to see the lion tamer and the tightrope. However, no matter where I go, the show is always the same... Dead body. Stage left.\nMaya:\nNick! Nick! He complained!!\nPhoenix:\nHeh heh... That's a rarity. Let's get back to business now, OK?\nExamine\nTarp\nPhoenix:\nThere's some evidence under the tarp over there...\nGumshoe:\nHey! Watch it, pal! The killer is behind that tarp!!\nMaya:\nAHHHHH!!\nGumshoe:\nHo! Ho! Ho! Got ya! I was just kidding!\nMaya:\nGRRR!\nGumshoe:\nHo! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!\nAir conditioner\nGumshoe:\nThis year, I finally won an air conditioner!\nMaya:\nWhat!? You didn't have an air conditioner? Did you ride your triceratops to work too?\nPhoenix:\nAnd what do you mean you \"won\" an air conditioner? You didn't buy it?\nGumshoe:\nI can't afford one of those things!! But I got lucky and won it as a door prize at the Annual Police Christmas Party!\nMaya:\nThey really pay you peanuts don't they?\nGumshoe:\nPeanuts? I don't even get paid enough for peanut butter, let alone peanuts!\nLightpost\nGumshoe:\nThe safety lights around the circus are kept on all night long. So, they should have been on at the time of the murder...\nPhoenix:\n(So he's saying the murder took place in the light...?)\nGumshoe:\nHow strange...\nMaya:\nHow strange indeed... Hmm...\nMuddy footprints\nPhoenix:\nThis is the only place that the snow has been trounced upon.\nMaya:\nThe murderer was sloppy leaving all these prints all over!\nGumshoe:\nNo no no no no... We're the ones who left the prints... An investigation can be a messy thing sometimes.\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nI also slipped and fell in that spot over there. The other detectives all got a good laugh when the prosecutor whipped me. Thank god there was all this snow around to bring down the swelling.\nPhoenix:\n(It's great to know that the police aren't worried about preserving the evidence...)\nTalk\nTomorrow's trial\nPhoenix:\nDo you know who will be the prosecutor in court tomorrow?\nGumshoe:\nOf course. It will be Ms. von Karma.\nPhoenix:\nUhhh... She isn't gonna hit me with her whip again, is she?\nGumshoe:\nWhat do you have to worry about? You only have to see her in court! When she shows up at the precinct, the sound of that whip never ends, pal.\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe... I'm sure Ms. von Karma's really interesting and all, but... (Changed from [Detective Gumshoe... That's enough about Von Karma.] in the original release) there's someone else I'd rather talk about. (Chagned from [What about that guy? What is he up to?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nLike who? (Changed from [That guy?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nLike Mr. Edgeworth, of course! (Changed from [What happened to Edgeworth?] in the original release) You know! Nick's true rival, Miles Edgeworth! (Changed from [You know! The Edgeworth that's Nick's rival!] in the original release) What in the world happened after I went back home!? (Changed from [What in the world happened when I went back home!?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth... You haven't heard what happened to him?\nMaya:\nNick won't tell me!\nGumshoe:\nWell, to be honest... I'm not at liberty to tell you either. Let's just say he's not around anymore.\nMaya:\nHe's not around!?!? Nick! What does he mean Mr. Edgeworth isn't around!?\nPhoenix:\nExactly what he said. He's not around. Edgeworth is gone... Don't say his name again, OK?\nMaya:\nN-Nick?\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nThe Ringmaster of the circus was murdered, wasn't he?\nGumshoe:\nYep. Last night around 10 PM. He died outside in the cold. A pretty sad way to go out if you ask me, pal.\nMaya:\n... It was rather cold.\nGumshoe:\nThis is the scene of the crime, pal. The body was found right over there. Right about where you are standing now.\nMaya:\nAHHHHHHHHHHH!!\nGumshoe:\nHo! Ho! Ho! Surprised you, didn't I?\nMaya:\nI'm not laughing!\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, but do you mind telling me what happened to the victim?\nGumshoe:\nHe was killed by a blow to the noggin, pal.\nMaya:\nYeep!\nGumshoe:\nIt's pretty clear cut as far as murders go. He was discovered quickly. But...\nPhoenix:\nBut?\nGumshoe:\nThere's just one thing that doesn't quite fit.\nMaya:\nHah! There always seems to be something that doesn't quite fit!!\nSomething unusual (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat was this one thing that just didn't quite fit? The thing you mentioned earlier.\nGumshoe:\nFootprints, pal. Footprints.\nMaya:\nFootprints?\nGumshoe:\nLook at this picture of the crime scene...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this? This wooden box under the body?\nGumshoe:\nNo clue, pal. Some forensics experts took it back and are examining it now.\nMaya:\nAnd... And... What is so mysterious about the footprints?\nGumshoe:\nWhoa. Calm down now. Take a good look at the footprints in this picture.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim's footprints are on the scene.\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The problem is...\nMaya:\n...! The killer's footprints aren't there!!\nGumshoe:\nBingo. Where did the killer come from, and where did the killer run off to? Obviously, there is no way the killer committed this crime while flying.\nPhoenix:\nA flying... culprit? (Changed from [A flying... Criminal?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(That's when something just clicked in my head...)\nMaya:\nT-There's no way! Flying is impossible!\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. Flying is impossible! Absolutely impossible! Haha...\nGumshoe:\nWhat's with the hollow laugh, pal?\nPhoenix:\nI meant nothing by it, pal...\nGumshoe:\n...?\nPhoenix:\n(Better stated, it means I don't want to talk about it. Maybe I can get some info about Max out of him...)\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nSomething unusual (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nWhat was this one thing that just didn't quite fit? The thing you mentioned earlier.\nGumshoe:\nFootprints, pal. Footprints.\nMaya:\nFootprints?\nGumshoe:\nLook at this picture of the crime scene...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this? This wooden box under the body?\nGumshoe:\nNo clue, pal. Some forensics experts took it back and are examining it now.\nMaya:\nAnd... And...

Maybe I can get some info about Max out of him...)\nThe eyewitness (Changed from [Eyewitnesses] in the original release) (appears after presenting Max profile)\nPhoenix:\nUmm... So about the eyewitness... (Changed from [Umm... How about any eyewitnesses...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nHo! Ho! Ho! You know I'm not going to tell you that! That's the prosecution's trump card!!\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Oh well...\nGumshoe:\n... Oh! I just remembered!!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nI forgot to mention that you two are barred from entering that lodging house.\nMaya:\n...? Why is that?\nGumshoe:\nOh... No reason! Just something I remembered to tell you.\nMaya:\nIt must be because that's where the eyewitness is. (Changed from [It must be because there's an eyewitness inside that Lodging House.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nLet's check it out!\nGumshoe:\nDon't you dare, pal! (Changed from [Oh no you don't, pal!] in the original release)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nGumshoe:\nC'non. You've flashed that badge at me so many times it doesn't work anymore! Why don't you try wearing a different badge every now and again?\nMaya:\nWell... I do have a Steel Samurai Badge with me. How about that one?\nPhoenix:\nI'll only wear it if Detective Gumshoe carries a Steel Samurai Police Badge.\nMaya:\nThen it's a deal! I hear that Detective Gumshoe has that very badge! ...\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? Don't look at me like that!! You're making me nervous!\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nBeing a spirit medium is quite an accomplishment... And you're so young too! That's really something!!\nMaya:\nActually, I've been thinking of taking a break from channeling.\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nMaya:\nI don't want to have another incident like last time.\nMax profile\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like Max is the most unpopular guy in the circus tent. You know what they say... A bad attitude follows you everywhere...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, he's a bit arrogant, but he didn't seem that bad.)\nMaya:\nBut just because someone has a bad attitude doesn't make them a criminal.\nGumshoe:\nIt's not just his attitude... I've got proof, pal!\nMaya:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nHe left something at the scene of the crime! One of his magician's trademarks! An incredibly well-made silk hat.\nMaya:\nWell it does have very classy decorative elements.\nSilk Hat added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nMax uses a cloak, silk hat, and white roses as his signature symbols.\nPhoenix:\n... Pretty mundane, aren't they?\nMaya:\nWho cares if they are mundane!? At least they are easy to understand!!\nPhoenix:\n(I must have hit a nerve...)\nGumshoe:\nThat's what he said.\nPhoenix:\nWho said?\nGumshoe:\nThe eyewitness.\nMaya:\nEh!?\nPhoenix:\nT-Tell us about the eyewitness!!\nMax profile (subsequent times)\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like Max is the most unpopular guy in the circus tent.

I'm making a really strange tired looking face here...\nMaya:\nHmm... Are you sure you weren't born looking like that?\nGumshoe:\nI wish I was more lively... ... Right now, I'm just tired.\nMaya:\nWell, there's not much you can do about that, so you just gotta keep on being tired!\nGumshoe:\nYou're right!\nPhoenix:\n(Glad I stayed out of that one...)\nFranziska von Karma profile\nGumshoe:\nYou're going down this time, pal!\nPhoenix:\nOh... Is that right?\nGumshoe:\nShe's been practicing 100 cracks a day, pal.\nPhoenix:\nCracks? Wait... You don't mean cracks of the...\nGumshoe:\nYep. Cracks of the WHIP!\nPhoenix:\nUhhh...\nAnything else\nGumshoe:\nYou know I can't tell you two anything about the evidence we have gathered!\nMaya:\nStingy!\nGumshoe:\n... Stingy!? When you put it so bluntly, it kinda hurts my feelings, pal...\nAfter clearing \"The eyewitness\" Talk option in Lodging House - Plaza:\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room\nPhoenix:\nI wonder whose room this is. (Changed from [This is it?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nThe nametag on the door says \"Moe\" on it.\nPhoenix:\nI guess he's not here...\nMaya:\nWow... It's a real mess in here!\nPhoenix:\n(My room's probably worse though...)\nMaya:\nOh well... I give up. We'll have to come back later.\nExamine\nCostumes\nPhoenix:\nAll those clown costumes lined up like that... I dunno about you, but it's creepy.\nMaya:\nLook at the collection he's got! It's incredible!\nPhoenix:\nIt must be a collection of clown costumes from around the world.\nMaya:\nOh! I almost forgot!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it now? (She better not want me to try one of those on!)\nMaya:\nI was thinking of starting a costume collection myself! I'll call it \"World Spirit Channels\"... We can display it in our office!\nPhoenix:\nIn OUR office!? As soon as you start paying the bills, you can say that.\nBoarded up cracks in ceiling\nPhoenix:\nLook at the ceiling... It looks like someone punched a hole in it!\nMaya:\nYou're right. I wonder what happened?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I don't even want to imagine what goes on in here.)\nCarrots\nMaya:\nWhat the!? There's a string of carrots here!\nPhoenix:\nHow strange. The carrots seem to come in all different shapes... Weird... I can't tell if Moe just likes carrots, or if he is using them for some sort of gag.\nWindow\nMaya:\nNick, you can see the scene of the crime from here.\nPhoenix:\n(You can even tell that the ground has been disturbed...)\nMaya:\nIt's right in front of this window, about 30 feet away.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it wouldn't have been strange for someone to have seen the crime from here.)\nPajamas\nPhoenix:\nMoe's got an excellent pair of pajamas... Laid on his bed in an excellent manner.\nMaya:\nWhat? Those are pajamas? You mean he goes to bed dressed as a clown? Eww...\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMoe seems to be a voracious reader. Look at all the hard books he has here. \"Clowns for Dummies\", \"The Joke's On You\", \"Treat Your Peons Right\", And the classic \"Funny Jokes Are Funny.\"\nMaya:\nWow. Moe is very studious.\nPhoenix:\n\"The Joke's On You\"... Huh?\nClown equipment\nMaya:\nTee hee... Clown equipment is so funny looking!\nPhoenix:\nHe's got a balancing ball, a unicycle... He's even got a trampoline!! ... But they're all broken.\nMaya:\nMaybe he was just a little too excited during practice?\nPhoenix:\n(Who knows with that guy. Maybe that's part of the gag?)\nShoes or banana peel\nMaya:\nAwesome! Look at these shoes! They're great!\nPhoenix:\nForget the shoes! Check out the great gag banana peel!\nMaya:\nYou sure it wasn't Moe's snack after lunch?\nPhoenix:\n(Are you blind? Look at how many scratches there are from people slipping on it!!)\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusBig Top\nPhoenix:\nThe circus stage sure doesn't look this small from out in the audience...\nMaya:\nWow... This is where they all perform, isn't it? Nick! Do some somersaults!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not doing any somersaults.\nMaya:\nWhy not!? You look like you'd be great at it!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I look like I'd be great at somersaults!?)\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...\nMaya:\nHuh? Nick?\nPhoenix:\nIt wasn't me.\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrrrr... Grawwwwwww!!\nMaya:\nT-T-T-T-T-T-T... TIGER!!\nPhoenix:\nH-H-H-He's c-c-coming this way!!\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrr... Grawwwwwww!!\nPhoenix:\nAHHHHHHHHHHH!!\nMaya:\nNick! You're too young to die! NICK!!\n???:\nSTAY! STAY! HEEL!\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrr...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm still here... I'm not dead, yet!!)\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Nick! Are you OK?\n???:\nAhahaha! Scared ya didn't I? Regent is such a cute tiger! Isn't he!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\n...\n???:\nWhat's the matter? You two sure are quiet.\nMaya:\nDon't \"What's the matter?\" me! N-Nick... He almost died there!!\n???:\nHah! He wasn't anywhere close to getting hurt, let alone dying! This little tiger hardly ever bites people. And besides, people normally never get to play with a wild tiger, right? So if you think about it, you're actually really lucky!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\n???:\nYou agree, don't you?\nPhoenix:\n... I guess...\nMaya:\nW-W-W-What do you mean you guess!? Why are you agreeing with her?\n???:\nWoohoo!! Your costume...\nMaya:\nEh?\n???:\nIt's cute. I wanna try it on!!\nMaya:\nC-Costume? You mean my clothes...?\n???:\nYou don't mind letting me try it on, right?\nMaya:\nUhh... I guess not...\n???:\nREALLY!? Hehehehehe!! You're the best!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... The tables turned quickly on that one. So much for the tiger thing...)\n???:\nOh! I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Regina Berry... The renowned animal tamer of the Berry Big Circus!\nMaya:\nMy name's Maya Fey. I'm a spirit medium.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix Wright. Attorney at law. (When you put us up next to an animal tamer, I bet we really look odd!)\nRegina:\nNice to meet ya!\nPhoenix:\nUhh... Likewise...\nExamine\nAudience wing\nMaya:\nThe seats are kinda far away don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nThey are, but it also means that lots of people can fit in the big top.\nRegina:\nHe's right. We can fit 500 people into a show.\nMaya:\nFive hundred... That's amazing.\nRegina:\nFlying around above that many people is a \"real rush\". At least that's what Max said.\n(Step)ladder\nMaya:\nAh, a ladder.\nPhoenix:\nIt's just a stepladder.\nMaya:\nWhat's the difference? They do the same thing, right? I think you should stick with the basic facts of the matter.\nPhoenix:\nOh... Uh... OK. (It's not even worth arguing with her on this one.)\nLion prop\nMaya:\nLook! That's where Max comes out during the show!!\nPhoenix:\nI've got to admit, that was a pretty cool effect!\nRegina:\nWe're planning for me to start coming out of the lion during the show.\nPhoenix:\nThat's great Regina!\nRegina:\nYeah. I will ride on Regent's back and jump out of the lion's mouth.\nMaya:\nI wanna try it too! I'll ride on Nick's back and jump out of the lion's mouth!\nPhoenix:\n(Sometimes I wonder about this girl...)\nBoxes\nPhoenix:\nThere doesn't seem to be anything here that can help us... Not a single clue.\nMaya:\nYou know I've been meaning to ask you... What exactly do you mean when you say \"clue\"? What are you looking for?\nPhoenix:\n... A bloody chainsaw for instance...\nMaya:\nWell there's definitely not one of those here...\nRope\nMaya:\nHey! It's a rope!\nPhoenix:\nProbably for tightrope walking...\nMaya:\nThat's a bit strange... There weren't any tightrope walkers in the show when we saw it.\nSpotlights\nMaya:\nWhoa! Those lights are huge!\nRegina:\nI love lights!! Whenever I appear under the spotlight, everyone claps for me!\nMaya:\nThat's because everyone knows that you're cute!\nRegina:\nNo... I'm not cute. You're cute!\nMaya:\nMe!?\nRegina:\nOf course! I'm sure you'd make an incredible heroine!\nMaya:\nReally!? You think so!? Nick! Did you hear that!? Me!! A heroine!! What about Nick, Regina?\nRegina:\n... Hmm... Nick...\nMaya:\nHe's no hero, is he?\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch... Thanks a lot Maya!)\nTalk\nWhat happened\nMaya:\nHey Regina... What do you know about what happened last night?\nRegina:\nYou mean the murder...?\nPhoenix:\nUh huh.\nRegina:\nMy dad was murdered.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I see... (Wait! What did she just say!?) (Changed from [I can't imagine how hard this must be for you... (Urk! That was insensitive!)] in the original release)\nMaya:\nSo... the Ringmaster was your... (Changed from [That's right! The Ringmaster was your...] in the original release)\nRegina:\nYep. The Ringmaster was my dad.\nMaya:\nI'm so sorry about what happened to him...\nRegina:\nWhy do you say you're sorry?\nMaya:\nHuh? (Changed from [Eh?] in the original release)\nRegina:\nAnyways... Everyone was here practicing last night.\nPhoenix:\nEven your dad?\nRegina:\nYes. Everyone was here. We finished up around 10 PM. After that, everyone went off on their own. I was the only one who stayed around here.\nMaya:\nWhy did you do that?\nRegina:\nI was playing with Regent.\nPhoenix:\n(Regent... So she was with that beast...)\nRegina:\nThat's when the police showed up. When they took me to check things out, Dad was dead.\nPhoenix:\n(For someone whose father was just murdered, she seems awfully perky... (Changed from For someone who's [sic] father was just murdered, she seems awfully perky...] in the original release) I wish she would tell us more about her dad...)\nRegina\nMaya:\nThat's incredible that you are an animal tamer!\nRegina:\nIf you say so...\nMaya:\nIt has to be really scary!\nRegina:\nScary? Why?\nMaya:\nHuh?\nRegina:\nRegent isn't scary! He's cute! Ever since Léon died, Regent has been my best friend.\nPhoenix:\nLéon?\nRegina:\nYes. Léon the lion.\nPhoenix:\n(Léon the lion... Regent and Regina... Interesting name choices...)\nMaya:\nLéon... He died?\nRegina:\nYes. Actually he was killed. My dad killed him.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nMaya:\nWhy did he do that?\nRegina:\nI'm not sure why he did it.\nPhoenix:\n(It's tough not to get charmed when she looks at you with those innocent eyes...)\n\"What's on your mind?\" (appears after presenting Max profile)\nMaya:\nRegina... What's the matter? What's on your mind?\nRegina:\n*giggle* I'll tell you Maya... But just you.\nPhoenix:\nAh!\nRegina:\nUmm... Well... *mumble* *mumble*\nMaya:\nWhat!? REALLY!?!?\nRegina:\nAnd then... *mumble* *mumble*\nMaya:\nOh my! That's incredible Regina!!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nC'mon Nick. There's no reason to pout!\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry about me...\nMaya:\nRegina told me that someone professed their love to her!\nPhoenix:\nP-P-P-Professed their love!?\nMaya:\nNot only that! It was Maximillion Galactica!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder how many people have stolen one of his hearts anyways...?)\nMaya:\nAnd then, on the exact same day, another person professed their love for her as well!!\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Who was it!?\nMaya:\nSomeone named Trilo.\nPhoenix:\nTrilo...?\nMaya:\nApparently he is a tenor who sings in the circus.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Haven't met him yet.)\nMaya:\nRegina seems to be quite the hit with the men in the circus!\nPhoenix:\nShe must have some sort of strange power over them!\nMaya:\nYou're not kidding. Two people in one day! Even I want to profess my love for her!\nPhoenix:\n(Me too! She's so cute...)\nRegina:\n*giggle*\nPresent\nSilk Hat\nRegina:\nThis silk hat is Max's.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right.\nRegina:\nIt's beautiful isn't it? I thought up the idea for wearing the hat.\nMaya:\nHuh? Really?\nRegina:\nYep. He took my sketch to the hat shop... And they made a custom hat for him based off the sketch. There is only one of these silk hats in the entire world! Isn't that cool?\nMaya Fey profile\nRegina:\nMaya... You're a spirit channeler?\nMaya:\nYep! I'm still training though.\nRegina:\nThat sounds like fun! I think you should join us at the circus!\nMaya:\nHuh? As a spirit channeler?\nRegina:\nYeah! You'd be a big hit!\nMaya:\nReally!? She says I'd be a big hit!\nPhoenix:\n(I think she's just being nice.)\nMax profile\nRegina:\nIt's Max!! Hey... Where is Max now anyways?\nPhoenix:\nY-You don't know?\nRegina:\nNope.\nPhoenix:\nHe's been arrested. He was charged with the murder of your father.\nMaya:\nIt's OK! Nick and I will help him!\nRegina:\nMax isn't the guy, is he? I mean... The criminal?\nPhoenix:\nOf course he's not!\nRegina:\nI'm worried about so many things right now...\nMaya:\nHmm... Like what?\nRegina:\n*giggle*\nFranziska von Karma profile\nRegina:\nCool! This lady's got a whip! She's an animal tamer, huh?\nMaya:\nHmm... Sort of...\nPhoenix:\n(Two women with whips... That's my cue to shut up and act like a good boy...)\nRegina Berry profile\nRegina:\nAlright! I look so cute in this picture! Don't you think I look cute? Don't ya? Don't ya?\nMaya:\nYou sure do!\nPhoenix:\nNo objections here!\nRussell Berry profile\nRegina:\nAfter practice was over, Dad went right back to his room.\nMaya:\nHis room?\nRegina:\nYes. That door right over there leads to the Ringmaster's room.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nRegina:\nI dunno why, but he went off to his room in a hurry. I wonder what happened?\nPhoenix:\n(The Ringmaster's room... It's probably a good idea to check it out for myself.)\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this? What can you tell me?\nRegina:\nUmm... I'm not really good at figuring out hard things.\nMaya:\nReally? You too? I understand exactly what you mean...\nPhoenix:\n(I never expected Maya to make a new friend in a strange place like this...)\nAny other profiles\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this person?\nRegina:\nSorry...\nPhoenix:\nSorry?\nRegina:\nI've already given my heart to another man. So I'm not interested in enrolling in your dating service.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I just wanted to know if you knew this person.\nDetention Center\nPresent\nSilk Hat\nMax:\nAhh! This is my silk hat! It's the only one of its kind in the world. It's one of my most prized possessions. This silk hat proves that I was somewhere else... Where did they find this? Huh, sweetie?\nPhoenix:\nThey found it at the murder scene.\nMax:\nAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! I... I... I don't know nothing about nothing!\nMaya:\nEww... Max is so pathetic like this...\nPhoenix:\n(Max must be really confused...)\nCrime Photo\nMax:\nThat's... That's the Ringmaster. ... It's a shame what happened... He was going to be like a father to me...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nRegina Berry profile\nMax:\nAhhh... My sweetie pie. She must be really lonely with me all cooped up in here.\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, she was laughing and rolling around with her tiger...)\nMax:\nShe is my special someone. And I am her special someone.\nMaya:\nUh-huh... Very complex...\nAny other profiles\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this person?\nMax:\nUnfortunately I don't take on apprentices. I mean, just look at the face on this one... It's not what I'd call fabulous.\nPhoenix:\n(That's awfully harsh...)\nAfter clearing \"Something unusual\" and \"The eyewitness\" Talk options in Lodging House - Plaza, and visiting Big Top:\nDecember 28Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\n... Max isn't here.\nPhoenix:\nHe must be in questioning.\nMaya:\nAww... I wanted to see a magic trick.\nPhoenix:\nHe should be back in a little bit.\nMaya:\nI guess so.\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera.\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. I wonder if he is bored? He doesn't even try to glance over this way...\nLodging House - Plaza\nPresent\nAny other profile\nGumshoe:\nI've gotten affidavits from most of the performers at this circus. They are certainly a strange bunch of characters.\nMaya:\nYou don't say?\nGumshoe:\nWell, not stranger than you I suppose.\nMaya:\n... That was cold...\nGumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry. I was just messing around.\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nSilk Hat\nMaya:\nThis silk hat really does look like it can fly!!\nPhoenix:\nIt does have a feather on it. Maybe that's why you think it can take off.\nMaya:\nYou're right! Nick, I bet you could wear a hat like this! This is like one of those hats a famous detective would wear!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I guess so...\nMaya:\nBut... With a head as big as yours, you'd probably bust a hole in the* ([sic]) it!\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPhoenix:\nNo matter what the crime, we always meet the same detective at the scene.\nMaya:\nSometimes it seems like he's the only detective on the force. That would make Gumshoe really elite, wouldn't it?\nPhoenix:\n(Something tells me that no matter how you look at it, he's anything but elite...)\nFranziska von Karma profile\nMaya:\nYou know, if she wasn't so mean, I think she and I would get along...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but that's the problem... She is so mean. And that whip... That thing hurts. It really hurts.\nMaya:\nIt is kinda cool though. I wouldn't mind having a whip myself. I bet that cracking the whip on you once or twice would be just what the doctor ordered!\nPhoenix:\nW-Why me!? W-What did I do!?\nRegina Berry profile\nMaya:\nRegina is sooo cute!\nPhoenix:\nI have to admit that her smile does have a sort of hypnotic power.\nMaya:\nCan you believe that she's an animal tamer? That's sooo cool! I'd like to try animal taming someday. Nick! Nick! Lie down! Roll over!!\nPhoenix:\nOnce this case is solved, I'll roll over for you as many times as you want!\nMaya:\nYAY!!! Remember, you promised, Nick!\nRussell Berry profile\nMaya:\nEveryone loved the Ringmaster...\nPhoenix:\nSo I'm told. Why would anyone want to kill such a beloved man of the big top?\nMaya:\nMotive will surely be a point of contention tomorrow in court.\nPhoenix:\n(You can count on that...)\nAfter presenting Russell Berry profile in Berry Big Circus - Big Top:\nDecember 28Big TopRingmaster's Room\nMaya:\nThis was the Ringmaster's room?\nPhoenix:\nYes. This room belonged to the victim. Which means this must be where Max met the Ringmaster last night.\nMaya:\nNow that you mention it, that is what he said.\nPhoenix:\nI wonder what... Hmm... That's an interesting poster. (Changed from [I wonder what... Hmm... That's an intresting [sic] poster.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nAh! It's a poster of Max! I want it! I want it! Nick! I want it!\nPhoenix:\nI wanna get outta here...\nExamine\nPhotos\nMaya:\nNick... Look at all the photos lined up on the wall...\nPhoenix:\nIt's like a guided tour of the circus' history.\nMaya:\nThis is so cool! It seems like there were so many happy memories. Maybe we should do this sort of thing at our office? We can put up pictures of all the clients who have been found not guilty.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what if we had a client who was found guilty? (Changed from [What about the clients who were found guilty?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nUmm... We'll just pretend like they don't exist. How's that? ... Nick! Now you've got me thinking about losing cases! Why'd you do that!?\nFrames\nMaya:\nAll of these frames look the same.\nPhoenix:\nThey almost look like... Thank You cards. It looks like every year the Ringmaster made donations to charity... To the Robot Clown Research Center...\nMaya:\n... You're kidding right?\nPhoenix:\nWhat!? They may be a perfectly reputable charity in the field of advanced tomfoolery!\nTrophy case\nMaya:\nNick! Look at all the cute trophies!!\nPhoenix:\nIndeed. Just look at all the awards this circus has won...\nMaya:\nLike... \"All County Quiz Champions\"... \"Ringmaster's Association Mini Golf Master\"... \"Beer Belly Balloon Bounce Champ\"... \"Pet Grooming Grand Prix\"... Wow. The Ringmaster was multi-talented in ways I could have never imagined...\nPosters\nMaya:\nThere's a lot of posters here don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nThere are indeed.\nMaya:\nSo many posters that they aren't likely to miss one, are they?\nPhoenix:\nMaya... We're supposed to be the honest ones around here.\nMaya:\nBut... But... You didn't even notice that I took one!\nPhoenix:\n(Arghhh... She already swiped one!)\nMaya:\nHeh! Heh!\nPhoenix:\nYou're incorrigible, you know that?\nMax G. Promo Poster added to the Court Record.\nPosters (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nLook at all the stars on this poster... This must have been the poster they used to promote their public appearances.\nMaya:\nPosters are the way to go aren't they?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nMaya:\nWe should make posters to promote our law firm. \"Spine tingling legal action! Mind numbing legalese! You will say 'wow'!\" Or perhaps, \"Hold it! Don't miss out on a stunning life or death courtroom thrill ride!\"\nPhoenix:\nWith those taglines, our law firm would sink faster than the Titanic...\nTailcoat\nMaya:\nYou may not know this, but they call this a \"tailcoat\".\nPhoenix:\nAnd they call this \"the face of someone who already knew that...\" Hmm...\nMaya:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nA scrap of white paper is sticking out of the coat pocket.\nMaya:\nHuh? Where? Where?\nPhoenix:\nCalm down, Maya. You can't just go rummaging through people's coats!\nMaya:\nAhhh... You always make me feel like I'm doing something wrong...\nMirror\nMaya:\nThis is where the Ringmaster applied his makeup.\nPhoenix:\nIt's quite a collection of the most understated colors. Shocking Pink for example.\nMaya:\nThis one says it is \"100% All Natural Organic Mascara.\"\nPhoenix:\nAnd this one says \"Sensitive enough for a baby, strong enough for a mime.\"\nMaya:\nThe Ringmaster must have been really concerned about skin care... Very metrosexual.\nDesk\nMaya:\nThis is strange... Everything else looks nice, but this desk looks old and cheap.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a really big photo on the desk... It's a picture of Regina and her father, the Ringmaster.\nMaya:\nHe really loved her didn't he? Regina was lucky to have such a wonderful father.\nTable\nPhoenix:\nIt's a table for guests... There are some papers scattered on top.\nMaya:\nAh! Look at this! Max's salary is written on this piece of paper. YIKES!\nPhoenix:\nW-What is it?\nMaya:\nI didn't know that a magician... This salary is incredible!\nPhoenix:\n(She looks like she's about ready to pass out from shock...) How much is it!? How much is it!? T-T-THAT MUCH!?\nMaya:\nIncredible, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYou can say that again. (This must be the paper they used to negotiate Max's salary... The Ringmaster signed and dated it...)\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nMax definitely got a raise... But this document is dated a week ago!\nRingmaster's Papers added to the Court Record.\nTable (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis was the table he used when visitors came to see him.\nMaya:\nEww... There's mud caked on the table.\nPhoenix:\nSomeone with terrible manners must have put their shoes up on the table!\nMaya:\nNick! Don't even think about it!\nPhoenix:\nI wasn't! How uncouth do you think I am anyway?\nAfter clearing \"The eyewitness\" Talk option in Lodging House - Plaza and clearing \"\"What's on your mind?\"\" Talk option in Berry Big Circus - Big Top:\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusCircus Entrance\nMaya:\nHuh? Hey Nick! Look over there!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nThere's someone over there! Ex-Excuse me!\n???:\n...\nPhoenix:\nHello.\n???:\n...\nMaya:\nWow! He sure is a quiet one! Excuse me!!\n???:\nWha... Ha... Huh? M-Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. You work at the circus don't you?\n???:\nN-No. I'm just your everyday average Joe.\nMaya:\nAn average Joe who just happens to hang out at the circus? I don't think so.\n???:\nY-Yes I am. I've got nothing to do with what's going on here.\nPhoenix:\n(He's lying. Like any regular person would hang around the circus... Dressed like that!) I'm an attorney. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\nI'm a spirit medium. My name is Maya.\n???:\nWell... I... Um... Just happened to be... Umm... Passing by...\nPhoenix:\nI don't suppose you happen to be some kind of carny?\n???:\nNot a c-c-carny... I-I'm a p-performer. Actually, I'm a v-v-v-ventriloquist.\nMaya:\nVentriloquist?\n???:\nHe-he-he-he-he-he-he... I-I-I'm Benjamin Wo-Wo-Wo-Woodman...\nMaya:\nYour last name is Woodman? *snicker* (Changed from [You're [sic] last name is Woodman? *snicker*] in the original release)\n???:\nY-Yes... T-T-That's right... But e-everyone c-c-calls me B-B-B-B-B-Ben.\nMaya:\nAh... Yes yes yes... That's your alias, right?\nPhoenix:\nI believe they call it a stage name.\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, Ben?\nBen:\nUh... Yes? You mean... Me?\nPhoenix:\nAbout the murder. I'd like to talk to you about the details, if I may.\nBen:\nR-Really... I'm just a regular normal guy... I don't k-k-now... A-a-a-a...\nPhoenix:\n(This guy's so nervous, he's creeping me out.)\nMaya:\nNick. Cheer up! Just try and smile!\nMax Galactica\nMaya:\nWould you mind telling us something about Max? Maximillion Galactica.\nBen:\nMa-Ma-Ma-Max? H-H-H-He's... N-N-N-Not... V-Very... N-N-Nice.\nPhoenix:\n(Did he just say that Max is \"Not Very Nice\"?)\nBen:\nO... O... O... Oww... My... H-H-Head...

This one or the Steel Samurai poster?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not a big fan of either one of them.\nMaya:\nI guess putting a poster of a magician in a law office is kinda strange.\nPhoenix:\n(No stranger than a poster of a hunk of junk carrying around a spear!)\nRingmaster's Papers\nMaya:\nLooking at this really makes you think.\nPhoenix:\nLike what?\nMaya:\nNo matter how great a medium I become, there is no way I could make this kind of money.\nPhoenix:\nSo it's money you're after?\nMaya:\nYou only live once, right? Well, then you might as well live it fabulously!\nBen profile\nMaya:\nBeing a ventriloquist sounds like an interesting job.\nPhoenix:\nI bet it's fun once you get good at it.\nMaya:\nMaybe I should give it a try then! Here I go! \"Hello e-e-everyone...

CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'RE THE BIG WEINER! The one millionth visitor to the room of one Mr. Moe Curls, AKA ME!!\nPhoenix:\n(Earplugs... Must... Find... Earplugs...)\nMoe:\nTo celebrate this momentous occasion, would you care for an organic grape? Just one! Did you get my joke right there!? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMoe:\nI welched on giving you more than one!!\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nMoe:\nNo no no! If it was funny, it is your duty as a human being to laugh!! People who don't laugh are usually last-seen in Lan-sing. Catch my drift? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Maya?\nMaya:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n(This is like some Faustian nightmare...)\nMaya:\nC'mon! It was funny! Clowns are always funny in my book!\nPhoenix:\nIn my book, they're just funny lookin'.\nMoe:\nYou sure do have a great taste in clothes girlie! Look at that garb! You look just like Gretta Garb... OH! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* I'm goin' home...\nMaya:\nNo! Nick! You can't!!\nPhoenix:\nYou know, I can excuse a bad joke or two... But this stooge keeps laughing at his own jokes! That's what I object to!\nMaya:\nOK OK... I get it. But you have to admit he is kinda funny...\nPhoenix:\n(Argghhh... No, I do not have to admit that, because he isn't!)\nMoe:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nExamine\nCostumes\nMoe:\nI look awfully snazzy in these costumes.\nMaya:\nUmm... Did you just use the word \"snazzy\" in a sentence?\nMoe:\nI sure did. These are haute couture from the best international clown designers. At least, that's what they said on the TV shopping channel I use... I like having a big collection so I can match my costume to my mood... And my carrot.\nMaya:\nHehe...\nMoe:\nYou know, I only own one T-shirt. The rest are all clown costumes!\nPhoenix:\n(Snazzy dresser!? More like spazzy dresser if you ask me!)\nBoarded up cracks in ceiling\nMaya:\nThere's a hole in the ceiling... Why is there a hole in the ceiling?\nMoe:\nWell... Umm... I was riding a pogo stick, and I guess I just overdid it a little...\nMaya:\n\"Overdid it a little\"...?\nMoe:\nWhat can I say, sometimes things get a bit crazy in one's college days...\nMaya:\nHuh?\nCarrots\nMoe:\nCarrots are one of my trademark props.\nMaya:\nYep! I saw you use them! You must believe in a carrot and no stick approach. You put the carrot out in front for motivation, but I guess the trick is gauging what flavor you want each day...\nMoe:\nExactly! You were really paying attention, weren't you!? You know, I eat about 5 of those carrots every single day. If you eat that many, you've gotta change up the taste every now and again.\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't understand any of that, nor do I ever want to.)\nPajamas\nPhoenix:\nMoe, you've got quite the collection of pajamas... They really scream out to you.\nMoe:\nYou think they're loud, huh? I kinda thought they were refined... You know, a bit too adult for me to use on stage... That's why I used them as pajamas.\nPhoenix:\n(Wait a second... He sleeps in clown costumes!?)\nDesk\nMoe:\nTake a look at my desk. Aren't I the most studious clown you've ever seen? Every free moment I have, I spend it studying or reading.\nPhoenix:\nThe classic \"Pull My Finger\" or \"Clown Car Maintenance and Repair\".. Not to mention the bestseller \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Pierrots\"...\nMaya:\nUmm... They all seem to cover rather basic topics though...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he is just trying to cover all of his bases?\nMoe:\nExactly! I want to be a renaissance clown!\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad he didn't buy \"How To Be A Funny Clown\"...)\nClown equipment\nMoe:\nUs clowns really take our work seriously. I try to hone my craft day and night, with the latest in jester technology. Unicycles. Trampolines. Balancing Balls. Accordions.\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like you've put quite a bit of wear and tear on that equipment...\nMoe:\nWell... The theme of my act as a clown is... \"How many ways can a fat funny guy fall down?\" I don't care what I break or how I break it, as long as it ends with me on my bum!! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nShoes or banana peel\nMaya:\nWhat's this? A banana peel? *slips*\nMoe:\nOh my! Oh my! What a wonderful fall girlie! You should remember that when you see a banana peel, get ready to fall down! That is one of the basic tenants of clownsmanship.\nMaya:\nOw ow ow ow ow...\nMoe:\nEvery night, I fall down 100 times to practice the proper banana peel breakfall. WHOA! *slip* WHOA! *slip* WHOA! *slip*\nMaya:\nWow. He really is a pro, huh Nick!? His falls are totally different than my slip!\nTalk\nBerry Big Circus\nMaya:\nCould you please tell us more about the Berry Big Circus?\nMoe:\nIt's a Berry Big story... You sure you got that kind of time?\nPhoenix:\n(And the hits just keep on comin'... *sigh*)\nMoe:\nThis circus has been in business for 20 years. We all performed under the guidance of the Ringmaster, Russell Berry.\nMaya:\nTwenty years!? Wow!\nMoe:\nWorking in the circus is never easy, especially nowadays... With movies, TV, and bowling, there is just too much competition.\nMaya:\nBut... But... I LOVE THE CIRCUS!\nMoe:\nI love it too... That is why I've been here for 20 years. We work hard to keep the show running. No one sends in the clowns on us!\nMaya:\nNick! He just made a joke! Laugh!!\nPhoenix:\nHar! Har! Har! Har! Har! Har!\nMoe:\nThe Ringmaster was a real big shot in the circus world. A real class act. Even when there were no customers, Russell would use his own money to pay me. Because he knew that I had a family to care for... He was happy to take care of his employees.\nMaya:\nI see...\nMoe:\nHow could anyone do that to such a wonderful man...!?\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMoe...\nMoe:\nWiggidty-wiggidty-wiggidty WHAT?\nPhoenix:\nUgh...\nMaya:\nI'm sorry Moe. Nick was born without a sense of humor.\nMoe:\nDon't worry about it... How can you fault someone for being born that way?\nPhoenix:\nLet's talk about the murder.\nMoe:\nAhh... Let's see... It must've taken place around 10 PM last night. After rehearsals were finished, I was tuckered out, so I came back here. After I went to bed... That's when I caught a peek of it...\nMaya:\n\"Caught a peek...?\"\nMoe:\nOf the crime.\nPhoenix:\n(Just as we suspected... (Changed from [So this is what Detective Gumshoe was talking about...] in the original release) This guy's the eyewitness to the crime! (Changed from [Moe was the eyewitness to the crime!] in the original release))\nRussell Berry (appears after \"Berry Big Circus\")\nMoe:\nThe Ringmaster was truly ahead of his time. He would always add new elements to the show.\nMaya:\nNew elements...?\nMoe:\nWhen you've been a performer for a long time, your act starts getting a bit stale.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nMoe:\nI realize that even my act can get a bit long in the tooth... Sometimes my jokes can be a bit... Umm... Old-fashion.\nPhoenix:\n\"A bit long in the tooth?\"\nMoe:\nBut that make-believer takes things too far!!\nMaya:\nMake-believer?\nMoe:\nThe magician!! The one that thinks he's all high and mighty!! He had the gall to say to me, \"You're one of those funny types, right?\" What does he mean \"one of those\"!? Well the joke's on him now...\nPhoenix:\nOn him...?\nMoe:\nYep! He got on everyone's nerves!! The day of the murder... ...\nPhoenix:\nGo ahead.\nMoe:\nNope. No way! Just forget I said anything!\nPhoenix:\n(I bet he's still hiding something about Max...)\nWhat you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nYou say you saw the crime. Do you mind telling me what you saw?\nMoe:\nWell, the police told me that I can't share my story with others. \"Don't say a word, pal!!\" I'm just gonna have to let these lips stay zipped! (Changed from ['Don't say a word!!' I'm just gonna have to let these lips stay zipped!] in the original release)\nMaya:\nThat's not fair!\nMoe:\nI guess you're right... Maybe I can tell you a few details. But only if you can get old stiff lips here to make with the funny...!\nPhoenix:\nStiff lips? Wait... Do you mean me?\nMaya:\nNick! You can do it!!\nPhoenix:\n*achem* *achem*\nMoe:\nWhat's the matter?\nPhoenix:\nJust getting ready. OK... Do you know why I, Phoenix Wright, am a great lawyer? Because I'm Wright all the time!!\nMaya:\n...\nMoe:\n...\nMaya:\nAt least his expectations are low.\nMoe:\nI wouldn't let him quit his day job.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeesh, cut a guy some slack. At least it was funnier than Chuckles over here.)\nMoe:\nIt wasn't the greatest joke I've heard, but you did try, so I'll tell you what I saw.\nMaya:\nI'm sorry he's incapable of being funny, Moe.\nMoe:\nThat night... Once I had tucked myself into bed, I heard this amazing noise. It was incredibly loud. It sounded like a giant \"THUMP\"! Once I heard it, I jumped out of bed. That's when I saw... Without question. Without a doubt. It was that magician!! That's all I saw... But it just proves how terrible that man actually is!\nPhoenix:\n(He knows more about Max than he is letting on...)\nPresent\nCrime Photo\nMoe:\nRUSSELL!! How could anyone do this to you... I... I... *sobs*\nMaya:\nMoe's taking this really hard...\nSilk Hat\nMoe:\nIt's that uppity faker's uppity top hat! They found this at the scene of the crime, didn't they?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what I've been told...\nMoe:\nUnbelievable. That jerk killed the Ringmaster!\nMaya:\nIt really is a shame what happened to the Ringmaster, huh Moe?\nPhoenix:\nIt seems that the Ringmaster was truly a great man...\nMax profile\nMoe:\nHmph! If he thinks he can kill the Ringmaster, it's only just that he should die, too!\nMaya:\nMoe!!\nMoe:\nSorry. I crossed the line. But he truly is a disgusting human being.\nMaya:\nWhy do you hate him so much?\nMoe:\nLet me tell you this one story... The morning before the murder, something terrible happened. Max clonked Ben right over the head, as hard as he could.\nPhoenix:\nBen? (The ventriloquist with the speech impediment?)\nMoe:\nYou should go to the cafeteria and investigate for yourselves.\nMaya:\nThe cafeteria?\nMoe:\nLet's just say there's Gotti be something interesting there... Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Ahh yes... The Berry Big Circus is very big, isn't it? You should always carry a map with you to get around...\nMaya:\nAh! Thank you!! Umm... This is an atlas!!\nMoe:\nAha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Oh... I kill myself. Really. I'm dying here... CORONARY! CORONARY!\nPhoenix:\n(Now he's just laughing to hear his own voice...)\nCircus Map added to the Court Record.\nMax profile (subsequent times)\nMoe:\nHmph!

Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nRegina Berry profile\nMoe:\nThat's the Ringmaster's daughter, Regina. Ever since she was a little girl, she's been watching the circus performances. Cuter than a little puppy Maltese, that Regina. If only my Larina was that cute...\nMaya:\nLarina?\nMoe:\nAh... Larina is my daughter. She lives with her mother now.\nPhoenix:\n(It's true what they say about the tears of a clown...)\nRussell Berry profile\nMoe:\nI've been friends with Russell since even before the circus began. He was so selfless. He always thought about others before thinking of himself. I'll find a way to return the favor... He always took such good care of me. I wish I would have thanked him more than I did...\nBen profile\nMoe:\nAh, Ben... How's he doing?\nPhoenix:\nHe's a ventriloquist isn't he?\nMoe:\nThat's right! Boy was I surprised when they told me his secret! He's got a second mouth where his belly button should be!! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Just kidding...\nPhoenix:\nBen wouldn't tell me a single thing about the murder.\nMoe:\nAhh... That's a simple problem to solve. He won't talk if he doesn't have his puppet Trilo!\nMaya:\nTrilo...?\nMoe:\nIf Ben doesn't have his ventriloquist's puppet, you'll barely get a word outta him.\nMaya:\nReally?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Master and puppet...)\nMoe profile\nMoe:\nAh!\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter?\nMoe:\nWhenever I see my own pose, I am reminded of my Italian heritage...\nMaya:\nAhhhh... I see... It must be because you have one of those \"Roman Noses\"... Roamin' all over your face.\nMoe:\n...!!\nMaya:\n... I didn't cross the line there did I?\nPhoenix:\nYou went so far past it, you'll need a map to get back!\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this? Anything come to mind?\nMoe:\nAhh... You want some advice on your development as a comedian, right? I see... Well... This is what you do... When you tell a joke, imagine everyone's wearing underwear and dancing the lambada...\nPhoenix:\nUmm... I think that's enough advice for now...\nMaya:\nNick! He was giving you good advice! Don't be so close-minded!!\nAny other profiles\nMoe:\nThis isn't very funny... How am I supposed to know about people who aren't in the circus!?\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nMoe profile\nMaya:\nMoe is a really nice guy, don't you think Nick? He taught us all about the inner workings of the circus.\nPhoenix:\nYep. It definitely made me look at things in a new light.\nMaya:\nAnd he's got such a great sense of humor. It tickles your funny bone, doesn't it?\nPhoenix:\n(Well... I can't argue that some people might find it funny... But the only thing it tickles on me is my desire for high quality earplugs...)\nBig Top\nPresent\nMoe profile\nRegina:\nThat's Moe! He's such a funny clown! He's been a good friend to my dad for a really long time now.\nMaya:\nHe was good friends with the Ringmaster?\nRegina:\nMy dad always said... \"When it comes to who I can entrust the circus to, it's definitely Moe.\"\nMaya:\nHmm... Yep! That clown is one lovable stooge. Don't you think so, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... No comment...\nAfter presenting Max profile in Lodging Hall 1st Floor - Moe's Room:\nDecember 28Big TopCafeteria\nMaya:\nEww... This place is gross.\nPhoenix:\nThis must be because of last night. They didn't have time to clean up after dinner because of the murder.\nMaya:\nThat reminds me... What was it that Moe said?\nPhoenix:\nHe said that yesterday morning Max \"clonked\" Ben over the head here.\nMaya:\nHe also said that, \"There's Gotti be something interesting there.\" Nick? What's \"Gotti be interesting?\"\nPhoenix:\nDon't ask...\nMaya:\nHmph!\nExamine\nKitchen\nPhoenix:\nThe kitchen is over here. Everyone must have taken turns cooking. There's a duty list posted here.\nMaya:\nI wouldn't mind trying my hand at cooking for this many people. Maya's Killer Hamburger... You'd try it, wouldn't you?\nNotice\nMaya:\n\"Keep Our Cafeteria Clean!\"\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't seem like anyone ever read this sign, huh?\nMaya:\nMaybe they should make it easier to understand... \"Clean it or die!\"\nPhoenix:\nWell, that would definitely make them clean up!\nBulletin board\nPhoenix:\nAh, a bulletin board... For... Umm... Bulletins. It doesn't look like there are any useful clues posted here.\nMaya:\nBoring... Maybe we should leave a juicy tidbit for someone to read!\nPhoenix:\nJuicy?\nMaya:\nYou know... Like a fake clue! Hmm... Maybe something like... \"Message from the Killer!\"\nPhoenix:\nGive it up Maya... You know Gumshoe would take it all seriously.\nStand\nPhoenix:\nThis is strange... There's nothing on top of this stand.\nMaya:\nLook here... Max is written on it. It must be his VIP table.\nPhoenix:\nIsn't a bit small to be a VIP table? You won't be putting a ten course meal on this.\nMaya:\nWell, he could still eat hamburgers, right?\nBack table\nPhoenix:\nThere are dirty dishes all over the place... It must have been too hectic last night to clean up.\nMaya:\nYou know I can't stand a mess Nick! I think you and I should clean this place up for them!\nPhoenix:\nW-Why do we have to clean up...!?\nMaya:\nOne, because I hate dirty cafeterias. Two, because one bears repeating.\nPhoenix:\nB-But... This is a crime scene! We can't clean it up! We have to preserve it for evidence!!\nMaya:\nArrrggghh... You know I really hate dirty cafeterias!!\nPhoenix:\n(Not as much as I hate cleaning dirty cafeterias!)\nDining tables\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like they've left it exactly as it was on the night of the murder.\nMaya:\nThey didn't seem too worried about cleaning up the dishes, did they? Hmm... Looking at all these dishes is making me hungry! Let's go get a burger at the snack stand outside.\nPhoenix:\nOnce we're finished with the case.\nMaya:\n... Alright! Then let's get this over with Nick!! Here we go!! Whoahh!\nPhoenix:\n(Where's the mute button when you need it?)\nKnocked over chairs\nPhoenix:\nThe chair's been knocked over.\nMaya:\nThat's what it looks like.\nPhoenix:\nIt almost looks as if someone knocked it over in a struggle, or used it for self defense...\nMaya:\nOr maybe Regent just likes to eat his dinner in the cafeteria?\nSmashed bottle\nPhoenix:\n(What's this? ...Must be a juice bottle or something?)\nMaya:\nAhhh... Watch out Nick! There's broken glass all over the floor! (Changed from [Ahhh... Watch out Nick! Broken glass on the floor is dangerous!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nHmm... A broken bottle just lying in the middle of the floor.\nMaya:\nDo you think it means anything?\nPhoenix:\n... \"There's Gotti be something interesting there.\"\nMaya:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nLooks like we're going to have to go back and meet with him.\nMaya:\nHim?\nBroken Bottle added to the Court Record.\nSmashed bottle (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\n(What's this? ...Must be a juice bottle or something?)\nMaya:\nAhhh...

It's my two sweeties! Welcome to the Detention Center!!\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh* Did he just call me his sweetie!? AGAIN!?)\nMax:\nWhat's on today's agenda? What can I help you with?\nPhoenix:\nWell, we've gathered quite a few clues...\nMax:\nWON-DER-FUL-LY FAN-TAB-U-LOSO!! I mean fabulous!\nPhoenix:\nThat's why we came to meet with you again.\nMax:\nWh-Wh-What's w-w-wrong!? Quit making such a scary face!\nPhoenix:\nOK then Max... Let's make this \"absolutely fabulous\"!!\nTalk\nMax Galactica\nMaya:\nWe heard a lot about you at the circus, Max.\nMax:\nAhhh, you just mean from the dinosaurs? How were those Jurassic geriatrics?\nMaya:\nMax, you aren't very popular with the other performers, are you?\nMax:\nYes yes yes. Sweetie, that's what they call jealousy. J-E-A-L-O-U-S-Y. They are absolutely jealous of my absolutely fabulous self! People who really understand can see the obvious differences between us.\nPhoenix:\nPeople who really understand?\nMax:\nFor instance, my sweetie pie.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, so Regina understands him huh?)\nMax:\nI plan on getting married to her. She is truly my sweetie pie princess.\nMaya:\nWow! That's so cool!\nMax:\nIt's already in the works.\nMaya:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(That's strange. Regina never said anything about marrying this joker...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nYou met with the Ringmaster on the night of the murder?\nMax:\nYes. I was with him around 10 PM. Once I was done with practice. I went to his room right after we finished.\nMaya:\nThey found the Ringmaster's body in the plaza in front of the lodging house.\nMax:\nYeah, I head* ([sic]) about that... He needed to step out for a bit, so I waited in his room for him to return.\nMaya:\n...Huh?\nRussell:\n\"Sorry Max. I have something I must attend to right now. Do you mind waiting for me right here?\"\nMax:\n\"It's pretty cold outside. Where's your coat?\"\nRussell:\n\"It's alright. I'll be right back. It should only take about 10 minutes.\"\nPhoenix:\nAnd then?\nMax:\nI waited for him. But he never came back...\nPhoenix:\nDid he go to the plaza where the body was discovered?\nMax:\nPossibly. The snow had tapered off a bit, but it was still very cold outside. But I have no idea what he went off to do...\nMeeting with Russell (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nMax:\nThe truth is... Yesterday morning during breakfast, we had a run in.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you had a fight with Ben the ventriloquist?\nMax:\nYou could put it that way.\nMaya:\nWhy did you fight with him? Ben seems like such a quiet man.\nMax:\nWe fought about my sweetie pie.\nMaya:\nYou mean Regina?\nMax:\nThat ill-bred creep told my sweetie pie princess that he was in love with her! Would you put up with that?\nMaya:\n\"Ill-bred\"!! Are you talking about the same Ben!?\nPhoenix:\n\"Told her he was in love with her\"!! Are you sure this is the Ben we are talking about!?\nMax:\nAll I can say is that he made me mad and I had to tap him on his hard head! That's when the Ringmaster called me and I realized that it was my chance!\nPhoenix:\nYour chance?\nMax:\nThat's when I went to his room and I laid it all out on the table. I asked him to \"Let me marry my sweetie pie!\"\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nMax:\nThe Ringmaster told me that it \"sounds good to me!\" That's why my sweetie pie is MY sweetie pie! And no one else's!\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I see...\nMax:\nSince Ben was causing me so much trouble, I realized I had to shut him up.\nPhoenix:\n(...Shut him up?)\n\"Shut him up\" (appears after \"Meeting with Russell\")\nMaya:\nUm... What do you mean by \"shut him up\"?\nMax:\nYou don't know, do you my sweeties? Trilo can't say a word... Not without Ben. (Changed from [Unless Ben and Trilo are together, Trilo can't say a word.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nTrilo...?\nMax:\nThe puppet. The ventriloquist's puppet. His real name is Trilo Quist.\nPhoenix:\nBut... A puppet doesn't talk.\nMax:\nI know! That's why I hid it! Before the police came and took me away of course... If that puppet started flapping off at the balsa, I'd be screwed.\nMaya:\nYou hid him? You mean the ventriloquist's puppet?\nMax:\nYou are so smart sweetie!\nMaya:\nUmm... Where did you hide him?\nMax:\nWhat? Sweetie... You aren't thinking of trying to add him to my defense are you?\nMaya:\nWell... Ben does seem awfully lonely without his puppet.\nMax:\nFABULOUS! That should have taught him a lesson! OK... I hid Trilo in the Ringmaster's room. You don't mind going there and getting Trilo for me, do you my sweets?\nMaya:\nNo problem! None at all! Thank you Max!!\nMax:\nYou know I can't stand to see my sweeties in a jam!\nPhoenix:\n(Then don't go hiding puppets!)\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nPhoenix:\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- Meeting with Russell --\nPhoenix:\nLast night, you met with the Ringmaster, correct?

The whole truth?\nMax:\nWhat do you mean!?\nPhoenix:\nYou just went to his office to negotiate your new salary?\nMax:\nI hate lies and I hate liars even more! What are you insinuating!? Do you have any proof that I did something other than negotiate my fee last night?\nPresent Ringmaster's Papers\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Th-Tha-That's!!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nMax:\nGeebus...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the matter?\nMax:\nSweetie, you must have some wax build up in your ears. You haven't listened to me at all!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMax:\nYou're still not listening are you? I said that I HATE LIES!\nPhoenix:\n(It seems this evidence isn't enough to make him confess...)\nMax:\nYou want to try again? It doesn't bother me at all!!\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have any proof that I did something other than negotiate my fee last night?\"\nMax:\nTh-Tha-That's!!\nPhoenix:\nIt was on the table in the Ringmaster's room. You weren't lying when you said that you received quite a raise...\nMax:\nIs there a problem with being well compensated?\nPhoenix:\nNot with the compensation... Just with the date. This is dated a week ago.\nMax:\n...\nPhoenix:\nMax! You finished your contract negotiations a week ago!\nMax:\nF-Fa-Fab-Fabulous!!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nMax:\n... Alright. I'll tell you the truth.

It fits in with the chain of events.\nMax:\nYou are so belligerent... If that's the case, how about you show me some proof.\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have any proof that we got into a knockdown drag out brawl?\"\nPhoenix:\nThis proves it.\nMax:\nWhe-where did you get that?\nPhoenix:\nIsn't it obvious that I found it in the cafeteria, Max?

You know I had to cut the number of symbols to three?\nMaya:\nReally? You had quite a few to begin with then, huh?\nMax:\nWell, I thought that you could never have too many symbols... Sunglasses... Beauty mark... Soft pillows for lips... A beard... Buck teeth... I gave all sorts of symbols a shot. But if I forget one when I put on my makeup, everyone would forget who I am!\nMaya:\nThat's awful... Especially for a magician.\nRingmaster's Papers\nPhoenix:\nCan I ask what you do with such an exorbitant salary?\nMax:\nWe've already covered this point. I'm paying off my father's debt.\nMaya:\nHow could he possibly have such a large amount of debt?\nMax:\nFor example, say you rented a video... And perhaps you forgot about it, for say... a short period of about 10 years. You'd would* ([sic]) have the biggest late fee known to man... It's kinda like that.\nMaya:\nWow... Now I can see how you can get that much debt.\nPhoenix:\n(That makes sense now. Wait a minute... That doesn't make any sense!)\nFranziska von Karma profile\nMax:\nU-Uh-huh... This woman, huh? Well...

Especially after she has eluded my charms for such a long time!\nMaya:\nThere isn't much you can do about that, right?\nMax:\nHmph. You haven't even been truly in love, have you?\nMaya:\nUmm...\nMax:\nWhen you are truly in love with someone... You'd be jealous of their mirror because it traps their image inside.\nMaya:\nAwww... Don't you think that's sweet of him, Nick?\nMax:\nI'm gonna get back with my sweetie pie! Then I'm gonna turn that dumb puppet into a toy glider!\nMaya:\n...I guess you two haven't worked out your differences yet.\nAfter clearing \"\"Shut him up\"\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusCircus Entrance\nMaya:\nHuh?

If they fell from the ceiling, you'd be going to the circus in the sky...

I think they need a little work.\nTrilo:\nWho asked you!? I'm the artist here!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nBen:\nUmm... Uhh... Thanks... Now that Trilo's here...\nPhoenix:\n\"Now that Trilo's here...\" Does that mean you can talk normally now?\nTrilo:\nHey! Buttface!\nMaya:\nAHHH!\nTrilo:\nYou must be looking forward to tomorrow, aren't you Mr. Ambulance Chaser!?\nPhoenix:\nUhh...\nTrilo:\nYou know... It's time to get rid of that pesky magician once and for all!!\nMaya:\nTri... Trilo?\nTrilo:\nEnough jibba jabba! Let's get to court already!\nPhoenix:\nAhh... Hey! Wait a second!\nMaya:\nNick... What's going on?\nPhoenix:\nHe's a witness for tomorrow's trial...\nMaya:\nAhhhhh...\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusBig Top\nMaya:\nHmm... What in the world happened with Ben and Trilo?\nPhoenix:\nQuite a pair, those two. What did that puppet see anyways?\n???:\nOooooh!\nPhoenix:\nOh no... Now what!?\n???:\nOooo-Ooooh!\nPhoenix:\nAhhhhh... Yeowwwwwwwww... Ahhhhhhhhhh...\nMaya:\nHey! Welcome back, Nick! (Changed from [What is it, Nick?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nT-T-That monkey... ... AHHHH! My badge!! That monkey stole it!!\nMaya:\nWHHHAAATTT!?\nRegina:\nHehehehehe! Mr. Attorney, that face was so cute. You looked so completely dumbfounded!\nMaya:\nRegina!!\nPhoenix:\nYou!! That monkey!!\nRegina:\nHey... No need to get angry... OK?\nPhoenix:\nB-B-But!! My attorney's badge!!\nRegina:\nDon't worry... I'll help you out.\nPhoenix:\nOK... If you say so... (If I don't get my badge back, how can I flash it?)\nRegina:\nBy the way... The monkey's name is Money. Money the monkey.\nMaya:\nHis name is Monke... Money?\nTalk\nMoney the Monkey\nPhoenix:\nThe monkey... Is called Money?\nRegina:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\nWell, the rich ape just stole my attorney's badge. Mind if I get that back?\nRegina:\nI'll see what I can do... Even I have Money problems.\nPhoenix:\nEh?\nRegina:\nWhenever Money sees something shiny, he takes it back home.\nMaya:\nHaha... That's pretty funny.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess I'll just have to find out where Money disappeared to...\nRegina:\nI think that's your best bet. You should probably ask Uncle Moe... He might know.\nMaya:\nHuh? You don't know?\nRegina:\nWell... Money isn't exactly someone I am on friendly terms with.\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nRegina:\nHe's not really the kind of animal I work with... Even if he does need taming.\nMaya:\nOh, I see!\nPhoenix:\n(Go to Moe's... Hmm... I guess it is time that I revisit that kooky clown...)\nBen and Trilo\nMaya:\nDo you mind telling us a bit about Ben?\nRegina:\nBen...? You mean the guy that is always hanging around with Trilo?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean \"hanging around\"?\nRegina:\nWell, he was there when Trilo told me that he was in love with me...\nPhoenix:\nTrilo told you he was in love with you?\nRegina:\nYes he did. Kinda cute, don't ya think? He's so smart, and he's such a wonderful singer... I love him!\nMaya:\nBut... What about Ben?\nRegina:\nWhat about Ben? He's got nothing to do with me loving Trilo.\nPhoenix:\n(Like sand through the hourglass, so are the Days of the Circus...)\nProposal\nMaya:\nRegina, you were proposed to, weren't you?\nRegina:\nProposed to? Nope... That won't be for a while.\nMaya:\nHuh? Really? That's strange, isn't it Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Max and Trilo both said otherwise. They said they asked for her hand in marriage.\nMaya:\nAhh, but Max only talked to the Ringmaster about it.\nPhoenix:\nI forgot about that. He asked the Ringmaster for her hand, not Regina directly.\nMaya:\nSo I guess Trilo hasn't asked her directly yet.\nRegina:\nWhat!? He's going to propose to me!? I'm so confused... How about you Maya?\nMaya:\nHuh? What?\nRegina:\nWho do you think I should go for? Max or Trilo?\nPhoenix:\nWait... Wait... You do realize that Trilo is... a... puppet?\nRegina:\nUh? I don't care that he's a bit stiff...\nPhoenix:\nOh boy.\nPresent\nCrime Photo\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this...\nMaya:\nNICK! YOU CAN'T SHOW HER THAT PICTURE!!\nPhoenix:\nOuch... Yeah, that would be a bit insensitive of me.\nRegina:\nHuh? Show me! Show me! Show me!\nMax G. Promo Poster\nMaya:\nDo you know how Max flies in the sky like he does?\nRegina:\nI do know! Want me to tell ya?\nMaya:\nYou know!?\nRegina:\nUh-huh. *giggle* But you have to keep it secret!\nPhoenix:\nEh?\nRegina:\nSo here's how it works... *mumble* *mumble*\nMaya:\nWow! That's incredible!!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nOh, don't pout Nick!\nRegina:\nHehe... We were just teasing you! I don't know a thing about magic!!\nMaya:\nSorry we tricked you Nick.\nAfter presenting Trilo Quist, then clearing all Talk options in Big Top - Cafeteria:\nDecember 28Lodging HousePlaza\nMaya:\nHuh? Detective Gumshoe took off already.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Probably because we ditched him earlier. (Changed from [Yep. Just leave him alone for a while, OK Maya?] in the original release) I bet he and the other cops got lonely and headed back to the precinct. (Changed from [I'm sure he just got lonely and headed back to the precinct.] in the original release)\nExamine\nTarp\nPhoenix:\nSomething's covered up by this tarp... An old sign perhaps.\nMaya:\nNick! Look out! They've got the killer trapped behind that tarp!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat? It wasn't funny? You know it wouldn't have hurt you to look even a little bit surprised.\nPhoenix:\n(Whew! She didn't notice that I was too scared to talk!)\nAir conditioner\nPhoenix:\nThis is the condenser for the air conditioner. It hasn't been used in a while.\nMaya:\nWhat!? How'd you figure that out!? You're not making things up now are you!?\nPhoenix:\nHold your horses! It was easy to figure out! It was snowing before the murder, right? Well, look at the condenser. The snow is still piled on top of it.\nMaya:\nWow! Nick! I'm impressed. Maybe you should be a P.I. instead of an attorney.\nLightpost\nMaya:\nThis safety light was on at the time of the murder, wasn't it?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what they say. (There were performers in the lodging house, so it makes sense that it was on. I bet the killer was worried that someone would spot them during the crime...)\nMuddy footprints\nPhoenix:\nThe Ringmaster's body was found here. I heard that the way he fell over made him look like he was carrying a wooden box... But what in the world really happened here?\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room\nMoe:\nOh my! If it isn't \"Mr. Wright All The Time\"!!\nPhoenix:\n*ugh*\nMoe:\nIt's all Wright to be wrong every now and again, Wright?\nMaya:\nSee Nick! It just took awhile for the joke to find its audience!\nPhoenix:\n... *sigh*\nMoe:\nSo what can I do for you? Did you remember a good joke you wanted to tell me? Pull up a chair, or maybe just pull my finger, and let me have it.\nMaya:\nWe're going to get the same sound effect either way, aren't we?\nMoe:\nHow'd you know I put a whopee [sic] cushion on the chair!? You really know what it takes to be a clown, don't you? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nTalk\nRegina\nPhoenix:\nSo, about Regina...\nMoe:\nRegina is such a pure, innocent child...\nMaya:\nShe's such a cutie, too.\nMoe:\nShe was born and raised in the circus you know? But that means she doesn't really know much about the world outside the Big Top.\nMaya:\nSounds like Pearly...\nMoe:\nFor her, every child's \"dream\" of the circus is her everyday reality.\nMaya:\nShe lives in a dream world...\nMoe:\nEveryday she sees dancing wild animals, men flying in the air, and one very funny clown. The funny thing is, that all seems normal to her because it is her everyday life.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that explains why she thinks she can marry a ventriloquist's puppet...)\nMoe:\nDon't ask me if her reality is a good thing or a bad thing though... \"A clown sees life simply, without complications.\"\nMoney the Monkey\nPhoenix:\nHave you ever heard of a monkey named Money?\nMoe:\nAhhh! Yes! Money!\nPhoenix:\nHe stole my Attorney's Badge!\nMoe:\nWell... Money does love shiny objects... It makes sense that he'd swipe your badge. But under no circumstances can you chase after him.\nPhoenix:\nEh? Why's that?\nMaya:\nOh! I know!! You don't want to get involved in any monkey business, right?\nMoe:\nEXACTLY! BRAVO!! BRAVO!! Enough joking around though... Money isn't considered a member of Regina's family.\nMaya:\nThen who does he belong to?\nMoe:\nI'll be happy to take you to where his owner is staying...\nMaya:\nYou mean right now?\nMoe:\nOf course. Shall we go?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, should we go with him now, or wait a while?)\nGo with Moe\nLeads to:\n\"December 28\nLodging Hall 3rd Floor\nAcro's Room\"\nGo later\nPhoenix:\nWe'll go after we talk some more, OK?\nMoe:\nYay! You want to hear me talk some more, huh? Your wish is my command!! I'll give ya the full repertoire of 1001 jokes!\nMaya:\nWoohoo!!\nPhoenix:\nDon't \"Woohoo!!\" that!!\nLeads back to Talk options\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 3rd FloorAcro's Room\nPhoenix:\n*huff* *huff*\nMoe:\nThis is it... What's wrong, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI... can't... breathe...\nMoe:\nDon't be such a wimp! You only had to climb two flights of stairs!!\nPhoenix:\n*pant* *pant*\nMoe:\nAnyways... This is the place. Acro's room.\nPhoenix:\nAcro?\nMoe:\nHe's an acrobat... It seems like he's not around today...\nMaya:\nEh... That's a big pile of junk over in the corner...\nMoe:\nI don't think it'd be wrong to assume that Phoenix's stuff is over there too... Just be careful to make sure you've got the Wright stuff.\nMaya:\nThanks Moe! See you later!\nMoney has been added to the Court Record.\nAcro's Room\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nYou can see the Big Top from the window here.\nMaya:\nThere is no snow on top of the Big Top... Kinda weird don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nThe inside of the tent is warm so any snow that lands on top probably melts.\nMaya:\nI guess you're right. The snow probably just slides right off.\nTire swing\nPhoenix:\nMoney must use this to swing around on...\nMaya:\nGo ahead Nick. I know you want to ride on it too!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe later...\nJunk pile\nLeads to:\n\"Holy cow!\"\nBasketball hoop\nMaya:\nHey... The net's ripped. Money must be prone to breaking things... He's hardcore.\nPhoenix:\nUmm... The net looks fine to me. You really think that he plays basketball?\nMaya:\nI think so... Monkeys live life above the rim you know.\nPhoenix:\n... You're joking right? You think the monkey has got proverbial \"game\"?\nMaya:\nOf course. That monkey doesn't fake the funk on a nasty dunk.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, a prehensile tail might be an unfair advantage...)\nCalendar\nMaya:\nHehe... It's a monkey calendar!\nPhoenix:\nWhoever's in this room must really love monkeys.\nMaya:\nMaybe a little too much... Wow... I just realized that the year is almost over. Amazing how time flies.\nPhoenix:\nIt's been one wild year. Especially the last part...\nMaya:\nWell, we still got one last person to help this year... Max.\nBed\nPhoenix:\nThis bed is incredibly well made. It's almost like a maid made it up. Even the laundry on top of the bed is folded perfectly.\nMaya:\nNick, there's nothing unusual about that at all. It's how things are supposed to be!\nPhoenix:\nCan't a man respect another man for doing something said man cannot do?\nBarbell\nPhoenix:\nHmm... He's got a barbell. Look around... Everything he's got is for upper body training. Wait a second... These are the same machines I see on TV all the time!\nMaya:\nHey, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nI don't have this one! This barbell here is a new model!\nPhoenix:\nDon't overdo it Maya. You don't want to end up a muscle woman.\nMaya:\nHoly cow! There's a fork... And a mirror... Everything's shiny!! There's even a really cheap looking knockoff wristwatch!\nPhoenix:\nLook at this! It's a trophy! And it's really heavy!!\nMaya:\nNick! I found it! Your badge! It's right here!!\nAttorney's Badge returned to its rightful spot on lapel. (Changed from [Phoenix's Attorney's Badge has been returned.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nThanks! You really saved me! ... Huh?\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter? Did you find something?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Check this out.\nMaya:\nIt's a ring...\nPhoenix:\nThere's something engraved on it... \"From T to R\"...\nRing put in pocket.\nPhoenix:\nWell... I think it's about time we wrap up our investigation...\nMaya:\nDo you think we'll win in court tomorrow?\nPhoenix:\nWho knows... Even I can't imagine what kind of testimony will come out tomorrow. (I'm guessing Moe will be a witness in court tomorrow... Moe and maybe the puppet.)\nMaya:\nDon't worry Nick. No matter what, we've still got a magician on our side!!\nPhoenix:\nThat's good, because we might need some magic tomorrow...\nTo be continued.\nMoe's Room (before examining junk pile in Lodging Hall 3rd Floor - Acro's Room)\nMaya:\nHuh? Moe must have gone off somewhere...\nPhoenix:\nJust as long as he isn't off writing new jokes...\nMaya:\nOh, that reminds me Nick... You have to get your Attorney's Badge back by tomorrow, or we're in trouble.\nPhoenix:\nI know. I know. (I'm gonna have to try and find out where that monkey hid it...)\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.\nExit Magatama session\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)\nToo many errors during Magatama session\n...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...\nPhoenix:\n(Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)\n-- The Silhouette --Moe:\nI was a bit far away, but that shadow could only have belonged to Max.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDon't you think that you are going a little overboard with how explicit you're being? 'That shadow belonged to Max' is an awfully firm statement, don't you think?\nMoe:\nWhat are you getting at...?\nPhoenix:\nI'm just saying that one of your fellow performer's life is on the line here. Are you truly, 100% absolutely certain that it was Max?\nMoe:\n... I'm not the kind of person who would lie about something as serious as this! The silhouette I saw was Max. I'm convinced of that.\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't seem like he is jumping to any conclusions this time...) Let's go over this again then. What makes you so sure that you saw Max that night?Moe:\nThere's no doubting it. Especially since I saw his uppity symbols.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nTrilo said the same thing. But if it was just the symbols, then even I could have been wearing them. What if someone had just taken Max's symbols and worn them?\nMoe:\nI thought of that myself. But just looking at the shape of the face I saw, it must have been Max.\nJudge:\nHmm... You're sure of that!?\nvon Karma:\nSuch a silly little boy... He threw his entire case headlong into a trap!Present Max G. Promo Poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You say you saw all of Max's \"uppity\" symbols?\"Moe:\nHis silk hat.

I've got eyes like a hawk!\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... Don't birds have terrible night vision?)\nMoe:\nBut that's not all I saw!Present Max G. Promo Poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You say you saw all of Max's \"uppity\" symbols?\"Moe:\nHis face was silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were able to see that kind of detail from your window?\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nThere was a light near the scene of the crime. Anyone with decent eyesight should have been able to see that much.\nPhoenix:\nOut of curiosity Moe, what is your eyesight like?\nMoe:\nI can see like a hawk out of my left eye, and an eagle out of my right eye...\nvon Karma:\nOur records say his eyesight is a perfect 20/20.\nPhoenix:\n(That must mean he could have seen the crime scene clearly.)\nJudge:\nHmm... The more we look into this matter, the more suspicious it becomes.\nMoe:\nHey! You asked me what my eyesight was like, not what it actually was!Moe:\nHis cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you didn't actually see what the criminal was holding?\nMoe:\nThat's correct. I've been curious to know what caused that loud noise... It must have been something incredibly hard.\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad they haven't found the murder weapon to know for sure...)\nMaya:\nThey claim it was a blunt object... At least it says so in the autopsy report.Phoenix:\n(With Trilo's testimony, and now Moe's... It really seems like Max is the killer.)Maya:\nN-Nick... You've gotta find a contradiction in this.Phoenix:\nThat's not going to be enough...Maya:\nWhat?Phoenix:\nI have to prove that Moe saw someone other than Max that night! That's the only thing that will help! I've gotta do it!Phoenix:\nYou say you saw all of Max's \"uppity\" symbols?Moe:\nI suppose so... The silk hat and the cloak, right?Phoenix:\nMoe... Everyone knows that Maximillion Galactica has three uppity symbols!Moe:\nThree symbols?Maya:\nYay! Everyone get ready!! All... Together... Now...\"SILK HAT! CLOAK! WHITE ROSES!\"Moe:\nWhat the!?von Karma:\nWho cares if he knew that there were three or not! He saw what he saw. And he saw the symbols. He just forgot to mention one.Moe:\n...von Karma:\nIsn't that right, Moe?Moe:\n... Do you like Pi? I love Pi! 3.141592653589793238462643383279! Tasty!von Karma:\nSilence fool! You are to respond with the whole truth! No fractions!Judge:\nOrder! Order!Phoenix:\nMoe! You didn't see the roses, did you!?Moe:\nTo be honest... There wasn't any roses on the person I saw...von Karma:von Karma:\nThe crime scene was dark! It's obvious it was too dark to see that kind of detail!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut the witness said he was able to see the silhouette of the criminal's face. Not to mention that the roses are white! There's no way he could have missed them!von Karma:von Karma:\nThen the roses must have fallen off when the defendant assaulted the victim!Phoenix:\nIf that was the case, then the police would have found them near the crime scene!Judge:\nMr. Wright! Are these white roses truly material to the facts of this case?von Karma:\nClearly not! He is just toying with this court!Phoenix:\n... (I got her on the ropes now... These seemingly insignificant facts have never failed to lead me to the truth yet! (Changed from [Whenever there's a nugget of truth, it always seems to peek out at me... Then run away.] in the original release)) Someone is toying with the court, but it's not me! Your Honor! Do you recall Trilo's testimony?Trilo:\nThere's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols!Trilo:\nHow can you mistake someone with that crazy get-up and his nose stuck up so high...Trilo:\nHow could you mistake someone wearing such a snobby 3 piece get-up!Phoenix:\nTrilo saw them all! Trilo saw all three of Max's symbols! However, this witness claims there were no white roses on the person he saw! There is absolutely no doubt that this is a contradiction!Judge:\nHmm... Now what am I supposed to think? One is supposed to disregard the pointless, but this...von Karma:\nJudge! Forget the roses! Think about his other testimony! The witness has stated without a doubt that he saw Maximillion Galactica! Nothing else matters! Let's wrap this case up now!Phoenix:\nYour Honor! It may be trivial, but it does cast doubt on the prosecution's case. (Changed from [Your Honor! It may be trivial, but there should still be doubt lingering in your mind!] in the original release)Judge:\n... Frankly, I have my doubts about this witness. It seems that, unlike wine, the witness has not grown more mature with age.Moe:\nI'm not... mature...Judge:\nI've come to a conclusion... I'm 99% certain that this witness saw the defendant. However! My remaining one percent of doubt is quite reasonable! Which means that for my peace of mind, I'm going to request a bit more testimony.von Karma:\nW-What!?Judge:\nIf there are no contradictions in his next statement, I am prepared to issue a ruling.Phoenix:\n(A ruling...!!)Maya:\nNick! This is your last chance!Witness Testimony-- The Silhouette, Part 2 --Moe:\nThere's no doubt in my mind! There were no white roses that night!\nHowever, all of the other symbols were there... I'm equally sure of that.\nEspecially the silk hat! There is no way I could forget seeing the decorations on it!\nHe was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!Judge:\nMr. Wright... You've got one last chance at this.Phoenix:\nJust one chance?Judge:\nI will not allow even the slightest hint of badgering against this witness. If you are going to prove to me there's a contradiction with Mr. Curls' statement, you'd better have at least a shred of evidence to back up your accusations.Phoenix:\n(I've only got a single shot as [sic] this...

You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "To identify a contradiction between Moe's testimony and the evidence, we can focus on whether the silk hat was present with the defendant, Max, during the entire time he was supposedly at the scene of the crime. Moe's particular statement \"He was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene\" (Testimony 3) is critical. \n\nLooking back at the evidence, the Silk Hat (Evidence 3) was found at the crime scene. If Max had been wearing it the entire time as Moe testified, it wouldn't have been found separately at the crime scene. This discrepancy suggests that Moe could not have seen Max with the silk hat on his head the entire time, contradicting his specific assertion.\n\n{\"evidence\": 3, \"testimony\": 3}",

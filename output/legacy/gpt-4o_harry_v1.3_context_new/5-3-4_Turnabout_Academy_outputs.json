I'm gonna be late! *huff* *puff* Whew, finally. So, this is it... the illustrious Themis Legal Academy. (This is the place where many distinguished lawyers and prosecutors got their start. When news spread that Mr. Wright had gotten his attorney's badge back... ...he received a call from this school, asking him to pay a visit. Mr. Wright brought us along, hoping we'd learn something from the experience. But no, I had to go and blow it by getting here thirty minutes late. At least it's not all business today! After all, today's their school festival!)\nOctober 24, 1:29 PMThemis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway\nAthena:\n(Wow! This place has school festival written all over it... literally! But why all the cold stares? Is it because everyone's in a school uniform except me? Well, I like the way I dress! Wonder where Mr. Wright and Apollo are?)\nYour attention please. This is an announcement from the Mock Trial Committee. The mock trial will begin shortly. All students and faculty please proceed at once to the Lecture Hall. Thank you.\nAthena:\n(Sounds like a mock trial is about to start, but where's this Lecture Hall? Looks like all the students and faculty are heading that way. Might as well join them. Maybe I'll find Mr. Wright and Apollo there!)\nOctober 24, 1:33 PMThemis Legal Academy - 3F Lecture Hall\nAthena:\n(This must be the Lecture Hall. Wow, they spent some serious money on this place. The District Court can't even compete.)\nHey, Athena! Over here!\nAthena:\nAh, Mr. Wright! Apollo! I've been looking for you two. I'm so sorry I'm late.\nPhoenix:\nIt's okay. Sorry we couldn't wait for you. But we didn't want to be late for our meeting.\nApollo:\nLucky for you, the person we're supposed to meet also seems to be running late.\n???:\nMr. Wright, Mr. Justice, it seems Prof. Courte has yet to arrive. How un-professorial of her to keep visitors to our esteemed institution waiting like this! I shall make her write \"I will not--\" ...Oh, who do we have here?\nPhoenix:\nOh, right. You haven't been introduced yet.\n???:\nAh, yes. You must be the young lady Mr. Wright was telling me about. I am Aristotle Means, a professor at this hallowed hall of learning.\nMeans:\nI oversee the lawyer course here. It is a pleasure to meet you.\nAthena:\nI'm Athena Cykes! I just recently got my attorney's badge myself! It's nice to meet you, too!\nMeans:\nHow wonderful! So vigorous and vivacious. You just earned yourself a gold star.\nAthena:\nWow, thanks! (That big smile of his is kinda scary, though.)\nApollo:\nLooks like the mock trial's about to begin. What are we going to do about our meeting?\nAthena:\nOh, speaking of the mock trial, do either of you know what it's about?\nMeans:\nOh, but I thought we had sent a pamphlet to your office.\nPhoenix:\nRight, the pamphlet... Whatever happened to that?\nAthena:\nYou won't be seeing it again. Trucy used it for the old rip-it-up-and-restore-it trick. ...Unfortunately, it didn't work as advertised.\nMeans:\nWell, it seems I had better explain the situation, then.\nPhoenix:\nThank you, Professor.\nTalk\nThemis Legal Academy\nMeans:\nNow, does anyone have any questions?\nAthena:\nI do, professor! Could you tell me all about your school?!\nMeans:\nWhat an excellent question. Here's a gold star for asking! Our academy has three courses to choose from. Students seeking to be lawyers take the lawyer course. Likewise... ...budding prosecutors take the prosecutor course, and future judges, the judge course.\nAthena:\nWow, you have everything here for someone who wants to seriously pursue a career in law!\nMeans:\nYes, well, that's what makes our school special, and today even more so. After all, we are to be treated to a lecture by the legendary attorney Phoenix Wright. We can't wait to hear all about his return to the legal profession.\nAthena:\nYou're giving a lecture, Mr. Wright? But you're not even a professor.\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha. Yeah, well I'm just giving them what they want.\nToday's plans (appears after \"Themis Legal Academy\")\nAthena:\nUh, did you even know you were meant to be giving a lecture here today?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, sort of. But I came early because I was supposed to have a meeting... ...with the head of the judge course, Constance Courte.\nApollo:\nIt's been a whirlwind of a morning. Let's leave it at that.\nMeans:\nProf. Courte... She is a wonderful instructor, but quite unpunctual.\nAthena:\n(Oh, so that's who's late.)\nMeans:\nFrom what I've heard, our esteemed Mr. Wright here... ...is scheduled to hold a training seminar tomorrow, in addition to today's lecture.\nAthena:\nA training seminar? For lawyers? What exactly does that involve?\nMeans:\nWhy, it involves the very skills that make a lawyer, a lawyer! The arm angle when shouting, \"Objection!\" The proper way to strike the podium... How to project one's voice... And most importantly, how to bluff your way to victory!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Um, who exactly do you want me to teach stuff like that to again?\nMeans:\nWhat a wonderful question. You just earned yourself a gold star! The great honor of taking a seminar by a famous lawyer and a famous prosecutor... That is what is at stake in this mock trial, the crown jewel of the school festival.\nThe mock trial (appears after \"Today's plans\")\nLeads to:\n\"The mock trial in question is a prestigious event that every student aspires to win.\"\nPresent\nAnything\nMeans:\nWhat magnificent presentation technique! Both your timing and speed were impeccable.\nAthena:\nSpeed?! You mean speed's important when presenting evidence, too?\nMeans:\nAbsolutely! The speed and approach angle theorems are the first things we teach here! I believe Mr. Wright and others like him already make extensive use of them.\nAthena:\nYou do, Boss?!\nPhoenix:\nWell... to some degree, I guess, ah ha ha.\nAthena:\nIt never even crossed my mind. (This lawyer thing is deeper than I thought!)\nMeans:\nThe mock trial in question is a prestigious event that every student aspires to win. The top student in the lawyer course and the top student in the prosecutor course... ...face off in a simulated court case set in this very school! As for the case itself... ...we select the best script written by a judge course student and base our case on that!\nAthena:\nOoh! A one-on-one battle?! How thrilling!\nPhoenix:\nSo, if the student studying to be a lawyer wins, they get to take my training seminar? But what if the other student wins? I'm not a prosecutor, so...\nMeans:\nThere's no cause for alarm. We have a famous prosecutor ready for just such a case. But exactly who it is, well, that is a special surprise!\nAthena:\nA famous prosecutor? (No, it can't be...)\n???:\n...Prof. Means, forgive me for interrupting you and your guests. I'm Juniper Woods, a senior in the judge course. (Changed from [I'm Juniper Woods, a third year in the judge course.] in the original release)\nWoods:\nProfessor, the trial will begin shortly. Since you'll be delivering the pre-trial speech... ...would you mind waiting up in the balcony until we're ready for you?\nMeans:\nMy, how very organized you are, Juniper. You just earned yourself a gold star, too. But what about Prof. Courte... Well, I suppose she'll eventually arrive. Now then, I trust you will look after our visitors, Juniper?\nWoods:\nYes, of course, Prof. Means.\nAthena:\nJuniper? Juniper Woods? Is that you?\nWoods:\nHm? ...Then-- Athena?! I almost didn't recognize you. I didn't know you were back from Europe.\nPhoenix:\nWait, you two know each other? Now that's a coincidence.\nAthena:\nWe've known each other since we were kids. We're like best friends, right, Junie?!\nWoods:\nYes... Well, we lived close to each other, so we used to play in the forest together.\nAthena:\nYeah, like a lot a lot. (Why won't she look at me? I guess I shouldn't be surprised since we haven't seen each other in a long time.)\nApollo:\nAnyway... we're supposed to go wait in the waiting room, right? Not that I wouldn't mind taking in the mock trial you're putting on today.\nWoods:\nUnfortunately, the mock trial is only for students and faculty. There is one seat reserved for Mr. Wright, but no other exceptions are allowed.\nMeans:\nYes, I'm very sorry, but it is part of the student curriculum, after all. I hope you won't mind remaining in the waiting room until the trial concludes.\nApollo:\nOh, that's too bad. I was hoping to learn something new today.\nPhoenix:\n...I'll tell you what, Apollo. Why don't you take my place?\nApollo:\nWhat? Really?\nPhoenix:\nSure. Besides, I'd like to meet with Prof. Courte as soon as she gets here.\nAthena:\nAw, no fair! I wanna see the mock trial, too!\nPhoenix:\nSorry, I'm going to let Apollo pull what little rank he has. ...If it's okay with Prof. Means.\nMeans:\nBut of course, Mr. Wright, if that is what you wish.\nPhoenix:\nIt's settled, then. We'll expect a full and detailed report, Apollo, so pay attention!\nAthena:\nTsk, being the new kid sure stinks.\nWoods:\nIf you would please follow me. I'll escort you down to the waiting room on the first floor.\nOctober 24, 2:15 PMThemis Legal Academy - 1F Waiting Room\nAthena:\n(Still no Prof. Courte... It's been over thirty minutes. And Mr. Wright's snoozing away on the sofa. This is so boring. I should've hid in the Lecture Hall and spied on the mock trial.)\n*crash*\nAthena:\nEek! Wh-What was that?!\nOctober 24Themis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway\nPhoenix:\n*yawn* ...Athena. I could've sworn I just heard something fall down and break. If you go running now, they'll think it was you.\nAthena:\nW-Well it wasn't me. I think it came from somewhere outside.\nPhoenix:\nOh. Well, we better go have a look, seeing as everyone else is in the Lecture Hall.\nAthena:\nOkay!\nOctober 24Themis Legal Academy - Outdoor Stage\nAthena:\nIs this stage for some sort of concert? It kinda reminds me of a courtroom.\nPhoenix:\nWait, Athena. Behind the witness stand!\nAthena:\nWhat? Eeeeeeeeek!\nPhoenix:\nProf. Courte! Can you hear me?! Professor!\nAthena:\nWait, that's... that's who we were supposed to be meeting with?!\nPhoenix:\n......... It looks like our meeting's been canceled for us.\nAthena:\nNo way! This... This can't be real...!\nAthena:\nI called the police. They should be here soon. ...I'll go tell everyone in the Lecture Hall, too.\nPhoenix:\nNo, wait. They'll find out soon enough once the police get here. Let's do our own crime scene investigation before it gets too crowded around here.\nAthena:\nHuh?! Are we even allowed to do that?\nPhoenix:\nIt's no big deal, as long as we leave it exactly like we found it. Plus... No, never mind. Anyway, we should look around while the scene's still fresh.\nAthena:\nBut...... Okay, you're the boss.\nExamine\n\"67th School Festival\" sign, backdrop, defense bench, prosecution bench, judge bench, witness stand, or piles of rubble\nAthena:\nWe should start by studying the body. Hmm, I wonder what's the best angle for this?\nConstance Courte's body\nAthena:\n(Ugh. I guess I really do have to examine the body... Well, guess I'd better get used to stuff like this if I want to be a full-fledged lawyer!)\nArrow\nAthena:\nUgh... There's an arrow stuck in her side. Gunshot wounds and stab wounds are pretty common, but arrow wounds?\nPhoenix:\nThis is a homicide any way you slice it. In other words, we have a murder on our hands.\nAthena:\n(A murder?! Here?!) S-So, that makes this arrow the murder weapon. Well, that and the bow that shot it.\nPhoenix:\nRight, but where could the killer have shot her from? The stage is a sea of obstructions? I'm no expert on archery, but it can't be easy to hit a target with this much stuff around.\nAthena:\nWould it be possible to kill someone by stabbing them with an arrow?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure. Guess we better do some more investigating before jumping to conclusions.\nArrow added to the Court Record.\nArrow (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nUgh... There's an arrow stuck in her side. Gunshot wounds and stab wounds are pretty common, but arrow wounds?\nPhoenix:\nThis is a homicide any way you slice it. In other words, we have a murder on our hands.\nAthena:\n(A murder?! Here?!)

Guess we better do some more investigating before jumping to conclusions.\nPlanner\nPhoenix:\nWhat do we have here...? A book? I'm guessing it fell out of her chest pocket.\nAthena:\nWait! What if it's her diary?! That's the most private thing a girl has!\nPhoenix:\nTrue, but considering the situation at hand, my apologies to the late Prof. Courte.\nAthena:\nNo, don't!\nPhoenix:\nHmm, looks more like a planner than a diary. Every page seems to have the same sword mark printed on it at that.\nAthena:\nI still think a girl deserves her privacy, but this may help us solve the case.\nCourte's Planner added to the Court Record.\nPlanner (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nWhat do we have here...? A book? I'm guessing it fell out of her chest pocket.\nAthena:\nWait! What if it's her diary?! That's the most private thing a girl has!\nPhoenix:\nTrue, but considering the situation at hand, my apologies to the late Prof. Courte.\nAthena:\nNo, don't!\nPhoenix:\nHmm, looks more like a planner than a diary. Every page seems to have the same sword mark printed on it at that.\nAthena:\nI still think a girl deserves her privacy, but this may help us solve the case.\nBody\nPhoenix:\nNotice anything strange about the body? Take a deep breath, and then take a good look.\nAthena:\nUm... well, now that you mentioned it, there's no blood around it.\nPhoenix:\nYet the victim's body is cold and rigor mortis has already started to dissipate. It would appear that quite some time has passed since Prof. Courte was murdered. Thing is, the quad was packed with students up until the start of the mock trial.\nAthena:\nWait, then doesn't that mean she was killed at a different location? Ooh, I know! The killer moved the body here while everyone was in the Lecture Hall!\nPhoenix:\nThat's a definite possibility. Notice anything else?\nAthena:\nUmm... Her arms are raised over her head and there are dark bruises around her wrists.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. The professor was probably tied up with something.\nAthena:\nEventually, her wrists were unbound, and as she reached up to stretch, she was killed? ...Actually, I'm not so sure about this theory...\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well, there's not exactly a lot to go on...\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nPhoenix:\nIn addition to checking the body, we should also check the area around it. But we don't have much time, check only what you can. ...Nervous, Athena?\nAthena:\nY-Yes! I mean, n-no! (Apollo didn't bat an eye at the alderman's body during that case in Nine-Tails Vale... I can't let him show me up. I can do this. Just take a deep breath and focus!)\nAbout the murder\nAthena:\nSo, Prof. Courte was...\nPhoenix:\nYep, the professor I was here to meet with. Turns out, she wasn't running late after all.\nAthena:\n(How awful. Here she was lying dead and we thought she was late.) What was that you were saying before, Boss? You never finished.\nPhoenix:\nHm? Oh, that. Don't worry, I'll fill you in... later. But right now, let's focus on the investigation, okay?\nAthena:\nO-Okay, sure. (Ugh, the suspense is killing me.)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nOh, a shiny new attorney's badge. Brings back memories...\nAthena:\nI've heard that countless people live in dread of your pointer finger. Were you really that scary back then, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha. Strike one. I've always been just as you see me here.\nAthena:\nA harmless sheep in wolf's clothing?\nPhoenix:\nStrike two.\nAthena:\nDo you have an old picture of yourself? Wait, never mind! I'm not sure I want to see it!\nPhoenix:\nStrike three, you're out.\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nListen, Athena. There's a certain amount of etiquette involved in presenting evidence. You're free to shove this or that into my face, but... ...at least get my attention first or give me some sort of a warning.\nAthena:\n(In other words, do as I say, not as I do.)\nAfter examining arrow, planner, and body:\nAthena:\nI think that's about all we're going to find out from the body for now.\nPhoenix:\nNice work, Athena. Your face only turned five shades of pale. I was expecting fifty. We should probably take a picture of the crime scene, just in case.\nAthena:\nOkay, I'm on it! Say cheese!\nPhoenix:\nCheese? And I thought I was the one with the twisted sense of humor.\nAthena:\nI think that should do it.\nPhoenix:\nAll right, let's take a better look around the area while we wait for the police to arrive.\nAthena:\nThis pile of rubble sticks out like a sore thumb. Looks like broken pottery or plaster. Maybe this is the source of that noise we heard.\nPhoenix:\nHmm, there were supposedly two statues on this stage. I seem to recall hearing that a coed from the Fine Art Club had made them.\nAthena:\nThere were two? Then that thing over there is the remains of another statue?\nPhoenix:\nThis could be related to the case. Let's take a closer look.\nExamine\n\"67th School Festival\" sign, backdrop, defense bench, prosecution bench, judge bench, or witness stand\nAthena:\nThere's definitely something here, but there are other pressing issues to take care of. Like doing a careful search of the area around that broken statue.\nPile of rubble near prosecution bench\nBroken statue\nAthena:\nWonder what this was a statue of. Whatever it was, it was reddish-purple in color.\nPhoenix:\nWhen Apollo and I first got here, both statues were already here, but they were covered up. I bet they were waiting to unveil them when the school festival moved here to this stage.\nAthena:\nYou mean this duffle bag-looking thing was actually being used to cover the statues? I guess that just leaves the question, were they broken by accident or on purpose? Hmm... What a puzzle this is.\nNewspaper\nAthena:\nThere's something buried in the rubble. ...The Themis Herald?\nPhoenix:\nWait, we shouldn't disturb it. Let's just read what we can.\nAthena:\n\"Final Act in Torrid Love Triangle Centered on Campus She-Devil Juniper Woods\" \"Level-headed lawyer course genius and hot-blooded prosecutor course student... ...will go head to head in a mock trial battle for the she-devil's black heart! Hugh O'Conner has declared that he will confess to her if he wins!\" Wait, whaaaaaaaaat?! I seriously wish I hadn't read that!\nPhoenix:\nYou find that more shocking than discovering a murder victim's body?\nAthena:\nB-B-But, we're talking about my friend Junie here! She'd never lead guys on like that!\nPhoenix:\nAthena, you don't believe everything you read, do you? This article is clearly written with malicious intent. I'm not buying a word of it.\nAthena:\nY-You're right. But it's still disturbing, even if it's third-rate tabloid material.\nThemis Herald added to the Court Record.\nNewspaper (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nThere's something buried in the rubble. ...The Themis Herald?\nPhoenix:\nWait, we shouldn't disturb it. Let's just read what we can.\nAthena:\n\"Final Act in Torrid Love Triangle Centered on Campus She-Devil Juniper Woods\" \"Level-headed lawyer course genius and hot-blooded prosecutor course student... ...will go head to head in a mock trial battle for the she-devil's black heart!

I'm not buying a word of it.\nAthena:\nY-You're right. But it's still disturbing, even if it's third-rate tabloid material.\nAfter examining broken statue and newspaper:\n???:\nMr. Wright! Athena!\nAthena:\nOh, here comes Apollo! I've never seen anyone move so fast!\nApollo:\n*huff*... *huff*... Listen! Something big's happened! I was at the mock trial when the police announced a body had been found on campus!\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. And we're the ones who phoned it in. We found Prof. Courte dead behind the witness stand over there.\nApollo:\nWH-WHAAAT?! Can you show me?! ...What the--?!\nAthena:\nWe've already had a quick look at the body. It's definitely a homicide. Once the police get here--\nApollo:\nNo, I know it's a homicide! I'm shocked because it's the same! Exactly the same!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa there, Apollo. Take a deep breath and explain what you mean.\nApollo:\nIt's the same! The body, that is! It's just like it was in the mock trial!\nAthena:\nWhat? It's like the mock trial?\nApollo:\nI know! It sounds crazy, b-but... The body's location and position, the murder weapon, the lack of pooling blood... It's all exactly like the mock trial!\nAthena:\nYou're kidding, right? It can't really all be the same... can it...?\nOctober 24Themis Legal Academy - 3F Lecture Hall\nPhoenix:\nThe whole school's in an uproar. There won't be any more classes today.\nApollo:\nA murder on campus... That's the last thing I expected at a legal academy.\nPhoenix:\nI'll go tell Prof. Means what we observed when we discovered the body. You two wait here until you've spoken with the police.\nAthena:\nYes, Boss!\nApollo:\n*sigh* I can't believe this is happening.\nAthena:\nI can't believe we have to wait around here. I can't stay still at times like these. (I hope Junie hasn't fainted from the shock of this whole thing.)\nWoods:\nAh! Thena... er, I mean, Athena. There you are.\nAthena:\nJunie! Am I glad to see you! I was worried that--\nWoods:\nDon't worry about me. I am Student Council President, after all. I need to be strong.\nAthena:\nStudent Council President? Wow, I'm impressed. (She's really changed. She used to be kind of sickly and shy.)\nApollo:\nJuniper was it? You mind if we ask you a few questions?\nAthena:\nYeah, we're stuck here waiting for the police. And there's really not much to do.\nWoods:\nSure, what would you like to know?\nTalk\nJuniper Woods\nAthena:\nI haven't seen you in ages, Junie! What's it been, seven years or so?\nWoods:\nYes, and I remember how you were always there for me, Athena.\nAthena:\nUm, maybe it's just me, but I wanted to ask why you seem so distant. Remember how you used to call me \"Thena\"? I liked it better that way. It felt like we were sisters, you know?\nWoods:\nYes, but I'm Student Council President now. And as the student representative of Themis Legal Academy, I have to act properly.\nAthena:\n(She was never this stiff and formal before.) I knew you wanted to be a judge, but I didn't expect this. It's such a prestigious school. And you're in the judge course to boot.\nWoods:\nYes. And Prof. Courte had been in charge of it until... well, you know.\nAthena:\n(Oh, right. Prof. Courte was the professor in charge of Junie's course...)\nConstance Courte (appears after \"Juniper Woods\")\nApollo:\nWhat sort of teacher was Prof. Courte?\nWoods:\nIf I had to sum her up in a single word, I'd say she was \"amazing.\" \"A judge must always seek the truth.\" That was her mantra, and she used it in trying to... ...fix what was wrong with our school. She was a beacon of hope in this dark age of the law.\nAthena:\nWhat's wrong with your school? What did you mean by that?\nWoods:\nOh, uh, nothing! Never mind.\nAthena:\n(Am I imagining things or did I just detect something in Junie's voice?)\nWoods:\nProf. Courte chose my script for the mock trial.\nAthena:\nOh? You mean all of the students in the judge course had to submit a script? And yours was the one she selected? Wow, that's amazing, Junie!\nWoods:\nOh, th-thank you. But now, Prof. Courte is... Who would do such a thing? Just yesterday we were working together, trying to get things ready... *cough* *cough* *cough* Excuse me.\nAthena:\nAre you all right, Junie? Maybe you should take it easy for a while. (So she's still got that cough... Guess she's not as strong as she pretends to be.)\nThe mock trial (appears after \"Constance Courte\")\nLeads to:\n\"Why do you need a script in a showdown between a lawyer and a prosecutor?\"\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nWoods:\nThat's your attorney's badge, isn't it! I really envy you, you know. That gold sunflower really suits you.\nAthena:\nThanks. But I know you'll make a fabulous judge someday, Junie.\nWoods:\nTh-Thank you... But... Even if I become a judge, I'll never have one of those sunflower badges.\nAthena:\n(Wait, so she only envies me for the badge?)\nThemis Herald\nWoods:\nOh, th-that's...\nAthena:\nHeh heh. Sorry, but I couldn't help reading it. You always were popular with the guys.\nWoods:\nTh-That's not true! I... I was never...!\nAthena:\nYou just didn't realize it. But that made you even more irresistible. It's been seven years, but I still remember how all the boys wanted to be near you.\nApollo:\nI bet you used to get all excited when a guy handed you a love letter... ...and then got really bummed out when he'd say, \"Could you give this to Juniper for me?\"\nAthena:\nAgh! (How'd he know?! I'm sure it was just a lucky guess, but why'd it have to be Apollo of all people?!)\nAnything else\nWoods:\nAthena, you know it's against school rules for you to have such things in your possession. As Student Council President, I'm afraid I'll have to confiscate that. Hand it over, please.\nAthena:\nBut this is important evidence.\nWoods:\n...Oh, well, then I suppose we can make an exception just this once.\nAthena:\n(Wow, she's one tough law-and-order type president, all right.)\nAthena:\nWhy do you need a script in a showdown between a lawyer and a prosecutor?\nWoods:\nWell, we were simulating a trial, so we needed a script as a framework. All the details about the incident and the people involved are included in the script. We also prepared a crime scene, photos, a murder weapon, and other kinds of evidence.\nApollo:\nWow, you guys think of everything. Must be hard getting all that ready.\nWoods:\nYes, well... it was only Prof. Courte and I. After all, we didn't want the script or other elements of the mock trial to get leaked. We were the only ones in the entire school who knew all of the details.\nAthena:\nMust've been a big pain in the-- er, I mean, that must've been really difficult.\nWoods:\nI wrote the script so that the case could go either way. That way, the defense and the prosecution both had an equal chance of winning.\n???:\nHeh, if you think that's all she's capable of, you've got another thing coming.\nAthena:\nHuh? Who said that?\n???:\nJuniper's genius doesn't stop at her brilliant script.\n???:\nYEAAAAAH! She gave an award-winning performance as the defendant, maaaaaan!!!\nApollo:\nUm, I think I found a rival to my Chords of Steel.\nWoods:\nHugh, Robin, aren't you going to introduce yourselves to our guests? As Student Council President, I won't have you treating them rudely.\n???:\nHeh, you're right. I heard Mr. Wright was bringing a couple of guests with him. That would be you two? Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes?\nAthena:\nYep! I'm Athena Cykes!\nApollo:\nAnd I'm Apollo Justice. Nice to meet you.\n???:\n...I'll pass on the handshake.\nO'Conner:\nI'm studying to be a lawyer. The name's Hugh O'Conner. ...But some call me Mr. Perfect because I never score less than one hundred percent on tests. (Changed from [...But some call me Mr. Perfect because I never score less than 100% on tests.] in the original release)\nAthena:\n(Ugh. Most... pretentious... introduction... EVER. And what's with his hand? Is it glued to the inside of his pocket or what? Yeesh.)\n???:\nLemme be the first to apologize for Hugh's totally rude introduction! SORRRRRY!!!\nNewman:\nNow, here's my intro! I'm Robin Newman!!! I'm studying to be a prosecutor! Like the really cool kind that nails the bad guys! NOOOOOO!!! Where's the sincerity?!\nAthena:\n(So he makes pottery, too? And what's that brace-like contraption for...?

Juniper, come on. Your role's way beyond just that.\nNewman:\nThat's riiiiiight! The mock trial's just the start! She's also in the school festival's main event! Live on stage, Juniper Woods! And the crowd goes bananas! WOOOOO!!!\nWoods:\n......... I'm... I'm supposed to sing at the school festival. All of the other girls were too embarrassed to try out, so...\nAthena:\nMy Junie singing? On a stage in front of people? (Wow, she really HAS changed.)\nTalk\nYour performance\nWoods:\nI was responsible for making everyone's stage costumes. And this is what I'll be wearing.\nAthena:\nThat's amazing, Junie, but then again, you were always good at that kind of thing. These constellations in particular are really something.\nWoods:\nOh! Um, thank you. One of my favorite things to do is to look up at the stars in the middle of the forest.\nApollo:\nHuh, so you're a fan of the night sky then?\nAthena:\nWow Apollo, didn't know you were such a romantic.\nApollo:\nI-It's not like that! I have this friend -- he and I go way back -- who got me really interested in space.\nAthena:\nWait, you had friends when you were young? Color me surprised!\nWoods:\nAs Student Council President, I cannot allow such mean-spirited teasing to continue.\nAthena:\nEep....

YOU CAN DOOOOOO IIIIIIT!!!\nO'Conner:\nThat's right. And anyone who says otherwise will have to answer to me.\nAthena:\n(It's like a chivalrous love triangle -- a damsel in distress and two knights in shining armor.

(appears after \"Your performance\")\nLeads to:\n\"So, how did the mock trial end?\"\nAthena:\nSo, how did the mock trial end?\nWoods:\nWe were just about to reach a verdict when the police arrived. Now we'll never know how it would've turned out.\nApollo:\nI guess that's what happens when there's a real murder during a fake murder trial.\nAthena:\nIt ended right before the verdict? Talk about bad timing...\nO'Conner:\n.........\nNewman:\nI was THIS close, maaan! I bet I woulda won!!!\nApollo:\nBut I bet the defense wasn't doing too badly either, right?\nO'Conner:\nWe'll settle this some other time. And I assure you, I WILL win when that time comes.\nNewman:\nLike I'm gonna let that happen! I DON'T THINK SO!!!\nAthena:\nI hope they don't end up hurting each other.\nWoods:\nOh, don't worry. The three of us have been good friends since we enrolled here.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. We even have proof of our friendship.\nAthena:\nProof? Like physical evidence, proof?\nWoods:\nYes. We're studying for a career in law, and in the legal world, evidence is everything.\nNewman:\nYeaaaaaah!!! As long as our friendship lasts! You can bet we'll be carrying them around!\nAthena:\nAh, the famed \"Themis Legal Academy ingenuity\" at work! So, what exactly is this \"proof of friendship,\" anyway?\nWoods:\n.........Well... It's a secret. And if I show you, it would be bad luck.\nAthena:\nOh, okay... (I knew it. There's definitely some discord in Junie's voice.)\nO'Conner:\nOur friendship is sacred and inviolable. It's not something to be put cheaply on display.\nNewman:\nProof?! We don't need no stinkin' proof! Us three are friends foreveeeeeer!!!\nAthena:\n(I can hear discord in their voices, too! But they're talking about their friendship. What's going on here?)\nApollo:\nSomething wrong, Athena?\nAthena:\nNo, it's... it's nothing.\nApollo:\nOh... All right, then... Hey, isn't that--!\n???:\nEveryone, stay right where you are! Don't move a muscle!\nAthena:\nD-Detective Fulbright? Is something wrong?\nFulbright:\nWhy, if it isn't my little lawyer friends! Sorry, but the small talk will have to wait. Juniper Woods, you're under arrest for the murder of Constance Courte!\nWoods:\n...I'm what?\nAthena:\nW-Wait a second! What's going on here?! Why are you arresting Junie?!\nApollo:\nPlease, Detective Fulbright. We're involved in this case, too.\nFulbright:\nAh-ha! So, you're the lawyers the dispatch said were first on scene! I can't tell you everything, but I will say this. There are two major reasons for her arrest. Number one! The suspect led someone to where the body was.\nWoods:\nI-I didn't--!\nFulbright:\nAnd number two! The crime scene is exactly how the suspect portrayed it in her script!\nAthena:\nBut...! You can't arrest her on just those grounds!\nFulbright:\nTrue. But there's more! However, Prosecutor Blackquill specifically told me to say no more than that!\nAthena:\n(So Blackquill's the prosecuting attorney on this one, too...?)\nPoliceman:\nDetective Fulbright! We found this in the suspect's pocket!\nFulbright:\nHm? Wh-Why there's...! There's blood on this!\nWoods:\nTh-That's evidence we made for the mock trial!\nFulbright:\nA mock... trial? Never heard of such a thing, but it sounds fishy to me! Real fishy! Now, if you would, officers.\nPoliceman:\nYes, sir!\nWoods:\nB-But... *cough, cough* I... *cough*\nAthena:\nJunie! (I have to do something! I... I can't let them take her away like this!)\nFulbright:\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.\nAthena:\n............\nAthena:\nAnime cutscene\nAthena:\nHold it! I refuse to believe that she's the killer! ...Junie! I've decided... I'm going to defend you! I'll fight with everything I've got!\nWoods:\nTh-Thena...!\nAthena:\nJunie! It's good to hear you say that name again.\nFulbright:\nHate to interrupt your bonding time, but... Aren't you rather new to all this? You're barely even a lawyer!\nAthena:\nWell, I don't have much experience, and I may need Apollo and Mr. Wright's help at times... ...but nobody believes in Junie as much as I do!\nApollo:\nI'll help you, too, Juniper. There's no way you murdered your professor.\nWoods:\nThena... *cough* Apollo... Thank *cough* you both. I'm counting on you! *cough, cough*\nAthena:\nWe've got your back, Junie!\nFulbright:\nGuess things worked out after all. Now that you have your lawyers, Ms. Woods, it's time for us to head back to the station.\nAthena:\n(I can't believe Junie's been arrested for murder. And I can't believe I accepted her case without asking Mr. Wright!)\nApollo:\nTake a deep breath and relax, Athena. I'm here to help with whatever you need, so let's get right on the case!\nAthena:\nRight!\nO'Conner:\nHeh. I won't have this case left in the hands of rank amateurs. If anyone's going to solve this case, it'll be me. Time to investigate.\nAthena:\nWhy that smug little--! (He hasn't even finished law school!)\nNewman:\nHUUUUUUGH!!! That was totally ruuude!!! And you're not the only one on the case, maaaaaan!!! I'm in, too! Big time! JUUUUUUUUUNIPER WOOOOOOODS!!! I'm gonna save yooooooooou!!!\nApollo:\nNow that those two are gone, let's get back to what I was talking about in front of the stage. ...About the mock trial, that is.\nAthena:\nOh, right! You said the victim's location, position, and so on were just like in the script!\nApollo:\nExactly. But without the script or any props, it's kind of hard to explain.\n???:\nPerhaps I could help... Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\nP-Prosecutor Gavin! What are you doing here?\nAthena:\nYou two seem to know each other. Is someone going to introduce me?\nKlavier:\nWhy, I do believe we have a fresh face here. Greetings, Fräulein. I am Klavier Gavin. Some know me as a prosecutor, but I'm most famous for my former rock band. We were quite popular you know, but regrettably, the band went kaput. Perhaps you've heard of us? The Gavinners? I was the lead vocalist.\nAthena:\nNever heard of your band. Then again, I was out of the country till only recently. But... can I get your autograph?!\nApollo:\nYou just met him like three seconds ago and you want his autograph?\nKlavier:\nForgive me Fräulein, but I've retired from the music biz. But I'd be happy to offer my autograph as rock star prosecutor, Klavier Gavin.\nAthena:\nOh, okay. That one, then!\nKlavier:\nShe's a lively one, eh, Herr Forehead? Didn't know she was your type.\nApollo:\n.........She's the newest member of Wright Anything Agency, that's all.\nAthena:\nNice to meet you! I'm Athena Cykes!\nKlavier:\nA pleasure to meet you too, Athena Cykes. Now that the intros are out of the way... ...I'm sure you have some questions for me, ja, Herr Forehead?\nTalk\nWhy are you here?\nApollo:\nSo, what are you doing here, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nI'm here for the same reason as your boss -- to give a lecture and a training seminar.\nAthena:\n(So HE'S the famous prosecutor they invited!)\nKlavier:\nAnd... I have another crucial role to play. The Gavinners are getting back together for a one-time special performance.\nApollo:\nEven though you guys disbanded? ...Which was a shame, by the way. Really.\nKlavier:\nJa, I know how much you... adored our music, Herr Forehead. Anyway, I studied abroad in Germany to get my badge early, but I did graduate from here.\nAthena:\nWait, so that performance Junie mentioned...\nKlavier:\nI see you've already heard about that. One student representative was selected to sing with us onstage. And the stage was supposed to look like this tomorrow. Two big banners and a pair of wicked statues. This is just an illustration, but it's not half bad.\nAthena:\nWicked statues...? Wait are these supposed to be you and Mr. Wright?\nKlavier:\nBingo, Fräulein. And they were so big and magnificent, too! What a terrible waste. But the worst part of this whole thing is... ...my long-awaited reunion with my mentor never came to pass.\nAthena:\nWait, don't tell me your mentor was--!\nKlavier:\nProf. Courte. She was the one who taught me how to think about the law.\nConstance Courte (appears after \"Why are you here?\")\nLeads to:\n\"So, Constance Courte was your professor here at the academy...\"\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nKlavier:\nMay I ask why you people present your attorney's badges like that? It seems like Herr Forehead and Mr. Wright always want to show theirs off, too.\nAthena:\nWell, let me ask you, Prosecutor Gavin. Why do you play air guitar?\nKlavier:\nAh!\nAthena:\nIt would seem the answer we seek can be found in much the same place.\nApollo:\nI never gave it that much thought, actually. I always just whip it out.\nThemis Herald\nKlavier:\nDid I ever mention I'm a graduate of this fine institution? The mock trials... They sure bring back memories. So many unforgettable battles.\nAthena:\nReally? So, you stood on that stage, too?\nKlavier:\nJa, I waited on my air guitar, rocked out to the beat, and exposed crimes for all to see. You could say this is where my hard-rocking prosecutorial style made its debut.\nAthena:\nHard-rocking prosecutorial style? How did your mock trial turn out?\nKlavier:\nAchtung, baby! I brought the house down and had the crowd on its feet! Ever since, the academy has held a live concert in conjunction with the mock trial.\nAthena:\n(All I wanted to know was how the trials turned out...)\nAnything else\nKlavier:\nWhy, Fräulein, what a wonderful piece of evidence you have there. But I imagine no matter what you present... ...it would be impossible for it to be more persuasive than your beauty.\nAthena:\n(Too bad it doesn't work that way in court, too...)\nAthena:\nSo, Constance Courte was your professor here at the academy...\nKlavier:\nShe may have taught the judge course, but she had a huge impact on me. She was fond of saying, \"The end is only justified through proper means.\" She wouldn't tolerate dishonesty and always revered what was right beyond all else.\nAthena:\n(I can feel Prosecutor Gavin's sadness. Oh, no, I think I'm gonna cry... *sniffle*)\nApollo:\nAthena? Are you tearing up? Though I can't blame you... Prosecutor Gavin owes a lot of who he is to Prof. Courte.\nKlavier:\nExactly. So, as you can see, we are both joined in purpose, so to speak, ja? Now, let's rock this place hard!\nApollo:\nHuh? I don't follow. Let's rock what?\nKlavier:\nForget already, Herr Forehead? I said I'd help you explain the mock trial. We're going to reprise it right here in the Lecture Hall! It might help us catch her killer!\nOctober 24Themis Legal Academy - 3F Lecture Hall\nMock Trial ReenactmentAll Rise\nKlavier:\nRight. the stage is ready. And you, Herr Forehead? Ready to rock?!\nApollo:\nUm, no, the defense is not ready to rock.\nKlavier:\nYou saw the actual mock trial earlier, right? Just relax, you'll do fine. Besides, we have the script right here.\nAthena:\nJunie's masterpiece?! The one everyone's been talking about?!\nKlavier:\nJa, and there's only one in existence. I \"borrowed\" it, if you will. Now, Fräulein, we'll need you to play the part of defendant and judge as per the script.\nAthena:\nOkay, got it!\nKlavier:\nI've only read the case outline so far. I don't know how it actually turns out, so I'll treat this like I'm prosecuting a real case. You, Herr Forehead, will play the part of a fledgling lawyer, a role you were born to play. All the evidence is also here with us. We have everything we need to reprise the mock trial.\nAthena:\nTrès bien! Let's get started. Defendant-slash-judge Athena Cykes, is psyched and ready to rock! Court is now in session for our reenactment of the mock trial... ...or what I'd like to call the mock mock trial!\nKlavier:\nJa, a double mockery, perhaps, but a trial is still a trial. Achtung, baby! It's no holds barred! Let's rock!\nApollo:\nAw, can't we take it easy today?\nAthena:\nAthena:\nIt may just be a mock of a mock, but there's only one way to compete! You play to win! So remember, each time I catch you slacking off, I'm holding you in contempt of court!\nApollo:\nGreat... A judge that voices her own objections AND abuses her judicial powers.\nTalk\nSummary of the facts\nAthena:\nNow, then, Prosecutor Gavin, your opening statement if you please.\nKlavier:\nYou got it, Fräulein Judge! Our case is set in a school very much like this one. The victim -- a professor, female. The defendant -- an Archery Club member, also female.\nAthena:\nOh me, oh my... I'm innocent! Innocent I tell you!\nKlavier:\nThat's some seriously bad acting, Fräulein. Anyway, the victim's body was discovered in the middle of the quad. Here's a shot of the crime scene. Ironically, it was Prof. Courte who posed as the corpse. Herr Forehead, how did the mock trial participants react to this photo?\nApollo:\nMr. Newman was surprised by what Prof. Courte was wearing. He reacted with, \"Oh, the green sweat suit.\"\nAthena:\n(That's not exactly what I would pick to focus on, so why would he care about that?)\nKlavier:\nAh, too much of a fledgling to know what's important, that one. In any case... ...both in the mock trial and the actual case, Prof. Courte was wearing a sweat suit. Moving right along--\nApollo:\nApollo:\nHey, wait a sec! The body was discovered in the same area as the mock case, although there was a stage. Plus, the murder weapon, an arrow, and the lack of blood are also the same!\nKlavier:\nThat's right. And therein lies the significance of this mock mock trial. So let's keep rockin' it hard, just like that!\nDefense's argument (appears after \"Summary of the facts\")\nKlavier:\nBefore the crime occurred, the defendant was to meet the victim in the quad.\nAthena:\nUm, ahem... Let's see here... \"When I arrived at our meeting place, I found the professor with an arrow in her stomach! But... it wasn't me! I didn't kill her!\"\nApollo:\nYou don't have to ham it up like that, Athena.\nKlavier:\nIt's called getting into character, Herr Forehead. Don't be such a wet blanket.\nApollo:\nRight... Um, let's see... Oh yeah, then Hugh said... \"A frail coed used her bare hands to stab her professor with an arrow? I don't think so. At the time of the murder, a male student was seen... ...holding a bow in the Archery Club room, which has a clear view of the quad. He shot the arrow into the victim before my client even got there!\"\nKlavier:\nNein nein, Herr Forehead. That feigned swagger does not suit you in the least.\nAthena:\nOrder! Order!!! ORDER!!! Especially you, Mr. Justice!\nApollo:\nMe?! But I was just trying to get into it like Mr. Euro Rocker said.\nProsecution's rebuttal (appears after \"Defense's argument\")\nAthena:\nSo, the victim was shot from the Archery Club room before the meeting even took place. Hence, the defendant could not be the killer. That seems to be the defense's assertion. Prosecutor Gavin, do you have any objections?\nKlavier:\nThe autopsy report notes that the edges of the victim's wound were unusually ragged. Could such physical trauma possibly result from an arrow shot from a bow? Nein! I believe the victim was impaled with the arrow by hand... postmortem. In short, the real murder weapon was not the arrow at all.\nApollo:\nWhen Robin was prosecutor, he had a tough time determining the real murder weapon.\nKlavier:\nWell, he's just a student, a warm-up act, while I am the real deal, the headliner, so to speak. The true murder weapon was most likely the awl that was left in the art room.\nAthena:\nAn awl, what's that? Er, I mean... Hmm... An awl, you say? What might that be?\nKlavier:\nIt's a kind of tool used for poking holes in paper, wood, and other materials. It's kind of like an ice pick. I have a photo here if you're interested.\nAthena:\nGross.. It's all bloody up to the handle. Please tell me it's just paint.\nKlavier:\nMost likely, Fräulein. Pretty realistic, ja? Let's pretend it's real blood for now. The defendant's prints were lifted from the murder weapon. Furthermore, traces of the victim's blood were discovered in the art room. That's where I believe the murder actually took place.\nAthena:\nSo, the question now is, how did the body get from the art room to the stage?\nHow the body was moved (appears after \"Prosecution's rebuttal\")\nLeads to:\n\"The murder took place in the third floor art room, but the body was found in the quad.\"\nKlavier:\nThe murder took place in the third floor art room, but the body was found in the quad.\nAthena:\nIt must've been quite a chore moving the body all that way.\nKlavier:\nNot at all. There's a maintenance area and storehouse right outside the art room. And a cart used to carry balls around was found there.\nAthena:\nOh, I think I've seen one of those before. But that's a pretty big one.\nKlavier:\nA jumbo, ja? Big enough to fit a person -- or a body -- in it. The defendant dropped the body from the art room window, then moved it with the cart. That is how a high-school girl could easily move a body all by herself!\nAthena:\nY-You don't saaaaaaaaaaay!\nApollo:\nApollo:\n\"A body dropped from three stories up would show signs of massive blunt force trauma!\"\nKlavier:\nKlavier:\nThat may be true, but... ...you failed to account for the large high jump mat in the storehouse. A body dropped onto such a mat would show no signs of blunt force trauma.\nApollo:\nYikes... It's almost scary how similar this whole case is to the mock trial proceedings.\nKlavier:\nQuite the crafty killer. In an attempt to case suspicion on the Archery Club... ...they moved the body to the quad where it would be an easy shot from the clubroom. Then the killer faked the murder weapon by inserting an arrow into the awl's stab wound.\nAthena:\n(Sounds like he has only high praise for Junie's script.)\nKlavier:\nWere there any further arguments from the defense?\nApollo:\nNope. It seemed like the teacher who was playing the judge was satisfied, too.\nKlavier:\nTime for the finale, then. Your verdict if you please, Fräulein Judge!\nAthena:\nHuh? Oh, right, that's me! Very well, this court finds the defendant, Juniper Woods-- Wait a second. Even if this is just a mock trial of a mock trial... ...I don't want to declare Junie guilty!\nKlavier:\nYeah, perhaps that's not such a good idea. Let's end our mock mock trial here. Besides, it's about time I get back to my investigation.\nAthena:\nThanks, you two! That little run-through of the mock trial cleared up quite a few things!\nMock Trial Script added to the Court Record.\nKlavier:\nAchtung, baby! The prosecution's already got a witness sized up, too.\nAthena:\nThat was quick. (Prosecutor Blackquill's almost too good...)\nApollo:\nYou're in such a helpful mood today, Prosecutor Gavin...\nKlavier:\nWell, like I said, I just want to catch whoever killed Prof. Courte. And there's no reason for me to start butting heads with you two. Anyway, I won't say goodbye, as I'm sure I'll be seeing you later.\nAthena:\nI always thought prosecutors were all a rather scary bunch. But Prosecutor Gavin seems pretty nice.\nApollo:\nYeah, he's not so bad as prosecutors go. We should get back to investigating, too. We don't have nearly enough information yet.\nAthena:\nAnd we also have to tell Mr. Wright that we accepted Junie's case.\nApollo:\nRight. Looks like we have our work cut out for us!\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nApollo:\nThe most prominent feature of this case is how closely it resembles the script. That makes it a tough one because we have to have a firm understanding of them both.\nAthena:\nNo sweat! We can reenact the mock trial as many times as we want by reading the script! I'll check it out in the Court Record and commit it to memory later!\nApollo:\nGood. I bet the script and the mock trial are going to be the centerpiece of the real trial. Make sure you know them inside and out.\nAthena:\nYes, sir, Mr. Justice!\nApollo:\nMr. Justice? Careful, I could get used to that.\nThe investigation\nAthena:\nApollo, any advice on how to investigate this case?!\nApollo:\nOh, uh... Start by interviewing people about the basic facts.\nAthena:\nInterview people! Got it! Hey, you there! What can you tell me about the--\nApollo:\nWhoa, hold on, Athena! The trial's tomorrow, so try to limit it to people with some relation to the case.\nAthena:\nOkay, got it! Limit the interview pool!\nApollo:\nRight... You might also want to take it down a notch, otherwise you'll be dead by tomorrow.\nAthena:\n(He wants me to calm down?! At a time like this?! Junie's fate rests in my hands. I just HAVE TO win this one...!)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nApollo:\nOh, nice. Your attorney's badge! That's the first thing you want to present when you meet someone new. I heard that's what all lawyers do.\nAthena:\nYou heard that? From whom?\nApollo:\nWho else, Mr. Wright. Just remember, your badge comes first! See, Athena! Check it out! This is my attorney's badge!\nAthena:\n(Ooh! That's so intense! I want to present mine like that, too!)\nThemis Herald\nApollo:\nA torrid love triangle? Juniper sure is popular with the guys.\nAthena:\nOf course she is. She's pretty, plus she has such a sweet and caring personality.\nApollo:\n.........\nAthena:\nI know what you're thinking. Why can't Athena be more like that, right?\nApollo:\nArgh! N-No, no! The thought never crossed my mind!\nAthena:\n(Let's see... Panic... Sorrow... Yep, that's exactly what crossed his mind. *sigh*)\nMock Trial Script\nApollo:\nThe mock trial was quite the heated battle.\nAthena:\nTsk, Mr. Wright didn't even hear me when I said I wanted to see it. That was so unfair. We should've done rock, paper, scissors to decide who got to watch. I know I would've totally beaten you.\nApollo:\nHow could you know that? The game's totally random.\nAthena:\nNo, I can tell you favor scissors. I mean, the proof's sticking right out of your head.\nApollo:\nHuh? What're you talking about?\nAthena:\n(Like I said, it's right there on your head!)\nAnything else\nApollo:\nYes! Nice one, Athena. Keep it up! I don't care if it's totally unrelated to the case or just plain annoying or even embarrassing. Just keep presenting evidence without any regard for others! That's the first step towards becoming a successful trial lawyer!\nAthena:\nLeave it to me! I'll one piece after another, and then another!\nOutdoor Stage (before clearing \"Rumor about the academy\" Talk option in Themis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway)\nPoliceman:\nHey, what do you think you're doing? The crime scene is off-limits to students.\nAthena:\nTsk, I'm no student. I'm a lawyer!\nPoliceman:\nYeah, right! Just because you're in law school doesn't mean you're a lawyer!\nApollo:\nYou should see what she did to the last cop who said something like that her.\nPoliceman:\nWhy you--! Are you threatening an officer of the law?!\nApollo:\nYikes! N-N-No, it's not a threat! It's more like a friendly warning!\nAthena:\n(...*sigh* Guess we should go before I get myself arrested for assaulting an officer.)\nWright Anything Agency\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nTrucy:\nA school festival? Why didn't you take me with you?\nAthena:\nOh, um... Only Mr. Wright was officially invited. Apollo and I are just tagging along, but we ARE lawyers, after all.\nTrucy:\nWell, my magic act would've made a great warm up for the mock trial. They'd have seen how even the most crucial evidence could vanish in the blink of an eye!\nAthena:\n(That's probably precisely why Mr. Wright didn't invite you.)\nThe academy\nTrucy:\nAthena, don't you think the Wright Anything Agency has about run its course?\nAthena:\nWh-What do you mean?\nTrucy:\nIsn't it obvious? It's time for the Wright Anything Academy! And you, Athena, I want you to be the head of our Psychology Department.\nAthena:\nOh... What other departments will we have?\nTrucy:\nWell, I'll be the head of the Magic Department... ...and we'll have a Chords of Steel Department and a Bluffing Department!\nAthena:\n(But then who'll be the head of the Toilet Cleaning Department?)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nTrucy:\nHey, that's an attorney's badge!\nAthena:\nPromise me you won't make it disappear.\nTrucy:\nAh! What a mean thing to say! Do I look like someone who'd do something like that?\nAthena:\nNo, I didn't mean it like that. Anyway, I hear they reissue badges that get lost, so...\nTrucy:\nHey, isn't that great! That means you have nothing to worry about!\nAthena:\nYeah! ...But seriously, please don't make mine disappear. I wouldn't want to have to explain.\nThemis Herald\nTrucy:\nHey, is that the morning paper?\nAthena:\nSomething like that. It's a school paper. I was thinking, your magic tricks would make a great article.\nTrucy:\nReally?! A newspaper article about my tricks? That would be so cool! The moment the interview starts, I'd suddenly disappear, shocking the interviewer! Without an actual interview, they could call the article, \"The Interview that Vanished\"!\nAthena:\n(I'll just leave it at that.)\nAnything else\nTrucy:\nWow, thanks, Athena! That'll make a great new prop for my magic act!\nAthena:\nHuh? But that's--\nTrucy:\nSo, what kind of trick should I do with it? Make it disappear? Burn it? Rip it in two?\nAthena:\nHa ha ha. Let's just save that fun little detail for later.\nTrucy:\nAww, you're no fun.\nOctober 24Themis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway\nAthena:\nAh, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nI heard they arrested your friend Juniper.\nApollo:\nYeah, Detective Fulbright just took her in.\nMeans:\nI refuse to believe that one of our students is capable of murder. We must prove her innocent by any means necessary! The end justifies the means!\nAthena:\nWhat do you mean, the end justifies the means?\nMeans:\nI, Prof. Means, always say what I mean, and mean what I say by all means! Here at our esteemed academy, we train our students to produce meaningful results. You believe in Juniper's innocence, do you not?\nAthena:\nOf course, I do! Junie wouldn't even hurt a fly!\nMeans:\nPrecisely. We have justice on our side. The only other thing we need are results. It is the height of folly to endanger your client by failing to pursue all means possible!\nAthena:\nUm... sure I want to prove her innocence, but... (I don't like the sound of that \"end justifies the means\" part.)\nMeans:\nWell, you are still young and idealistic. It's no wonder you fail to see the wisdom therein. There is but one thing to do now. I must personally take up Juniper's defense.\nPhoenix:\nYou're going to take her case, Prof. Means?\nMeans:\nI may be a professor, but I am still licensed to practice law. In fact, I have even battle Prof. Courte in... well... in court!\nApollo:\nNo kidding?! So you guys were rivals or something?\nMeans:\nNo, nothing of the sort. She was an esteemed colleague at the academy and in court. You see, both Prof. Courte and I graduated from this academy at the top of our class.\nAthena:\n(Wow, I bet they both used to really bring it.)\nMeans:\nNow, if you would excuse me, I had best go discuss the case with Juniper.\nAthena:\nProf. Means, please, wait! I didn't want to say anything, but Apollo and I already agreed to take her case.\nApollo:\nIt's true. Juniper is counting on us to prove her innocence.\nMeans:\nReally now? You two?\nPhoenix:\nAnd when were you planning on telling me?\nAthena:\nS-Sorry, Boss. I know we should've asked first, but...\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha. Relax. Your friend was just hauled away in front of your eyes. Sometimes you just have to make snap decisions. And I think you made the right one.\nMeans:\nHow wonderful! Very well, Athena Cykes, let me ask you just one thing. As a lawyer, what is it that you treasure beyond all else?\nAthena:\nHeh heh! That's an easy one, Professor! Seeking justice for my clients! (Changed from [Heh heh! That's any [sic] easy one, Professor! Seeking justice for my clients!] in the original release)\nMeans:\nWhat a wonderful answer. Juniper must be overjoyed to have a friend such as you. As her professor, I too, shall do whatever I may to help her. And if you decide to take the-end-justifies-the-means strategy, come see me at once!\nAthena:\n(Let's hope it never comes to that.)\nMeans:\nNow, if you would excuse me.\nPhoenix:\nWell, time's a wasting. You better start investigating and fast. But first, how about I tell you everything I know so far?\nAthena:\nYes, please!\nTalk\nAbout the murder\nAthena:\nHave you learned anything new about the case?\nPhoenix:\nActually, I ran into Prosecutor Gavin, and he told me something interesting. Seems the murder took place in the art room. There's traces of a large pool of blood there. So the police believe the body was moved from there to the stage.\nAthena:\nWhat? Really?! (Just like the mock trial again!)\nPhoenix:\nThe police are searching the art room, but whether they'll find anything, well...\nAthena:\nWell what? (Come to think of it...)\nPhoenix:\nLet's do our own crime scene investigation before it gets too crowded around here.\nAthena:\nHuh?! Are we even allowed to do that?\nPhoenix:\nIt's no big deal, as long as we leave it exactly like we found it. Plus... No, never mind.\nAthena:\n(Now, where was I again?)\nPhoenix:\nBut there's really no need to talk about it right here, right now. I want you two to find out for yourselves.\nRumor about the academy (appears after \"About the murder\")\nPhoenix:\nSo, were you shocked by your conversation with Prof. Means?\nAthena:\nOh, umm, I guess so. (Actually, that was pretty shocking.)\nPhoenix:\nThe dark age of the law... I'm sure you've heard those words before.\nAthena:\nSure, a number of times. Prosecutors file false charges and lawyers fight back by fabricating evidence. There's a lot of that going around these days.\nApollo:\nBut the question is, how is it related to the case at hand?\nPhoenix:\nTraining students to produce results... That is the school's policy.\nAthena:\nWell, that in and of itself isn't a bad thing.\nPhoenix:\nRight. ...As long as those results come by fair and honest means.\nAthena:\nOh, but what was it that Prof. Means said?! \"The end justifies the means\"?\nPhoenix:\nTo survive the dark age of the law, you must use any means necessary. Fabrication of evidence and false charges are unavoidable in the quest for results. That's what they're preaching here at Themis Legal Academy.\nAthena:\nB-But... What'll happen to our legal system if results are all that matter anymore?!\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha, relax. It's just a rumor. I'd take it with a grain of salt if I were you.\nAthena:\nOh, that's a relief. (He had me going there for a minute. Wait a second! What if Mr. Wright examined the victim's body for a reason! Maybe he was worried someone might actually tamper with the evidence!)\nPhoenix:\nI think that about wraps up what I know so far. The fact that this case closely resembles Ms. Woods's script is obviously important. Knowing that, you should probably try and identify what's the same and what's different.\nAthena:\nOkay! I'll try talking to as many people as I can on campus!\nRumor about the academy (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo, were you shocked by your conversation with Prof. Means?\nAthena:\nOh, umm, I guess so. (Actually, that was pretty shocking.)\nPhoenix:\nThe dark age of the law... I'm sure you've heard those words before.\nAthena:\nSure, a number of times. Prosecutors file false charges and lawyers fight back by fabricating evidence. There's a lot of that going around these days.\nApollo:\nBut the question is, how is it related to the case at hand?\nPhoenix:\nTraining students to produce results...

Maybe he was worried someone might actually tamper with the evidence!)\nPresent\nThemis Herald or Mock Trial Script\nPhoenix:\nThings like that sure scream out \"school days,\" don't they?\nAthena:\nWere you involved in any extracurricular activities like school papers or mock trials?\nPhoenix:\nNah, that wasn't my thing. I was an art major.\nAthena:\nAn art major? Then how did you become a famous attorney?\nPhoenix:\nIt's kind of complicated. And when I say, kind of, I mean really, really complicated.\nAthena:\nOh... (...He must really mean it. I'm picking up a lot of complex emotions in his voice.)\nAfter clearing \"Rumor about the academy\" Talk option in Themis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway:\nOctober 24Themis Legal Academy - 3F Lecture Hall\nAthena:\nLook, there's Hugh! Hey, Huuuuugh!\nO'Conner:\nOh, it's you two. Do you want something?\nApollo:\nDid you find anything? You said you were going to do some investigating of your own.\nO'Conner:\nNope, nothing yet. I'm afraid it's not looking very good for Juniper.\nApollo:\nYou don't really think Juniper could have done something like this, do you?\nO'Conner:\nOnly the author and the victim knew the contents of the script. Both the stage and the art room were in the exact same state as described therein. Nobody could mimic the crime like that unless they'd already read the script... or... wrote it.\nAthena:\nB-But!\nO'Conner:\nLook, Prof. Means is better able to handle this than you two, so just leave it to him!\nAthena:\n(There it is again. I'm picking up some discord in Hugh's voice.)\nTalk\nHugh O'Conner\nAthena:\nHugh, would you mind telling me a bit about yourself?\nO'Conner:\nHeh, whatever. I'm 6'1\" and under this uniform, I'm one hundred percent lean muscle. My grades are outstanding and I'm the ace of the Archery Club. Needless to say... ...I never miss my mark. Oh, and I'm incredibly humble, too.\nAthena:\n(How can he even say that with a straight face?)\nO'Conner:\nThose around me call me a genius, but I pay them no mind. But when it comes to tests... I always get a hundred percent, so I suppose it's only natural for them to say I'm a genius. But, as I said before, I pay them no mind.\nAthena:\n(I heard you the first time.)\nApollo:\nBut what about the mock trial? It sounded like you were about to lose to Robin.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. There's a very good reason for that. You see, right before the mock trial started... I saw the body.\nAthena:\nY-You saw the body?!\nO'Conner:\nRight, and I was so distraught that I basically handed Robin a victory.\nApollo:\nHugh, would you mind telling us a little more about that?\nDiscovering the body (appears after \"Hugh O'Conner\")\nO'Conner:\nRight before the mock trial, the campus was empty. Everyone was here in the Lecture Hall.\nYour attention please. This is an announcement from the Mock Trial Committee. The mock trial will begin shortly. All students and faculty please proceed at once to the Lecture Hall.\nAthena:\n(That's right... There was that announcement and the everyone came in here.)\nO'Conner:\nThe only exceptions were the mock trial participants. Juniper, Robin and I were in our personal dressing rooms next door.\nApollo:\nWow, your own personal dressing rooms? That's total VIP treatment.\nO'Conner:\nActually, they're for student-teacher meetings. They don't even have windows. The other two waited patiently in their rooms, but that's not my style. So, I headed over to the archery range on the other side of the quad. I did some meditation while I waited. That's the best way to relax. Then, just before the mock trial was about to start, I headed back toward the main building. As I walked across the quad, I passed in front of the stage.\nAthena:\nSo, that's when you saw the body?\nO'Conner:\nRight. It was quite a shock. As much as I hate to admit it, my legs were shaking. I could've easily beaten Robin if it hadn't been for that.\nApollo:\nWait, hold it right there. You went through with the mock trial even though you had just discovered a body? Why didn't you tell anyone? I mean, we're talking about someone getting killed here!\nAthena:\nI think I know why... Was it because of this?\nO'Conner:\nAh! Where'd you get that?!\nAthena:\nSo, this article in the Themis Herald IS true. The winner of the mock trial would get to make his confession to Junie.\nO'Conner:\nRight. But if I reported the body I'd found, the whole thing would be called off.\nAthena:\n(He really wanted to win that bad? Bad enough to ignore a dead body? Sorry, but that's not normal. ...Or could their love for Junie really be that strong?)\nApollo:\nThanks for sharing that important piece of information with us. It may prove useful at tomorrow's trial.\nO'Conner:\nGood. Because that's all I have to say about the matter.\nAthena:\nThanks. And don't worry, we'll prove Juniper's innocence, you'll see.\nO'Conner:\nHeh, I can't say you two inspire much confidence.\nApollo:\nOkay, Athena, what next?\nDiscovering the body (subsequent times)\nO'Conner:\nRight before the mock trial, the campus was empty. Everyone was here in the Lecture Hall.\nYour attention please. This is an announcement from the Mock Trial Committee. The mock trial will begin shortly. All students and faculty please proceed at once to the Lecture Hall.\nAthena:\n(That's right...

Sorry, but that's not normal. ...Or could their love for Junie really be that strong?)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nO'Conner:\nHeh. Your attorney's badge? Looks brand new. That just shows how inexperienced and useless you are.\nAthena:\nWell, when you get your badge, it will be new and shiny, too!\nO'Conner:\nHeh. You mouth-breathers just don't get it, do you? My badge will be a symbol of my genius. From the moment I get it... It will be chipped, bent, and worn as if it's been through a thousand courtroom battles.\nAthena:\n(He's like some hipster doofus.)\nArrow\nO'Conner:\nThat's from the Archery Club. We let the school use it for the mock trial. Never figured it would end up being used like it was.\nAthena:\nOf course, the real murder weapon isn't an arrow at all.\nO'Conner:\nI know. But the fact remains that it was used in this whole insidious plot. But a mouth-breather like you couldn't possibly understand. You see, archery is a sport that demands advanced mental focus. And the killer's actions have done harm to its image.\nAthena:\nI know exactly what you mean, except for that mouth-breather remark.\nO'Conner:\nWell, let's hope that someday you will because it couldn't be any more self-evident.\nAthena:\n(I like him less and less every time he opens his mouth.)\nCourte's Planner\nAthena:\nIs it just me or is this your name here?\nO'Conner:\nHeh, that's my name, but how should I know what it's doing there? But being that the whole campus looks up to me... ...I'm not surprised to find my name mentioned here and there.\nAthena:\n(And I'm not surprised he said that, being the narcissist he is.)\nThemis Herald or Themis Herald Extra\nAthena:\nSo, you really declared that you'd confess to Junie if you won the mock trial? (Because he's definitely not the shy type.)\nO'Conner:\nHeh. Yeah, well, that's just the genius that is me. My thoughts and actions are on a whole other level from you mouth-breathers.\nAthena:\n(No, it's your vanity that's on a whole other level.)\nMock Trial Script\nO'Conner:\n...I get it. This is your way of mocking my defeat. You like shoving people's shame in their faces. That's your modus operandi.\nAthena:\nNo, that wasn't my intention. Besides, you were never actually defeated.\nO'Conner:\nOh, I suppose you're right. ...Or is this a trick intended to provoke me.\nAthena:\nThat wasn't my intention, either!\nO'Conner:\nThen what WAS your intention?! I know! You're trying to toy with my emotions!\nAthena:\n(Wow, this guy can't take being humbled, old country style.)\nAnything else\nO'Conner:\nRandom junk from some mouth-breather? What makes you think I'd want to see that? Heh. The least you could do is make it more interesting, like by telling me how cool I am.\nAthena:\n(Who does this guy think he is?!)\nAfter clearing \"Rumor about the academy\" Talk option in Themis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway:\nOctober 24Themis Legal Academy - Maintenance Area\nAthena:\nSo this is the maintenance area. Let's see... During the mock mock trial, Prosecutor Gavin said... ...that the art room is right above here on the third floor... ...and that they body was dropped from there onto a high jump mat from the storehouse.\nApollo:\nRight. And then he claimed that the body was transported to the stage in a ball cart. And then... Hm? There's someone else here...\nAthena:\nHey, it's Robin!\nNewman:\nWhoooooooooa! You scared the crud outta meeeeee!!!\nAthena:\nYikes! Right back at you! ...So, what are you doing out here?\nNewman:\nI'm working out so that I can become strong enough to save Juniper! But I'm so worked up... my training brace is almost breaking at the seams!\nAthena:\nOh, right... The girl you like got arrested, so you're psyching yourself up to rescue her?\nNewman:\nYes! Because! I'm the manliest of manly men! ...That's why I work out with my manly brace!\nAthena:\n(Except that I hear some discord in that manliest of men's voice of yours...)\nApollo:\nI don't mean to be rude, but can't you talk without shouting?\nNewman:\nSorry! I'll try not to shout so much! If at all possible, that is!!!\nAthena:\n(...Which is \"not at all possible\" by the sound of it.) Um, so do you mind if I ask you some questions as Junie's lawyer?\nNewman:\nNo problem! Ask away! Keep 'em coming, maaaaaan!!!\nAthena:\n(Ouch... My ears ache already.)\nTalk\nRobin Newman\nAthena:\nRobin, could you tell me a little more about yourself?\nNewman:\nYou wanna know about meee?! I'm a second-rate member of the Fine Arts Cluuub!!!\nAthena:\nThe Fine Arts Club?\nAthena:\nLooks like broken pottery or plaster. Maybe this is the source of that noise we heard.\nPhoenix:\nHmm, there were supposedly two statues on this stage. I seem to recall hearing that a coed from the Fine Art Club had made them.\nKlavier:\nTwo big banners and a pair of wicked statues. This is just an illustration, but it's not half-bad.\nAthena:\nWicked statues...? Wait are these supposed to be you and Mr. Wright?\nKlavier:\nBingo, Fräulein. And they were so big and magnificent, too! What a terrible waste.\nAthena:\nSay... Did you create those stage statues by any chance?\nNewman:\nYou bet I did! Both of 'em! Put my blood, sweat, and tears into those things, maaan!\nApollo:\nIt must've been terrible seeing them all smashed up like that.\nNewman:\nNah! I couldn't face Prof. Courte if I let something like that get me down!!!\nAthena:\nWhat do you mean?\nNewman:\nProf. Courte was the Fine Arts Club advisor! She was all about truth and beauty, maaan!!! She always said, \"The only good result is the truth\"! That and... ...\"Only lawyers who seek the truth through legitimate means produce worthwhile results\"!\nAthena:\nYeees! I'm totally on your guy side! She must have been an incredible woman!!!\nApollo:\nYeesh, and you call ME loud when I practice my Chords of Steel...\nAbout the murder\nNewman:\nAw, maaaaaaaaan! Why'd I have to take the prosecutor course! I mean, how am I supposed to save Juniper if I'm studying to be a prosecutor?!\nAthena:\nDon't worry. I'll clear Junie's name, you'll see.\nNewman:\nThe three of us had a dream! We swore we'd make it happen TOGETHER!!! Prosecutor! Lawyer! Judge! The three of us would hold fair and honest trials! The dark age of the law? Ha! We were gonna put a nail in its coffin, maaaaaan!\nApollo:\nWow, you guys swore to do that?\nNewman:\nBut, noooo! That stupid school rule had to ruin it!\nAthena:\nSchool rule? Which one?\nNewman:\nAnyone with a prior conviction, no matter how minor the offense, they won't...! They won't be allowed to graduate from this stupid, holier-than-thou schoooool!!!\nApollo:\nA tough legal academy, with even tougher rules...\nAthena:\n(Junie will never become a judge unless I can prove her innocence. And if I fail, the three of them will never realize their dream. ...It's like someone put pressure on my pressure.)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nNewman:\nWhooooooa! Check out your badge!\nAthena:\nWhat do you think? Nice and shiny, huh?\nNewman:\nYeah! It's AWESOME!!! If the plating ever starts to peel or it gets all bent up, lemme fix it up for you!!!\nAthena:\nReally?! Thanks!\nNewman:\nNo problemo! I'll have some primo clay and glaze at the ready, just in case!!!\nAthena:\n(Wait, what does clay have to do with my badge?)\nThemis Herald\nNewman:\nAh! That paper!!!\nAthena:\nSo, Robin, is this article true?\nNewman:\nThe author of that article has been gunning for the three of us for some reason! It's been nothing but trashy articles like this as long as I can remember!\nAthena:\nHmm... Maybe the author just wants your attention?\nNewman:\nNo waaaaaaay, maaan! The venom in those articles is waaay beyond that!!!\nAthena:\n(Hmm, I wonder...)\nMock Trial Script or Themis Herald Extra\nNewman:\nWhoooa! Déjà vu, maaaaaan! It's like I can almost taste my near victory again! But noooooo!!! The final showdown was canceled because of that murder!\nAthena:\nThis topic sure seems to strike a raw nerve. I hope it doesn't come between you guys.\nNewman:\nYou kidding?! Our friendship...! It's like a diamond, only tougher!!! It's like a powder keg before a spark!!! It's like the calm before the storm!!!\nAthena:\n(In other words, it's under a lot of pressure and ready to blow at any moment...?)\nAnything else\nNewman:\nWhooooooa! Did you make that?! Lemme fire it in the kiln for you! Just give it to me and I'll take care of the rest!\nAthena:\nI think I'll pass on the kiln firing this time. (Phew, dodged a bullet there!)\nAfter clearing \"Rumor about the academy\" Talk option in Themis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway:\nOctober 24Themis Legal Academy - Outdoor Stage\nApollo:\nI thought the area was cordoned off. Hey, the police are discussing something over there.\nAthena:\nOoh, I know! I'll just quietly sneak over for a listen. Here goes...\nApollo:\nAh! Athena, watch where you're--!\nAthena:\nHuh? Eeeeeeeeek! Ouch! Who put this stupid box here? Wait............ Eek! A-A-Apollo! This box, there's...!\nApollo:\nWh-What now?\nAthena:\nTh-Th-There's! There's someone or... *gulp* something inside!\nApollo:\nDon't let it be a SNAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!\n???:\n............Sss, sss, sss. You morons just blew my cover.\nApollo:\nWhat the--? There really is someone inside...\n???:\nSss, sss, sss, sss, sss! That someone is me, Myriam Scuttlebutt.\nScuttlebutt:\nAnd I'm a senior in the judge course.\nAthena:\nWh-What's with the box?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. It's the fate of we who live in the shadows. There's a very good reason why none may see my face by the light of day!\nApollo:\nWait, if you're taking the judge course, did you write a mock trial script, too?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. You really want to see my script that bad? Well, you better watch out. Read it without my permission and you'll wish you hadn't!\nAthena:\n(Who cares? I'm sure it was rejected for a good reason.)\nTalk\nMyriam Scuttlebutt\nAthena:\nOh, so you're studying to be a judge, too? You must be classmates with Juniper. Are you a friend of hers?\nScuttlebutt:\nJuniper? Sss, sss, sss. Sure, she's my friend. That's why I'm gathering info. Now, tell me all you know. You know, for tomorrow's trial.\nAthena:\nFor tomorrow's trial? What are you talking about?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. I'm going to take the stand, naturally.\nAthena:\nSo, the witness for the prosecution is... some weirdo in a cardboard box?\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk! This disguise is how I get my scoops! ...But you're right. It's me. So tell me everything you know for Juniper's sake!\nApollo:\nW-Wait a second, Myriam. Repeat what you just said.\nScuttlebutt:\nA lawyer with brains as bad as his ears. Poor Juniper! I'm taking the stand tomorrow. Tell me everything you know for Juniper's sake. Clear enough for you this time?\nBRACELET THUMPS\nApollo:\nI thought so. Athena, my bracelet's reacting.\nAthena:\nReally?! That means...! (A lie, already? That was quick!)\nPresent Bracelet\nScuttlebutt:\nI'm taking the stand tomorrow. Tell me everything you know for Juniper's sake.\nPerceive tightening grip on box on \"for Juniper's sake.\"\nApollo:\nApollo:\nThat's strange. You suddenly tightened your grip when you said, \"for Juniper's sake.\" It's like you subconsciously tensed up because you're lying.\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk! Wh-What're you talking about?! When did I ever lie?!\nAthena:\nOkay, then let me ask you this... Why were you selected as a witness?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. That's an easy one. I'm the editor-in-chief of the Themis Herald. I know everything there is to know around campus, even the darkest of secrets.\nApollo:\nEditor-in-chief, huh? Pretty impressive.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, yeah well, it's a lonely, one-woman operation. I do it all myself, from reporting, to editing, to publishing. Still impressed? I'm a perfect storm of journalism because I bring it all to the table, sss, sss, sss, sss! ...And this is the evidence. Here! An extra edition of the Themis Herald, published to coincide with the mock trial!\nThemis Herald Extra added to the Court Record.\nAthena:\nThanks, Myriam. You've revealed who you truly are: Someone who's never had Junie's best interests in mind. (Changed from [As someone who's never had Junie's best interest in mind.] in the original release)\nScuttlebutt:\nWhat?! Are you questioning our friendship?!\nAthena:\nLook, you may want answers, but... No can do, because what you're saying conflicts with this piece of evidence.\nPresent Themis Herald\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"That's the Themis Herald, the paper I publish. What about it?\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! You just gave me an idea for an extra addition headline! Extra, Extra! \"Juniper Woods Headed for Conviction? Scatterbrained Attorney to Blame.\"\nAthena:\nScatterbrained? If I'm wrong, just say so.\nApollo:\nThere's nothing iffy about it. You're way wrong.\nAthena:\nUgh!\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss! Scatterbrained, scatterbrained! Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss! Now, out with it! Tell me everything you know for Juniper's sake!\nLeads back to:\n\"No can do, because what you're saying conflicts with this piece of evidence.\"\nScuttlebutt:\nThat's the Themis Herald, the paper I publish. What about it?\nAthena:\n...Are you really that dense? This article is full of malicious lies about Junie! It's definitely not something a true friend of hers would write!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk! Y-You got it all wrong! Another staff member wrote that one!\nAthena:\nI don't think so, Myriam. You even said it yourself just a moment ago. \"It's a one-woman operation.\" Or did you forget already?\nScuttlebutt:\nKaaahk kahk-kahk-kahk! If you'd just give me the info you have--! Stupid pawn! Juniper's just using you!\nLeads back to Talk options\nPerceive wrong area\nApollo:\nApollo:\nMyriam, your unease is betrayed by a little habit of yours.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! Think you can see through me with your silly little guesses? You're wasting your time! My box is impenetrable! Nobody sees the real me!\nApollo:\nGah... I blew that one.\nAthena:\nYou're completely boxed in now, Myriam! And Apollo's power is like a box cutter with x-ray vision! Prepare to be exposed!\nApollo:\nDon't exaggerate, Athena. I'm a lawyer, not a superhero.\nLeads back to Talk options\nMyriam Scuttlebutt (after perceiving)\nAthena:\nNow, I want the truth, Myriam! You hide in your box in order to collect gossip for your sleazy paper, isn't that right?!\nApollo:\nYou're not really friends with Juniper, are you?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. No duh! She's the target of my scoops, and my readers demand dirt! Extra, extra! \"The Dirty Little Secret of the Squeaky Clean Student Council President!\"\nAthena:\nDirty little secret...? All right, what are you planning to say in court, huh?\nScuttlebutt:\nI'm a witness to her part in the crime. I'm going to tell it all in a shocking exposé! The end justifies the means. That's my brand of tell-all journalism!\nAthena:\n(The end justifies the means? Wait a second!)\n\"End justifies the means\" (appears after \"Myriam Scuttlebutt\")\nScuttlebutt:\nIn this dark age of the law, many of us embrace Prof. Means's methods, even future judges. I've even adopted an end-justifies-the-means brand of journalism, which includes... ...tape recorders secretly hidden all over our campus... ...secretly recording every last word without anyone being any the wiser!\nAthena:\n(Doesn't she realize that's totally illegal?!)\nScuttlebutt:\nAnd one of them was at the scene of the crime -- the art room!\nApollo:\nYou put a tape recorder in the art room? What did it record?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. You wanna know? You really wanna know?\nAthena:\nYes, please! That's so nice of you to--\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! Like I'd really tell you now! The big scoop comes out in court tomorrow!\nAthena:\nTsk! You're so mean, Myriam!\nScuttlebutt:\nAccording to my evidence, a fatal fissure had opened between the three of them.\nAthena:\nWho? Junie, Hugh, and Robin? And what do you mean by fatal fissure?\nA rift in the trio (appears after \"\"End justifies the means\"\")\nScuttlebutt:\nJuniper, Hugh, and Robin used to be the best of friends.\nAthena:\nUsed to be? They still seem to get along fine to me. (I did sense some discord, though.)\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. You don't know anything. Prof. Means has his followers and Prof. Courte had hers. Their influence is inescapable!\nAthena:\nAre you implying that one of them adheres to that extreme idea you and Prof. Means have? (But why would anyone follow that philosophy?)\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. How could you possibly understand. You're new around here.\nApollo:\nMyriam, wouldn't you feel better if you came out of the dark and into the light?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. I can see fine in here. You'll be the ones seeing the light in court tomorrow. (Changed from [Sss, sss, sss. I can see fine in here. You'll be the one's [sic] seeing the light in court tomorrow.] in the original release) Then you'll realize how guilty Juniper Woods really is! Sss, sss, sss! Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss!\nAthena:\nUgh. We're going to have to cross-examine her tomorrow, but I don't know where to start. (Changed from [Ugh. We're going to have cross-examine [sic] her tomorrow, but I don't know where to start.] in the original release)\nApollo:\nWell, let's at least take care of whatever we can today.\nAthena:\nYou're right. Let's see what else we can find out!\nA rift in the trio (subsequent times)\nScuttlebutt:\nJuniper, Hugh, and Robin used to be the best of friends.\nAthena:\nUsed to be?

Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss!\nPresent\nThemis Herald\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! I love this newspaper! The paper quality, the printing method, the smell of the ink... Could it be more perfect?!\nAthena:\nUmm... Is it really that amazing?\nScuttlebutt:\nMeh! You just don't get it, do you?! Toilet paper, hamster cage lining, window wiper! My paper is so awesomely versatile!\nAthena:\n(Am I to understand that the contents run the entire spectrum of fecal matter as well...?)\nMock Trial Script\nScuttlebutt:\nMy script was way more popular than Juniper's.\nAthena:\nReally? Wow, was that the majority opinion?\nScuttlebutt:\nYep. My behind-the-scenes maneuvers, threats, and deceptions worked like a charm.\nAthena:\nMyriam, this may come as a surprise to you, but that's called \"cheating.\"\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. Says you. I didn't break the law. Besides, the end justifies the means. That's what they teach us here.\nApollo:\nApparently, some people are already thriving in the dark age of the law.\nAnything else\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! If you wanna give me a present, slip it through a hole in my box. Or if it's too big, you can open the top and gimme it that way! So, which way is it gonna be? Sss, sss, sss!\nAthena:\n(Either way creeps me out.)\nAfter clearing \"Discovering the body\" Talk option in Themis Legal Academy - 3F Lecture Hall, clearing all Talk options in Themis Legal Academy - Maintenance Area, and clearing \"A rift in the trio\" Talk option in Themis Legal Academy - Outdoor Stage:\nAthena:\nWell, I think I've talked to everyone who is somehow linked to the case.\nApollo:\nOkay, maybe it's about time we wrapped up our investigation.\nAthena:\n...Oh, wait. We haven't met with Junie yet.\nApollo:\nYeah, you're right.\nAthena:\nLet's head over to the detention center.\nOctober 24Detention Center - Visitor's Room\nWoods:\nTh-Thena. Thank you so much for coming.\nAthena:\n(She called me \"Thena,\" like she used to. Maybe she's finally letting her guard down.)\nTalk\nThe script\nAthena:\nJunie, the crime's unfolding exactly like your script. Any idea what's going on here?\nWoods:\nWe wanted to make it fair, so the script was kept secret until the day of the mock trial. And the only people who knew the details were Prof. Courte and I.\nAthena:\n(Hmm... Nothing we haven't heard already so far.)\nWoods:\nHowever...\nAthena:\nYes?! What is it, Junie?\nWoods:\nWell, there was this one article in the school paper.\nApollo:\nYou mean this one? It's more like a tabloid piece than a newspaper article, if you ask me.\nWoods:\nI've... been worried that the trial would wreck the friendship between Robin, Hugh and me.\nAthena:\n(She wants to stay friends, but both of the guys are hoping to take it to the next level. Oh, the passion of high school drama...! Wish I could've experienced it...)\nWoods:\nAnd I know I shouldn't have, but... I revised the script to favor the prosecution. But Prof. Courte noticed it immediately and changed it back.\nAthena:\n(Ahh, so if Robin had won, Hugh wouldn't have been able to confess his love to Junie. That would've kept the trio's relationship the same. Never knew Junie could be so devious.)\nWoods:\nSorry. I guess my personal problems won't be of any help in court, huh?\nApollo:\nYou never know. Help often comes from the most unexpected places. Thanks, Juniper.\nThe awl\nAthena:\nI was wondering about that awl you had on you when you were arrested.\nPoliceman:\nDetective Fulbright! We found this in the suspect's pocket!\nFulbright:\nHm? Wh-Why there's...! There's blood on this!\nWoods:\nTh-That's evidence we made for the mock trial!\nFulbright:\nA mock... trial? Never heard of such a thing, but it sounds fishy to me! Real fishy!\nWoods:\nIt was the murder weapon from the mock trial. Prof. Courte and I were prepping it in the art room until the day before the trial. I didn't even realize I still had it on me until I was arrested.\nApollo:\nThen we've nothing to worry about. There shouldn't be any way to link it to the crime.\nWoods:\nStill, that blood-red color on the awl bothers me.\nAthena:\nWasn't it just paint or something? I mean, I was looking at it from pretty far away, but...\nWoods:\nIt probably was just paint, but that's what bothers me. It wasn't on the awl when we were prepping it yesterday.\nApollo:\nIt wasn't? Then how and when did it get there?\nWoods:\nWell, before the mock trial began, I showed Thena and Mr. Wright to the waiting room... ...then I went back to my dressing room to get the trial props we were going to use. That's when I found the art room key and the awl with what looked like blood on it.\nAthena:\nA key... and the awl?\nWoods:\nProf. Courte normally has the art room key since she's the Fine Arts Club's advisor. And since that key was there in the dressing room... ...I thought she was the one who had painted the awl to look like it had blood on it. After all, she always insisted that the props should be realistic, so...\nAthena:\nThe awl suddenly shows up on the day of the trial with what looks like blood on it? I have a really bad feeling about this.\nApollo:\nMe, too. But let's not jump the gun on this.\nMock trial prep work (appears after \"The script\" and \"The awl\")\nLeads to:\n\"You and Prof. Courte were busy preparing for the mock trial together yesterday, right?\"\nPresent\nStage Costume\nWoods:\nUm... I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't go around showing that to everyone.\nAthena:\nHow come? I mean, it's so well made. Aren't you going to wear it when you sing?\nWoods:\n*sigh*... Yes, unfortunately, I've been chosen to sing. But I don't think I'm up to the task.\nAthena:\n...Reminds me of the old Junie when you talk like that. Makes me want to protect you.\nWoods:\nI can't let you do that. After all, I'm Student Council President! It's my job to look after our entire student body.\nAthena:\nSo what if you took that can-do spirit and applied it to your singing?\nWoods:\n*sigh*... But we're talking about me singing in front of a huge crowd.\nAthena:\n(Maybe she is in over her head.)\nMock Trial Script or Themis Herald Extra\nWoods:\nI wish the mock trial had ended better than it did...\nAthena:\nYeah, but to have three good friends all play leading roles? It's pretty amazing if you think about it.\nWoods:\nThat's true. And it's thanks to the strength of our friendship. There's nothing we can't do if we help and support each other.\nAthena:\nI don't know... Is that really the issue here? (But whenever I bring it up...)\nWoods:\nYes, that's what it's all about! The friendship between the three of us is absolute!\nApollo:\nAthena, it's obvious that they're friends, so let's leave it at that.\nAthena:\nYes, I know that, but... (Her words seem kind of forced.)\nAthena:\nYou and Prof. Courte were busy preparing for the mock trial together yesterday, right? Was that the last time you saw her?\nWoods:\n...Yes. I left school at around 6:00 PM.\nApollo:\nDid you notice anything different about her?\nWoods:\nNo, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. She looked and acted the same as always. I would've never guessed she'd end up like this. It looks like we're about out of time. Thank you for coming to see me.\nAthena:\nWe'll do everything we can to prove you innocent tomorrow.\nWoods:\nI know. And I believe in you, Thena. Well, I should go now. Bye.\nApollo:\nIs she gonna be all right? She's like a shadow of the girl we met back at the academy.\nAthena:\nThe Junie I knew was always like that -- a little weak and sickly. But the fact that she's lifted her façade shows that she trusts us. Even still...\nApollo:\nWhat is it?\nAthena:\nWell, when Junie and her two friends were talking about their friendship... ...I sensed some discord in their hearts.\nApollo:\nSeriously?\nAthena:\nYeah, but it was really faint. I might've been mistaken. (There's no reason to doubt their friendship... is there?)\nApollo:\nDon't worry, everything will be fine! You and Juniper are friends, right? You know that friend I mentioned to you earlier? Well, get this. Whenever something's troubling one of us, the other can just feel it. That's real friendship.\nAthena:\nI suppose you're right... Might as well forget about that and concentrate on the trial!\nApollo:\nYup! Tomorrow's the big day. Let's sort out what we know so far.\nAthena:\nOkay! The victim Prof. Constance Courte was murdered in the art room on the third floor. Then, her body was moved to the outdoor stage in the quad. Also, the location where we found the body was just as the mock trial script described.\nApollo:\nI wish those were the only similarities they shared.\nAthena:\nWhat do you mean?\nApollo:\nWhat I mean is the script and this case are exactly the same in almost every respect. So it follows that the actual trial may very well unfold just like the mock trial did!\nAthena:\nOh, no! (The mock trial ended right before the prosecution was about to win! Well, that's not gonna happen! This time, Junie WILL be declared \"not guilty\"! Of course, I intend to get our results the honest way. We can do this! We'll be fine! After all, I have Apollo and he's the king of being fine.)\nTo be continued\nNothing to examine during investigation\nAthena:\nThere's really not much of interest here. At least, that's what my intuition tells me.\nTurnabout Academy\nImage Gallery\nTranscript\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nOctober 25, 9:47 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3\nAthena:\n(Ugh. My butterflies have butterflies in their stomach.)\nApollo:\nSo, what's it like to have your very own case for the first time?\nAthena:\nMy heart hasn't raced this fast since I ran that full marathon last year.\nApollo:\nIf it keeps up, you might get a lawyer's high -- you know like a runner's high?\nPhoenix:\nRelax, everyone's nervous their first time.\nMeans:\nSo my fears weren't unfounded. After all, today's prosecutor is so terribly brutal... ...and willing to use any means necessary to win a conviction.\nAthena:\n(There's that the-end-justifies-the-means concept again.)\nMeans:\nNow that it has come to this... ...we have no choice but to fight fire with fire. The end justifies the means.\nAthena:\n(I wish he'd stop saying that.) That's your method, Professor. I'm going to defend Juniper in my own way.\nMeans:\nBut, Ms. Cykes. Just yesterday you told me...\nMeans:\nAs a lawyer, what is it that you treasure beyond all else?\nAthena:\nHeh heh! That's an easy one, Professor! Seeking justice for my clients!\nMeans:\nBut if this trial proceeds in the same manner and ends in the same way as the mock trial... ...would you not lose everything you've worked so hard to gain?\nAthena:\nWell, I'll just have to make sure that doesn't happen, then, won't I!\nMeans:\nMy, but aren't you a stubborn one. Well, I suppose you will have to learn of your own inefficacy the hard way.\nAthena:\n(Grrrrrrr...)\nApollo:\nForgive me, Prof. Means, but can we just leave it at that?\nMeans:\nOh, dear, please forgive me. It's just, I wish to protect Juniper by any means I can.\nAthena:\n(I do, too, but...)\nMeans:\nNow, if you would excuse me...\nAthena:\nUgh! Thanks to him, I'm feeling even more pressure than before.\nApollo:\nDon't let it get to you, Athena. And don't forget to keep smiling.\nAthena:\nI'll be fine! And I haven't forgotten what Mr. Wright said! \"The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles.\"\nBailiff:\nThe trial is about to begin. I'll show you to the courtroom if you please.\nPhoenix:\n...Apollo, I'm counting on you to support Athena this time.\nApollo:\nOkay, Mr. Wright! Leave it to me!\nAthena:\n(That's right. I have Apollo to back me up. Junie's fate rests in my hands. I won't rest until she walks free!)\nOctober 25, 10:00 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4\nDay 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Juniper Woods.\nAthena:\nA-Athena Cykes, d-defense team leader, is ready, Your Honor!\nApollo:\nThat didn't sound very confident. You sure you're okay?\nAthena:\nI'll... I'll be fine!\nBlackquill:\n...Your Baldness.\nJudge:\nI know, I know. As usual, you want me to deliver the opening statement. Agh!\nBlackquill:\nThis case is crystal clear. I see no need to explicate it any further. ...Now, summon the witness.\nJudge:\n.........\nBlackquill:\n.........Is there something the matter? Please do share, Your Baldness.\nJudge:\nWh-Whatever gave you that idea?! Bailiff, please call our first witness!\nAthena:\n(And now we don't even get an opening statement...?)\nAthena:\n(Detective Fulbright... He and Prosecutor Blackquill have become quite the team.)\nBlackquill:\n.........\nFulbright:\nOh, right! The case brief! Leave it to me! Yes, let the detective in charge, everyone's favorite friend of justice, explain!\nApollo:\nWhat was THAT just now...? It's like he and Blackquill are totally in sync.\nAthena:\nWell, I don't think they're capable of mind melding, if that's what you're thinking.\nJudge:\nAll right, Detective Fulbright. Would you please explain the case to the court?\nFulbright:\nProf. Courte's body was discovered on October 24th at approximately 2:30 PM. She was murdered with this awl I have here! The victim's blood and the defendant's prints were both discovered on it!\nAwl added to the Court Record.\nAthena:\nEEEK!\nCourte's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nApollo:\nWow, that bird can deliver evidence, too? Blackquill has trained him well.\nAthena:\nMaybe Blackquill should train it not to mess up people's hair while he's at it.\nFulbright:\nMoving right along! The body was discovered on the outdoor stage, although no blood was found there! However, we detected traces of a massive amount of blood in the third floor art room. In short, the murder took place in the art room!\nJudge:\nSo, then the body had been moved from the art room to the stage?\nFulbright:\nPrecisely! And there is one more piece of irrefutable evidence! A recording made by a tape recorder that a school paper reporter hid in the art room! It captured a female voice screaming, \"You're a goner!\"\nJudge:\nWhat's this?! You have such a recording?!\nApollo:\nMust be from that tape recorder Myriam mentioned.\nAthena:\n(But why is this the first we've heard of a death threat at the moment of the murder?)\nFulbright:\nShhhhhh! Silence, please! I would like to play the tape for you now.\n.................................... ...You're a goner!\nJudge:\nHmm... It is quite hard to hear.\nAthena:\n(But the voice does sound female...)\nTape Recorder added to the Court Record.\nFulbright:\nThe noise and low volume of the voice have made voiceprint analysis all but impossible.\nJudge:\nThen, you haven't identified the voice as belonging to the defendant.\nFulbright:\nNot so fast. After all, voiceprint analysis isn't everything! The victim was killed at night, then discovered in the afternoon the next day. The question is... when was the body moved!\nJudge:\n............Oh, oh! I know! It could've been moved in the middle of the night when no one was around!\nFulbright:\nSorry, but no! The campus was full of students that morning. However, no one reported seeing a body. That means the body was moved sometime before the mock trial when all the students... ...and faculty were gathered in the Lecture Hall and the rest of the campus was empty! It was during this time Hugh O'Conner, one of the mock trial participants, found the body.\nAthena:\n(So the prosecution heard about Hugh seeing the body...)\nJudge:\nWait one moment. If all of the students and faculty were gathered in the Lecture Hall... ...then there wouldn't have been anyone who could've moved the body!\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! Have no fear, for there is always an exception.\nJudge:\nAn exception?\nFulbright:\nThe three mock trial participants were standing by in individual dressing rooms. They were the only ones who had free access to the deserted campus before the mock trial.\nJudge:\nWhat?! Then that would mean...! ...What would that mean?\nFulbright:\nThose three students were the only ones who could've moved the body! In justice we trust!\nApollo:\nI don't like where this is headed, Athena.\nAthena:\nMe neither...\nFulbright:\nAnd by those three, I mean... ...Hugh O'Conner, Robin Newman and Juniper Woods.\nAthena:\nI knew it... (Please, Detective Fulbright... Don't say what I think you're about to say...)\nFulbright:\nIn justice we trust! I take it EVERYONE understands now! The voice believed to be that of the murderer was female! And out of the three people who could've moved the body, just one is a girl. That leaves the defendant Juniper Woods as the only possibility!\nAthena:\nNoooooooooooooooo!\nApollo:\nImpressive. He has you on the ropes even before any cross-examinations.\nAthena:\n(You could at least pretend to be upset for me.)\nBlackquill:\nA splendid job, Fool Bright. That could not be any clearer. Feel free to anticipate a salary raise next month.\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha ha! I don't do this for the money. It's all about justice! In justice we trust!\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Not only a halfwit, but a perennial stick-in-the-mud you are.\nAthena:\n(I guess neither the carrot nor the stick works on Detective Fulbright.)\nJudge:\nNow, Bailiff, please bring our next witness to the stand.\nScuttlebutt:\n.........\nJudge:\nSo... our first witness... is a cardboard box?\nScuttlebutt:\n......... Kaaahk! Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss...! Stealth mode deactivated!\nJudge:\nOh, my! The box has hands!\nScuttlebutt:\nSmile, Your Honor. Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss, sss!\nJudge:\nWhat the dickens?! I've just had my picture taken!\nScuttlebutt:\nMyriam Scuttlebutt. Senior at the legal academy. I'm a reporter on the judge course. Juniper's been a bad, bad girl. I'll tell you all about her crime, sss, sss, sss!\nJudge:\n...Umm, might I ask whether you could come out of that box?\nScuttlebutt:\nHow will I get any more scoops if I blow my cover? So, the answer is no. After all, covert action is an undercover reporter's bread and butter!\nJudge:\nHmm... But testimony from a faceless witness is highly irregular.\nBlackquill:\nA former ninja I met in the clink said that exposing those who work in the shadows... ...is to pass the death sentence upon them.\nJudge:\nOh, my! I had never thought of it that way. Very well, if it would spare a life, I'll make a special exception this time.\nAthena:\n(A former ninja in prison? Holy shinto! How can the judge believe this load of crock?!)\nJudge:\nNow, your testimony please. Oh, but take care not to reveal your face.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Similarity of the Case and the Script --\nScuttlebutt:\nThe murder happened exactly like Juniper's mock trial script.\nUp until the mock trial began, only Prof. Courte and Juniper knew the script's content.\nBut Prof. Courte's sudden decision not to use the script sparked Juniper's murderous rage.\nJuniper has to be the killer. She has a motive and the murder is just like her script.\nJudge:\nThe murder is just like her script?! Could such a thing be true?!\nScuttlebutt:\nCompare her script with the murder case and crime scene photos. Then you'll see!\nBlackquill:\nThis is so simple, even an ape posing as a decrepit old judge could understand. Only the victim and the defendant were privy to the script. Ergo, the defendant is the killer. Furthermore, in the art room where the crime supposedly occurred, this witness's script... ...along with an envelope on which \"Use\" was written were found. This proves that the accused's script had been rejected the day before the mock trial. She pressed the victim to use her script, an argument ensued, and then the fatal stabbing.\nAthena:\n*gulp* (That makes perfect sense. What now?!)\nApollo:\nProsecutor Blackquill has all his ducks lined up in a row. He's really on a roll now.\nAthena:\nUgh. He's like a pit bull once it sinks its teeth into you.\nScuttlebutt:\nHow dare she! My script had it all! A bum rap and phony evidence! Grudges and betrayals!\nJudge:\nHmm... I trust the defense is ready to cross-examine the witness?\nAthena:\nN-No problem! I-I mean, yes I'm ready... I think... (Time to find a hole in her testimony, and unbox the truth! I've seen it done over and over. I know I can do this!)\nCross Examination\n-- The Similarity of the Case and the Script --\nScuttlebutt:\nThe murder happened exactly like Juniper's mock trial script.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThere must be places where the script and the case diverge!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk! Don't sweat the details! That kind of stress will give you wrinkles!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nI'm not worried. My skin is as fair as silk.\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\n...Hmph. Indeed, you are quite fair -- fairly desperate!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nWh-What did you just say?!\nApollo:\nHa ha ha. Blackquill really turned that one around on you.\nAthena:\nTsk, whose side are you on?! Hurry up and think of a clever comeback!\nApollo:\nWhoa, easy there, Athena.\nBlackquill:\nNow you listen to me. The two cases do, indeed, have their differences. For one, the stage hadn't yet been erected in the mock trial script. And in the actual case, there were signs indicating the victim's wrists had been bound. But such differences pale in comparison to the host of similarities. In any event, replicating the crime without knowledge of the script is an impossibility.\nAthena:\nHmmm... (Looks like I won't be passing this off as a coincidence.)\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! What a total burn! Try again, why dontcha, Pawn of Woods?\nScuttlebutt:\nUp until the mock trial began, only Prof. Courte and Juniper knew the script's content.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nSomebody could've stolen a peek beforehand!\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! I don't think so. I mean, I tried any number of times.\nAthena:\n(Shame on you, Myriam!)\nScuttlebutt:\nBut that crafty she-devil Juniper has eyes in the back of her head! What chance does your average person have if an undercover reporter like me failed?!\nAthena:\n(Interesting point. Still...) Ms. Scuttlebutt, won't you get in trouble later for admitting to such underhanded tactics?\nScuttlebutt:\nWhy, you...! I plead entrapment!\nAthena:\n(How is you blurting out your own crime entrapment?!)\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk... But you haven't scooped me yet! They were all set to use Juniper's script...\nScuttlebutt:\nBut Prof. Courte's sudden decision not to use the script sparked Juniper's murderous rage.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nHow do you know that Professor Courte wasn't going to use her script?\nBlackquill:\nHmph. There in the art room where the heinous crime took place... ...an envelope marked \"Use\" and Myriam Scuttlebutt's script were found. Evidently, the script that was going to be used belonged to the girl in the box over there.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! It's only natural that my script would be accepted and hers rejected. I introduced all sorts of brand-new concepts, including bribery and fake evidence! It was a cutting-edge script portraying a courtroom battle in the dark age of the law!\nAthena:\n(I can't help but feel Prof. Courte went out of her way NOT to use it.)\nScuttlebutt:\nBut Juniper... She used some devious, underhanded tactics to get her script chosen. That's why her script, and not my masterpiece, was used in the mock trial! How's that for an explanation?\nScuttlebutt:\nJuniper has to be the killer. She has a motive and the murder is just like her script.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nAnyone who saw the mock trial could have recreated the crime! After they saw the mock trial, they could've easily staged the body just like the script.\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\n.........Hmph. Weary is the trial which pits hawk against canary.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nWh-Wh-What did you just say?!\nApollo:\nHa ha ha. If he's so weary, he should try hmph-ing less. I bet that'd save some energy.\nAthena:\nThis is no time for jokes, Apollo! He just called me a canary!\nApollo:\nDon't let him get to you. At least canaries pick up on things quickly, just like you.\nBlackquill:\nI shan't repeat myself, so listen carefully, Cykes-dono. Hugh O'Conner discovered the body before the mock trial even began. How could one stage the body as it is in the script before anyone knew its contents?\nAthena:\nGah... That's right...\nBlackquill:\nDo you even fathom the intricacies that go into staging a crime scene? No, I think not. You have the rudimentary mind of an elementary school child.\nAthena:\nElementary school?!\nScuttlebutt:\n\"Reporter's Testimony Throws Attorney Athena Cykes for Loop!\" The perfect caption!\nJudge:\nHow marvelous! A photo in the newspaper is just the thing to boost your brand.\nAthena:\n(In a school paper? Seriously?)\nAthena:\n(Anyone can see the similarities between the script and this case. But that doesn't mean Junie's the killer!)\nApollo:\nI know it's frustrating, Athena, but we don't have much to go on at this point. All you can do is relentlessly press the witness and hope you find a hole.\nAthena:\nOkay, got it! (Press relentlessly! Right!)\nAfter pressing first and fourth statements:\nJudge:\nI believe you've pressed the witness more than enough, Ms. Cykes.\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Now do you see how clear-cut my case is? Take it now, and in that fair, desperate mind of yours... ...etch it deep so you may never forget!\nAthena:\nN-No... Nooooooooooooooo! (Even my arguments get thrown back in my face. It wasn't supposed to be like this. What am I going to do?)\nApollo:\n...Athena. You should just about have all the answers you've been looking for now.\nAthena:\nHuh?\nApollo:\nThink about it this way: If the killer knew the details of the mock trial... ...would they really commit the crime in the exact same way?\nAthena:\nI don't follow.\nApollo:\nTry to place yourself in the killer's shoes. I bet you'll discover an inconsistency if you do.\nAthena:\n.........Ah! I get it! Thanks, Apollo! Ms. Scuttlebutt! Just so we're clear, you're claiming... ...that the killer INTENTIONALLY made the crime scene just as it was in the script... ...and that it is beyond the shadow of a doubt NOT a coincidence. Is that correct?\nScuttlebutt:\nNo duh! After all, it's just more evidence of Juniper's evil she-devil ways.\nAthena:\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk! Wh-What'd I say, what'd I say?!\nAthena:\nOur client made the crime scene look just like the script, something known only to her? That would be not just foolhardy, but completely irrational!\nScuttlebutt:\nWh-What do you mean?\nJudge:\nYes, Ms. Cykes. Please tell this court what you mean by \"irrational.\"\nAthena:\n(It wouldn't make any sense for Junie to mimic her own script on purpose because it would...)\nMean leaking the script\nAthena:\nIntentionally making the crime scene look like the script... ...would expose the secret script for all to see!\nScuttlebutt:\nSo?! Juniper's a ruthless she-devil! She'd easily do that and a lot more to achieve her evil designs!\nJudge:\nHmm... Does the defense care to offer a counter-argument?\nAthena:\nNo, I'm good. Moving right along...\nJudge:\nJust one moment. Here in court, we have a special gift for intentionally evasive lawyers.\nAthena:\nI want a refuuuund! (Ugh. There's something obviously wrong with this whole set-up.)\nLeads back to:\n\"It wouldn't make any sense for Junie to mimic her own script on purpose because it would...\"\nMake her the culprit\nLeads to:\n\"The murder scene was the same as it was in the mock trial script.\"\nNot be possible\nAthena:\nHere's the thing. The mock trial details were kept secret. In short, there was no way our client could've known what was in the script!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Have you forgotten who penned the script?\nAthena:\nOf course I didn't forget! Our client wrote--! Er... whoops.\nJudge:\nTo say that the script's own author didn't know the details is quite a stretch, Ms. Cykes.\nAthena:\nEeeeeek! (Ugh. I think I need to find an explanation that actually makes sense.)\nLeads back to:\n\"It wouldn't make any sense for Junie to mimic her own script on purpose because it would...\"\nAthena:\nThe murder scene was the same as it was in the mock trial script. That in and of itself is irrational!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk-kahk! What's wrong with them being the same?!\nJudge:\nYes, Ms. Cykes. Care to explain what you mean?\nAthena:\nOkay, let's say for argument's sake, that Ms. Woods is the killer. If so, then... ...what reason would she have to intentionally make the actual murder mimic her own script?\nScuttlebutt:\nThat's easy! She was admitting that she was the-- Ah!\nAthena:\nThat's right. If she had really done that... ...it would've been like proclaiming to the world that she was the killer! So, what we ACTUALLY have here is evidence of someone trying to frame our client!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk... Kaaahk kahk-kahk!\nAthena:\nThe body was found on the day of the mock trial, in short, the day the details were revealed. So it would be completely inconceivable for the murder to go exactly like the script!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk-kahk! Don't let it go to your head just yet!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\n...Hmph. It would seem Justice-dono's comrade in arms has finally drawn her sword. However, the blade is dull, and it shall remain so until you master its use.\nAthena:\nE-Enough with the stupid sword metaphors, already!\nBlackquill:\nThere is a perfectly good reason for the inconsistency of which you speak.\nAthena:\nR-Reason? What reason?\nBlackquill:\nMust I spell out everything? Hmph, you are what people today call \"high maintenance.\" The accused had intended to stop the mock trial. And in that event... ...nary a soul would have been the wiser to the similarities of the case and script.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nNo! The mock trial was only stopped after the body was accidentally discovered! (Changed from [No! The mock trial was only stopped after the body was accidently [sic] discovered!] in the original release)\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Our witness here had also discovered the body. In fact, she was led to our dearly departed professor by the accused herself.\nAthena:\nWh-What?! Ms. Scuttlebutt saw the body, too?!\nBlackquill:\nPrecisely. And with the discovery of the body, the mock trial ought to have been canceled.\nAthena:\nWait, so you didn't call the police?!\nScuttlebutt:\nNope! I kept it secret for my big scoop!\nAthena:\nY-You can't do that!\nBlackquill:\nHmph. I made her pay long and hard penance for her sin. Did I not, my little box top?\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk! Compared to the work of a war correspondent, the sheer terror of that was-- Aaaaaaaaagh!\nApollo:\nJeez, I wonder what the Twisted Samurai did to her.\nAthena:\n...Block off all the holes in her box... ...and spin her like a top while Detective Fulbright cackled in delight?\nApollo:\n...That sounds more nauseating than scary.\nBlackquill:\nEnough jabbering. Witness! Continue your testimony!\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss, sss... Sure, Mr. Samurai. I'm ready to finish off that she-devil!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What Scuttlebutt Saw --\nScuttlebutt:\nI snuck into Juniper's dressing room while everyone was in the Lecture Hall.\nJuniper had changed into her stage costume. I asked her, \"What are you doing?\"\nWhen suddenly, she fled into the hallway, as if she wanted me to follow her.\nI followed her all the way to Prof. Courte's body! She led me right to it!\nI'm positive it was Juniper because she was wearing the costume that she had made!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nWhy did you withhold such key testimony?!\nScuttlebutt:\nKaaahk! Wh-What's that supposed to mean?!\nApollo:\nA-Athena! You haven't even started your cross-examination.\nAthena:\nI know, but her testimony points to her as being a potential suspect!\nApollo:\nWell, I don't think Prosecutor Blackquill is-- No, wait, I bet he's already thought of that.\nAthena:\nThe witness left the Lecture Hall to sneak into Ms. Woods's room before the mock trial. That means she, too, could have moved the victim's body!\nScuttlebutt:\nKaaaaaahk!\nAthena:\nThe prosecution's claim no longer has any ground to stand on! Heeeeeelp!\nBlackquill:\nNow, now, no need to ruffle your own feathers so. When you squeak like a little brat, it agitates Taka. Do you want him to peck your eyes out?\nWidget:\nNo, thanks!\nBlackquill:\nYou listen here. The witness has a perfectly good alibi.\nScuttlebutt:\nOh, yeah, I do! Around the estimated time of death... ...I was at undercover reporter class. It's right near my home!\nAthena:\n(Undercover reporter class?)\nBlackquill:\nThe proverbial rug has been pulled from under you. The witness could not be the killer.\nJudge:\nThe defense must look before leaping -- or at least make sure the rug's secured to the floor.\nApollo:\nI tried to warn you.\nAthena:\nOooh...\nBlackquill:\nWell, there ends the cross-examination. Let's allow the witness to step down.\nAthena:\nHuh? N-No, wait a minute...\nBlackquill:\nThe defense has no right to cross-examine the witness after that little spectacle. For whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.\nAthena:\nUgh. (Why can't he say, \"You reap what you sow\"?)\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well, if the cross-examination is over, I suppose the witness may go home. Perhaps spend some time in her lovely box and recover from today's stressful events.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! Don't you worry about me, Your Honor! There's no rest for the wicked... or journalists, either! My third eye's always eyeing a scoop!\nApollo:\nShe's always eyeing a scoop...?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! Well, back to the trenches! Buh-bye!\nApollo:\nApollo:\nNot so fast, Ms. Scuttlebutt!\nAthena:\nA-Apollo?\nApollo:\nThere's... just one thing I'd like to ask. Did you take a picture of the victim's body, and if not, why not?\nScuttlebutt:\nI, well... that is... No... I-I didn't take one.\nApollo:\nWell, that's strange... Why wouldn't you take a picture if you're always eyeing a scoop?\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk!\nApollo:\nDid you or didn't you really see the victim's body?!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk! Er... it's not like I, uh... actually SAW it, saw it, but...\nBlackquill:\nWhat the devil?!\nApollo:\nDid you hear that, Your Honor? The witness didn't actually see the body! That completely overturns the prosecution's claim that the witness was led to it!\nBlackquill:\nJustice-dono! You dare bare steel at me again?!\nScuttlebutt:\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss, sss! Nice try, boy wonder! So what if I didn't see the body? The fact remains that Juniper led me there. Feast your eyes on this!\nApollo:\nWhat exactly am I looking at here?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! It's a crucial moment forever frozen in time by my third eye. A photo clearly showing Juniper Woods! Kaaaaaahk!\nBlackquill:\n...Why did you not tell me of this?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. It's a shocking scoop I was saving for just the right moment. And that would be now, right here in court. Surprise! Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss. Kaaaaaaaaaaaahk! What'd I do, what'd I do?! All journalists keep their scoops secret until the right moment!\nApollo:\nShe's pretty brave hiding it from Blackquill like that.\nAthena:\nOr pretty stupid. ...Well, this is an unexpected turn.\nApollo:\n...Um, Athena? About this picture... See how it only shows the back of the subject?\nAthena:\nAh! So, then...!\nApollo:\nRight, who knows whether this photo Juniper in the first place!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph. A completely irrelevant point. What IS relevant here is... ...there was someone who did try to lead the witness to the body. Take a gander at this -- the route by which the accused escaped. The witness pursued the accused this way, after she fled the dressing room. The accused descended to the first floor and exited to the quad. Then what, Carton Cretin?\nScuttlebutt:\nThen I... tripped and fell. Caught my knee on my own box.\nAthena:\n(She stayed under the box, even while running after someone? Sounds difficult...)\nBlackquill:\nRecall that the body was already there, for Hugh O'Conner had already seen it. She was trying to show someone the body because she wanted to stop the mock trial!\nAthena:\nHrgh!\nApollo:\nApollo:\nBut if the facts have changed, that's all the more reason to cross-examine the witness!\nJudge:\nHmm... The defense has a point there. Very well, you may proceed with your cross-examination.\nBlackquill:\nHmph! It seems Justice-dono has saved your pretty little hide, missy. ...For now, at least.\nApollo:\n...Whew. Guess I pulled that off somehow.\nAthena:\nThanks, Apollo. You're a lifesaver.\nBlackquill:\nIncidentally, my compliments to the witness for her very fine box.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss, sss! It's primo cardboard, lovingly selected from among many-- Kahk!\nBlackquill:\nTell another lie or hide another fact from me... ...and I shall put it to the torch!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk... Kaaaaaahk! P-P-Please, anything but that!\nJudge:\nI think it would be more eco-friendly to recycle it, but that's just me. All right, Ms. Cykes. You may cross-examine the witness.\nCross Examination\n-- What Scuttlebutt Saw --\nScuttlebutt:\nI snuck into Juniper's dressing room while everyone was in the Lecture Hall.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nYou said you snuck in, but why would you do something like that?!\nScuttlebutt:\nBecause if I got a big scoop on Juniper, club membership would go through the roof! Right now, the Newspaper Club only has one member, me. The club's history once I'm gone. So, the Themis Herald's brand recognition is a matter of life and death!\nApollo:\nHer means may be questionable, but her motive is surprisingly sound.\nScuttlebutt:\nExtra, extra! \"Students seeking the Thrills and Chills of Exposé Journalism, Report to the Clubroom!\" This has been a paid advertisement. Anyway, where was I...?\nAthena:\n(Huh. Never took Myriam for such a go-getter.)\nScuttlebutt:\nJuniper had changed into her stage costume. I asked her, \"What're you doing?\"\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nWhy would she change into that costume? The mock trial was about to begin.\nScuttlebutt:\nHow should I know? But if you don't believe me, take a look at this photo! I captured this critical moment like the gonzo journalistic pro that I am.\nAthena:\nBut, this only shows the back of whoever was fleeing.\nScuttlebutt:\nYou expect me to shoot her face when she's running away from me?\nAthena:\nI guess you're right, but... (This doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere.)\nScuttlebutt:\nAt any rate, as this photo shows, Juniper was in her stage costume.\nScuttlebutt:\nWhen suddenly, she fled into the hallway, as if she wanted me to follow her.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThat doesn't mean you had to chase her.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! Call it a journalist's instinct! I see something fishy, I go after it!\nAthena:\nBut you never did catch up to her, did you?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss! A true undercover journalist gets up and dusts herself off when she stumbles!\nAthena:\nThat reminds me. Didn't you fall during the chase? When you tripped on your box?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! A true undercover journalist is always ready to stumble over a great story!\nAthena:\nSure are a lot of holes in your story. Or is that just the Scuttlebutt brand of journalism?\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk-kahk! A true undercover journalist always prevails against her adversaries!\nScuttlebutt:\nI followed her all the way to Prof. Courte's body! She led me right to it!\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nWhat would our client have to gain from leading you there?\nBlackquill:\nThe accused had employed her self-penned script as a manual for murder. Ergo, she had to stop the mock trial before the script's details became public. And that accounts for her desperate attempt to lead our carton cretin here to the body.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nBut, as we all know, Ms. Scuttlebutt didn't alert the authorities. And as a result, the mock trial began as scheduled!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nThe issue here is not whether it was, in fact, halted. The fact remains that the accused was trying to lead the witness to the body. Does that not show clear intent to halt the mock trial?\nAthena:\nArrrgh!\nScuttlebutt:\nI'm positive it was Juniper because she was wearing the costume that she had made!\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nYou say it was our client because the figure you witnessed was wearing her costume. Isn't that a bit simplistic?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! It's only as simple and clear-cut as a good piece of journalism should be!\nAthena:\n......... (Sure it's simple, but I'd hardly call it clear-cut.)\nScuttlebutt:\nThat's why I chased her, sss, sss, sss, sss!\nPresent Stage Costume\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Scuttlebutt's sole basis for identifying our client as the figure in this photo...\"\nAthena:\nShe keeps saying that it was Junie, but she didn't even actually see the body.\nApollo:\nYeah, but Blackquill's assertion takes that into account.\nAthena:\nSo, even if I press her on never seeing the body... ...I won't be able to overturn this testimony.\nApollo:\nWell, whoever it was that was fleeing, Myriam never did see their face. So, I'm wondering why she thought it was Juniper. Try thinking along that line and see what you can come up with.\nAthena:\nMs. Scuttlebutt's sole basis for identifying our client as the figure in this photo... ...is the fact that it shows someone in Ms. Woods's stage costume.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. Well, it IS Juniper's costume. So that must be Juniper in it. It's clear-cut.\nAthena:\nNo, that's where you're completely mistaken!\nScuttlebutt:\nWhaaat?!\nAthena:\nThis is a design drawing of our client's stage costume.\nJudge:\nOh, my, what a wonderful creation! The constellations are extraordinary.\nAthena:\nI'm glad you noticed, because those stars are precisely what's important here. In the drawing, there are constellations all over the outside of the costume. But there's not a single star on the costume in the photo!\nJudge:\nO-Oh, then that means... Uh... What exactly?\nAthena:\nYour Honor, there were no other blue costumes at the scene. Which leads me to believe... ...that the figure in the photo was wearing our client's costume inside out.\nJudge:\nHmm... But why would Ms. Woods make a mistake like that?\nAthena:\nWell, it's not really a matter of why... ...but rather, who made the mistake of putting it on inside out.\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk... W-Wait, you're not suggesting...!\nAthena:\nThat's right. I'm glad you're catching on. The costume's designer wouldn't put her own costume on inside out!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk! Kaaaaaaaaaahk!\nAthena:\nSorry, Ms. Scuttlebutt, but... ...doesn't believing you had a scoop when you really didn't make you a failure as a reporter?\nScuttlebutt:\nA f-failure as a r-reporter?! Kahk-kahk-kahk. Kaaahk kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk! Ack! ...Ah!!!\nAthena:\nWhy hello, Ms. Scuttlebutt! So nice to meet the woman beneath the box!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk! Y-- You didn't see nothing!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nNow, I would have you stop right there, Cykes-dono. For it is the why of the matter upon which I would have this court focus.\nAthena:\nWhat do you mean?\nBlackquill:\nMs. Juniper Woods!\nWoods:\nYes?!\nBlackquill:\nWhat were you doing on the morning of the mock trial?\nWoods:\nI was in my dressing room, *cough* painting my costume in fluorescent paint.\nAthena:\nFluorescent... paint?\nWoods:\nMy design drawing shows twinkling stars on the costume. *cough* *cough* I was going to make the costume shimmer like that by painting the inside fluorescent.\nJudge:\nFluor... what was that again? Fluoride? Did your costume have cavities?\nWoods:\nNot fluoride -- fluorescent, as in glowing. The paint would make it glow in the dark. *cough*\nBlackquill:\nYes, yes, so you applied that to the inside of the costume. And then?\nWoods:\nI let it dry for a while because I heard it takes a long time. So I put the costume on my mannequin inside out.\nAthena:\nInside out...? So, then...\nBlackquill:\nThis is a photograph of the inside-out costume taken in the dark. As you can see, there is a heavy layer of paint over the entire inside surface. If someone were to properly don this costume in this state... ...the wet paint would get all over their body.\nJudge:\n...Why, yes! I believe it would!\nBlackquill:\nIndeed. Ergo, the costume was worn the way it was, not by anyone's mistake... ...but because this was the way it was on the mannequin -- inside out!\nAthena:\nGah!\nGlowing Costume Photo added to the Court Record.\nApollo:\nFigures he would have a photo.\nAthena:\nUgh. Did we just fall into his trap?\nApollo:\nYeah, I bet Blackquill had it all planned out. Still, I think you should give this photo a nice, long look.\nAthena:\nOh, please tell me you found something that doesn't add up.\nApollo:\nCheck out the chest area. It kinda looks like handprints to me. (Changed from [Check out the chest area. It kinda looks like a hand print to me.] in the original release)\nAthena:\nHey, you're right! But Junie would know better than to touch it while the paint was still wet.\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nI believe the term to describe your thought process is wishful thinking. After all, if master painters make mistakes, why not a rank amateur such as the accused?\nAthena:\nAthena:\nSo basically... you're saying, my claim requires evidence to back it up?\nApollo:\nEvidence? That shouldn't be a problem, right? After all, you've come this far.\nAthena:\nJust because I've come this far, that doesn't mean I've thought everything through, though...\nApollo:\nWhat?! You mean you've just been bluffing?!\nAthena:\nWhat did you expect me to do?! I'm sick of losing to this guy! But you're right... There's only one thing left to do at this point! And that's to present some evidence! Pronto!\nBlackquill:\n............A showdown, is it? I gladly accept!\nAthena:\n(The fluorescent paint must have stuck to the hands of whoever touched the costume. And that paint should glow in dark places... So, I just need to carefully check every last piece of evidence!) This piece of evidence shows who touched the costume!\nPresent Themis Herald Extra\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"A school newspaper?\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nBlackquill:\n.........\nJudge:\nIt seems Prosecutor Blackquill is not too pleased with your off-target evidence.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nOr is it so on target that it's rendered him speechless?!\nJudge:\nHmm... Let's ask him what he thinks. Prosecutor Blackquill?\nBlackquill:\n.........\nJudge:\nAs I thought. My initial suspicion was correct.\nAthena:\nGah hah! (Now I'M speechless...) Please! I think I've got it this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"The fluorescent paint must have stuck to the hands of whoever touched the costume.\"\nJudge:\nA school newspaper?\nBlackquill:\n...Interesting.\nAthena:\nTake a look at the photo where the lights are dimmed and the spotlight is on Ms. Woods. Observe Mr. Newman's hand in that photo as he stands at the prosecutor's bench. As you can see, it's glowing, just like Ms. Woods's fluorescent paint.\nJudge:\nHmm... It is glowing -- quite brightly I might add.\nAthena:\nBut why would he put fluorescent paint on his hand for the mock trial, you may ask? The answer is he wouldn't -- not on purpose. It got there when he put the costume on.\nJudge:\nOh...? I mean, oh! That means...! ......What again?\nAthena:\nIt means the figure photographed in the costume was not our client Juniper Woods. It was her classmate, Robin Newman!\nJudge:\nWHAAAAAAAAAT?!\nApollo:\n...To think you were actually able to prove that...\nAthena:\nWell, you never know what's going to happen next. That's the thrill of the courtroom!\nApollo:\nHmm... So, then... ...does that mean that Robin is our man...?\nAthena:\nHmm... Well... That's certainly how it looks...\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Very well, Robin Newman it is! He is here in the gallery, I trust? Show yourself! I challenge you to a duel!\nJudge:\nWill the witness please state his name and occupation.\nNewman:\nIIIIIIIIIII'M ROBIIIIIIIN NEWMAAAAAAAAN!!! I want to become a great artist! I practice day and night!!! YEAAAAAAH! NOOOOOO! That's not it! Art's gotta be sincere, maaaaaan!!!\nJudge:\nSo, for occupation, should we put down ...budding artist?\nNewman:\nNOOOOOO! Themis Legal Academy! Senior! PROSECUTOR COOOURSE! This brace is proof of my masculinity! I've been training to be a prosecutor for eighteen years! (Changed from [This brace is proof of my masculinity! I've been training to be a prosecutor for 18 years!] in the original release)\nJudge:\n*ahem* I assume you will be cleaning up the pottery you smashed before you leave today.\nNewman:\n.........Aaaaaaaaagh! AWWW, MAAAAAAAAAN!!! Aaaaaaaaagh! Aaagh...\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems the witness has finally settled down.\nAthena:\n(I guess nothing fazes the judge after all these years.)\nJudge:\nYou may proceed with your testimony, Mr. Newman. Specifically, the court wishes to hear why you had fluorescent paint on your hand.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Why I Touched the Costume --\nNewman:\nI went to see Juniper in her dressing room! BUT SHE WASN'T THERE!\nWhen I walked by that frilly costume, I was like, whoaaaaaa!!!\nThe mannequin it was on! IT WAS ABOUT TO FALL ON ME!!!\nI got that paint on me when I caught it!\nBut I never put it on! That's just STUUUPID!!!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nYour Honor! I recommend a short therapy session for the witness.\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Newman does seem particularly agitated, but...\nNewman:\nAgh! ...Arrrgh! Aaaaaaaaagh! Nooooooooooooooo!\nApollo:\nNot again. What's his problem?\nAthena:\nI sensed it the moment Robin took the stand. ...The discord in his heart!\nApollo:\nSo, you think he might be hiding something?\nAthena:\nProbably! You ready, Mr. Newman? Let's see what the Mood Matrix can do for you!\nNewman:\nI went to see Juniper in her waiting room!\nNewman:\nBUT SHE WASN'T THERE!\nNewman:\nWhen I walked by that frilly costume, I was like, whoaaaaaa!\nPinpoint Happy marker\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"When you mentioned the stage costume...\"\nNewman:\nThe mannequin it was on! IT WAS ABOUT TO FALL OVER!!!\nNewman:\nI got the paint on me when I caught it!\nNewman:\nI never put it on! That's just STUUUPID!\nAthena:\nHe had to catch the mannequin as it suddenly started to fall over?\nApollo:\nEven I can guess this one. The most natural response would be surprise.\nAthena:\n(Apollo's right, so maybe I should try focusing on some other emotion.)\nAthena:\nWhen you mentioned the stage costume... ...I sensed a sudden, powerful feeling of joy. Would you care to explain, Mr. Newman?\nNewman:\nW-W-Wait?! WHAAAAAAT?! Wh-Why would a frilly scarf-thing and a long skirt make me feel like that?!\nAthena:\nI don't know, but you seem awfully interested in that costume for some reason. You didn't happen to put it on, did you?\nNewman:\nL-Like I'd be into that kinda thing! I'm a dude! And I'm into braces! (Changed from [L-Like I'd be into that kinda thing! I'm a dude! I'm into braces, not dresses!] in the original release)\nApollo:\nYou don't think... Robin's actually got a thing for Juniper's outfit... do you? (Changed from [You don't think... Robin likes girls' clothes... do you?] in the original release)\nAthena:\nOh, come on! Isn't it obvious?!\nApollo:\n...You're enjoying this a bit too much, Athena.\nNewman:\nNO WAY, MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN! The mannequin came falling toward me, so I stuck out my hands to stop it! End of story!!!\nAthena:\nThat's a new piece of information! Time to run an update! (Hmm... Even after that update, something just doesn't feel right here. Do I have anything that could prove his statement contradicts what really happened?)\nPresent Glowing Costume Photo\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"You said the mannequin came falling toward you, so you stuck your hands out to stop it.\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThis piece of evidence clearly shows the contradiction in your statement!\nNewman:\nNo way, maaaaaan! The only contradiction that thing shows... ...is your existeeeeeeeeeeeeence!!!\nAthena:\nUgh! (I-I object to that statement! Okay, so... Maybe I should compare when he caught the mannequin against the evidence.)\nLeads back to:\n\"Do I have anything that could prove his statement contradicts what really happened?\"\nAthena:\nYou said the mannequin came falling toward you, so you stuck your hands out to stop it. If so, then then fingers of your hands would've been pointing outward like this. But that's not what the handprints show. In fact, this looks more like just your thumbs and the base of your palms.\nNewman:\nWh-Why in the world would I leave such weird handprints?\nAthena:\nYou know why! You left them when you went to adjust the scarf after putting it on. Just like the model in this drawing!\nNewman:\nWHOOOOOOA!\nAthena:\nWhy don't you admit it, Mr. Newman? You DID put the stage costume on, didn't you? And you really DO like Ms. Woods's clothes, don't you? (Changed from [And you really DO like frilly clothes, don't you?] in the original release)\nNewman:\nFine! I admit to putting the costume on! BUUUUUUT! I DON'T LIKE GIRLY CLOTHES, MAAAN!!!\nNOISE LEVEL90%\nAthena:\nYes! New information to plug in! Time for another update!\nNewman:\nI snuck in, knowing the costume was in there!\nNewman:\nMy heart was pounding, even though I'm a guy.\nNewman:\nThen I saw it! It was even more amazing than I'd imagined!\nNewman:\nI was like, WHOAAA! I'm a guy, but I got all excited!\nPinpoint Sad marker\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"There! Another emotion that doesn't fit.\"\nNewman:\nIt's true! I did put on girly clothes!\nPinpoint Sad marker\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"There! Another emotion that doesn't fit.\"\nNewman:\nBut it was strictly for artistic purposes!\nAthena:\nHopefully, we can figure out what Robin's hiding based on this new information.\nApollo:\nJust hope it's not more than we bargained for, although that usually seems to be the case.\nAthena:\nThere! Another emotion that doesn't fit.\nNewman:\nSo what?! You're really starting to get on my nerves, maaaaaan!\nAthena:\nMr. Newman, you got excited when you put the costume on... ...but you also felt sad.\nNewman:\nWho cares if I felt sad?! It's no big deaaaaaal!\nAthena:\nOkay, Mr. Newman, out with it! Why did you feel sad?! You're hiding something, aren't you?!\nNewman:\nOoh! Nooooooooo!\nAthena:\nYou're not fooling anyone anymore. Now, tell us why you were sad!\nNewman:\nOKAAAAAY, FIIINE! If you're gonna be that way, I'll tell you!!! The reason I felt sad is... is... is...!!! No matter how much I dress up, I'll never be as pretty as Juniper!!!\nApollo:\nWell, no offense, but his habit of shouting at the top of his lungs... doesn't exactly help... (Changed from [Well, no offense, but for one thing, he's a guy -- and a real hothead at that.] in the original release)\nNewman:\nNOOOOOOOOOOOO! THAT'S NOT IIIIIIIIIIT! I totally owned those girly clothes! I should've been totally pretty!!! BUT! BUT! THERE'S SOMETHING THAT KEEPS GETTING IN MY WAAAAAAY!!!\nAthena:\nWow! That's a whole lot of anger and raw emotion right there! His heart is crying out in pain -- his emotions are out of control!\nApollo:\nOut-of-control emotions...! We saw those during the Nine-Tails Vale incident. (Changed from [Out-of-control emotions...! We saw those during the Nine-Tales [sic] Vale incident.] in the original release) So, all we have to do is find the source of his uncontrollable anger, right?\nAthena:\nRight. Help me look for a conflict between his statements and the images we see. If we can find that we can wrestle him away from whatever's tormenting him. (Mr. Newman said that there's something \"getting in the way\" of him being pretty. Something that doesn't go with \"girly clothes\"... But what could it be?)\nNewman:\nFINE! I'LL TESTIFY, MAAAAAAN!!!\nNOISE LEVEL85%\nNewman:\nI snuck in, knowing the costume was in there!\nNewman:\nMy heart was pounding, even though I'm a guy.\nNewman:\nIt's true! I felt a powerful feeling when I saw that long frilly scarf.\nNewman:\nI admit it! I wore girly clothes!\nNewman:\nI felt like a diva when I pulled the hood over my head!\nProbe Brace\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Newman, you feel a great deal of anger toward your brace, don't you?\"\nNewman:\nIt felt so right I was totally dressed up like a girl!\nProbe Brace\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Newman, you feel a great deal of anger toward your brace, don't you?\"\nApollo:\nSo, we're looking for the source of his anger?\nAthena:\nRight. The conflict in his testimony will most likely arise from his emotional repression. Let's compare the images to his testimony! We might find the problem that way!\nAthena:\nMr. Newman, you feel a great deal of anger toward your brace, don't you? Is that what you feel is holding you back from being as pretty as you think you should be?\nNewman:\nHuh? Wh-Wh-Wh-WHAAAAAAT?!\nAthena:\nMr. Newman! The truth is, you really want to take that brace off, don't you?\nNewman:\nNo way maaan! This is a symbol of masculinity! I could never take it off!!!\nAthena:\nIs it that you can't take it off, or that you don't want to take it off?\nNewman:\nAw, maaaaaaaaaaaan! I shoulda kept my big mouth shut!!!\nAthena:\n......... (This is really weird. He exhibits intense anger toward his brace, which he calls a \"symbol of masculinity\"... ...but he can't take it off, not even when he's trying to look pretty. (Changed from [...but he can't take it off, even when dressing like a girl.] in the original release) What could be at the root of his complicated relationship with his brace? (Changed from [And why is he so interested in girls' clothes in the first place?] in the original release) I have a feeling we're on the verge of uncovering an earth-shattering secret.)\nApollo:\nAthena? You okay?\nAthena:\nIt seems Robin is still hiding a secret. A big one.\nApollo:\nBigger than the fact that he's secretly jealous of Juniper's looks? (Changed from [Bigger than the fact that he likes to wear girls' clothes?] in the original release)\nAthena:\nYes, at least I think so. ! (No, it can't be! I just thought of something, but it's totally insane!) Mr. Newman!\nNewman:\nWh-What?!\nAthena:\nI'm on to your little secret. And if I'm correct, it's not very little at all. It's huge! This sounds completely insane, but it's the only possibility left.\nYou want to be pretty like a girl (Changed from [You like girls' clothing] in the original release)\nAthena:\nRobin Newman! You want to be as pretty as you feel! (Changed from [Mr. Newman! You like to dress like a girl!] in the original release)\nNewman:\nThat's right! And I'm never gonna change! I'll show you how real men cross-dress!!!\nAthena:\nYou will? (Now???)\nApollo:\nAthena, we already know he likes to cross-dress. This line of discussion is a dead end.\nAthena:\n(And yet, he can't take that \"symbol of masculinity\" off... (Changed from [But if he really likes to dress like a girl, you'd think he'd want to...] in the original release) ...even when it clashes with his ideal self-image. Wait, could this mean...? (Changed from [...take that 'symbol of masculinity' off when he does it. Wait, could this mean...?] in the original release))\nLeads back to:\n\"This sounds completely insane, but it's the only possibility left.\"\nYou hate girls\nAthena:\nYou don't like girls, do you?\nNewman:\nWhat?! Whaaaaaat?! WHAT GAVE YOU THAT IDEA?!\nAthena:\nOh... Then, what? You like girls?\nNewman:\nI-I-I! I refuse to answer thaaaat!\nApollo:\nAthena, you're not asking just of curiosity, are you?\nAthena:\nWhat? N-No, of course not! (Better try something else.)\nLeads back to:\n\"This sounds completely insane, but it's the only possibility left.\"\nYou're a girl\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Newman, or should I say... Ms. Newman...\"\nAthena:\nMr. Newman, or should I say... Ms. Newman... You are and always have been a girl!\nApollo:\nWhat?! Have you lost the plot, Athena?!\nAthena:\nNo, I'm completely serious. I don't have any direct evidence. But that's what Robin's heart is shouting out, loud and clear!\nApollo:\nApollo:\nI still think you've totally lost it! I mean, Robin reeks of testosterone! How could he possibly be a she?! I, for one, have never seen a girl who shouts like a maniac all the time!\nNewman:\nOoh. Ooh hoo hoo. Ooooooh.\nJudge:\nI've seen plenty of witnesses in my day... ...but if he's a she, then she's the most convincing actress I have ever encountered. Therefore, let me pronounce my verdict. Robin Newman is without question... a man!\nNewman:\nOoh. Ooh hoo hoo. Ooooooh. Ooh hoo hoo.........\nBlackquill:\nYou are now truly Justice-dono's equal in one area. You are just as equally insane! Never in the history of this planet has there been a finer specimen of the masculine spirit.\nNewman:\nNewman:\nOooh... AAAAAAAAAAAAGH! IF YOU GUYS ARE DONE TALKING ABOUT MEEEEEEEEEEE!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAGH! I'M...! I'M...!\n.................. ............Heh... Ha ha! Ah ha ha ha ha ha! Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!\nAthena:\nAhhhhhhh! The brace! It's...!\nNewman:\nMs. Cykes... No, allow me to call you \"Athena.\" I wanted to keep this a secret at all costs! But noooo!\nApollo:\nWh-- No waaaaaaaaaaaay!\nBlackquill:\nGnnnaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! .........S-Surely this must be some kind of jest?\nNewman:\nEh heh heh, nope, it's for real. I'm a girl, body and soul. If you don't believe me, I'll give you a P-E-E-K.\nBlackquill:\nAaaaaaagh!\nNewman:\nAs if! Ah ha ha ha ha!\nAthena:\n(What an amazing transformation.) Well, all the discord is gone. The image is now complete!\nNOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYE\nNewman:\nI was raised as a boy since I was little, and I studied law just as my parents wanted. But now, this living lie that had me pinned to the ground, it's...! Aaaaaagh! *huff* *puff* It's been blown to smithereens by you, Athena! Now I can stop pretending I want to be a prosecutor! I'm gonna be an artist! Yaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!!! What a shocking development. He really DID turn out to be she!\nNewman:\nEek! Why's everyone looking at me like that?! Tee hee! I feel like a movie star or something! But no paparazzi please! I value my privacy, O-K-A-Y? RAAAAAAAAAWH! No pics or you'll regret it, maaaaaaaaaan!!!\nApollo:\nAm I just imagining things, or is Robin even more hyper now than when she was a he?\nAthena:\nI don't know. Maybe it's because she finally got her troubles off her chest, literally.\nJudge:\nThis is all well and good, but does he being a she actually change anything?\nAthena:\nThe fact that the witness is a girl does change things. Because there is now a piece of evidence that we must re-evaluate!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well, let's see what the defense has for us now. What piece of evidence must we reconsider now that we know that the witness is a girl?\nPresent Tape Recorder\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"This is what I'd like the court to reconsider.\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThis piece of evidence must be reconsidered because Mr. Newman is really Ms. Newman!\nJudge:\nHmm... Please do explain.\nAthena:\nYes, Your Honor. You see, I feel that if you have a sharp eye and an open mind... ...you can discover something completely new in the most obvious of places!\nJudge:\nHmm... Yet, the defense's statement reflects anything but those two admirable traits.\nAthena:\nEeek! (Guess that won't fly! But I know we have some sort of evidence that could be seen differently based on sex.)\nLeads back to:\n\"What piece of evidence must we reconsider now that we know that the witness is a girl?\"\nAthena:\nThis is what I'd like the court to reconsider.\nJudge:\nOh, the tape recorder -- the one that recorded the threat, \"You're a goner!\"\nAthena:\nThat's right. And we have already established that it's a female voice in the recording. Of all the students who could've moved the body before the mock was to start... ...our client was the only female if you exclude Ms. Scuttlebutt because of her alibi. And that is why the tape recorder made our client the prime suspect.\nJudge:\nAh... So then...!\nAthena:\nThat's right! The witness just revealed that she's a girl! Therefore! If we are using the voice in this recording as the basis for hurling accusations... ...this witness must be labeled a suspect, too!\nNewman:\nOh... Oh, noooooo!\nApollo:\nWow... Talk about a sudden turn of events. You've done it. You've found a hole in one of the prosecution's key pieces of evidence.\nAthena:\nYeah... But, wow, that was a lot of work for a single one.\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nNot so hasty, now. You're forgetting that only one person here was privy to the script. Ergo, Ms. Juniper Woods is still the prime suspect!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nBut Ms. Newman hid the fact that she was a girl, both at the crime scene and in court! I'd say that puts her in Camp Suspicious!\nNewman:\nEek! That's not nice, Athena! How can you accuse me of being a killer? I mean, I'm just a weak, innocent little girl! Just thinking about murder makes me--\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph! Suspicious is as suspicious does. Undoubtedly, the witness does have some sort of connection to this crime. Perhaps our newfound lady is merely feigning ignorance. We can surmise that she lent support to the principal offender, Juniper Woods. By leading Ms. Scuttlebutt to the body, that would make her an accessory to the crime.\nNewman:\nHow can you say that?! I'm not an accessory to any crime, Mr. Birdman!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\n...B-Birdman...? In any event, with the witness as an accessory, it explains quite a bit, does it not?\nAthena:\nAthena:\n............Argh! (He made it all make sense somehow! And he'll keep accusing Junie unless we can show someone else knew the script's details. But how could someone have gotten their hands on that kind of info? The only way they could've known what was in the script was if they...)\nSaw the mock trial\nAthena:\nNothing could be more simple. All anyone had to do was watch the mock trial.\nBlackquill:\n.........\nApollo:\nBut Athena, the murder took place before the mock trial even began.\nAthena:\nOof, that's right.\nBlackquill:\n.........\nJudge:\nI believe Prosecutor Blackquill wishes to penalize you, Ms. Cykes.\nAthena:\nYeowch! (What is this, Athena the Piñata Day?)\nLeads back to:\n\"The only way they could've known what was in the script was if they...\"\nHeard it from Junie\nLeads to:\n\"Sorry, Junie, but...\"\nHad penned the script\nAthena:\nI've got it! All anyone has to do is write their own script! In a completely stream-of-thought, devil-may-care way!\nJudge:\nI'm not even going to ask how such a Frankenstein could resemble the actual script!\nAthena:\nNoooooo! (Oh, well, if at first you don't succeed...)\nLeads back to:\n\"The only way they could've known what was in the script was if they...\"\nAthena:\n(Sorry, Junie, but... You're not going to like this.) Our client may have leaked the script's details to someone.\nBlackquill:\n...What the devil?\nWoods:\nAnd I know I shouldn't have, but... I revised the script to favor the prosecution. But Prof. Courte noticed it immediately and changed it back.\nAthena:\nMs. Woods did not want Hugh O'Conner to win the mock trial. That's why I believe she leaked the details to the witness, Robin Newman.\nApollo:\nI get it. If Robin won, Hugh wouldn't be able to confess to Juniper.\nAthena:\nRight. Junie was probably trying to keep their friendship from becoming awkward.\nNewman:\nNewman:\n*sob* *sniffle* How could you, Thena! WHADDA BUNCH O' BULL! I...! I...! I NEVER HEARD A WORD ABOUT THE SCRIPT FROM JUNIPER. NEVER EVEEEEEER!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nYou sure?! Can you look me in the eye and swear you didn't?\nNewman:\nB-A-D Athena... YOU DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDEEEEEEEENCE!\nAthena:\nGrr...\nApollo:\n.........Actually, we might have just the thing.\nAthena:\nReally?\nApollo:\nYeah, one of Robin's lines I read when we were reenacting the mock trial.\nKlavier:\nHere's a shot of the crime scene. Ironically, it was Prof. Courte who posed as the corpse. Herr Forehead, how did the mock trial participants react to this photo?\nApollo:\nMr. Newman was surprised by what Prof. Courte was wearing.\nApollo:\nRobin said, \"Oh, the green sweat suit.\"\nNewman:\nS-U-R-E, I might have said that. But... SO WHHAAATTT?!\nApollo:\nWell, think of it this way, Athena.\nAthena:\nY-Yeah. Uh, which way, exactly?\nApollo:\nIf I told you that I'd be wearing a blue suit today... ...but then showed up wearing what I've got on now, what would you say?\nAthena:\nUmm... \"Oh, the red suit.\" Ah! (I-I think I've got it...!) Your Honor! We have evidence proving that Ms. Newman knew the contents of the script. The defense moves to present said evidence to the court!\nJudge:\nVery well, Ms. Cykes. Present away.\nAthena:\nThis evidence proves that Ms. Newman had prior knowledge of the script's contents.\nPresent Mock Trial Script\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"...The mock trial's script?\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nJudge:\nHmm... And on what are you basing your assertion?\nNewman:\nI don't understand! Why are you just making stuff up? Oh, Athena! Shame on Y-O-U!\nJudge:\nYes, that's R-I-G-H-T!\nAthena:\nS-O-R-R-Y!\nNewman:\nOh my gawd, you two! That was so C-U-T-E!\nJudge:\nWhy, thank you! Erhm, but I'm afraid I must award Ms. Cykes a penalty.\nAthena:\n(When Robin commented about the body in the mock trial... ...it was like she was saying Prof. Courte was wearing the sweat suit she always wore. That's not something you'd expect her to say, unless...!)\nLeads back to:\n\"This evidence proves that Ms. Newman had prior knowledge of the script's contents.\"\nJudge:\n...The mock trial's script?\nAthena:\nMs. Newman, during the mock trial, you were shown a photo of the victim's body... ...and reportedly, you reacted by saying, \"Oh, the green sweat suit.\"\nNewman:\nOh, um... Yes, I said that. What's your point?\nAthena:\nYou seemed to have some issue with the green sweat suit, and I think I know why. The proof is in the script, specifically on the \"Things to Prepare\" page. \"Sweat suit: Victim's outfit will be a red one from the prosecutor course.\"\nNewman:\nAh!\nAthena:\nYou were surprised because the sweat suit in the photo was green. But, if you didn't know about the script's content... Then that shouldn't have surprised you!\nNewman:\n...N-- Noooooooooooooooooo! I thought we were friends, Athena! How could I have been so bliiiiiiiiind!\nAthena:\nIn light of her privileged knowledge, I move to declare Ms. Newman a suspect, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nYou whaaaaaat?!\nNewman:\nNewman:\nIf knowing script details makes me a suspect... ...then there must be others besides me! I mean, someone else could've also seen Prof. Courte's note!\nAthena:\nNote...? What note?\nNewman:\nThe professor and Juniper were working together to prepare for the mock trial. But only one copy of the script was made to prevent it from being leaked. But that gets kind of inconvenient, right?\nAthena:\nYou're not seriously going to suggest...!\nNewman:\nEek! But it's the truth! Prof. Courte did do exactly what you're thinking! She didn't write down any of the proceedings or the truth behind the case... But she did write a note to herself about the props and details about the victim's B-O-D-Y!\nAthena:\n...Is this really true, Ms. Newman?\nNewman:\nIf you don't believe me, send the police over to my house! Tell them to check the pictures on my camera. I thought it might give me an advantage... ...so I took a picture of the note!\nApollo:\n.........I'd say she's telling the truth.\nAthena:\n(...Wait a sec!) If there's a note with details about the body, then that means... ...there are others who could have made the murder look like our client's script!\nJudge:\nYes, I believe you're right!\nBlackquill:\n...Hmph!\nAthena:\nApparently, this case isn't as clear-cut as Prosecutor Blackquill would have us believe. This new revelation blasts a big fat hole in the prosecution's case!\nJudge:\nO-hoooooooooo!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nBully for you, missy. But don't think this spells victory.\nAthena:\nAnd why not?!\nBlackquill:\nThe battle is still young. And my blade is now fully drawn. Between it and my next witness, your life will be forfeit. So, put away your wooden sword... ...and show me what you are truly capable of if you wish to live!\nAthena:\n(You want it? Don't worry, I'm gonna bring it!)\nO'Conner:\n......... I already said I want nothing to do with this trial.\nBlackquill:\nHow juvenile. It is not a matter of what you want, for you WILL cooperate, Hugh O'Conner.\nJudge:\nProsecutor Blackquill. Why have you called this witness?\nBlackquill:\nYou will recall that the day before the mock trial -- in short, the day of the murder... ...the accused testified that she left for home at around 6:00 PM.\nJudge:\nYes. My notes here do confirm that fact.\nAthena:\nRight. Our client wasn't at school at the estimated time of death, so she couldn't be--\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nYet, that was but a felicitous lie. Or am I mistaken, Golden Boy?\nO'Conner:\n...I've no intention of saying anything more. Now, if you'll excuse me.\nBlackquill:\nHold! I am not through with you yet.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. It seems the rogue prosecutor has it out for me.\nBlackquill:\nLeave, and we just might discuss you-know-what.\nO'Conner:\nAck! N-No, wait!\nAthena:\n(One little statement and Mr. Cool loses it? What's that all about?)\nO'Conner:\nI changed my mind. ...I'll stay and testify.\nJudge:\nHmm... Are you sure, Mr. O'Conner?\nO'Conner:\nHeh. The word of a genius is as good as gold. Let's get on with this. Hugh O'Conner. A senior at Themis Legal Academy, lawyer course. How's that?\nJudge:\nJ-Just fine. Your testimony, then... If you please.\nApollo:\nYou're up against the top of the class now. I'd be careful if I were you.\nAthena:\nI know Junie would never lie like that! That pompous schoolboy won't know what hit him!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Around the Time of the Murder --\nO'Conner:\nTo get mentally prepared for the mock trial, I meditated at the archery range till 7:00 PM.\nAt around 7:15, I went to the main building before going home. That's when I saw Juniper.\nWe didn't say much as we passed by each other. She seemed her usual self.\nThat's it. Anything else you'd like to ask?\nBlackquill:\nThat is quite enough. Well done, Golden Boy.\nO'Conner:\n...Heh.\nBlackquill:\nThe final bell rings at 7:00 PM, at which point, the campus is a desolate place. Now, you will recall the tape recorder. We know the time of the voice recording. It was 7:10 PM, the day before the mock trial. That was the dark hour of this heinous crime.\nAthena:\nD-Do you have any proof of that?!\nBlackquill:\nAs its final bell, this school plays a special broadcast when the clock strikes seven. The female voice on the tape appears ten minutes after that broadcast. The killer waited until the school was empty to spring her devious and deadly trap.\nTape Recorder updated in the Court Record.\nJudge:\nSo, when the witness saw the defendant, that would've been...!\nBlackquill:\nIndeed. It was five minutes after the voice was captured on tape in the art room. Ergo, we know that the accused was still in the main building, even after the killing.\nJudge:\nHmm... So the time of the murder and the time of when the body was moved...\nAthena:\n(Great... Another inconvenient testimony.)\nJudge:\nMs. Cykes, your cross-examination, please.\nCross Examination\n-- Around the Time of the Murder --\nO'Conner:\nTo get mentally prepared for the mock trial, I meditated at the archery range till 7:00 PM.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nSo, um... do you meditate often?\nO'Conner:\nHeh. Don't tell me you're going to start pestering me, too.\nAthena:\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\nO'Conner:\nNo need to play dumb with me. All the girls want to know about my private life.\nAthena:\nWha--?!\nJudge:\nI will remind the defense this is a court of law, not a pick-up spot.\nBlackquill:\nHmph. It seems miss fancy-pants lawyer is smitten with the witness.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nObjection! Objection!!! OBJECTIIIIOOOOON!!! I'm just trying to establish the witness's--\nO'Conner:\nIf you must know, I never go a day without meditating. Satisfied now, stalker girl?\nAthena:\nThat's it! You'd better take that--!\nApollo:\nWhoa, whoa, there, tiger. Just take a deep breath and relax.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. I'll just continue my testimony now, if you don't mind.\nO'Conner:\nAt around 7:15, I went to the main building before going home. That's when I saw Juniper.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nOur client has stated she went home at 6:00 PM!\nAthena:\nYou and Prof. Courte were busy preparing for the mock trial together yesterday, right? Was that the last time you saw her?\nWoods:\n...Yes. I left school at around 6:00 PM.\nO'Conner:\n...No, wrong. I don't know what she was doing, but Juniper was definitely at school after 7:00 PM. But I suppose neither side can prove one way or the other.\nAthena:\nUgh. (But if Junie was there, that means she's lying.)\nO'Conner:\nTruth be told, I only saw her for the briefest of moments.\nO'Conner:\nWe didn't say much as we passed by each other. She seemed her usual self.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nSo you just walked past a good friend, barely saying a word?\nO'Conner:\nThe final bell had already rung. They get mad when you stand around chatting. Then again, we're not like you people, talking endlessly in those annoyingly loud voices.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nAnnoyingly loud voices?! I'd like it if you refrained from insulting my partner like that!\nApollo:\nNormally, I'd shout, \"Objection!\" right about now, but I'll take this one for the team.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. Anyway, I think that's about all I have to say.\nO'Conner:\nOh, let me add I never went to the art room. There was no reason for me to be there.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nYou had no reason to be in the art room... Really?\nO'Conner:\nThe lawyer course I'm in is supervised by Prof. Means. Plus, I'm not a member of Prof. Courte's Art Club, so why would I even go there?\nAthena:\nWhat about art class?\nO'Conner:\nHeh. Nice try, but Seniors don't take art class.\nAthena:\nAll right, then let me ask you--\nO'Conner:\nWait. I just remembered something important!\nAthena:\nYou did?\nO'Conner:\nI scored only a hundred percent on all the art tests I took through Junior year. (Changed from [I scored only 100% on all the art tests I took through Junior year.] in the original release) ...That's it.\nAthena:\n(Riiight... Always happy to indulge in some ego-stroking. Anyway, what to ask next...)\nHow did you prep for the mock trial?\nAthena:\nPlease tell the court what you were dong on October 23rd, the day before the mock trial.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. That's an easy one -- nothing in particular.\nAthena:\nNothing at all? You didn't help with the preparations?\nO'Conner:\nYou don't get it, do you? I was merely playing the role assigned to me. I left the preparations and the like to others. My job was to be mentally prepared.\nAthena:\n(Junie put her heart and soul into getting things ready, while he just sat on his behind?)\nO'Conner:\nJust to reiterate, I spent most of the 23rd meditating at the archery range. I didn't talk to anyone until the school closed at 7:00 PM. I supposed a few Archery Club members did come and go while I was there.\nAthena:\nBut you didn't talk to anyone? Not a single soul?\nO'Conner:\nThat's right. I didn't say a word to anyone till the final bell at 7:00 PM.\nAthena:\nI see... This is crucial information. Please add it to your testimony.\nO'Conner:\nI don't know if you're bluffing, but if you are, you have a pretty good poker face.\nChanges statement from \"Oh, let me add I never went to the art room. There was no reason for me to be there.\" to \"I didn't talk to anyone until the final bell. I'd been meditating alone at the archery range.\"\nWhy did you stay past the last bell?\nAthena:\nWhy would an honor student like you ignore the last bell?\nO'Conner:\nI wouldn't say I ignored it. I was simply running a little late.\nAthena:\nDo you remember exactly how late?\nO'Conner:\nHeh. You're a stickler for details, lady. But if I had to say, it was maybe about ten, fifteen minutes. If you think that's important, I'll add it to my testimony.\nAthena:\nI was hoping you'd say that.\nChanges statement from \"Oh, let me add I never went to the art room. There was no reason for me to be there.\" to \"The final bell had rung ten, fifteen minutes earlier. No biggie.\"\nNo further questions\nAthena:\nActually, never mind. I've got all the info I need.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. My, don't we seem confident.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nO'Conner:\nThe final bell had rung ten, fifteen minutes earlier. No biggie.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nYou ignored the last bell for no reason? Shame on you!\nO'Conner:\nNo, shame on YOU! Pressing me for no reason...\nAthena:\nGrrr...!\nApollo:\nWell, people do run late sometimes. Like you on the day this whole case began.\nAthena:\nArrrgh!\nJudge:\nIt appears we have a culprit in the case of \"The Pot Calling The Kettle Black.\"\nAthena:\nEt tu, Your Honor...?! (Hmmm...

Ask another question?)\nDid you go to the art room?\nAthena:\nDid you stop by the art room, or as it's now known, the scene of the crime?\nO'Conner:\nNo, I didn't.\nAthena:\nCan you prove it?\nO'Conner:\nAs much as I'd like to say I could, I can't. But let me ask you, can YOU prove that I did?\nAthena:\nAs much as I'd like to say I could, I can't. But I will ask how often do you visit there?\nO'Conner:\nHardly ever. There's no reason for me to be there, anyway.\nAthena:\nThere's no reason for you to be there?\nO'Conner:\nIs there an echo in here?

I didn't talk to anyone until the school closed at 7:00 PM. I supposed a few Archery Club members did come and go while I was there.\nAthena:\nBut you didn't talk to anyone? Not a single soul?\nO'Conner:\nThat's right. I didn't say a word to anyone till the final bell at 7:00 PM.\nAthena:\nI see... This is crucial information.

But what does that matter?\nAthena:\n(So, he didn't have any conversations? The entire day? Me thinks that claim needs a little more scrutiny. But what should I do? Is there anything I should ask about in more detail?)\nDid you go to the art room?\nAthena:\nDid you stop by the art room, or as it's now known, the scene of the crime?\nO'Conner:\nNo, I didn't.\nAthena:\nCan you prove it?\nO'Conner:\nAs much as I'd like to say I could, I can't.

I was simply running a little late.\nAthena:\nDo you remember exactly how late?\nO'Conner:\nHeh. You're a stickler for details, lady. But if I had to say, it was maybe about ten, fifteen minutes.

Our job is still the same.\nAthena:\n(Sure, but if Junie was really still at school after 6:00 PM... Ugh. I didn't spot any inconsistencies in Hugh's testimony, either. What am I supposed to do now?)\nAthena:\nSo, you didn't talk to anybody on October 23rd? Are you sure about that?\nO'Conner:\nHeh. I already told you, my word is as good as gold.\nAthena:\nOkay, then how do you explain this? And don't spare any details.\nO'Conner:\nSorry, never seen that before.\nAthena:\nThis is the victim's planner. She recorded all of her plans in great detail. Take a look at this page here. It reads, \"23rd - Meet with Hugh\" and \"Important.\" Don't you find that... interesting?\nO'Conner:\nWha-?! Where'd you get that?!\nAthena:\nThe keyword here is \"important.\" You say you were at the archery range all day. But you also said a few students came and went while you were there. That doesn't sound like a great place for an important talk.\nJudge:\nBut the entire campus was buzzing with activity before the mock trial. Where could they have possibly had a private conversation?\nAthena:\nI thought about that, too. But the situation changes after the last bell.\nJudge:\nWhat's this, now?!\nAthena:\nThe witness stayed after the last bell... ...in order to have a private talk with the victim. Am I right, Mr. O'Conner?!\nO'Conner:\nThis is insane!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Must we go through this yet again? I suppose you also have no evidence, as usual.\nAthena:\nNo, I don't have any direct evidence. However, the witness was meditating until after the last bell. And he attempted to conceal his private meeting with the victim!\nO'Conner:\nHeh. First Robin, now me? Who are you going to accuse next? You're just another unscrupulous attorney looking to get ahead.\nApollo:\nDon't let him get to you. He's definitely hiding something. I mean, he was supposed to meet with the victim around her estimated time of death.\nAthena:\nI had my suspicions about Robin, but... ...Hugh seems just as guilty! These three are the only possible suspects, after all!\nAthena:\nMr. O'Conner, answer me this! Did you meet with Prof. Courte that day?\nO'Conner:\n..................... Sorry, Mr. Jailbird Prosecutor. I don't mean to steal your thunder, but I've something to say.\nBlackquill:\nIf it will save me some trouble, then by all means, speak away.\nO'Conner:\nIf you would recall, Ms. Cykes, the voice on the tape recorder was female. Knowing that, I'd like you to explain how I could possibly be a suspect.\nAthena:\nOoh... (He has a point...)\nBlackquill:\nHmph, impressive. Golden Boy here does shine gold, indeed. Care to take the reins? You're more than capable of prosecuting this case.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. Sorry, but I'm studying to be a lawyer.\nBlackquill:\nWhat a pity. To think such genius is to be wasted on mere lawyering. At last, your moment is here, Cykes-dono. Time to refute Golden Boy's statement... ...and prove that you're the young prodigy worthy of the badge on your lapel!\nAthena:\nUuuurgh! (Could he lay any more pressure on...?!)\nApollo:\nThe voice is unmistakably female, so there's no point in arguing about that.\nAthena:\nYeah... You're right. In which case...! (To whom does the voice on the tape really belong to?)\nThe witness\nAthena:\nThe voice on the tape is that of this witness!\nO'Conner:\nBut I'm a man with a man's voice. All you have to do is open your eyes and ears.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThen let me ask, did you know Robin was a girl all along?\nO'Conner:\nAgh... But th-that's different...!\nAthena:\nSee, Your Honor, I have him squirming on the stand!\nJudge:\nYes, but it would have been nice if it had been due to a fact relevant to your rebuttal.\nAthena:\nArghh! (Now I'M the one squirming at my stand... The voice is definitely female. That much we know. In that case...)\nLeads back to:\n\"To whom does the voice on the tape really belong to?\"\nThe victim\nLeads to:\n\"The voice on the tape belongs to the victim. That's the only thing that makes sense.\"\nThe defendant\nAthena:\nIf the voice is female, it must belong to our client Juniper Woods!\nBlackquill:\nWell, now. Finally seen the light, have we?\nAthena:\nHuh?\nO'Conner:\nSo, you're going to explain how Juniper is guilty?\nAthena:\nWait... Oh, oops! Your Honor, let's pretend I never said that!\nJudge:\nHow about you at least pretend to take ownership of your statements.\nAthena:\nUuugh! (If it wasn't Junie's voice, then...)\nLeads back to:\n\"To whom does the voice on the tape really belong to?\"\nAthena:\nThe voice on the tape belongs to the victim. That's the only thing that makes sense.\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nAre you mad? The voice on the recording says, \"You're a goner!\" That is something a murderer shouts at their victim, not the other way around.\nAthena:\nHmm... (Yeah, that is a problem.) You're a goner... You're a goner... You're a goner...\nApollo:\nUm, Athena?\nAthena:\nYou're a goner... You a goner... Hew a corner... Hue o conner? ...Wait a second!\nApollo:\nWhoa, Athena, you're scaring me here.\nAthena:\nYOU'RE scared? I'm terrified for even coming up with this!\nApollo:\nWith what?\nAthena:\nProsecutor Blackquill! You wanted to know if I am worthy of my badge. Well, I'm about to show you why, despite my age, I can wear it with pride! (Changed from [Well, I'm about to show you why, despite my age, I'm able to proudly wear this at all!] in the original release)\nBlackquill:\nOh? Then can I take it you won't be changing your argument? Still, it stands that it's a bit odd for the victim to be the one yelling, \"You're a goner!\"\nAthena:\nI agree, if that's what the victim was saying. But it's not.\nJudge:\nHmm... I assume you have something to back up your assertion, Ms. Cykes?\nAthena:\n(Not exactly... But you don't have to add fuel to his fire, Your Honor!) If it is indeed Prof. Courte's voice on the tape, then she was shouting because she was...\nThreatening O'Conner\nAthena:\n\"You're a goner!\" was a threat directed at the witness!\nO'Conner:\nAnd what possible reason would she have to do that?\nAthena:\nOh, well, she was at that rebellious age. You know how students can be.\nJudge:\nThe victim was neither a student nor at a rebellious age. She was a professor.\nAthena:\nNoooooo! (How could I forget such a basic fact?! You're a goner... You a goner... Hew a corner... Wait! Maybe...!)\nLeads back to:\n\"If it is indeed Prof. Courte's voice on the tape, then she was shouting because she was...\"\nBeing threatened by O'Conner\nAthena:\n\"You're a goner\" was a threat the witness shouted at the victim!\nBlackquill:\nAs has been mentioned countless times, the voice in the recording is female. How the devil do you reckon it belongs to the witness?\nAthena:\nOh, right, heh heh.\nJudge:\nI'm confused how you could be confused about that, so without further ado, a penalty.\nAthena:\nNo fair! (Two against one! You're a goner... You a goner... Hew a corner... Wait! Maybe...!)\nLeads back to:\n\"If it is indeed Prof. Courte's voice on the tape, then she was shouting because she was...\"\nScolding O'Conner\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to call one basic fact into question.\"\nAthena:\nI would like to call one basic fact into question. Is that shout on the tape really saying, \"You're a goner!\"?\nApollo:\n...What are you up to now, Athena?\nAthena:\nProf. Courte's planner says she was supposed to meet with the witness for an important talk. Perhaps our witness, despite being a genius, had done something wrong... And this made Prof. Courte get angry with him during their private meeting.\nJudge:\nI don't see how this changes what we heard on the tape.\nAthena:\nWell, if you want to see how it changes things ...then let's try a little experiment. Your Honor, I want you to tell at the witness as if you're mad at him. But... and this is important... use his full name!\nJudge:\nO-Okay! Let's see, um... Hugh O'Conner!!!\nO'Conner:\nHeh. What did I do to deserve that?\nAthena:\nYes, like that! Now try again, but faster!\nJudge:\nHugh Aconner!!! ...Hm? Hue... a coner? Hew... o coner? You... a coner? W-Wait a second! ...No, no, no, this can't be.\nAthena:\nAthena:\n(You think I'd spend the energy to lead you this far if it wasn't true?!) Ah, but it is, Your Honor. Humans are not perfect, that's a scientific fact. We sometimes mistake shadows for monsters, or the winds for voices.\nJudge:\nHmmm... Now that you mention it...\nAthena:\n(You can do this, Athena! Just give the old guy one more little push...!) The sound on the tape recorder never was the phrase \"You're a goner!\" (Changed from [The voice on the tape recorder never was 'You're a goner!'] in the original release) That's only what we thought we heard, when in fact, it was the witness getting yelled at! The court will note that this is different from the selective hearing men are so good at!\nApollo:\n...I think you're right, but what was that last part again?\nAthena:\nNever mind. The important thing is that the voice that was recorded isn't our client's. And since it was the victim scolding the witness, he must now join the list of suspects!\nO'Conner:\nHrrrgh!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph. I had thought that testimony would suffice, but it seems it has come to this. I will not allow such fallacious quibbles to upend this case. The prosecution has one final piece of evidence to present to the court.\nAthena:\n(E-Evidence? What's he going to pull out now?!)\nBlackquill:\nFeast your eyes on this photo, and let me see that insolent look vanish from within them.\nJudge:\nLet's see here... Oh, it's a picture of the defendant and the victim.\nBlackquill:\nThe photograph shows professor and student preparing for the mock trial together.\nAthena:\nWait, was this taken in the art room -- the room where the murder occurred?\nBlackquill:\nIndeed it was. But the revelations do not end there. Do you see the clock on the wall? It reads 7:05, a mere five minutes before the voice was recorded on the tape.\nAthena:\nWH-WHAAAAAAT!\nBlackquill:\nThe accused brutally stabbed the victim to death five minutes after this photo was taken.\nSchool Camera Photo added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems the defendant's culpability in this crime is quite obvious.\nAthena:\n(Junie was with Prof. Courte just five minutes before she was murdered? What now? Nothing I say can change that fact...!)\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Understand now? You can believe in your client all wish, but try as you might... ...such misplaced faith will inevitably be cut down before the cruel, steely blade of truth.\nAthena:\nNgaaah!\nBlackquill:\n...Listen, missy. The person you'd like to save more than anyone else in the world? I'd be willing to wager that your defense isn't what they desire.\nAthena:\nB-B-But...! I became a lawyer so I could--\nBlackquill:\nYou still fail to understand? After so much pain and defeat? The courts are not the play yards of little children dressed as lawyers. So before you break your back in failure... ...run along home and grow up!\nAthena:\nGrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!\nAthena:\n(If he thinks I'm giving up now, he's got another thing coming! I have to find my inner strength if I ever hope to save him. But I can't think of any way to strike back. The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles? That's impossible! How could I smile under these circumstances, even if I forced it?!)\nApollo:\nThis is badder than bad! Who knew Blackquill had that one waiting in the wings! Why didn't that Twisted Samurai just present it at the beginning?\nAthena:\n(Wait, maybe this was his real plan? Was he just trying to show me how weak and powerless I am?! Maybe he's right, because I really haven't got a clue! Who's the real killer? Who murdered Prof. Constance Courte?) Robin Newman, a girl who had been forced to live a lie as a guy? Or was it Hugh O'Conner, the honor student who had met with Prof. Courte?\nJudge:\nThere seems to be little reason to debate the defendant's guilt any longer. The time for a verdict has come.\n???:\nNewman:\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN, MAAAAAAN!\nJudge:\nWhat's the meaning of this? You can't interrupt a judge about to hand down a--\nNewman:\nTee hee hee. Maybe, but false verdicts are a N-O N-O!\nJudge:\nWha-?!\nAthena:\nMs. Newman, please explain yourself!\nNewman:\nJuniper's not the killer. I know because... because I know who the real killer is.\nAthena:\nYou do? You know who the real killer is? (What is she up to now?)\nNewman:\nYup! I know because the real killer is... M-E, me! Tee, hee!\nAthena:\nUh......... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nNewman:\nIT WAS ME! I DID IT ALL ALONE. JUST MEEEEEEEEE!\nAthena:\n(I don't get it. Why is SHE confessing?)\nJudge:\nHmm... Ms. Newman WAS witnessed near the stage. There's even a related photo of her. The more I think about it, the more suspicious she seems...\nNewman:\nROBIN NEWMAN ISN'T THE KIND OF GUY WHO PINS THE BLAME ON FRIENDS... ...JUST SO HE CAN WALK FREEEEEEEEEE!!! GET IT OVER WITH! DECLARE ME GUILTY ALREADYYYYYYYYY!\n???:\nWoods:\n*cough, cough* Please... wait.\nAthena:\nJuniper! Wh-What are you doing?!\nWoods:\nThank you for all you've done, Thena. But you'll have to forgive me. I can't let my friends take the blame any longer!\nAthena:\nJunie! No! Don't do it!\nWoods:\nHugh and Robin have done nothing wrong. They have absolutely no connection to this case. The real killer is... is me. I alone am responsible for the entire crime!\nJudge:\n.........Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaat?!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nJunie! You know that's not true! Hurry up, and retract your statement!\nWoods:\nI'm afraid it is true. Forgive me, Thena.\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!!! Will somebody please explain what's going on here?!\nBlackquill:\n.........Hmph. I see right through your cheap ploy. School rules state that a prior conviction terminates one's eligibility to graduate. A guilty verdict here would make whatever dreams one had go up in a puff of smoke.\nJudge:\nOh, I wasn't aware...\nBlackquill:\nEven meek little mice will fight when cornered. A pitiful spectacle, I might add. These vermin are trying to protect each other now that they've nowhere else to run.\nAthena:\n(Protect each other? Wait... So, was Robin just trying to protect Junie, too? If so, then the real killer is...)\n???:\nO'Conner:\nHeh. This whole thing's a joke.\nAthena:\n(Uh-oh, now it's Hugh's turn...)\nJudge:\nWh-What... What is wrong with kids these days?!\nO'Conner:\nI know what just crossed your mind, Ms. Cykes. You think I'm the killer, don't you?\nApollo:\nWow, he really is a genius. He even knows what you're thinking.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. I think it's about time I told you the truth. And I'll even get right to the point. It was me. I did it.\nAthena:\nWait............ WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nApollo:\nNow both potential suspects are claiming to be the real killer.\nAthena:\nArgh! I... I am so confused right now...!\nO'Conner:\nIf you still have doubts, how about I detail my murder plot? It's absolute genius.\nBlackquill:\nEnough of this nonsense! This is a court of law, not the set of some high-school drama!\nJudge:\nI see I have no choice. I'm afraid I'll have to--\nBlackquill:\nHoy! Wait, Your Baldness!\nJudge:\n...I'm sorry, Prosecutor Blackquill, but I'm in no position to hand down a verdict just yet. I am hoping that the defense and prosecution can come up with some airtight evidence. That is why I am giving you both the rest of the day to continue investigating this case.\nAthena:\n(Pinch me, I think I'm dreaming...)\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Fine. Do as you wish!\nJudge:\nThis brings today's proceedings to a close. Court is adjourned!\nTo be continued\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThat statement contradicts the evidence!\nJudge:\nIt does? And how would that be?\nAthena:\nJ-Just look at it! It's one huge contradiction!\nJudge:\n...I see. The defense is simply making another baseless assertion.\nAthena:\nEeeeeek! (Crash and burn!)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nAthena:\nAthena:\nYour Honor, members of the court, please look at this. That's right. There's no need to explain anything. This piece of evidence says it all.\nJudge:\nAll that says to me is you're completely wrong.\nAthena:\nAaaaahhh! (I guess that won't fly.)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThis piece of evidence clearly reveals the inconsistency in the witness's testimony!\nJudge:\nI've been doing this for far too long to be fooled by such nonsense.\nAthena:\nUgh! (And I really tried hard that time, too.) Your Honor, can I at least get credit for trying?\nJudge:\nVery well, I hereby award Ms. Cykes the court's \"Wasted Effort\" award.\nAthena:\nNoooooo!\nWidget:\nWhere's the love?\nConsult (when evidence must be presented)\nApollo:\nYou mind letting your slightly senior partner help out a little now?\nAthena:\n...If you insist. (Actually, I could really use the help.)\nApollo:\nWell, I find this statement suspicious. You should find the answer if you take a good look at the evidence.\nAthena:\nTh-Thanks, Apollo!\nApollo:\nI could get used to this more humble version of you, you know. (Changed from [I could get used this [sic] more humble version of you, you know.] in the original release)\nConsult (when statements must be pressed)\nApollo:\nYou okay, Athena? You can tell me if something's bothering you.\nAthena:\nN-No, I'm totally fine! (Actually, I'm not anywhere near fine.)\nApollo:\nThe thing with cross-examinations is the answer you need isn't always obvious. You have to dig deep to find clues hidden in the testimony. Really wrestle with it.\nAthena:\nOh, so it's like grabbing a bull by the horns and wrestling it to the ground!\nApollo:\nWell, try not to take it so literally. Just stick with pressing the witness.\nAthena:\nTh-Thanks, Apollo! (Okay, let's give it a try!)\nPinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment \"Why I Touched the Costume\")\nAthena:\nAthena:\nMr. Newman, this emotion is inconsistent with your testimony!\nNewman:\nWhat are you talking about?! It's not truuuue!!! My only emotion is testosterone-fueled stubbornessssssss!!!\nAthena:\nYikes! (I wouldn't really call that an emotion!) Wonder where I went wrong? Well, better try that again!\nNewman:\nBring it on! A million times or a billion!!! I DON'T CAAAAAARE!!!\nProbe wrong area (during Mood Matrix segment \"Why I Touched the Costume\")\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThe source of Mr. Newman's anger... is this!\nNewman:\nNope! You're way off! WAAAY OFFFFFF!\nAthena:\nEeeeek! (No good, huh?) I'm trying to listen carefully, but all his shouting -- it's...!\nApollo:\nWe'd better finish this off quick before you rupture an eardrum.\nAthena:\nNo worries! I'm gonna nail it next time!\nToo many penalties\nJudge:\nThat's enough! I see no need prolong this trial any further. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims!

I don't know exactly what you meant... ...but there was no way I could force a smile in that courtroom today.\nPhoenix:\nI'm just glad you remembered that. But now how about relaxing a little--\nAthena:\nR-Relax?! Not gonna happen!\nPhoenix:\n.........\nAthena:\nJunie... she asked me to defend her because she believes in me. But I...

If it weren't for their confessions, I'd...!\nMeans:\nBut if this trial proceeds in the same manner and ends in the same way as the mock trial... ...would you not lose everything you've worked so hard to gain?\nAthena:\nWell, I'll just have to make sure that doesn't happen, then, won't I!\nAthena:\n(No, I can't lose it all! Not now!)\nApollo:\nYou okay, Athena? You're turning kind of pale.\nAthena:\n...I can't just stand around here! I'm going to finish the investigation!\nTrucy:\nCan't it wait? I just took a batch of freshly baked cookies out of my magic panties!\nAthena:\nThanks, but I'd better get going! Save me one for when I get back. Apollo, you wait here! I need to see Junie at the Detention Center first right away!\nApollo:\nNo, wait! I'm going with you! Sorry, Mr. Wright, but I'd better go too!\nPhoenix:\nNo problem. You two be careful.\nOctober 25Detention Center - Visitor's Room\nAthena:\n(There's so much I need to ask Junie. What happened in court today... Where we go from here...)\nMeans:\nWell, now! Fancy meeting you here.\nAthena:\nOh, Prof. Means. What brings you here?\nWoods:\nI asked him to come. He arrived just a little before you. I wanted to ask him something. But first, Athena... I want to apologize for my sudden confession after you worked so hard to defend me.\nAthena:\n(She was calling me \"Thena\" until just now...) No, I should be the one apologizing. The whole thing spiraled out of my control.\nWoods:\nAthena, I--\nAthena:\nDon't worry! I'll really bring it tomorrow! I'll find something to prove your innocence!\nWoods:\nAbout that............ Athena... I've been thinking of asking Prof. Means to defend me.\nAthena:\n...Huh?\nMeans:\nI myself only just heard of this a moment ago.\nAthena:\n(Oh... So, she thinks Prof. Means would be... No! I can't let this happen! Not with the way he wants to do things!) J-Junie!\nWoods:\nI know, Athena, but will you please hear me out?\nTalk\nWhy change lawyers?\nWoods:\nAthena, do you actually think Hugh or Robin could've committed this crime?\nAthena:\n(The body was moved right before the mock trial. Besides Junie, they're the only ones... ...who could move freely around the campus at that time...) I'm sorry, Junie, but at this point, I can't rule them out.\nWoods:\nI was afraid you'd say that.\nMeans:\nJuniper is seeking a lawyer who can clear all three of their names. Only I am capable of such a feat.\nAthena:\nB-But how can you possibly prove that all three of them are innocent?\nMeans:\nI am a result-oriented person. Come tomorrow, I won't fail to have the perfect piece of evidence ready. For the end really does justify the means, especially for me, Prof. Aristotle Means.\nAthena:\n(Ugh... I really don't like the sound of that.)\nWoods:\nI'm sorry, but... Just as you believe I'm innocent, I believe that my friends are innocent, too.\nApollo:\nAll right. If that's how you really feel, we'll respect your decision.\nAthena:\nA-Apollo?!\nApollo:\nBut we want to continue our investigation. Could we ask you some more questions?\nWoods:\nSure, I don't mind. Prof. Means, would you like to stay and join our conversation?\nMeans:\nYes, of course. I am your lawyer, after all.\nAthena:\n(There's that smile again. Why does it always creep me out?)\nWhy did you confess? (appears after \"Why change lawyers?\")\nAthena:\nAbout your confession, Junie. It's not true, is it? You just said what you did because Robin had confessed on the stand, didn't you?\nWoods:\nYes. I wasn't thinking straight. All I knew was I had to help my friend.\nApollo:\nYou mean, because of that school rule? The one that says you can't graduate if you are convicted of a crime?\nWoods:\nNo! I didn't do it because of some rule! I did it because she's my friend *cough* *cough, cough*... *cough*\nAthena:\n(Why is there discord in her voice again? ...Could it really be that the friendship between the three of them is on the rocks? There's more here than meets the eye.)\nThe trio's friendship (appears after \"Why did you confess?\")\nAthena:\nWhen did you three first become friends?\nWoods:\nWell... Even though we were in different courses, we really bonded from the first day of school. We vowed to work together to bring an end to the dark age of the law. That was when our proof of friendship came about.\nAthena:\n(There's that proof of friendship again. I just wish this were as simple as that.)\nO'Conner:\nHeh. We even have proof of our friendship.\nNewman:\nYeaaaaaah!!! As long as our friendship lasts! You can bet we'll be carrying them around!\nWoods:\nBut the situation kind of changed recently. When the school's policy shifted to training legal professionals who produce results--\nMeans:\nAllow me to explain. In the lawyer course I teach, producing results means winning trials. Prof. Courte, on the other hand, taught that finding the truth was the only valid result. Unfortunately, that clash of ideas created a rift among our students.\nWoods:\nAt some point, we stopped talking about it. While that meant fewer arguments... ...it also meant we couldn't be as frank and open with each other as we used to be.\nAthena:\n(I think I understand now. By putting their friendship on a pedestal, they actually did more harm than good. It seems the relationship between the three of them isn't as simple as I thought.)\nApollo:\n...Juniper, thank you for talking to us about this difficult subject.\nAthena:\nYeah, thanks, Junie. Now, if you could tell us about the day of the murder...\nThe day of the murder (appears after \"The trio's friendship\")\nAthena:\nJunie, you told us yesterday that you went home a little after 6:00 PM. Was that a lie?\nWoods:\n...I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before, but... ...what actually happened was I left the art room a little after 6:00 PM and... ...headed over to my dressing room, where I worked on my stage costume until 7:00.\nAthena:\nThat's it? You didn't go anywhere else?\nWoods:\nNo, nowhere else.\nAthena:\n(If that really were it, then there would be no reason to lie in the first place. She's gotta be hiding something else.)\nApollo:\nJunie, do you remember this picture?\nWoods:\nYes, but something's wrong here.\nAthena:\nWrong? What's wrong?\nWoods:\nI took this picture at around 6:00, which was before I'd left the art room.\nAthena:\nBut the clock here says it's just after 7:00.\nWoods:\nBy 7:00, I'd already been working in my dressing room for some time. So, there's definitely something wrong with the time in this picture.\nApollo:\nHm, I guess we'd better go check the art room.\nAthena:\nOkay, just one last question about the day of the murder.\nEncountering O'Conner (appears after \"The day of the murder\")\nLeads to:\n\"On the day before the mock trial -- the evening of the murder -- you ran into Hugh.\"\nPresent\nAwl\nWoods:\nThat was just a prop. To think it would become an actual murder weapon!\nAthena:\nThe killer is trying to make this case look exactly like your script. That's why this awl was used like that.\nWoods:\nBut... But why would anyone do that?\nAthena:\n(Yeah, that's the million-dollar question. I wonder if Junie has her suspicions but is afraid to share them with me.)\nCourte's Autopsy Report, Tape Recorder, or School Camera Photo\nAthena:\nJunie, can you tell us anything about this?\nWoods:\nI don't really know what to say. Um...\nAthena:\n(She went silent. Seems like she doesn't want to talk about it.)\nAthena:\nOn the day before the mock trial -- the evening of the murder -- you ran into Hugh.\nWoods:\n............Yes, I did.\nO'Conner:\nAt around 7:15, I went to the main building before going home. That's when I saw Juniper. We didn't say much as we passed by each other. She seemed her usual self. That's it. Anything else you'd like to ask?\nWoods:\n.........\nAthena:\n(She suddenly went silent. She always was terrible at hiding things. Was she trying to keep their meeting a secret by lying about going home at 6:00?) All right, I won't press the matter any further. Is there anything else you noticed on the night of the murder?\nWoods:\n...Well, I don't know if this will help, but... That evening, I went back to my dressing room to get something I'd forgotten there. It was well after the last bell rang... I'd say, maybe around 8:30.\nAthena:\nAround 8:30, huh? That's over an hour after when the crime supposedly took place.\nWoods:\nThat's when I noticed that both stage statues were finished. They were quite large, and they were each covered with a white sheet, but I could tell. It made me happy to think that after all that hard work, they were finally finished.\nAthena:\nOh, right... The statues that Robin made. So they were covered in white sheets...?\nWoods:\n...*cough*... *cough* *cough*\nAthena:\nJ-Junie! Are you okay?\nWoods:\n*cough* Sorry. I'm a little tired, that's all.\nApollo:\nAthena, I think this meeting is over. Prof. Means?\nMeans:\nI will use any means possible to get the result I want in Juniper's case. But it will require considerable preparation, so I must be off.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nJunie! ...And Prof. Means! I have a proposal!\nWoods:\n...A proposal?\nApollo:\nWait, this isn't another one of your crazy--\nAthena:\nBy sundown today...!\nWoods:\nYes...?\nAthena:\nI, Athena Cykes, along with Apollo Justice...!\nApollo:\nW-Wait a second. Don't drag my name into--\nAthena:\nWe're going to discover the truth behind this murder mystery!\nWoods:\n......What?!\nAthena:\nAnd we're going to bring you solid evidence showing just what that truth is!\nMeans:\nI see... So, it has come to this, has it?\nAthena:\nIf we succeed in doing that... ...I want you to promise that you'll accept it, Junie, no matter how hard it is to hear.\nWoods:\n.........\nAthena:\nThen, you shouldn't need anyone else to defend you except me. Have we got a deal? ...I trust that's okay with you too, Prof. Means?\nMeans:\nI have no objections, as long as Juniper is satisfied with this arrangement.\nWoods:\n............Okay. But only if it's the real truth. I'm sorry to put you through this, Thena. But thank you. I've been thinking only of myself this whole time.\nAthena:\nJunie, it's way too early to thank me. But you can thank me all you want once I get to the bottom of this!\nMeans:\n...Very well, I will see you back here at sundown.\nApollo:\nSorry for all the trouble, professor. It's just, she's new to the agency, so...\nMeans:\nDon't be silly. I find it all rather thrilling. Now, let us meet here again later!\nWoods:\nIf you'll excuse me, I'd better go.\nAthena:\nOkay, see you later!\nMeans:\nBut if this trial proceeds in the same manner and ends in the same way as the mock trial... ...would you not lose everything you've worked so hard to gain?\nAthena:\n(Argh! This is no time to be thinking about that! I've got an investigation to do. I WILL find the truth by sundown, no matter what!)\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nApollo:\nOnly the three mock trial participants could've moved the body before it started. That's why the killer must be Robin, Hugh, or Juniper.\nAthena:\nRight, and that means at least one of them is lying.\nApollo:\nTo make matters worse, I have a feeling each one of them is hiding some sort of secret.\nAthena:\n(We'll have to bring it all to light. I'm not looking forward to it, but it has to be done!)\nAbout the murder\nApollo:\nToday's trial focused on the day of the crime and the actions of those involved.\nAthena:\nYeah, like when the voice was recorded, and who went to the art room and when. If we analyze the info we have, we should be able to ID the killer! There's no lead in these legs! I've been training for a day like this! Okay, on my mark! Ready, set--\nApollo:\nNo running for me. I'm done trying to keep up with you.\nTomorrow's trial\nApollo:\nSo, the main argument tomorrow will be over how the body was moved. Detective Fulbright said Prosecutor Blackquill already has a plan. I bet it involves some bit of info that will damage Juniper's case.\nAthena:\nPoor Junie. She gets discouraged much easier than I do, too. I'll just have to reassure her the best I can!) No problem. All we have to do is find some irrefutable evidence before the day is done!\nWidget:\nCome on, lazybones!\nApollo:\nHa, ha. Very funny, Mr. I-Dangle-Around-Someone's-Neck-All-Day.\nPresent\nAwl, Tape Recorder, School Camera Photo, or Voiceprint Analysis\nApollo:\nMore damaging evidence. Juniper's case seems to have no lack of that.\nAthena:\nWe still have time to turn this whole case upside down! But it'll require some legwork!\nApollo:\nYou're right. Let's give it our best shot.\nAthena:\nThat's the spirit! We'll start with wind sprints! Two hundred yards, ten times! Ready to go?!\nApollo:\nNo, wait! Wouldn't our time be better spent investigating the case?\nWright Anything Agency\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nTrucy:\nHungry, Athena? You haven't had lunch yet, right? Well... It's a virtual snack bar in my magic panties! Cookies, chips, Snackoos! You name it!\nAthena:\n(That's not the most appetizing place to keep snacks...) You know, I'm not that hungry anymore. I'll just have some juice from the fridge.\nTrucy:\nGreat! I've been waiting to have you try drinking from my magic panties.\nAthena:\n(Ugh. That's even worse.) M-Maybe next time. I'm really busy with the investigation and all.\nTrucy:\nOh, you are? Well, when you get back, I'll have all sorts of things ready for you in my magic panties.\nAthena:\n(Just the very thought is making me shudder.)\nToday's trial\nTrucy:\nI saw your debut fight, Athena You looked like an old pro out there!\nAthena:\nI wasn't nearly that good, but thanks.\nTrucy:\nAww, c'mon! You'd put a pitbull to shame! You sunk your teeth in and never let go!\nAthena:\nSure...\nTrucy:\nYou exploited your opponents' faults, and you split hairs like there was no tomorrow!\nAthena:\nOkay...\nTrucy:\nIt was amazing! I can't tell you the last time I was on the edge of my seat for a whole fight!\nAthena:\nRight...\nWidget:\nTrial = Boxing Match = Trial?\nOctober 25Themis Legal Academy - Outdoor Stage\n???:\nAh!\nAthena:\nIs it my imagination or did something just move?\nKlavier:\nAfternoon, you two.\nApollo:\nProsecutor Gavin. What are you doing here? Don't you think sneaking onto campus like this... is just slightly suspicious?\nKlavier:\nI'll have you know I'm continuing my investigation, in the strictest of confidence.\nAthena:\nI don't want to be caught napping again at tomorrow's trial. And that means a thorough investigation today. Think you can lend us a hand?\nKlavier:\nI'm not one to refuse a damsel in distress. But you needn't have asked, Fräulein. I'd intended to help from the start.\nAthena:\nYou're the best, Prosecutor Gavin! (Okay, time for a thorough investigation. I bet we missed lots of stuff yesteday!)\nTalk\nThe stage\nAthena:\nProsecutor Gavin, you were scheduled to perform at the school festival, weren't you?\nKlavier:\nThat's right. But I hadn't seen this stage until yesterday. That backdrop with the starry sky and big crescent moon isn't half bad. We also had some tricks up our sleeve to make the concert really rock. Pyrotechnics, a fog machine, big banners... Things like that. It would've looked like this.\nAthena:\nOh, the plans from yesterday. What's that design on the banner there in the back? I know the scales are the school emblem... ...but what's with the number six? It looks like it's in serious pain or something.\nApollo:\nA-Athena, ixnay on the ixsey.\nKlavier:\nThat's the Gavinners's logo, Fräulein. Oh, and nice Pig Latin, Herr Forehead. Really smooth.\nAthena:\nOh! I, uh... I meant, it looks like the number six rocking seriously hard.\nKlavier:\nNein, Fräulein, it's a G for Gavinners, not a six. But whatever floats your pretty boat.\nApollo:\nSo where is the banner? I don't see it anywhere onstage.\nKlavier:\nIt was an important part of the show, but the school managed to misplace it somehow. It's a pity. We had it specially made from heavyweight high-grade cloth. A missing banner and two broken statues -- there are mysteries aplenty to be solved, ja?\nAthena:\n(Come to think of it, one of the broken statues was of Prosecutor Gavin.)\nThe statues (appears after \"The stage\")\nKlavier:\nAs you can see here in the stage plans... ...right here, we have the statue of me... ...and right here, Herr Wright's statue. But little does that matter now, as we both lie in pieces thanks to you, Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\nWhat did I ever do to you?!\nAthena:\nActually, this statue broke into rather large pieces. Why don't we try to put it back together? Maybe we'll learn something new.\nKlavier:\nHmm... Picking up the pieces of a shattered rock star? Achtung! That's one über-cool idea! There might even be a song in there somewhere!\nAthena:\nYay! Let's do this! Schnell!\nApollo:\nIs this an investigation or am I interrupting a German Language Club social event?\nPresent\nTape Recorder\nKlavier:\nI'm flattered, Fräulein, but the answer is nein.\nAthena:\nWhat do you mean, \"nein\"?\nKlavier:\nYou want to record my godlike voice on your little tape recorder there, ja? Well, sorry. I may have retired from the music biz, but I will not sell myself cheap.\nAthena:\n(It's a piece of evidence, you-- Oh, never mind.)\nExamine (after clearing \"The statues\" Talk option)\n\"67th School Festival\" sign\nAthena:\nSixty-seventh?! Wow, this school festival goes way back. Oh, look. The text on this sign isn't written, it's embroidered! And there's a warning in even smaller embroidery... \"Embroidered sign lovingly crafted by the Handicrafts Club. KEEP DRY!\" (But the sign is outside. What happens if it rains?)\nBackdrop\nAthena:\nI dunno... This is fine for a rock concert, but... The nighttime sky as backdrop for a courtroom?\nKlavier:\nPersonally, I think it's breathtaking. I mean, speaking the truth under a starry sky? Don't you think it's romantic, Fräulein? And the waning crescent moon represents the maximum three-day trial cycle.\nAthena:\n(Three-day trials outdoors? No thanks. If it starts raining my hair'll be ruined!)\nProsecution bench\nAthena:\nThere's even a prosecutor's bench here on this stage.\nKlavier:\nAh, the memories, Fräulein. As a former rock star, and a prosecutor... ...the prosecutor's bench has taught me much about human emotions, passion, and fight.\nAthena:\nI can picture it now -- you with your silvery singing voice and Apollo sweating bullets.\nApollo:\nHey, how about picturing me winning once in a while?\nDefense bench\nAthena:\nThe winner of the mock trial was to take the training seminar right here.\nApollo:\nYou mean, Hugh or Robin?\nAthena:\nYeah... Besides Junie, they're the only ones who could move freely around the campus... ...before the mock trial. That means one of them must be the killer.\nApollo:\nBut that's not really enough to go on, is it? We need to talk with Juniper one more time and persuade her to give us a name.\nAthena:\nRight. And that means we have to find irrefutable evidence before the day ends! (There's no time to lose! But we can't rush it, either! Efficiency is the key!)\nWitness stand\nAthena:\nWow, they built a witness stand, too, even though it's just a temporary stage. (Oh, but I think they're still working on it. Let's see what this notice says.) \"Caution: Pedestal features a high-speed rotation mode. Activate with care.\" (You mean this thing spins...?)\nFront of judge bench\nAthena:\nIt's a bit too far away to get a good look. Maybe we should try a different angle.\nBack of judge bench\nAthena:\nOoh, I like the view. The judge can look down on everything from up here.\nApollo:\nYeah, not bad for a temporary stage.\nAthena:\nHmm... Is that so, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\nHeh, your judge act from the mock mock trial? I don't know why, but it kind of creeps me out.\nAthena:\nWrong answer again, Mr. Justice. A penalty for our mock lawyer!\nApollo:\nArrrgh! ...That is NOT funny!\nChalk outline\nAthena:\nThe body's gone. All that's left is a white outline. I never knew Prof. Courte personally... ...but seeing her reduced to a white outline leaves me cold inside.\nApollo:\nBut in a way, she still lives on in the messages she left behind. Like the strange way her body was posed and the signs of her wrists being bound.\nAthena:\nYou're right. Let's use her final messages to catch her killer!\nBroken Klavier Gavin statue\nAthena:\nOh, no, Prosecutor Gavin! You're a complete wreck, literally! Why in the world would someone do something like this?\nApollo:\nI don't know, but whoever did it must've felt an amazing sense of release.\nKlavier:\nCan I take that as a confession, Herr Forehead?\nApollo:\nWhat?! No! I feel bad for Robin. She worked so hard on these. Let's pick up the pieces for her!\nKlavier:\nYou got it! Let's check every corner of this stage then, ja!\nBroken Phoenix Wright statue\nAthena:\nThe other statue Robin made... It's been smashed to bits. If there were some larger pieces, we might be able to put this one back together, too.\nKlavier:\nYeah, but all I see are itty bitty ones.\nAthena:\nI wonder what Mr. Wright would think... ...if he knew we put Prosecutor Gavin's statue back together, but left his like this.\nApollo:\nWe could always come back to it after the case is solved. I'll help you fix it.\nSpeakers visible from judge bench\nAthena:\nLook! There's your rival over there, Apollo!\nApollo:\nWho, Prosecutor Gavin? We've battled it out a few times before, but I wouldn't call him--\nAthena:\nNo, not him. I meant that speaker over there! (Changed from [No, not him. I'm meant [sic] that speaker over there!] in the original release) It can output massive blasts of sound that rival your Chords of Steel!\nApollo:\nI have better things to do than compete with a speaker, so just forget it.\nBox\nAthena:\nWait... You don't think this weird box here is--\n???:\nSss, sss, sss... Hands off!\nAthena:\nI knew it. I'd know that voice anywhere.\nApollo:\nLet's just ignore it. I mean, it made its wishes loud and clear.\nAthena:\n(So, this is the future cardboard box technology has afforded us, huh...)\nSchool newspaper\nAthena:\nIt's a copy of the school paper with that story about the alleged love triangle. I wonder if people waste their time reading this stuff...\nSss, sss, sss... It's more popular than you think...\nApollo:\nW-What was that?! I thought I heard something just now...\nAthena:\nY-You're just hearing things! It was nothing more than your ears playing tricks on you!\nFirst statue fragment examined (if fragment is white)\nAthena:\nFound one! A piece of Prosecutor Gavin's shattered pride!\nKlavier:\nAre you saying my pride is as fragile as plaster of Paris?\nApollo:\nIt looks like there are other large pieces scattered about.\nAthena:\nOkay, let's find what we can!\nWhite Fragment added to the Court Record.\nFirst statue fragment examined (if fragment is purple)\nAthena:\nFound one! A piece of Prosecutor Gavin's shattered pride!\nKlavier:\nAre you saying my pride is as fragile as plaster of Paris?\nApollo:\nIt looks like there are other large pieces scattered about.\nAthena:\nOkay, let's find what we can!\nPurple Fragment added to the Court Record.\nSecond, third, and fourth statue fragments examined (if fragment is white; before White Fragment is added to the Court Record)\nAthena:\nFound another piece of the statue!\nApollo:\nBut there should still be some more. Let's leave no stone unturned.\nWhite Fragment added to the Court Record.\nSecond, third, and fourth statue fragments examined (if fragment is white; after White Fragment is added to the Court Record)\nAthena:\nFound another piece of the statue!\nApollo:\nBut there should still be some more. Let's leave no stone unturned.\nWhite Fragments updated in the Court Record.\nSecond, third, and fourth statue fragments examined (if fragment is purple; before Purple Fragment is added to the Court Record)\nAthena:\nFound another piece of the statue!\nApollo:\nBut there should still be some more. Let's leave no stone unturned.\nPurple Fragment added to the Court Record.\nSecond, third, and fourth statue fragments examined (if fragment is purple; after Purple Fragment is added to the Court Record)\nAthena:\nFound another piece of the statue!\nApollo:\nBut there should still be some more. Let's leave no stone unturned.\nPurple Fragments updated in the Court Record.\nFifth statue fragment examined (if fragment is white)\nApollo:\nThis looks like another piece of the statue.\nAthena:\nThanks, Apollo! This makes five piece in all.\nApollo:\nI think we have all we're going to find.\nAthena:\nOkay, let's get back to where Prosecutor Gavin was shattered!\nKlavier:\nI think you might want to reword that.\nWhite Fragments updated in the Court Record.\nLeads to:\n\"Well, I don't see any other big pieces lying around.\"\nFifth statue fragment examined (if fragment is purple)\nApollo:\nThis looks like another piece of the statue.\nAthena:\nThanks, Apollo! This makes five piece in all.\nApollo:\nI think we have all we're going to find.\nAthena:\nOkay, let's get back to where Prosecutor Gavin was shattered!\nKlavier:\nI think you might want to reword that.\nPurple Fragments updated in the Court Record.\nLeads to:\n\"Well, I don't see any other big pieces lying around.\"\nAthena:\nWell, I don't see any other big pieces lying around.\nApollo:\nYeah. Let's see if we can put this statue back together.\nAthena:\nAll right, Apollo you come over here and Prosecutor Gavin, if you could hold this...\nAthena:\nWe did it! Not bad, if I do say so myself!\nKlavier:\nYeah, but don't you think it's strange? We put the statue back together, but look. What's with all these leftover white pieces?\nAthena:\nHm... These two look like they go together. And this one, too! (Changed from [And these pieces, too!] in the original release)\nApollo:\nUm, Athena? What do you think you're doing?\nAthena:\nDon't stop me now. The artist inside me wants to get out and have a good time!\nApollo:\nSo... what is it...?\nKlavier:\nAh... It's the goddess of law holding a pair of scales in one hand and a sword in the other. That's quite the feat you pulled off there, Fräulein.\nAthena:\nWhew! I love that feeling you get after you work really hard on something!\nApollo:\nNo, no, no! I knew WHO it was! I meant to ask what's it doing here!\nKlavier:\nNot sure. There's no statue like this in the stage plans.\nAthena:\n(Still, I could swear I've seen this statue somewhere before.)\nLady Justice added to the Court Record.\nApollo:\nThe more we learn, the deeper the rabbit hole goes.\nKlavier:\nAt least we're moving in the right direction. Let's keep searching the stage for clues.\nAthena:\nI've been wondering about something this whole time. You know that pole at the edge of the stage?\nApollo:\nYou mean this? It has a wire that goes off and connects to something somewhere.\nExamine\nRestored Klavier Gavin statue\nAthena:\nHey, look what I made! Not bad, huh?\nKlavier:\nYou're like a recording artist who samples other people's work and calls it their own.\nAthena:\nWell, you know what they say. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery! In any case, we have a statue smasher in addition to a killer to catch now!\nKlavier:\nNein, I suspect they might be one and the same. (Changed from [Nein, I suspect they might be one in [sic] the same.] in the original release)\nRestored Lady Justice statue\nApollo:\nThis statue doesn't look anything like you or Mr. Wright.\nKlavier:\nThe goddess bearing scales and a sword... She's a symbol of fairness and strength.\nAthena:\nBut she and her symbols were shattered along with the statues of you and Mr. Wright. This is a direct challenge to the rule of law! Well, if they want a fight, they've got one!\nApollo:\nWhoa, take it down a notch, tiger. Let's save the fighting for when we find our culprit.\nPole\nAthena:\nThis pole supports the wire over the stage. Just seeing it makes me want to climb it.\nApollo:\nWhat's with your constant desire to run and climb things?\nAthena:\nWhat's wrong with being competitive? You need to man up a little, Apollo.\nApollo:\nWell, I'm not climbing that thing, that's for sure. I'd like to keep my spine intact.\nKlavier:\nCare to see where that wire goes?\nBuilding\nApollo:\nAn impressive building fit for an impressive school.\nAthena:\nYeah, and these beautiful walls are like a big blank canvas. See? My shoeprints leave really distinct marks.\nApollo:\nHey, cut that out before you get us in trouble!\nPulley or window\nKlavier:\nThis wire is for hanging banners over the stage. One of the policemen who was here earlier was checking how it worked.\nApollo:\nOh, so that's why the banner looks like it's out of place.\nKlavier:\nThe banners are hung and removed from the art room over there.\nAthena:\nThat's the art room over there? As in the scene of the crime?!\nKlavier:\nBingo, Fräulein. It's still crawling with cops, though.\nAthena:\nHey...! Anyone in the art room?!\nFulbright:\nOh, it's you people! Ha ha ha! In justice we trust!\nAthena:\nAh, it's Detective Fulbright! ...In justice we trust!\nKlavier:\nIs that some kind of a greeting between you two?\nAthena:\nDetective Fulbright! Can you lower that banner from there?!\nFulbright:\nOf course! Just leave it to me!\nFulbright:\nHow's that?! *huff* *puff* Whew!\nAthena:\nThanks, Detective! In justice we trust!\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! Always glad to help! In justice we trust!\nKlavier:\nSo, is that some kind of greeting between you two or not?\nApollo:\nWell, looks like the banner's down now. Let's go take a look.\nWindow (after examining pulley or window)\nAthena:\nThat's the art room -- the scene of the crime -- over there. Let's get Detective Fulbright's attention!\nApollo:\nWait. We probably shouldn't bother him unless we really need something.\nAthena:\nAww... I really wanted to do that whole \"In justice we trust!\" thing again.\nSide of school banner (after examining pulley or window)\nAthena:\nIt’s a little hard to see from this angle. Let’s look at it head-on.\nTied banner (after examining pulley or window)\nApollo:\nLook at this banner. I don't think it would flap very well in the wind.\nAthena:\nAn unflappable banner? Hey, I like that! It goes perfect with unflappable lawyers and unflappable rockers! It's like it was made for this very stage!\nApollo:\nLook at this. The bottom part is all knotted up. Lemme try and unravel it.\nAthena:\nGeez, did you really have to? You don't come across an unflappable banner every day!\nApollo:\nAthena, there are some things that have to yield to forces beyond themselves.\nAthena:\nWhat a cruel world we live in.\nApollo:\nHey, a scrap of paper was caught up inside. ...It's blowing away!\nAthena:\nI got it! ............Yes! Great catch, huh?! Looks like some kind of note. What does it say?\nApollo:\n\"October Hugh 120.\" What's that supposed to mean?\nAthena:\nA test score maybe? Pretty impressive when you consider that a hundred is a perfect score! (Changed from [A test score maybe? Pretty impressive when you consider that 100 is a perfect score!] in the original release)\nApollo:\nI don't see how even Hugh can get beyond perfect...\nKlavier:\nFräulein, shall we inspect the banner again, now that it has been unraveled?\n\"Hugh\" Scrap added to the Court Record.\nUnraveled banner (after examining tied banner)\nAthena:\nThis is the emblem that's on Junie's school uniform.\nApollo:\nHey, you're right. ...Wait a sec! It's hard to see against the red material, but look. There's a dark red stain here, just under the emblem.\nAthena:\nThis banner was on a wire connected to the art room.\nApollo:\nRight, and the art room is where the murder occurred. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?!\nAthena:\nThis stain might be from the victim's blood!\nSchool Banner added to the Court Record.\nUnraveled banner (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nThis is the emblem that's on Junie's school uniform.\nApollo:\nHey, you're right. ...Wait a sec! It's hard to see against the red material, but look. There's a dark red stain here, just under the emblem.\nAthena:\nThis banner was on a wire connected to the art room.\nApollo:\nRight, and the art room is where the murder occurred. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?!\nAthena:\nThis stain might be from the victim's blood!\nAfter examining restored Lady Justice statue and unraveled banner:\nAthena:\nWhew! That was a whole lot of poking around in such a short time.\nApollo:\nDoes that mean you're satisfied?\nAthena:\nActually, there was one more thing I wanted to check out. See that metal fence back there? There's just that one segment, so it seems out of place.\nKlavier:\nIt looks like they were in the process of removing them after the stage was set up. But they were never able to finish on account of the murder.\nApollo:\nWe should take a look if you think it could be important.\nAthena:\nHmm... This track looks man-made.\nApollo:\nHey, you're right. And it looks like it starts from behind the backdrop.\nAthena:\nMaybe a big muddy pro wrestler was hiding back there.\nApollo:\n.........Well, that was totally random, but we'll never know until we take a look.\nAthena:\nLooks like something was being dragged through here, and this is where it started.\nApollo:\nYeah, but whatever it was, it's long gone.\nKlavier:\nMust've been pretty heavy. Perhaps it was used in setting up the school festival.\nAthena:\nAww, then I guess it wasn't a pro wrestler. Still, this could be something important.\nApollo:\nWell, that's about it for the stage.\nAthena:\nRight. I think we'd better search the art room next.\nKlavier:\nI think I'll hang around here for a while. But make sure to tell me once you find it, ja?\nApollo:\nFind what?\nKlavier:\nWhat else? The Gavinners banner that disappeared from the stage. You never know -- it just might be connected to the case at hand.\nAthena:\n(Really? Or does he just want his banner back?)\n???:\nSss, sss, sss. Don't tell me... So, in short, that's...\nAthena:\nHm? Hey...\nApollo:\nThat box... It just took off running.\nAthena:\nI have a pretty good idea who that is, as I suspect you do, too. Come on! We can't afford to have any weird articles written about us!\nApollo:\nThe maintenance area's over in that direction. After that box!\nOctober 25Themis Legal Academy - Maintenance Area\nAthena:\n...Myriam, you're liable to get tossed in the garbage truck if you hang around here.\nScuttlebutt:\nI'm just an empty box. And that's what you do with them -- you throw them away.\nAthena:\nHey, did you change boxes? I like the new look.\nScuttlebutt:\nWhat does it matter anymore?! I was a complete failure in court today! My work, my pride, my dream -- everything I've worked so hard for... Gone!\nAthena:\nSorry, Ms. Scuttlebutt, but... ...doesn't believing you had a scoop when you really didn't make you a failure as a reporter?\nScuttlebutt:\nA f-failure as a r-reporter?! Kahk-kahk-kahk. Kaaahk kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk! Ack! ...Ah!!!\nApollo:\nCome to think of it, calling her a failure as a reporter might've been a bit extreme.\nAthena:\nNngh...\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss, sss! Scold me! Despise me! Pack me away where I'll never see the light of day! I've been cast aside to waste away into a big pile of mushy paper mache!\nAthena:\n(I kind of feel responsible for this, but...)\nApollo:\nNow's our chance to prod her for information while she's vulnerable! I bet that's what you were just thinking.\nAthena:\nWhat kind of a person do you think I am? (He read me like a book...)\nTalk\nScuttling Scuttlebutt\nAthena:\nThat was you on the stage earlier, wasn't it? Why'd you run off like that?\nScuttlebutt:\n......... Take a look... at this.\nAthena:\nWhy are you showing me a burnt up old rag?\nApollo:\nWait, it's really hard to see, but I think that's the Gavinners's logo there.\nAthena:\nSo, is this the banner that disappeared? It's all burned up.\nScuttlebutt:\nD-Don't look at me. I just happened to find it in the incinerator.\nAthena:\n(Incinerator? Did Blackquill actually make good on his threat to burn her box?)\nApollo:\nWe should probably try to find out whether someone tried to destroy this on purpose.\nAthena:\nYeah, this banner is sounding less and less unrelated to our case, Apollo...\nBurnt Fragments added to the Court Record.\nScuttling Scuttlebutt (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nThat was you on the stage earlier, wasn't it?

I owe you an apology. I shouldn't have said you were a failure as a reporter.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss... Too late. I already decided journalism isn't for me. The last step is to erase all of the photos on my PC! I'm really going to do it! Here goes! Five percent... Ten percent... Sss, sss, sss! Four years of my life down the drain!\nApollo:\nShouldn't we stop her, Athena?\nAthena:\nMyriam, you should keep publishing your paper. I didn't mean what I said, okay?\nScuttlebutt:\nYou didn't mean it? ...Oh, no, my photos! Stop! Cancel! Abort!\nAthena:\n.........Did you stop it in time?\nScuttlebutt:\nDeletion progress... Ninety-nine percent complete... There are only two pictures left. Sss, sss, sss. Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss, sss!\nApollo:\nWhat are you going to do now, Athena?! You owe it to her to make this right!\nAthena:\nI-I know...\nYour photo technique (appears after \"The depths of despair\")\nAthena:\nD-Don't worry, Myriam. Your photos may be gone... ...but the memory of your photographic genius will live on forever in all of our hearts!\nApollo:\nOoh... Athena. That was cringe-worthy.\nAthena:\nHey, Myriam, check this out! You took some amazing photos of the three of them. I'm sure they really appreciated it.\nScuttlebutt:\nObviously. I'm the ace member of the Newspaper Club. The only member, in fact!\nAthena:\nI know this won't make up for the photos you lost, but here are your newspapers back.\nThemis Herald and Themis Herald Extra returned to Myriam.\nScuttlebutt:\nThere's no rest for the wicked! I plan on pursuing those three for as long as I live.\nAthena:\nMyriam, why are you so obsessed with Juniper, Hugh and Robin?\nScuttlebutt:\nO-Obsessed?! I'm not obsessed with them! It's just, they were so close, ever since their freshman year, so uh... well...\nApollo:\nAthena, are you thinking what I'm thinking?\nAthena:\n(Yeah, I think that's the only explanation.)\nScuttlebutt:\nW-W-Wait a second! You're not thinking what I think you're thinking!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThat's exactly what he's thinking, Myriam. You want in on their little trio!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk! ...kahk-kahk!!! Kaaahk kahk-kahk-kahk!!! How could you possibly know thaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!\nApollo:\n...That's one abused laptop.\nYour photo technique (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nD-Don't worry, Myriam.

Kaaahk kahk-kahk-kahk!!! How could you possibly know thaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!\nApollo:\n...That's one abused laptop.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nScuttlebutt:\n...Kahk-kahk-kahk. My laptop won't turn on. Never thought my life would end so soon. A mere seventeen years...\nAthena:\n(Now I really feel bad.) Oh, I know! Myriam, we have a laptop at the office. We'd be happy to lend it to you.\nScuttlebutt:\nHuh? Y-You have a laptop I could use?!\nAthena:\nSure, but on one condition. I want you to ask Junie, Hugh, and Robin if you can hang out with them.\nScuttlebutt:\nWhat?! Like I could ever do that!\nAthena:\nSorry, but that's the deal if you want to borrow our laptop.\nApollo:\nYou scare me sometimes, Athena. You're like good cop, bad cop all rolled into one.\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk-kahk-kahk. Fine! I'll do it! If that's all you want!\nAthena:\nYay! I'll be by later to bring you the laptop!\nScuttlebutt:\nW-Wait! It's not like I owe you anything, but here.\nAthena:\nTh-Thanks. Oh, it's a set of pictures.\nApollo:\nLooks like they're setting up the stage.\nScuttlebutt:\nYeah, I took them when they were putting the stage's backdrop into place.\nAthena:\nWow, you sure have an eye for photography! (...From what I can make out, anyway.)\nScuttlebutt:\nThere are the last two photos that didn't get deleted. They're all yours.\nStage Set Up Photos added to the Court Record.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss, sss! Well, see you around, Scary Lawyer Lady!\nApollo:\nThat was really impressive, Athena. What's next?\nAthena:\nWell... I'd like to talk to Hugh or Robin if possible.\nApollo:\nOkay, let's walk around and see if we can find them!\nPresent\nLady Justice\nApollo:\nPretty impressive the way you fixed that so quickly.\nAthena:\nI wouldn't really say I fixed it. I just looked at the pieces to see how they fit together.\nApollo:\nToo bad we can't put Mr. Wright's statue back together, too.\nAthena:\nOh, I totally forgot! But we're running out of time, so...\nApollo:\nProsecutor Gavin and Lady Justice are back up, but Mr. Wright still lies there shattered. But that was totally your call. I promise not to say anything to Mr. Wright, as long as you don't make me run anymore.\nAthena:\nAh...! You wouldn't...! Would you?\nAthena:\n(Once we take care of this case, I'd better come back and fix Mr. Wright's statue, too!)\nOutdoor Stage\nExamine\nTracks on and near fence\nAthena:\nIt looks like something was dragged through the dirt here. The track seems to start from behind the backdrop.\nApollo:\nI wonder what could've made that.\nAthena:\nI wouldn't rule out a pro wrestler scraping by here.\nApollo:\nWow. Now you're getting oddly specific about your oddly random ideas.\nTalk\nContribution to the case\nAthena:\nI just wanted to say thanks for helping with our investigation!\nKlavier:\nNo danke necessary, Fräulein. I was doing this partly for myself, too. I also have access to police data and gear, what with my many fans on the force.\nApollo:\nI assume you always get official authorization, right, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nYou are such a stick-in-the-mud, Herr Forehead. Let's just say, I have my ways. So relax. Unlike Prof. Means, I believe there is no proper end without justifiable means. And that always includes a bright smile and some wicked air guitar.\nApollo:\nFor a second there, I thought we were going to get philosophical... for once.\nPresent\nBurnt Fragments\nKlavier:\nWhy are you carrying a sooty mess of fabric around?\nAthena:\nYeah, about that. This is kinda hard to say, but...\nApollo:\nThis is the banner you've been looking for. It was found in the incinerator.\nKlavier:\nWhat?! This ash and cinder?! That's all that's left?!\nAthena:\nSomehow, I don't think was a random act of vandalism.\nKlavier:\nYeah, it no doubt bears some relation to the case at hand. In short, this is a challenge directed at me and Gavinners fans everywhere. Mark my words, Fräulein. I WILL find the perpetrator behind the crime!\nAthena:\nGreat, thanks! (Does he mean whoever burned the flag... ...or the professor's killer? I'll just cross my fingers that they're one and the same.)\nWright Anything Agency\nPresent\nLady Justice\nTrucy:\nYou must be so disappointed, Athena. You can't master magic in a day. It takes practice, practice, practice.\nAthena:\nUm... I don't quite follow.\nTrucy:\nI'm talking about that jumbled mess of a statue. Look at all the cracks in that thing! I mean, you totally botched your restore-the-broken-statue trick, right?\nAthena:\nTrick? I wasn't trying to--\nTrucy:\nWhen you botch a trick, don't admit defeat by resorting to glue or things like that. Just smash it to bits and start all over again! Here, give it to me! I'll show you!\nAthena:\nN-N-No, don't! (I don't have time to put it together again!)\nOctober 25Themis Legal Academy - 3F Art Room\nAthena:\nWell, here it is -- the art room where the grisly crime occurred. Let's start looking--\nFulbright:\nStop right there! This is an active crime scene! No unauthorized personnel allowed!\nAthena:\nWhat? Can't you make an exception? You won't even notice we're--\nFulbright:\nFreeze! I don't think so! No exceptions! Now, move along! Nothing to see here!\nAthena:\nUgh. He doesn't seem very accommodating this time. Let's try again later.\nOctober 25Themis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway\nAthena:\nHey! That's Hugh over there! Hugh, we wanted a word with you, if you don't mind.\nO'Conner:\nIf it was Mr. Wright, then sure, but you two? Meh...\nAthena:\n(I knew it. There's a hint of discord in Hugh's voice.)\nApollo:\nYou're not getting off that easy. After all, you're a possible suspect, plus you actually confessed in court.\nO'Conner:\nWhatever. So, what do you want from me? But make it brief. I don't have a lot of time, and I assume you don't either.\nTalk\nWhy did you confess?\nAthena:\nAbout your confession today... You weren't serious about that, were you?\nO'Conner:\nLet's just say I had no choice thanks to a certain lawyer who failed to get the job done.\nAthena:\n*gulp*\nApollo:\nSo, you're really prepared to take the blame for this?\nO'Conner:\nNot gonna happen. The voice on the tape is female, so that rules me out. Let's put it this way: you don't actually believe that ridiculous play on words, do you? Well, my confession is just like that -- a means to an end. Or as we say around here... ...the end justifies the means.\nAthena:\n(Ugh. But I actually DO believe the voice is shouting, \"Hugh O'Conner!\")\nO'Conner:\nJuniper's confession was quite advantageous to the real killer. But if Robin or I were actually the killer, we wouldn't have confessed. It's that simple. Even you should be capable of such reasoning, or have I overestimated you?\nApollo:\nYou'll make a great lawyer someday. I mean, you seem to enjoy getting under people's skin.\nAthena:\n(Hmm... Could Hugh and Robin's confessions really prove their innocence instead of their guilt? This is going to take some serious thinking on my part.)\nRelation to Blackquill\nAthena:\nIt sure looked like Prosecutor Blackquill was twisting your arm to testify earlier today. Is there some sort of secret he's using against you?\nO'Conner:\n...I've no intention of saying anything more. Now, if you'll excuse me.\nBlackquill:\nHold! I am not through with you yet.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. It seems the rogue prosecutor has it out for me.\nBlackquill:\nLeave, and we just might discuss you-know-what.\nO'Conner:\nAck! N-No, wait!\nAthena:\n(One little statement and Mr. Cool loses it? What's that all about?)\nO'Conner:\nI changed my mind. ...I'll stay and testify.\nO'Conner:\nYou really are a rank amateur. Even if that were true, you think I'd open up to you?\nAthena:\n(So, he's not denying it. That secret might be causing the discord in his voice. Then again, we have the same problem with Junie and Robin.)\nO'Conner:\nHeh. You're just wasting your time and mine. Next question.\nCourte's planner (appears after \"Why did you confess?\" and \"Relation to Blackquill\")\nLeads to:\n\"About that meeting with Prof. Courte on the 23rd... Why did she want to see you?\"\nPresent\n\"Hugh\" Scrap\nAthena:\nIs it just me or is this your name here?\nO'Conner:\nHeh, that's my name, but how should I know what it's doing there? But being that the whole campus looks up to me... ...I'm not surprised to find my name mentioned here and there.\nAthena:\n(And I'm not surprised he said that, being the narcissist he is.)\nAthena:\nAbout that meeting with Prof. Courte on the 23rd... Why did she want to see you?\nO'Conner:\nI've no intention of telling you. You'll have to force it out of me any way you can.\nAthena:\nUgh... Prof. Means strikes again. (Then again, Hugh IS in the lawyer course.) But didn't Prof. Courte used to say that the only good result is the truth? So, why don't you drop this whole charade and just tell me the truth!\nO'Conner:\n...The truth. How can you be so sure it will help you solve this case? The truth isn't necessarily your friend, nor Juniper's for that matter.\nAthena:\nNo, you're wrong! I don't care what anyone says. I'm going to defend Junie the right way -- using the truth! (That's the only way to honor Junie's wishes and Prof. Courte's memory!)\nO'Conner:\nI see. Very well, Ms. Cykes. I'll testify tomorrow about that truth you're so interested in.\nAthena:\nHugh...\nO'Conner:\nBut... Heh heh heh. Don't look to me if something happens to Juniper because of it. Understand?\nAthena:\nWh-What's that supposed to mean?\nApollo:\nWhat a terrible thing to say. I thought you guys were friends?\nO'Conner:\nYes, we were. Until just recently, actually.\nAthena:\nWere?\nO'Conner:\nI already told Juniper, so I might as well tell you. I don't really care about her anymore.\nAthena:\nWhat? Why?\nO'Conner:\nJust as I have my secrets, she has a side you've never seen. Juniper's not all sunshine and rainbows like you think she is.\nAthena:\nWh-What are you saying?!\nO'Conner:\nThis conversation is over. I said I don't have a lot of time and I meant it.\nApollo:\nHugh, wait! .........He's gone.\nAthena:\nHe doesn't care about her anymore? Why would he say that?\nApollo:\nThat didn't go so well. I guess we'll just have to pin our hopes on his testimony tomorrow. Athena, what do you say we head over to the art room. Might be a nice change of pace. Hopefully, the police have completed their investigation.\nAthena:\nAll right. We don't really have much time left, anyway.\nOctober 25Themis Legal Academy - 3F Art Room\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! Why, if it isn't my little lawyer friends again!\nAthena:\nThanks again for lowering that school banner for us earlier.\nFulbright:\nDon't mention it. Helping those in need is what my brand of justice is all about!\nApollo:\nRight... So, this art room was where the murder actually occurred?\nFulbright:\nThat's right. You can't see it with the naked eye, but there's blood on the floor! That area roped off in the middle of the room marks the spot. The police investigation is done, so if you want to look around, knock yourselves out!\nExamine\nRoped-off area\nAthena:\nHey, this area with the rope around it...\nFulbright:\nThat's where we detected a large bloodstain. In short, the victim was stabbed here or somewhere close by.\nAthena:\nThe fact that there's no visible blood means it was wiped up with something, right?\nFulbright:\nRight. But we were able to detect trace amounts of blood. Merely wiping it up does not remove all evidence of wrongdoing! And that--\nAthena:\nIn a nutshell, is JUSTICE... right?\nFulbright:\nI'd appreciate it if you'd let me have the cool lines...\nClock\nAthena:\nThis is the clock that created that major problem for Junie. Let's take a closer look!\nFulbright:\nDon't waste your time! I've checked it, and it's a hundred percent accurate!\nAthena:\nYou sure? How'd you check it?\nFulbright:\nOf course I'm sure! I compared it to my own watch! See?!\nAthena:\nUm... Detective Fulbright, didn't you notice that your watch had stopped?\nFulbright:\nIt has? Ah... Ah! This is unacceptable!\nApollo:\nWe obviously can't rely on him. Let's take a look for ourselves.\nAthena:\nLet's see... Wait a second! It's ahead by one whole hour. Well, Detective?\nFulbright:\nAh... Argggh! B-B-But...!\nAthena:\nThis clock must've also been an hour ahead when this photo was taken! If so, that would fit perfectly with Junie's testimony. Prosecutor Blackquill won't like this. I almost feel sorry for the detective... Almost.\nApollo:\nYou can at least pretend to feel sorry by wiping that big grin off your face...\nFulbright:\nW-W-Wait just one minute! The clock is an hour ahead right now, sure! But what proof do you have that it was running ahead on the day of the crime?!\nAthena:\n(Hmm... That's a good question. Wait. I think I just might have something...) Detective Fulbright, you would agree that there is a moon outside this window, right?\nFulbright:\nSure, a nice crescent one -- like something out of a picture book. (Changed from [Sure, it looks like a nice drawing of a crescent moon.] in the original release)\nAthena:\nBut if you look at that window in the back with the winch attached to it... ...you'll see that the only view to be had is the opposite side of the school building.\nFulbright:\nOof! Then... Then what's this moon doing here?!\nAthena:\n(Hmm... I wonder...)\nAthena:\nProsecutor Gavin, you were scheduled to perform at the school festival, weren't you?\nKlavier:\nThat's right. But I hadn't seen this stage until yesterday. That backdrop with the starry sky and big crescent moon isn't half bad.\nAthena:\n(Isn't this the same as the one painted on the stage backdrop?) The proof's right here, Detective. This shows it was 6:00 PM when the photo was taken!\nPresent Stage Set Up Photos\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"I know what this moon really is.\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! Nice try! But evidence like that will never sway me from the true path of justice! It will also please Prosecutor Blackquill to know how wrong you were!\nAthena:\nUgh. Guess I blew that one. What now?\nFulbright:\nWhat's this?! Is that the voice of someone in need?!\nAthena:\n(Yeah, because of you!)\nLeads back to:\n\"The proof's right here, Detective. This shows it was 6:00 PM when the photo was taken!\"\nAthena:\nI know what this moon really is. And if you look at this photo, you'll know too. This shows where that moon in the photo came from and the truth of Junie's testimony.\nFulbright:\nWh-Wha-What?! Where?! Where does it show that?!\nAthena:\nIf you look right here, it will all become crystal clear!\nPresent board\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"They were still prepping the stage, so its backdrop wasn't in place yet.\"\nPresent anywhere else\nAthena:\nFulbright:\nWell, stop stalling! Tell me what I should be looking at!\nAthena:\nUm, right here. See where I'm pointing?!\nFulbright:\nVery funny. Now hurry up and show me what you're really talking about!\nAthena:\nUgh... (Guess that wasn't it. Let's think about it step by step. What was that moon in the photo really made of?)\nLeads back to:\n\"If you look right here, it will all become crystal clear!\"\nAthena:\nThey were still prepping the stage, so its backdrop wasn't in place yet. This photo shows them in the process of moving the backdrop into position.\nApollo:\nI can see that. That's the big board hanging here. The size matches, too.\nFulbright:\nBut there's no picture. That's a crucial detail.\nAthena:\nIt is, but I believe what we're seeing in this photo is the back of the board.\nFulbright:\nThe back of the...?\nAthena:\nThat's right. And at around 6:00 PM when this was taken... ...a photo of that same board was being taken from the front.\nFulbright:\nWhat do you mean the front? The front is against the wall!\nAthena:\nThat's where you're wrong. What about the window? Remember how we said the moon shouldn't even exist in this photo? Take a good look.\nFulbright:\nAre you suggesting the moon is the one on the backdrop?!\nAthena:\nExactly! In short, this photo was taken while the backdrop was being moved! And as you can see here, it was around 6:00 when the backdrop was being set in place. So, the art room clock was running fast at least as far back as the day of the murder.\nFulbright:\nHow-ow-ow... How can I ever face Prosecutor Blackquill now?!\nAthena:\n(Yes! I just blew a hole in a piece of the prosecution's evidence!)\nClock (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nThe photo taken with the school camera was from 6:00 PM or thereabouts.\nFulbright:\n*sob* How am I ever going to explain this to Prosecutor Blackquill?!\nAthena:\nHonesty is the best policy! Look him right in the eye and say you're sorry for screwing up!\nFulbright:\nYes, you're right! Only in sincerity is there justice! Plus, I'd like to avoid getting chewed out all over again.\nAthena:\n(Knowing Blackquill, Detective Fulbright's going to get chewed out no matter what.)\nTable next to easel\nApollo:\nHey, it's gone. Remember that strange statue in the school camera photo?\nAthena:\nYou're right. Wonder where it is? (Robin's a member of the Fine Arts Club. Maybe she can shed some light on this.)\nPalette\nAthena:\nThere's a paint palette here. No surprise there, considering this is the art room.\nApollo:\nLooks like someone mixed yellow and red to make orange.\nAthena:\nI prefer yellow. You, on the other hand, are way too red.\nApollo:\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\nAthena:\nI think this is saying that the two of us have to work together to solve this case. Ooh! What if this is Prof. Courte sending us a message from beyond the grave?!\nApollo:\nWhat about the blob right next to it -- the one with red and green?\nAthena:\nMaybe she's implying that you need more delicious greens in your diet?\nApollo:\nAre you saying Prof. Courte is watching over our dietary habits from the Pearly Gates?\nPhony Phanty mobile\nAthena:\nHey, look! That's you on this mobile, Apollo! A red demon!\nApollo:\nA red demon? Looks more like a snake curled around a brush to me.\nFulbright:\nNo, no, see the antennas and the yellow spots on its back! Anyone can see it's a ladybug!\nApollo:\nHmm... I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.\nFulbright:\nFine, we can investigate this further at a later date. Agreed?\nApollo:\nOkay, let's do that. You okay with that, Athena?\nAthena:\n(I really regret bringing this up.)\nPainting\nAthena:\nA picture of a girl wearing a floral hat... Oh, it has the artist's name right here. \"C. Courte.\" Wow, Prof. Courte must've painted this!\nApollo:\nSo is this what they consider art? I really don't get it.\nAthena:\nI swear I've seen this girl before. There's an air of fragility about her. And those pity-inducing eyes... Who is this again? Her name's on the tip of my tongue.\nWindow\nAthena:\nI can see the other half of the building over there, and the quad and the stage down below.\nApollo:\nYeah. This must be the window Detective Fulbright stuck his head out of earlier.\nAthena:\nOh, yeah, thanks for the help, Detective!\nFulbright:\nA true champion of justice always comes running to those in need!\nAthena:\nGreat, then how about telling us Prosecutor Blackquill's strategy for tomorrow?\nFulbright:\nAll right, let me think...\nAthena:\n.........Well?\nFulbright:\n.........Hm? Oh! Hey, I'm not falling for that!\nAthena:\n(So close I could almost taste it.)\nWinch\nAthena:\nSome wire and a winch... So this is how they reeled the banners in and out. There's a nice view of the stage from here.\nApollo:\nProsecutor Gavin is still standing in front of that broken statue.\nAthena:\nSo, it really wasn't you, Apollo? Don't worry, you can tell me. I won't tell anyone.\nApollo:\nArgh... I'll never clear my name unless we catch the real culprit!\nPottery\nAthena:\nLook, a piece of pottery. Looks like it's already been fired. I bet Robin made it.\nApollo:\nAnd I bet it won't last long, not with the way she deals with her own work, anyway.\nAthena:\nYeah, it seems like such a waste. I mean, this one already has some color on it. It looks just like bloodstains the way the glaze was dribbled on to it.\nApollo:\nJust like... b-bloodstains?\nFulbright:\nIn justice we trust! That DOES look like bloodstains. We'd better examine it at once!\nApollo:\nI get it. The victim was stabbed in the middle of the room where the big bloodstain is... ...and then brought over here, at which point, some of her blood dripped onto these pieces. That means the body very well could've been dropped from this window.\nAthena:\nIn the mock trial script, the body was dropped onto a mat. Then, a ball cart was used to move it over to the stage.\nFulbright:\nThe maintenance area is below this room, and the storehouse there has a mat and ball cart.\nAthena:\nSo, even the moving of the body was carried out just like in the script. The killer sure had a thing for Junie's script.\nFulbright:\nWell, what did you expect?! That's why we suspected the defendant in the first place.\nAthena:\nWell, you're wrong! And I'm going to prove it in court!\nShelf\nApollo:\nIsn't that a mock trial script? Actually, there's a whole bunch of them here.\nAthena:\nLet's see... Looks like everyone from the judge course submitted one.\nFulbright:\nThe victim Constance Courte was the Fine Art Club's advisor. So, she probably spent a lot of time up here in addition to her other duties. This isn't where I'd keep a bunch of scripts, but I'd wager that's how they wound up here.\nAthena:\nPoor stressed-out, overworked Prof. Courte! I know exactly how that feels!\nApollo:\nYou must, because your desk always looks like a tornado hit it.\nAthena:\nTsk, you're one to talk, Apollo!\nApollo:\nMe? What about Mr. Wright?\nAthena:\nMaybe we should rename the firm \"Wright Stuff-All-Over-the-Place Agency.\"\nBusts\nAthena:\nThree busts sitting on a shelf... A judge, a defendant and either a lawyer or prosecutor. The bearded one must be the judge, and the bummed out-looking one, the defendant.\nApollo:\nLook, there's another one that's fallen onto the floor.\nAthena:\nI wonder which one fell -- the lawyer or the prosecutor. Think, Apollo, think! This could tell us how tomorrow's trial will go!\nApollo:\nI'll... just wait for tomorrow's horoscopes, thanks.\nPainting on floor\nAthena:\nA picture of a girl wearing a floral hat... Oh, it has the artist's name right here. \"R. Newman.\" Wow, Robin must've painted this!\nApollo:\nIs this Juniper? The clothes are different, but...\nAthena:\nOh, look. There's a piece of paper stuck to the back. Let's see what it says... \"Completely lacks Prof. Courte's artistry. Must keep practicing. --Robin\" Huh... I think this is plenty good myself.\nApollo:\nI wonder what it would've looked like if Prof. Courte had painted Juniper.\nAthena:\nI bet it would've been really artistic looking.\nStatue\nAthena:\nIt kinda looks like there's a Prosecutor's Badge at the top of this statue.\nApollo:\nBut it's not if you look real close. Another strange, difficult-to-understand work of art...\nAthena:\nOh, look, it has a title. \"Guilty, Guilty, Guilty.\" Heh, real creative...\nApollo:\nArt... Either it's too abstract to understand or as subtle as a sledgehammer.\n\"Use\" envelope or mock trial script on floor\nAthena:\nA mock trial script on the floor, and nearby, an envelope marked \"Use.\"\nApollo:\nI wonder if Myriam's script was ever really inside that envelope.\nAthena:\nLet's see here... \"by Myriam Scuttlebutt.\" And the title is... \"Rouge et Noir: Crimson Blood and Dark Judgment\"\nApollo:\nI wouldn't take part in that mock trial if she begged me.\nAthena:\nIt says there are special rules allowing the payment of bribes while court is adjourned. Oh, and you can bring in up to three dollars worth of fabricated evidence. It also says... \"Welcome to the darkest mock trial ever, where the end justifies the means!\"\nApollo:\nThe prosecution claims this is the script that was supposed to have been used.\nAthena:\nBut the scripts were selected by Prof. Courte. Considering how much she valued the truth... ...I seriously doubt she's pick a script entitled \"Crimson Blood and Dark Judgment.\"\nApollo:\nWow, you have that title memorized already?\nTalk\nArt room investigation\nAthena:\nFind anything new, Detective Fulbright?\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! Good question! Unfortunately, the answer is nothing much yet!\nAthena:\n(He sure is confident for having found nothing...)\nFulbright:\nBut if we're talking outside of the art room, there has been a major breakthrough!\nAthena:\nOh, dear! Unless I find out what that is, I don't know what I shall do.\nFulbright:\nNo need for the theatrics. I was told I could fill you in on this one!\nAthena:\nWow, you saw right through me, Detective! I'm impressed.\nApollo:\nLooking to get arrested for murder via unwarranted flattery, are we?\nThe breakthrough (appears after \"Art room investigation\")\nApollo:\nSo, what's the major breakthrough you mentioned?\nFulbright:\nYou want to know?! You really want to know?! You really, really--\nAthena:\nCome on, just tell us, already!\nFulbright:\nAww, you're no fun. ...Anywho, we got the results of the voiceprint analysis back!\nAthena:\nVoiceprint? You mean for this tape recorder?\nFulbright:\nExactly. The voice belongs to the suspect Ms. Woods, beyond a shadow of a doubt! See right here?! They analyzed the voice on the tape inside and out!\nVoiceprint Analysis added to the Court Record.\nFulbright:\nAnd you thought the voice on the tape was saying, \"Hugh O'Conner!\" Ha ha ha ha ha! Thanks for the good laugh, Ms. Cykes!\nAthena:\nArgh! (He's the last person I want laughing at me!)\nApollo:\nSo now there's evidence of Juniper shouting, \"You're a goner!\" around the time of death. If we were to take this as truth, how are we supposed to make sense of it?\nAthena:\n(I don't know... I can't think of any reason why Junie would shout that in the first place.)\nThe breakthrough (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nSo, what's the major breakthrough you mentioned?\nFulbright:\nYou want to know?! You really want to know?! You really, really--\nAthena:\nCome on, just tell us, already!\nFulbright:\nAww, you're no fun. ...Anywho, we got the results of the voiceprint analysis back!\nAthena:\nVoiceprint? You mean for this tape recorder?\nFulbright:\nExactly. The voice belongs to the suspect Ms. Woods, beyond a shadow of a doubt! See right here?! They analyzed the voice on the tape inside and out! And you thought the voice on the tape was saying, \"Hugh O'Conner!\" Ha ha ha ha ha! Thanks for the good laugh, Ms. Cykes!\nAthena:\nArgh! (He's the last person I want laughing at me!)\nApollo:\nSo now there's evidence of Juniper shouting, \"You're a goner!\" around the time of death. If we were to take this as truth, how are we supposed to make sense of it?\nAthena:\n(I don't know... I can't think of any reason why Junie would shout that in the first place.)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nFulbright:\nHm? That was totally random. Well, two can play at that game! In justice we trust! How do you like them apples?! Pretty spiffy, huh? I polish the leather case to a rich luster daily. And once a week, I apply an anti-rust protectant to my badge!\nAthena:\nIs all that really necessary?\nFulbright:\nOf course, it is! A detective's badge is his first line of defense! I'm sure you treat your badge with tender loving care, too!\nApollo:\nAthena, I always see your badge gathering dust on your desk. And you usually scramble to find it right before leaving the office.\nAthena:\nNngh...... (Hmph. No comment!)\nMock Trial Script\nFulbright:\nThe mock trial is the key to this case. That much I'm sure!\nAthena:\nYeah, but even if the case and the script are similar, that doesn't mean Juniper's guilty. I already proved that in court this morning!\nFulbright:\nOh, right. This could be a problem. What to do, what to do!\nAthena:\nWell, we better get back to our investigation.\nFulbright:\nHey! Don't walk away like that! Even champions of justice need help sometimes!\nAthena:\n(Seriously? He wants me to help him convict our client?)\nAwl, Tape Recorder, or Voiceprint Analysis\nFulbright:\nThat's gonna give the prosecution a decisive advantage! Prepare to get owned tomorrow!\nAthena:\nI don't think so. We have new evidence that will blow your case out of the water!\nFulbright:\nOh, yeah? Well, Prosecutor Blackquill has a witness ready to deliver brand-new testimony! Plus, he has a new tie and a pair of even flimsier shackles just ready to break! Tomorrow's trial will be ours! In justice we trust!\nAthena:\nWell, tomorrow I'll be using a new shampoo and I'm changing breakfast cereals, too! What about you, Apollo?! What'll be new with you tomorrow?!\nApollo:\nI think we should approach the case with a fresh, new attitude. It's what's on the inside that's important. We'll be fine as long as we stand strong.\nAthena:\nW-Wow, Apollo! That was actually really inspiring!\nAnything else\nFulbright:\nI see! So, that's your symbol of justice! Well, here's mine! In justice we trust!\nAthena:\n(I'd be happy if I never saw one of those again.)\nAfter clearing \"The breakthrough\" Talk option and examining roped-off area, clock, table next to easel, winch, pottery, and \"Use\" envelope or mock trial script on floor:\nApollo:\nWell, I think we've examined pretty much everything we can. By the way, did Prosecutor Blackquill happen to tell you anything about tomorrow's trial?\nFulbright:\nIn justice we trust! It's no use trying to pry more information out of me! Having just learned that the clock had been one hour fast... ...means we're back to square one concerning the suspect's actions that day.\nAthena:\nHmm... I wonder what the main argument will be about now.\nFulbright:\nHow the body was moved would be my guess, but Prosecutor Blackquill's got his own plans.\nApollo:\nOh? Does he now...?\nAthena:\nUm, Detective Fulbright--\nFulbright:\nTry as you might, I won't say another word about the investigation!\nAthena:\nNo, I wasn't going to ask about that. I was just wondering if you'd seen Robin.\nFulbright:\nOh, you mean Ms. Robin Newman? She was just here a moment ago! And she mumbled something about watching videos in the Lecture Hall.\nAthena:\n(Video? What video?)\nApollo:\nThanks, Detective. ...Athena, I think we should stop by the Lecture Hall.\nAthena:\nRight, let's go!\nOctober 25Themis Legal Academy - 3F Lecture Hall\nAthena:\nThere she is! Robin! Hey, Robin!\nNewman:\nOh, Athena, Apollo!\nApollo:\nWhat are you watching there?\nNewman:\nHeh heh... Oh, it just so happens to be a video of the mock trial. I had to use a bit of coercion to get it, but the end justifies the means, right?\nAthena:\n(There it is again. Prof. Means sure has a lot of influence around here.)\nNewman:\nCare to look into the true connection between the murder and the mock trial with me?\nAthena:\nSounds great, but do you mind if we ask you some questions first?\nNewman:\nEh heh heh. Sure, I'll tell you anything you W-A-N-T.\nTalk\nWhy did you confess?\nAthena:\nAbout your confession today... Why'd you do it?\nNewman:\nBecause! Juniper hasn't done anything wrong! I had to stop the trial by any means possible!\nAthena:\nRight... The end justifies the means. So, you're a follower of Prof. Means, too?\nNewman:\nProf. Means is a wonderful teacher, as was Prof. Courte. I like them B-O-T-H!\nAthena:\n(She brushed that one off like a pro.)\nApollo:\nBut with that style of justice, you run the risk of breaking the law.\nNewman:\nWell... I'm prepared to quit school because of this case.\nAthena:\nWh-What? Why?\nNewman:\nI-I... I wanna be an artist! That's what I really want, maaaaaan! But noooooo! My parents forced me to study to become a prosecutor!\nAthena:\nBut if the trial went south, you'd have to drop out and give up on being a prosecutor... That's what you're really after, isn't it?\nNewman:\nMm-hm. *sniffle*\nAthena:\n(Talk about someone who literally changes at the bat of an eyelash...)\nApollo:\nI guess she's been dealing with her own problems, too. That totally makes sense.\nAthena:\n(Yeah, I suppose so, but that doesn't make what she did right.)\nThe day of the crime\nApollo:\nCould you tell us about what you were doing on the night of the murder?\nNewman:\nFinishing a statue. I was on the stage until the last bell.\nAthena:\nThat's right. You made the statues of Mr. Wright and Prosecutor Gavin, didn't you?\nNewman:\nOh, uh, yes... yes I did. Both of them.\nApollo:\nThis is just a formality, but can you prove you were making the statues at that time?\nNewman:\nC-C-CAN I PROVE IT?! YOU THINK I'M THE KILLER NOW?!\nApollo:\nN-No... That's not what I meant.\nAthena:\n(Both Hugh and Robin were still at school after 7:00 PM. But neither of them can prove exactly what they were doing. Could one of them really have murdered Prof. Courte?)\nNow that the secret's out...\nAthena:\nHave there been any problems now that everyone here knows you're a girl?\nNewman:\nHeh heh, no worries there! I discussed the matter with Prof. Courte some time ago. I told her I wanted to let everyone know I was really a girl. And just today I found out that she spoke with the school administration on my behalf.\nApollo:\nWow, they must really like you...\nNewman:\nI know, right? But now I can finally be myself here at school! I don't have to hide the fact that I love girly clothes! That's why, Athena, I simply must have this and... this by any means possible!\nAthena:\nWhat? B-But this is evidence we need for the trial. ...Sorry, but no can do!\nNewman:\nAww, don't be a party pooper, Athena. Come on, please? Pretty please?\nStage costume-related evidence taken in classic end-justifies-the-means style!\nAthena:\nOh, darn it...\nNewman:\nAnyway, thank you again, Athena! Thank you for revealing who I really am! I wanted everyone to know before the snitch found out!\nAthena:\nThe snitch? (Sounds like a new lead!)\nNow that the secret's out... (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nHave there been any problems now that everyone here knows you're a girl?\nNewman:\nHeh heh, no worries there! I discussed the matter with Prof. Courte some time ago. I told her I wanted to let everyone know I was really a girl. And just today I found out that she spoke with the school administration on my behalf.\nApollo:\nWow, they must really like you...\nNewman:\nI know, right? But now I can finally be myself here at school! I don't have to hide the fact that I love girly clothes! Anyway, thank you again, Athena! Thank you for revealing who I really am! I wanted everyone to know before the snitch found out!\nAthena:\nThe snitch? (Sounds like a new lead!)\nThe snitch (appears after \"Now that the secret's out...\")\nNewman:\nThere's a rumor going around that one of the students here is a snitch. I hear they're watching everything we do, our activities, our relationships, our interests... ...and reporting it all to one of the professors.\nApollo:\nBut why would anyone do that?\nNewman:\nOfficially, I heard it's to seek out misconduct among the student body... ...but rumor has it grades were being bought and sold through this surveillance network.\nApollo:\nThat's bribery. The situation at Themis Legal Academy is worse than I thought.\nAthena:\n(While all of this is important stuff, I still want to ask about that thing in the art room. I'll have to present some evidence to show her what I'm talking about, though.)\nCourte's artistic sense (appears after correctly presenting School Camera Photo)\nNewman:\nProf. Courte's artistic sense... That's a tough one. I'd say it's avant-garde and very eclectic.\nAthena:\n(In other words, it's weird and all over the place. Come to think of it, that strange-looking painting in the art room... ...was one of Prof. Courte's works, wasn't it.)\nNewman:\nThe statue in that photo was originally a statue of Lady Justice.\nAthena:\nLady Justice?\nNewman:\nProf. Courte had planned on placing it on the judge's bench in the Lecture Hall... Heh heh. But the day before the mock trial, it broke while she was polishing it. She said she'd take it back to the art room and try to fix it somehow.\nAthena:\nSo... this... is the statue in its proper state?\nNewman:\nYou bet! Just look at that wild silhouette! Wow! It's so C-U-T-E!\nAthena:\n(I... don't get it... Do you have to be an artist to appreciate stuff like this?)\nApollo:\nAthena... The Lady Justice that you put back together on that stage...\nAthena:\nOh, right. I didn't realize before because it was in pieces, but before it was smashed... ...maybe it didn't look like Lady Justice, but more like it does in the photo! But what in the world was it doing on the stage?\nLady Justice updated in the Court Record.\nCourte's artistic sense (subsequent times)\nNewman:\nProf. Courte's artistic sense... That's a tough one. I'd say it's avant-garde and very eclectic.\nAthena:\n(In other words, it's weird and all over the place. Come to think of it, that strange-looking painting in the art room... ...was one of Prof. Courte's works, wasn't it.)\nNewman:\nThe statue in that photo was originally a statue of Lady Justice.\nAthena:\nLady Justice?\nNewman:\nProf. Courte had planned on placing it on the judge's bench in the Lecture Hall... Heh heh. But the day before the mock trial, it broke while she was polishing it. She said she'd take it back to the art room and try to fix it somehow.\nAthena:\nSo... this... is the statue in its proper state?\nNewman:\nYou bet! Just look at that wild silhouette! Wow! It's so C-U-T-E!\nAthena:\n(I... don't get it... Do you have to be an artist to appreciate stuff like this?)\nApollo:\nAthena... The Lady Justice that you put back together on that stage...\nAthena:\nOh, right. I didn't realize before because it was in pieces, but before it was smashed... ...maybe it didn't look like Lady Justice, but more like it does in the photo! But what in the world was it doing on the stage?\nPresent\nStage Costume\nNewman:\nOoh, that's Juniper's stage costume! It's so C-U-T-E! Why don't you try it on, Athena?! C'mon, just try it!\nAthena:\nUmm, it's really pretty to look at. But it's really not my style with all the frills and stuff.\nNewman:\nWhat?! No, that's not true! I mean, there's a Cinderella inside every girl! You'd look great in anything! Just put it on and I'll brush on some yellow glaze. It's your favorite color, right?! Then it's in the kiln you go! How would you like that? Rare, medium, well done?\nAthena:\n(So when she said Cinderella, she literally meant burn me to cinders?)\nSchool Camera Photo (after clearing \"The snitch\" Talk option)\nAthena:\nRobin, I just remembered something I wanted to ask you. This photo shows a piece of art on the table. Do you know what it is?\nNewman:\nWH-WH-WHOOOOOOOOOA! Look at that unique artistic sense! That has to be one of Prof. Courte's creations, maaaaaan!\nAthena:\nProf. Courte's... artistic sense?\nLady Justice\nNewman:\nOoh! Lady Justice! That's sooo C-U-T-E!\nAthena:\nYou think this is cute?\nNewman:\nYeah, totally! The balance of the scales! The keenness of the sword! The cracks running all the way up!\nAthena:\nThat last one's only because I put it back together.\nNewman:\nOoh, I totally know what you mean! It's that feeling you get when something is so cute you want to smash it to bits! R-I-G-H-T? RAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!\nAthena:\n(Sorry, but that sounds more like a case of the crazy than a fondness for the cute.)\nStage Set Up Photos\nNewman:\nAww, maaaaaan... That's my blood, sweat and tears in a pile of rubble right there!\nAthena:\nWhy not make the statues again? I'm sure the two of them would be delighted.\nNewman:\nYeah! I could totally do that! And this time... ...I'm gonna make them even more realistic by making full body molds of the models!!!\nAthena:\nFull body molds? Um... are you sure that's safe? How about plain old measurements?\nNewman:\nOh, Athena. Measurements are for wimps! Full on YOLO is what art's all about! I'm gonna drop both of 'em in a big pool of plaster! YEAAAAAAH!\nAthena:\nI know I should stop you, but some part of me really wants to see how this plays out.\nAnything else\nNewman:\nYay! A present from Athena! Ooh, this is so exciting!\nAthena:\nUm... sorry, but it's not a present. I wanted to know whether you knew anything about it.\nNewman:\n*sob* ...That's not nice, Athena. Why are you so cranky today?\nAthena:\n(I wasn't until a moment ago.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nApollo:\nWell, I think that about covers it.\nNewman:\nOkay, then how about watching the mock trial video with me? What do you say?\nAthena:\nSure, sounds good to me. Er, so, how do you wanna watch it?\nNewman:\nEh heh heh. All classroom desks at this school have their own built-in computer, you know.\nApollo:\nWow, this place is definitely a lot cushier than I thought!\nNewman:\nI know you guys are in a hurry, so I'll just fast-forward to the important parts. Let's start with the professor's pre-trial speech.\n\"Good afternoon. I would like to start by thanking you for coming here today.\"\nAthena:\nOh, that sounds like Prof. Means.\n\"The mock trial, the crown-jewel event of the school festival will begin shortly!\"\nApollo:\nIs the camera like this the whole time?\nNewman:\nYeah, it's in a fixed position in front of the stage.\n\"When I was a student, I, too, could hardly wait for this day to come.\"\nApollo:\nHow come teachers' speeches always make me so sleepy?\nNewman:\nEh heh he. Let's just skip to the end of his speech.\n\"Now, let the mock trial begin!\"\nAthena:\nHey! What's the deal here? Why's Junie so large in this shot?\nApollo:\nLooks to me like she cut right in front of the camera.\nNewman:\nEh heh heh heh. Juniper was also in charge of the audio.\nAthena:\nEven though she was already playing a part in the mock trial itself?\nNewman:\nShe had to do it to keep the script details secret. She was all over the place that day. When she wasn't in the trial, she was in the audio control room dealing with the music.\nAthena:\nOoh, so this is what the Lecture Hall looks like.\nApollo:\nLooks like there's a judge's bench back by the screen, and a witness stand up front. What about those balconies with the professors' names on them?\nNewman:\nThose are the faculty seats. Prof. Means and Prof. Courte were in charge of scoring the mock trial.\nLecture Hall Diagram added to the Court Record.\nNewman:\nOkay, let's fast forward this a bit.\n\"...And that's why the defendant is... DEFINITELY GUILTYYYYYY!!!\"\nNewman:\nAh, that was me! Could you tell?\n\"Objection! A frail coed used her bare hands to stab her professor with an arrow? I don't think so.\"\nAthena:\nYou read that line in the mock mock trial, Apollo, but you made it sound kind of weird.\nApollo:\nCut me some slack. It was my first time reading that script.\nNewman:\nI think Juniper's going to speak next.\n\"I didn't do it! I had suffered a breakdown and pretty much lost it. It's true I shouted, 'You're a goner!' but I didn't mean it!\"\nApollo:\nWow, what an emotional performance. She'd put a real actress to shame.\nAthena:\nWait. Could you go back and play that scene again?\nApollo:\nYou really think that's necessary?\n\"I didn't do it! I had suffered a breakdown and pretty much lost it. It's true I shouted, 'You're a goner!' but I didn't mean it!\"\nAthena:\nStop! Did you hear that?!\nApollo:\nI think you're on to something! Let's play that last part again!\nNewman:\nI don't follow. What are you guys so excited about?\nAthena:\nI think this piece of evidence should explain it. (Time to show Robin a piece of evidence that links the line we just heard to the case.)\nPresent Tape Recorder\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"I'm sure you remember this. It contains a female voice shouting a violent threat.\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nNewman:\nThat's it?! I don't see the connection.\nAthena:\nOh, right... What was the connection again?\nNewman:\nC'mon, Athena! I know you know!\nAthena:\nI do? Really?! (That voice shouting, \"You're a goner!\" has come up over and over again.)\nLeads back to:\n\"Time to show Robin a piece of evidence that links the line we just heard to the case.\"\nAthena:\nI'm sure you remember this. It contains a female voice shouting a violent threat. I'll play it for you.\n\"...You're a goner!\"\nNewman:\nThe voices and performance do sound similar, but... I can't believe this is happening!\nAthena:\nIt's just a possibility, but if the voice on this tape is really a recording... ...one made from the mock trial video, then that means this evidence was fabricated.\nApollo:\nThey didn't get to do a voiceprint analysis in time for court today. That's why the gender of the voice became so important. And if the real killer had foreseen that gender would become key in today's trial...\nAthena:\n...He would've tried to deflect attention away from himself by making the suspect female. So basically, the only one with something to gain from doing this is our sole male suspect.\nNewman:\nWait a second! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!\nApollo:\nProf. Means's credo is \"The end justifies the means.\" So it makes perfect sense that a student who took those words to heart... ...would fabricate evidence. We need to get that tape analyzed as soon as possible!\nTape Recorder updated in the Court Record.\n???:\n......Allow me to assist you with that.\nAthena:\nProsecutor Gavin! At least make some kind of noise so we know you're there!\nKlavier:\nIt's go big or go home with rock star entrances, Fräulein. Timing is everything. Let me make a copy of that tape right now, and I'll get you the results as soon as I can. I trust that would be all right?\nAthena:\nVery much so! Thanks!\nApollo:\nWell, Athena? It's almost sundown. Isn't it about time we head over to the Detention Center?\nAthena:\nI think Junie will agree that this is something that could prove her innocence. But... (Will her heart really be open to accepting it? She had to have known this was what I'd find!)\nOctober 25Detention Center - Visitor's Room\nAthena:\n...And that about covers the main gist of our investigation.\nMeans:\nI see. Very interesting. You've been quite the busy beaver today.\nWoods:\nThank you for all your hard work, Athena. Well, my time's about up. And it will be getting dark soon, so...\nAthena:\nJunie!\nWoods:\nYou must be tired after being on your feet all day. You should go home and--\nAthena:\nNo, wait! You have to listen to me!\nWoods:\nI don't... I don't want to hear any more. I know what you're going to say, Athena.\nAthena:\nJunie, you promised.\nAthena:\nWe're going to discover the truth behind this murder mystery! And we're going to bring you solid evidence showing just what that truth is! If we succeed in doing that... ...I want you to promise that you'll accept it, Junie, no matter how hard it is to hear.\nWoods:\n............Okay. But only if it's the real truth.\nAthena:\nSo please. Please just listen to what I have to say. Once you've heard me out, I'll let you decide what to do.\nWoods:\n.........\nTalk\nSuspicions about O'Conner\nAthena:\nThe voice in this recording has been proven to be yours, Junie. And in the mock trial video, we can hear you reading your line from the script. We're having both of them analyzed now, but from what I can tell, the voices are the same. And the only one who'd benefit from faking the voice recording would be Hugh.\nWoods:\n......... But that doesn't make any sense. I mean, Hugh confessed in order to protect me!\nAthena:\nThis may sound strange, but his confession is a ploy to make himself look less suspicious. In other words, he was just pretending to protect you. Besides, his confession came after you and Robin had already confessed. If he hadn't confessed right then as well, wouldn't that have seemed a little suspicious?\nWoods:\n...Say what you will, Athena, but none of us would hurt a fly, let alone kill someone. Hugh is a gifted student. He gets outstanding grades and never causes trouble.\nBRACELET THUMPS\nApollo:\nWait. Athena. My bracelet reacted just now...!\nAthena:\nIt did? (But why?!) ......... Junie, can you look me in the eye and repeat what you just said?\nWoods:\nOh, um... none of us would hurt a fly, let alone kill someone. Hugh is a gifted student. He gets outstanding grades and never causes trouble.\nBRACELET THUMPS\nApollo:\nNow I'm sure of it. She's lying.\nPresent Bracelet\nWoods:\nHugh is a gifted student. He gets outstanding grades and never causes trouble.\nPerceive fluttering scarf on \"and never causes trouble.\"\nApollo:\nApollo:\nJuniper, you start coughing when you're under stress. You can't hide it from me no matter how hard you try. When you said, \"and never causes trouble,\" a cough escaped and made your scarf flutter. As for why you were stressed, it's because you were lying.\nWoods:\n.........\nAthena:\nJunie, you're trying to hide Hugh's connection to this case, aren't you? And I believe that also ties into a secret about yourself.\nWoods:\nA-A secret? About me? I don't understand.\nO'Conner:\nI already told Juniper. so I might as well tell you. I don't really care about her anymore.\nAthena:\nWhat? Why?\nO'Conner:\nJuniper's not all sunshine and rainbows like you think she is.\nAthena:\n(He ended their friendship after he found out about Junie's secret, which means... Hugh must've felt betrayed by Junie, making her...)\nThe killer\nAthena:\nYou're the killer! ...Just kidding.\nWoods:\n.........\nAthena:\nI had you going there for a moment, didn't I? Thought it might lighten the mood a bit.\nWoods:\n.........\nApollo:\nAthena, it's probably not a good idea for lawyers to punk their clients.\nAthena:\nAh... right... (Well, that didn't go as planned...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Hugh must've felt betrayed by Junie, making her...\"\nAn accomplice\nAthena:\nYou're an accomplice to the crime. You weren't at first, but you got involved to help cover for Hugh.\nWoods:\nAthena... I knew it was a mistake to ask you to be my lawyer. Maybe it's not too late to ask Prof. Means--\nAthena:\nN-No, wait! That was just a little slip up. (I better not hurt her feelings again. Time for some serious thinking.)\nLeads back to:\n\"Hugh must've felt betrayed by Junie, making her...\"\nThe snitch\nLeads to:\n\"You were Prof. Courte's snitch, weren't you?\"\nAthena:\nYou were Prof. Courte's snitch, weren't you?\nNewman:\nThere's a rumor going around that one of the students here is a snitch. I hear they're watching everything we do, our activities, our relationships, our interests... ...and reporting it all to one of the professors.\nAthena:\nAnd while fulfilling that role, you learned something about Hugh you'd rather forget.\nWoods:\nI-I don't know what you're talking about.\nAthena:\nJunie, please. Stop hiding things from me. I hate having to force things out of you like this.\nWoods:\n.........\nAthena:\n(Looks like we're going to have to do this the hard way. Time to review the evidence and see if I can't prove my hypothesis. I must have something that proves Junie's the snitch, and Hugh's connection to the case.)\nPresent Courte's Planner\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"Right here in Prof. Courte's Planner, it says, \"Routine Report.\"\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nWoods:\n...I'm relieved to see you're coming around. You see, I wasn't trying to hide anything.\nApollo:\nJuniper's one cool customer, Athena.\nAthena:\nW-Wait! I don't think that was the right piece of evidence.\nWoods:\nWhatever you show me won't change the fact that I've already told you all I know.\nLeads back to:\n\"I must have something that proves Junie's the snitch, and Hugh's connection to the case.\"\nAthena:\nRight here in Prof. Courte's Planner, it says, \"Routine Report.\" I believe this is meant to mean when the snitch would report in to Prof. Courte. I also believe Prof. Courte planned to meet Hugh in private based on the snitch's info. And from their meeting, Hugh must've put two and two together, and figured out your secret. So you see, it all makes sense only if you're the snitch, Junie.\nWoods:\n*sniffle* ...Aaah...! Forgive me... Forgive me, Thena. I... I... *sob* I've been lying to you this whole time! The truth is, I... I suspected Hugh from the start!\nAthena:\nYou did? (Now this is surprising...)\nWoods:\nI'm so sorry. I've talked about friendship so much, but I've been a terrible friend.\nApollo:\nJuniper, I don't have that special kind of hearing that Athena does... ...but I don't need it to sense the pain you're feeling inside. And its intensity is directly proportional to how you feel about your friend. Am I right?\nWoods:\n*sob* Apollo...!\nAthena:\nPlease, Junie, tell me why you suspected Hugh. I have a feeling that will be the key to getting to the bottom of this whole case.\nLeads back to Talk options\nPerceive wrong area\nApollo:\nApollo:\nThere it is. Juniper, you're feeling nervous, aren't you?\nWoods:\nNo. That's the one thing I'm not. The Student Council President isn't so easily shaken.\nApollo:\nNice try! But I just spotted a telltale habit of yours!\nWoods:\nHuh? I don't know what you're--\nAthena:\nApollo! It's you and your loud voice that's unnerving her.\nWoods:\nNo, I already told you, I'm not nervous! I'm not Student Council President for nothing!\nApollo:\nWell, in any case, it looks like I got that one wrong...\nLeads back to Talk options\nSuspicions about O'Conner (after perceiving)\nAthena:\nWhat exactly was your role as class snitch?\nWoods:\nProf. Courte had told me how academy alumni had strayed from the path of justice.\nApollo:\nThe dark age of the law, huh...\nWoods:\nShe didn't want any more of our students going astray like that. But few others at the academy shared her view.\nMeans:\nI thought her ideas were beautiful, though sad and unrealistic.\nAthena:\nShe asked you to be her eyes and ears, didn't she?\nWoods:\nI used to report to her once a month about any wrongdoings I'd seen or heard about.\nApollo:\nAnd that report session in her planner, the one from October 22nd, was a part of that?\nWoods:\nYes. That's when I reported Hugh to Prof. Courte.\nAthena:\n(She snitched on her own friend?!)\nYour report on O'Conner (appears after \"Suspicions about O'Conner\")\nWoods:\nI had accidentally overheard Hugh talking. (Changed from [I had accidently [sic] overheard Hugh talking.] in the original release)\nApollo:\nWhat did you hear?\nWoods:\nHe was talking to someone on the phone. I think it was one of his parents.\nAthena:\nWhat were they talking about?\nWoods:\nSomething about having paid money for good test scores. I only overheard him talking, so I never did find out who the money was going to.\nAthena:\nWhat?! (That's bribery! Hugh was buying his way through school, and if that's the case... ...then that evidence that always seemed out of place might actually be about his secret!)\nPresent \"Hugh\" Scrap\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"We found this while we were investigating the stage. It's got Hugh's name on it.\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nAthena:\nJunie, I was thinking that this might have something to do with the bribery...\nWoods:\nI-I'm not sure I see what you mean...\nAthena:\nOh, um, never mind then! (Besides, I know what this evidence is for...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Hugh was buying his way through school, and if that's the case...\"\nAthena:\nWe found this while we were investigating the stage. It's got Hugh's name on it. I didn't know what the number meant at the time, but now that I'm hearing about bribes...\nApollo:\n...it must mean that a bribe of 120 grand was to be paid in October.\nAthena:\nWhat's more, take a look at this mark. The same mark is on the pages of Prof. Courte's planner.\nApollo:\nHey, you're right!\nWoods:\nW-Wait... But would Prof. Courte have that kind of information in her planner? You don't really think the person who was taking the bribe money was--\nAthena:\nIt's just a possibility at this point, but it may indeed have been Prof. Courte.\nWoods:\nB-B-But...!\nMeans:\nTh-That is impossible! She'd be the last person I'd ever suspect of accepting bribes!\nAthena:\nLike I said, it's just a possibility. (But a rather good one. Maybe their private talk had to do with the possibility of the bribery being exposed. And what started out as a little argument soon got out of hand.)\nApollo:\nIt's not your fault, Junie. Anybody would've suspected Hugh if they knew what you knew.\nWoods:\nNo, I don't believe that alone would've driven him to murder. There's another reason why I suspected Hugh.\nAthena:\n(You've got to be kidding me. There's another reason?)\nYour other reason (appears after \"Your report on O'Conner\")\nLeads to:\n\"I saw Hugh around 7:00 PM the day before the mock trial.\"\nPresent\nTape Recorder or Voiceprint Analysis\nWoods:\nOh, that. It's my voice, isn't it?\nAthena:\nApparently, it's a recording of you reading your script during the mock trial.\nWoods:\nBut earlier, when you said it was Prof. Courte's voice -- that was quite shocking. I never would've imagined it was the professor yelling at Hugh.\nAthena:\nOh, uh, that? That was just... you know...\nWoods:\nThat was such an inspired leap of logic. You really are something special, Thena.\nApollo:\nYeah, it takes a special kind of person to make a claim like that with a straight face.\nAthena:\n(It doesn't take my sensitive hearing to detect dripping sarcasm, genius.)\n\"Hugh\" Scrap\nAthena:\nJunie, can you tell us anything about this?\nWoods:\nI don't really know what to say. Um...\nAthena:\n(She went silent. Seems like she doesn't want to talk about it.)\nWoods:\nI saw Hugh around 7:00 PM the day before the mock trial.\nAthena:\n(Oh, so she's finally ready to talk about that.)\nWoods:\nWhen I... When I saw him... his... his....! *cough* *cough* Oh... Thena! *cough* *cough, cough*\nAthena:\nJ-Junie, are you all right? Just try to relax and tell me what happened.\nAnime cutscene\nWoods:\nI... I never wanted to see what I did... But I'll have to live with it, won't I...?! In that hallway... H-Hugh's hands... His hands were... dripping with blood...!\nWoods:\nHis hands were... dripping with blood...!\nAthena:\n(What?! But why?!)\nWoods:\nWhat am I... going to do? Deep down, I know Hugh can't be the killer! But my mind keeps telling me he is, no matter how hard I try to convince myself he isn't! Oh, what am I going to do?! Hugh... Hugh... He's...! I... I can't take this anymore, Thena!\nAthena:\n(So she hid the fact that she had seen Hugh and said she went home at six because... ...she wanted to avoid talking about what she saw...) Junie... It must've been terrible holding all of that in. But it's going to be okay. I'll get to the bottom of this. And that's my promise from one good friend to another. I'll be defending Juniper tomorrow. If that's okay with you, Prof. Means.\nMeans:\nMy main concern is whether you can defeat that prosecutor. ...But I won't try to stop you. I will be watching from the gallery. And shall look forward to seeing what sort of results your methods can produce. Good luck tomorrow. Now, if you would excuse me.\nWoods:\nThena... I'm sorry. I really mean it. I wish I had trusted you from the start. You have to uncover the truth tomorrow. I know you can do it.\nApollo:\nDon't worry. We already know that the prosecution's key piece of evidence is a fake. And thanks to you, we figured out the motive, too. Let's give this our best shot, Athena. Let tomorrow be the day Juniper walks free!\nAthena:\nI wouldn't have it any other way! (We should be all ready now. What could possibly go wrong this time?! Still... There's this strange, uneasy feeling I can't shake... I'd better be imagining it.)\nTo be continued\nNothing to examine during investigation\nAthena:\nThere's really not much of interest here.

Yesterday's adjournment was unexpected, yet necessary. But I'll be running a tight ship here today, so no funny business from anybody, understood?Blackquill:\nYour Baldness, Robin Newman and Hugh O'Conner have recanted their confessions. But later, I shall grill them at leisure to find whether I can charge them with perjury.Judge:\nWell, this sure complicates matters. Still, one must not overlook the facts. Now, about the school camera photo that was submitted yesterday--Blackquill:\nA pity, but that evidence is no longer relevant to this case. The art room clock runs fast. It cannot function as an accurate measure of time. As for the bungling detective who overlooked that, he is paying for his failure as we speak.Athena:\n(Poor Detective Fulbright. I hope he returns to work with all his body parts intact.)Judge:\nHmm... But if that's the case, then what will we--Blackquill:\nThe accused is the sole person who could have moved the body from art room to stage. And I mean to prove it here this day.Athena:\n(It's just like Detective Fulbright said. But what else does he have up his sleeve?)Blackquill:\nMy understanding of this heinous crime is thus. The murder took place near the center of the art room, as evidenced by the bloodstain. Blood was also found on some pottery next to the window over the maintenance area. Which is to say the body was carried over to that very window. From there, it was dropped down to the maintenance area below. And though there was nary a scratch to the body aside from the fatal wound... ...that, too, was per the script. A high jump mat was employed to cushion the fall. Then, a ball cart was used to haul the body over to the stage.Athena:\nThat's not very clever. I mean, it's the same exact body moving scheme as the script. Anyone could've moved the body that way.Blackquill:Blackquill:\nYour propensity to spew forth words before you think is not very clever, either.Athena:\nWhy you--!Blackquill:\nMoreover, the prosecution has a witness, which is most unfortunate for you. Witness! It's time for you to come forth!O'Conner:\n.........Heh.Judge:\n*ahem* Well, then, will the witness please state his name and occupation.O'Conner:\nHugh O'Conner. I'm a senior at Themis Legal Academy, and I'm studying to be a lawyer. Yesterday, I told that lawyer there that I would testify to the truth. So, I intend to cooperate fully in today's trial. Happy now, Ms. Cykes?Athena:\nNrgh... (What's he up to now?)Judge:\nThe court appreciates your cooperation, Mr. O'Conner. Now, your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- What O'Conner Saw --O'Conner:\nThe Lecture Hall was packed before the mock trial, but the rest of the campus was empty.\nThat's when I saw Juniper dragging a large mat from behind the stage.\nI was watching her from a vantage point between the stage and the maintenance area.\nShe was heading towards me, so I assume she was on her way to the maintenance area.\nBut I didn't have time to stand around and see what she did after that.O'Conner:\nThe real truth hurts so much, doesn't it, Ms. Cykes? Or maybe you thought I was going to bring up something else entirely against your client?Athena:\nUgh! (Never a snappy comeback when I need one!)Apollo:\nHe's coming straight at us today, using any means possible.Blackquill:\nTo protect the students who had to climb up high when setting up the stage... ...a mat was brought over to the stage from the storehouse.Athena:\nOur client is the Student Council President! What's wrong with her taking it upon herself to put the mat away after they'd used it?Blackquill:Blackquill:\nOh, there is plenty wrong. There is but one mat in the entire school that could cushion a fall from such lofty heights. Ergo, the mat in question was indispensable to moving the body!Athena:\nArrrgh! (It sucks being the last to know everything.)Apollo:\n......I think I get it now. The drag marks we saw behind the stage were made by the mat.Judge:\nHmm... If the only mat of that thickness was where the body is assumed to have been dropped... ...it would be hard to deny a possible link to this case.Apollo:\nWe're off to a bad start again. You sure you're okay, Athena?Athena:\n...It's game on, Hugh. Game on. I'm gonna turn your arrogant perfect-score grin into a teary-eyed frown of failure!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What O'Conner Saw --O'Conner:\nThe Lecture Hall was packed before the mock trial, but the rest of the campus was empty.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nHold it!

Your heavy breath heaves to where I stand.\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nTsk, how rude! A human's breath doesn't travel anywhere near that far!\nO'Conner:\nSo, the only issue is distance? You're not denying that you're a heavy breather?\nAthena:\nArgh! I'm just saying that scientific studies have proven that it's not--\nApollo:\nHang in there, Athena. No matter how many insults they hurl, it won't affect the judge's opinion of you.\nAthena:\n(What about my own self-esteem?!)\nO'Conner:\nHeh. Let's get back to what happened before the mock trial.O'Conner:\nThat's when I saw Juniper dragging a large mat from behind the stage.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nOur client was simply putting the mat away. It had nothing to do with this case.\nBlackquill:\n\nBlackquill:\nThat is where you are wrong. There is but one mat in the entire school that could cushion a three-storey fall. Hence, the mat dragged by the accused was essential to moving the body.\nAthena:\nUgh! (If we win this one, I promise to donate another thick mat to the academy.)\nO'Conner:\nNow, show me how to show you the truth. You'll have my full cooperation.O'Conner:\nI was watching her from a vantage point between the stage and the maintenance area.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nMr. O'Conner, are you positive you were standing exactly where you said?\nO'Conner:\nI was between the stage and maintenance area, and she was behind the backdrop.\nAthena:\n(Hmm, he's sticking to his guns. The issue here is where Hugh was standing when he says he saw Junie. But nothing I say will mean anything without evidence. Time to dig a little deeper...)\nO'Conner:\nOh, and before you ask, I had my glasses on. Therefore, I'm positive it was Juniper. That is not an issue.Present Stage Set Up Photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nLeads to:\n\"So, you saw the back of the stage from the between the stage and the maintenance area?\"O'Conner:\nShe was heading towards me, so I assume she was on her way to the maintenance area.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nYou shouldn't assume anything! It only shows that you're NOT positive!\nBlackquill:\n\nBlackquill:\nSuch wild momentum. Perhaps you were a raging bull in your past life.\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nTsk! Don't compare me to some stupid farm animal!\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Hoy, Justice-dono!\nApollo:\nOur assertion is Juniper was simply putting the mat away. In that case, where would she be taking it?\nAthena:\nOh, umm... to the storehouse... over in the maintenance area...\nBlackquill:\nPrecisely. Therefore, there is naught wrong with witness's judgment in this matter. It is your wild charges that are the issue here. But I cannot help it if you keep seeing red.\nApollo:\nHe's going to get a face full of Justice, Apollo-style, if he keeps that up.\nO'Conner:\nHeh... Anyway, I saw her heading towards me...O'Conner:\nBut I didn't have time to stand around and see what she did after that.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nThen it's entirely possible someone else moved the body, correct?\nBlackquill:\n\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Are you mad or merely delusional? Everyone was in the Lecture Hall before the mock trial. The rest of the campus was empty. Ergo, the only probable suspects were the three trial participants.\nAthena:\nI know. Thank you for stating the obvious. (I also know that you, Hugh O'Conner, were one of the participants.)Apollo:\nMr. Confidence sure goes all out when he tells the \"truth.\"Athena:\nWell, I don't think he meant for any of that to be misleading, but it doesn't make it factual.Apollo:\nCareful now, Athena.

Taken on the day of the murder.\nEvidence 12\nName: School Banner\nDescription: A large banner that was hung by a wire between the stage and art room. A trace amount of blood was found on it.\nEvidence 13\nName: Purple Fragment → Purple Fragments\nDescription: A purple fragment from a broken statue. It was found all alone in the strangest of places. Two purple fragments of a broken statue. Going to search for more. Three purple fragments of a broken statue that originally stood on a pedestal onstage.\nEvidence 14\nName: White Fragment → White Fragments\nDescription: A large, white fragment. It has a distinctive shape that could be described as angular. Two large, white fragments. It looks like it would feel good to break them.\nEvidence 15\nName: Lady Justice\nDescription: This and the statue of Klavier were broken at the same time, but have been repaired. No one knows where it came from. It was found broken onstage. Professor Courte had remade it into a completely different-looking statue the day before the mock trial.\nEvidence 16\nName: \"Hugh\" Scrap\nDescription: Discovered onstage, it appears to be a piece of paper torn from a notebook. The name \"Hugh\" is written on it.\nEvidence 17\nName: Burnt Fragments\nDescription: The burnt remnants of the Gavinners banner that was tossed into the incinerator and later found by Myriam.\nEvidence 18\nName: Stage Set Up Photos\nDescription: The last two of Myriam's photos. They show the students setting up the stage's backdrop on the night of the murder. (2 photos.) [caption] There is a tall construction screen between the stage and the vantange point near the maintenance area. Two banners are lying on the stage. A person is watching the stage. Another person is making a sculpture on the stage.\nEvidence 19\nName: Voiceprint Analysis\nDescription: The results of the voice analysis performed on the tape recording.\nEvidence 20\nName: Lecture Hall Diagram\nDescription: A diagram of the lecture hall where the mock trial took place.\n\nTestimonies:\nTestimony 0\nTestimony: The Lecture Hall was packed before the mock trial, but the rest of the campus was empty.\nPerson: O'Conner\nTestimony 1\nTestimony: That's when I saw Juniper dragging a large mat from behind the stage.\nPerson: O'Conner\nTestimony 2\nTestimony: I was watching her from a vantage point between the stage and the maintenance area.\nPerson: O'Conner\nTestimony 3\nTestimony: She was heading towards me, so I assume she was on her way to the maintenance area.\nPerson: O'Conner\nTestimony 4\nTestimony: But I didn't have time to stand around and see what she did after that.\nPerson: O'Conner\n\nWhich evidence and testimony contradict each other?

I'm gonna be late! *huff* *puff* Whew, finally. So, this is it... the illustrious Themis Legal Academy. (This is the place where many distinguished lawyers and prosecutors got their start. When news spread that Mr. Wright had gotten his attorney's badge back... ...he received a call from this school, asking him to pay a visit. Mr. Wright brought us along, hoping we'd learn something from the experience. But no, I had to go and blow it by getting here thirty minutes late. At least it's not all business today! After all, today's their school festival!)\nOctober 24, 1:29 PMThemis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway\nAthena:\n(Wow! This place has school festival written all over it... literally! But why all the cold stares? Is it because everyone's in a school uniform except me? Well, I like the way I dress! Wonder where Mr. Wright and Apollo are?)\nYour attention please. This is an announcement from the Mock Trial Committee. The mock trial will begin shortly. All students and faculty please proceed at once to the Lecture Hall. Thank you.\nAthena:\n(Sounds like a mock trial is about to start, but where's this Lecture Hall? Looks like all the students and faculty are heading that way. Might as well join them. Maybe I'll find Mr. Wright and Apollo there!)\nOctober 24, 1:33 PMThemis Legal Academy - 3F Lecture Hall\nAthena:\n(This must be the Lecture Hall. Wow, they spent some serious money on this place. The District Court can't even compete.)\nHey, Athena! Over here!\nAthena:\nAh, Mr. Wright! Apollo! I've been looking for you two. I'm so sorry I'm late.\nPhoenix:\nIt's okay. Sorry we couldn't wait for you. But we didn't want to be late for our meeting.\nApollo:\nLucky for you, the person we're supposed to meet also seems to be running late.\n???:\nMr. Wright, Mr. Justice, it seems Prof. Courte has yet to arrive. How un-professorial of her to keep visitors to our esteemed institution waiting like this! I shall make her write \"I will not--\" ...Oh, who do we have here?\nPhoenix:\nOh, right. You haven't been introduced yet.\n???:\nAh, yes. You must be the young lady Mr. Wright was telling me about. I am Aristotle Means, a professor at this hallowed hall of learning.\nMeans:\nI oversee the lawyer course here. It is a pleasure to meet you.\nAthena:\nI'm Athena Cykes! I just recently got my attorney's badge myself! It's nice to meet you, too!\nMeans:\nHow wonderful! So vigorous and vivacious. You just earned yourself a gold star.\nAthena:\nWow, thanks! (That big smile of his is kinda scary, though.)\nApollo:\nLooks like the mock trial's about to begin. What are we going to do about our meeting?\nAthena:\nOh, speaking of the mock trial, do either of you know what it's about?\nMeans:\nOh, but I thought we had sent a pamphlet to your office.\nPhoenix:\nRight, the pamphlet... Whatever happened to that?\nAthena:\nYou won't be seeing it again. Trucy used it for the old rip-it-up-and-restore-it trick. ...Unfortunately, it didn't work as advertised.\nMeans:\nWell, it seems I had better explain the situation, then.\nPhoenix:\nThank you, Professor.\nTalk\nThemis Legal Academy\nMeans:\nNow, does anyone have any questions?\nAthena:\nI do, professor! Could you tell me all about your school?!\nMeans:\nWhat an excellent question. Here's a gold star for asking! Our academy has three courses to choose from. Students seeking to be lawyers take the lawyer course. Likewise... ...budding prosecutors take the prosecutor course, and future judges, the judge course.\nAthena:\nWow, you have everything here for someone who wants to seriously pursue a career in law!\nMeans:\nYes, well, that's what makes our school special, and today even more so. After all, we are to be treated to a lecture by the legendary attorney Phoenix Wright. We can't wait to hear all about his return to the legal profession.\nAthena:\nYou're giving a lecture, Mr. Wright? But you're not even a professor.\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha. Yeah, well I'm just giving them what they want.\nToday's plans (appears after \"Themis Legal Academy\")\nAthena:\nUh, did you even know you were meant to be giving a lecture here today?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, sort of. But I came early because I was supposed to have a meeting... ...with the head of the judge course, Constance Courte.\nApollo:\nIt's been a whirlwind of a morning. Let's leave it at that.\nMeans:\nProf. Courte... She is a wonderful instructor, but quite unpunctual.\nAthena:\n(Oh, so that's who's late.)\nMeans:\nFrom what I've heard, our esteemed Mr. Wright here... ...is scheduled to hold a training seminar tomorrow, in addition to today's lecture.\nAthena:\nA training seminar? For lawyers? What exactly does that involve?\nMeans:\nWhy, it involves the very skills that make a lawyer, a lawyer! The arm angle when shouting, \"Objection!\" The proper way to strike the podium... How to project one's voice... And most importantly, how to bluff your way to victory!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Um, who exactly do you want me to teach stuff like that to again?\nMeans:\nWhat a wonderful question. You just earned yourself a gold star! The great honor of taking a seminar by a famous lawyer and a famous prosecutor... That is what is at stake in this mock trial, the crown jewel of the school festival.\nThe mock trial (appears after \"Today's plans\")\nLeads to:\n\"The mock trial in question is a prestigious event that every student aspires to win.\"\nPresent\nAnything\nMeans:\nWhat magnificent presentation technique! Both your timing and speed were impeccable.\nAthena:\nSpeed?! You mean speed's important when presenting evidence, too?\nMeans:\nAbsolutely! The speed and approach angle theorems are the first things we teach here! I believe Mr. Wright and others like him already make extensive use of them.\nAthena:\nYou do, Boss?!\nPhoenix:\nWell... to some degree, I guess, ah ha ha.\nAthena:\nIt never even crossed my mind. (This lawyer thing is deeper than I thought!)\nMeans:\nThe mock trial in question is a prestigious event that every student aspires to win. The top student in the lawyer course and the top student in the prosecutor course... ...face off in a simulated court case set in this very school! As for the case itself... ...we select the best script written by a judge course student and base our case on that!\nAthena:\nOoh! A one-on-one battle?! How thrilling!\nPhoenix:\nSo, if the student studying to be a lawyer wins, they get to take my training seminar? But what if the other student wins? I'm not a prosecutor, so...\nMeans:\nThere's no cause for alarm. We have a famous prosecutor ready for just such a case. But exactly who it is, well, that is a special surprise!\nAthena:\nA famous prosecutor? (No, it can't be...)\n???:\n...Prof. Means, forgive me for interrupting you and your guests. I'm Juniper Woods, a senior in the judge course. (Changed from [I'm Juniper Woods, a third year in the judge course.] in the original release)\nWoods:\nProfessor, the trial will begin shortly. Since you'll be delivering the pre-trial speech... ...would you mind waiting up in the balcony until we're ready for you?\nMeans:\nMy, how very organized you are, Juniper. You just earned yourself a gold star, too. But what about Prof. Courte... Well, I suppose she'll eventually arrive. Now then, I trust you will look after our visitors, Juniper?\nWoods:\nYes, of course, Prof. Means.\nAthena:\nJuniper? Juniper Woods? Is that you?\nWoods:\nHm? ...Then-- Athena?! I almost didn't recognize you. I didn't know you were back from Europe.\nPhoenix:\nWait, you two know each other? Now that's a coincidence.\nAthena:\nWe've known each other since we were kids. We're like best friends, right, Junie?!\nWoods:\nYes... Well, we lived close to each other, so we used to play in the forest together.\nAthena:\nYeah, like a lot a lot. (Why won't she look at me? I guess I shouldn't be surprised since we haven't seen each other in a long time.)\nApollo:\nAnyway... we're supposed to go wait in the waiting room, right? Not that I wouldn't mind taking in the mock trial you're putting on today.\nWoods:\nUnfortunately, the mock trial is only for students and faculty. There is one seat reserved for Mr. Wright, but no other exceptions are allowed.\nMeans:\nYes, I'm very sorry, but it is part of the student curriculum, after all. I hope you won't mind remaining in the waiting room until the trial concludes.\nApollo:\nOh, that's too bad. I was hoping to learn something new today.\nPhoenix:\n...I'll tell you what, Apollo. Why don't you take my place?\nApollo:\nWhat? Really?\nPhoenix:\nSure. Besides, I'd like to meet with Prof. Courte as soon as she gets here.\nAthena:\nAw, no fair! I wanna see the mock trial, too!\nPhoenix:\nSorry, I'm going to let Apollo pull what little rank he has. ...If it's okay with Prof. Means.\nMeans:\nBut of course, Mr. Wright, if that is what you wish.\nPhoenix:\nIt's settled, then. We'll expect a full and detailed report, Apollo, so pay attention!\nAthena:\nTsk, being the new kid sure stinks.\nWoods:\nIf you would please follow me. I'll escort you down to the waiting room on the first floor.\nOctober 24, 2:15 PMThemis Legal Academy - 1F Waiting Room\nAthena:\n(Still no Prof. Courte... It's been over thirty minutes. And Mr. Wright's snoozing away on the sofa. This is so boring. I should've hid in the Lecture Hall and spied on the mock trial.)\n*crash*\nAthena:\nEek! Wh-What was that?!\nOctober 24Themis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway\nPhoenix:\n*yawn* ...Athena. I could've sworn I just heard something fall down and break. If you go running now, they'll think it was you.\nAthena:\nW-Well it wasn't me. I think it came from somewhere outside.\nPhoenix:\nOh. Well, we better go have a look, seeing as everyone else is in the Lecture Hall.\nAthena:\nOkay!\nOctober 24Themis Legal Academy - Outdoor Stage\nAthena:\nIs this stage for some sort of concert? It kinda reminds me of a courtroom.\nPhoenix:\nWait, Athena. Behind the witness stand!\nAthena:\nWhat? Eeeeeeeeek!\nPhoenix:\nProf. Courte! Can you hear me?! Professor!\nAthena:\nWait, that's... that's who we were supposed to be meeting with?!\nPhoenix:\n......... It looks like our meeting's been canceled for us.\nAthena:\nNo way! This... This can't be real...!\nAthena:\nI called the police. They should be here soon. ...I'll go tell everyone in the Lecture Hall, too.\nPhoenix:\nNo, wait. They'll find out soon enough once the police get here. Let's do our own crime scene investigation before it gets too crowded around here.\nAthena:\nHuh?! Are we even allowed to do that?\nPhoenix:\nIt's no big deal, as long as we leave it exactly like we found it. Plus... No, never mind. Anyway, we should look around while the scene's still fresh.\nAthena:\nBut...... Okay, you're the boss.\nExamine\n\"67th School Festival\" sign, backdrop, defense bench, prosecution bench, judge bench, witness stand, or piles of rubble\nAthena:\nWe should start by studying the body. Hmm, I wonder what's the best angle for this?\nConstance Courte's body\nAthena:\n(Ugh. I guess I really do have to examine the body... Well, guess I'd better get used to stuff like this if I want to be a full-fledged lawyer!)\nArrow\nAthena:\nUgh... There's an arrow stuck in her side. Gunshot wounds and stab wounds are pretty common, but arrow wounds?\nPhoenix:\nThis is a homicide any way you slice it. In other words, we have a murder on our hands.\nAthena:\n(A murder?! Here?!) S-So, that makes this arrow the murder weapon. Well, that and the bow that shot it.\nPhoenix:\nRight, but where could the killer have shot her from? The stage is a sea of obstructions? I'm no expert on archery, but it can't be easy to hit a target with this much stuff around.\nAthena:\nWould it be possible to kill someone by stabbing them with an arrow?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure. Guess we better do some more investigating before jumping to conclusions.\nArrow added to the Court Record.\nArrow (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nUgh... There's an arrow stuck in her side. Gunshot wounds and stab wounds are pretty common, but arrow wounds?\nPhoenix:\nThis is a homicide any way you slice it. In other words, we have a murder on our hands.\nAthena:\n(A murder?! Here?!)

Guess we better do some more investigating before jumping to conclusions.\nPlanner\nPhoenix:\nWhat do we have here...? A book? I'm guessing it fell out of her chest pocket.\nAthena:\nWait! What if it's her diary?! That's the most private thing a girl has!\nPhoenix:\nTrue, but considering the situation at hand, my apologies to the late Prof. Courte.\nAthena:\nNo, don't!\nPhoenix:\nHmm, looks more like a planner than a diary. Every page seems to have the same sword mark printed on it at that.\nAthena:\nI still think a girl deserves her privacy, but this may help us solve the case.\nCourte's Planner added to the Court Record.\nPlanner (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nWhat do we have here...? A book? I'm guessing it fell out of her chest pocket.\nAthena:\nWait! What if it's her diary?! That's the most private thing a girl has!\nPhoenix:\nTrue, but considering the situation at hand, my apologies to the late Prof. Courte.\nAthena:\nNo, don't!\nPhoenix:\nHmm, looks more like a planner than a diary. Every page seems to have the same sword mark printed on it at that.\nAthena:\nI still think a girl deserves her privacy, but this may help us solve the case.\nBody\nPhoenix:\nNotice anything strange about the body? Take a deep breath, and then take a good look.\nAthena:\nUm... well, now that you mentioned it, there's no blood around it.\nPhoenix:\nYet the victim's body is cold and rigor mortis has already started to dissipate. It would appear that quite some time has passed since Prof. Courte was murdered. Thing is, the quad was packed with students up until the start of the mock trial.\nAthena:\nWait, then doesn't that mean she was killed at a different location? Ooh, I know! The killer moved the body here while everyone was in the Lecture Hall!\nPhoenix:\nThat's a definite possibility. Notice anything else?\nAthena:\nUmm... Her arms are raised over her head and there are dark bruises around her wrists.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. The professor was probably tied up with something.\nAthena:\nEventually, her wrists were unbound, and as she reached up to stretch, she was killed? ...Actually, I'm not so sure about this theory...\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well, there's not exactly a lot to go on...\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nPhoenix:\nIn addition to checking the body, we should also check the area around it. But we don't have much time, check only what you can. ...Nervous, Athena?\nAthena:\nY-Yes! I mean, n-no! (Apollo didn't bat an eye at the alderman's body during that case in Nine-Tails Vale... I can't let him show me up. I can do this. Just take a deep breath and focus!)\nAbout the murder\nAthena:\nSo, Prof. Courte was...\nPhoenix:\nYep, the professor I was here to meet with. Turns out, she wasn't running late after all.\nAthena:\n(How awful. Here she was lying dead and we thought she was late.) What was that you were saying before, Boss? You never finished.\nPhoenix:\nHm? Oh, that. Don't worry, I'll fill you in... later. But right now, let's focus on the investigation, okay?\nAthena:\nO-Okay, sure. (Ugh, the suspense is killing me.)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nOh, a shiny new attorney's badge. Brings back memories...\nAthena:\nI've heard that countless people live in dread of your pointer finger. Were you really that scary back then, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha. Strike one. I've always been just as you see me here.\nAthena:\nA harmless sheep in wolf's clothing?\nPhoenix:\nStrike two.\nAthena:\nDo you have an old picture of yourself? Wait, never mind! I'm not sure I want to see it!\nPhoenix:\nStrike three, you're out.\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nListen, Athena. There's a certain amount of etiquette involved in presenting evidence. You're free to shove this or that into my face, but... ...at least get my attention first or give me some sort of a warning.\nAthena:\n(In other words, do as I say, not as I do.)\nAfter examining arrow, planner, and body:\nAthena:\nI think that's about all we're going to find out from the body for now.\nPhoenix:\nNice work, Athena. Your face only turned five shades of pale. I was expecting fifty. We should probably take a picture of the crime scene, just in case.\nAthena:\nOkay, I'm on it! Say cheese!\nPhoenix:\nCheese? And I thought I was the one with the twisted sense of humor.\nAthena:\nI think that should do it.\nPhoenix:\nAll right, let's take a better look around the area while we wait for the police to arrive.\nAthena:\nThis pile of rubble sticks out like a sore thumb. Looks like broken pottery or plaster. Maybe this is the source of that noise we heard.\nPhoenix:\nHmm, there were supposedly two statues on this stage. I seem to recall hearing that a coed from the Fine Art Club had made them.\nAthena:\nThere were two? Then that thing over there is the remains of another statue?\nPhoenix:\nThis could be related to the case. Let's take a closer look.\nExamine\n\"67th School Festival\" sign, backdrop, defense bench, prosecution bench, judge bench, or witness stand\nAthena:\nThere's definitely something here, but there are other pressing issues to take care of. Like doing a careful search of the area around that broken statue.\nPile of rubble near prosecution bench\nBroken statue\nAthena:\nWonder what this was a statue of. Whatever it was, it was reddish-purple in color.\nPhoenix:\nWhen Apollo and I first got here, both statues were already here, but they were covered up. I bet they were waiting to unveil them when the school festival moved here to this stage.\nAthena:\nYou mean this duffle bag-looking thing was actually being used to cover the statues? I guess that just leaves the question, were they broken by accident or on purpose? Hmm... What a puzzle this is.\nNewspaper\nAthena:\nThere's something buried in the rubble. ...The Themis Herald?\nPhoenix:\nWait, we shouldn't disturb it. Let's just read what we can.\nAthena:\n\"Final Act in Torrid Love Triangle Centered on Campus She-Devil Juniper Woods\" \"Level-headed lawyer course genius and hot-blooded prosecutor course student... ...will go head to head in a mock trial battle for the she-devil's black heart! Hugh O'Conner has declared that he will confess to her if he wins!\" Wait, whaaaaaaaaat?! I seriously wish I hadn't read that!\nPhoenix:\nYou find that more shocking than discovering a murder victim's body?\nAthena:\nB-B-But, we're talking about my friend Junie here! She'd never lead guys on like that!\nPhoenix:\nAthena, you don't believe everything you read, do you? This article is clearly written with malicious intent. I'm not buying a word of it.\nAthena:\nY-You're right. But it's still disturbing, even if it's third-rate tabloid material.\nThemis Herald added to the Court Record.\nNewspaper (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nThere's something buried in the rubble. ...The Themis Herald?\nPhoenix:\nWait, we shouldn't disturb it.

Athena!\nAthena:\nOh, here comes Apollo! I've never seen anyone move so fast!\nApollo:\n*huff*... *huff*... Listen! Something big's happened! I was at the mock trial when the police announced a body had been found on campus!\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. And we're the ones who phoned it in. We found Prof. Courte dead behind the witness stand over there.\nApollo:\nWH-WHAAAT?! Can you show me?! ...What the--?!\nAthena:\nWe've already had a quick look at the body. It's definitely a homicide. Once the police get here--\nApollo:\nNo, I know it's a homicide! I'm shocked because it's the same! Exactly the same!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa there, Apollo. Take a deep breath and explain what you mean.\nApollo:\nIt's the same! The body, that is! It's just like it was in the mock trial!\nAthena:\nWhat? It's like the mock trial?\nApollo:\nI know! It sounds crazy, b-but... The body's location and position, the murder weapon, the lack of pooling blood... It's all exactly like the mock trial!\nAthena:\nYou're kidding, right? It can't really all be the same... can it...?\nOctober 24Themis Legal Academy - 3F Lecture Hall\nPhoenix:\nThe whole school's in an uproar. There won't be any more classes today.\nApollo:\nA murder on campus... That's the last thing I expected at a legal academy.\nPhoenix:\nI'll go tell Prof. Means what we observed when we discovered the body. You two wait here until you've spoken with the police.\nAthena:\nYes, Boss!\nApollo:\n*sigh* I can't believe this is happening.\nAthena:\nI can't believe we have to wait around here. I can't stay still at times like these. (I hope Junie hasn't fainted from the shock of this whole thing.)\nWoods:\nAh! Thena... er, I mean, Athena. There you are.\nAthena:\nJunie! Am I glad to see you! I was worried that--\nWoods:\nDon't worry about me. I am Student Council President, after all. I need to be strong.\nAthena:\nStudent Council President? Wow, I'm impressed. (She's really changed. She used to be kind of sickly and shy.)\nApollo:\nJuniper was it? You mind if we ask you a few questions?\nAthena:\nYeah, we're stuck here waiting for the police. And there's really not much to do.\nWoods:\nSure, what would you like to know?\nTalk\nJuniper Woods\nAthena:\nI haven't seen you in ages, Junie! What's it been, seven years or so?\nWoods:\nYes, and I remember how you were always there for me, Athena.\nAthena:\nUm, maybe it's just me, but I wanted to ask why you seem so distant. Remember how you used to call me \"Thena\"? I liked it better that way. It felt like we were sisters, you know?\nWoods:\nYes, but I'm Student Council President now. And as the student representative of Themis Legal Academy, I have to act properly.\nAthena:\n(She was never this stiff and formal before.) I knew you wanted to be a judge, but I didn't expect this. It's such a prestigious school. And you're in the judge course to boot.\nWoods:\nYes. And Prof. Courte had been in charge of it until... well, you know.\nAthena:\n(Oh, right. Prof. Courte was the professor in charge of Junie's course...)\nConstance Courte (appears after \"Juniper Woods\")\nApollo:\nWhat sort of teacher was Prof. Courte?\nWoods:\nIf I had to sum her up in a single word, I'd say she was \"amazing.\" \"A judge must always seek the truth.\" That was her mantra, and she used it in trying to... ...fix what was wrong with our school. She was a beacon of hope in this dark age of the law.\nAthena:\nWhat's wrong with your school? What did you mean by that?\nWoods:\nOh, uh, nothing! Never mind.\nAthena:\n(Am I imagining things or did I just detect something in Junie's voice?)\nWoods:\nProf. Courte chose my script for the mock trial.\nAthena:\nOh? You mean all of the students in the judge course had to submit a script? And yours was the one she selected? Wow, that's amazing, Junie!\nWoods:\nOh, th-thank you. But now, Prof. Courte is... Who would do such a thing? Just yesterday we were working together, trying to get things ready... *cough* *cough* *cough* Excuse me.\nAthena:\nAre you all right, Junie? Maybe you should take it easy for a while. (So she's still got that cough... Guess she's not as strong as she pretends to be.)\nThe mock trial (appears after \"Constance Courte\")\nLeads to:\n\"Why do you need a script in a showdown between a lawyer and a prosecutor?\"\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nWoods:\nThat's your attorney's badge, isn't it! I really envy you, you know. That gold sunflower really suits you.\nAthena:\nThanks. But I know you'll make a fabulous judge someday, Junie.\nWoods:\nTh-Thank you... But... Even if I become a judge, I'll never have one of those sunflower badges.\nAthena:\n(Wait, so she only envies me for the badge?)\nThemis Herald\nWoods:\nOh, th-that's...\nAthena:\nHeh heh. Sorry, but I couldn't help reading it. You always were popular with the guys.\nWoods:\nTh-That's not true! I... I was never...!\nAthena:\nYou just didn't realize it. But that made you even more irresistible. It's been seven years, but I still remember how all the boys wanted to be near you.\nApollo:\nI bet you used to get all excited when a guy handed you a love letter... ...and then got really bummed out when he'd say, \"Could you give this to Juniper for me?\"\nAthena:\nAgh! (How'd he know?! I'm sure it was just a lucky guess, but why'd it have to be Apollo of all people?!)\nAnything else\nWoods:\nAthena, you know it's against school rules for you to have such things in your possession. As Student Council President, I'm afraid I'll have to confiscate that. Hand it over, please.\nAthena:\nBut this is important evidence.\nWoods:\n...Oh, well, then I suppose we can make an exception just this once.\nAthena:\n(Wow, she's one tough law-and-order type president, all right.)\nAthena:\nWhy do you need a script in a showdown between a lawyer and a prosecutor?\nWoods:\nWell, we were simulating a trial, so we needed a script as a framework. All the details about the incident and the people involved are included in the script. We also prepared a crime scene, photos, a murder weapon, and other kinds of evidence.\nApollo:\nWow, you guys think of everything. Must be hard getting all that ready.\nWoods:\nYes, well... it was only Prof. Courte and I. After all, we didn't want the script or other elements of the mock trial to get leaked. We were the only ones in the entire school who knew all of the details.\nAthena:\nMust've been a big pain in the-- er, I mean, that must've been really difficult.\nWoods:\nI wrote the script so that the case could go either way. That way, the defense and the prosecution both had an equal chance of winning.\n???:\nHeh, if you think that's all she's capable of, you've got another thing coming.\nAthena:\nHuh? Who said that?\n???:\nJuniper's genius doesn't stop at her brilliant script.\n???:\nYEAAAAAH! She gave an award-winning performance as the defendant, maaaaaan!!!\nApollo:\nUm, I think I found a rival to my Chords of Steel.\nWoods:\nHugh, Robin, aren't you going to introduce yourselves to our guests? As Student Council President, I won't have you treating them rudely.\n???:\nHeh, you're right. I heard Mr. Wright was bringing a couple of guests with him. That would be you two? Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes?\nAthena:\nYep! I'm Athena Cykes!\nApollo:\nAnd I'm Apollo Justice. Nice to meet you.\n???:\n...I'll pass on the handshake.\nO'Conner:\nI'm studying to be a lawyer. The name's Hugh O'Conner. ...But some call me Mr. Perfect because I never score less than one hundred percent on tests. (Changed from [...But some call me Mr. Perfect because I never score less than 100% on tests.] in the original release)\nAthena:\n(Ugh. Most... pretentious... introduction... EVER. And what's with his hand? Is it glued to the inside of his pocket or what? Yeesh.)\n???:\nLemme be the first to apologize for Hugh's totally rude introduction! SORRRRRY!!!\nNewman:\nNow, here's my intro! I'm Robin Newman!!! I'm studying to be a prosecutor! Like the really cool kind that nails the bad guys! NOOOOOO!!! Where's the sincerity?!\nAthena:\n(So he makes pottery, too? And what's that brace-like contraption for...? Junie sure has made some... unusual friends.)\nWoods:\nThese two were the lawyer and the prosecutor in today's mock trial. And even though I wrote the script, I also played the part of the defendant.\nAthena:\n\"Final Act in Torrid Love Triangle Centered on Campus She-Devil Juniper Woods\" \"Level-headed lawyer course genius and hot-blooded prosecutor course student... ...will go head to head in a mock trial battle for the she-devil's black heart!\"\nAthena:\n(Wait, THESE two are the guys who supposedly have a thing for Junie?)\nO'Conner:\nHeh. Juniper, come on. Your role's way beyond just that.\nNewman:\nThat's riiiiiight! The mock trial's just the start! She's also in the school festival's main event! Live on stage, Juniper Woods! And the crowd goes bananas! WOOOOO!!!\nWoods:\n......... I'm... I'm supposed to sing at the school festival. All of the other girls were too embarrassed to try out, so...\nAthena:\nMy Junie singing? On a stage in front of people? (Wow, she really HAS changed.)\nTalk\nYour performance\nWoods:\nI was responsible for making everyone's stage costumes. And this is what I'll be wearing.\nAthena:\nThat's amazing, Junie, but then again, you were always good at that kind of thing. These constellations in particular are really something.\nWoods:\nOh! Um, thank you. One of my favorite things to do is to look up at the stars in the middle of the forest.\nApollo:\nHuh, so you're a fan of the night sky then?\nAthena:\nWow Apollo, didn't know you were such a romantic.\nApollo:\nI-It's not like that! I have this friend -- he and I go way back -- who got me really interested in space.\nAthena:\nWait, you had friends when you were young? Color me surprised!\nWoods:\nAs Student Council President, I cannot allow such mean-spirited teasing to continue.\nAthena:\nEep.... (I think she's angry.)\nStage Costume added to the Court Record.\nWoods:\nThe costumes were no problem, but as for singing, I'm not sure I--\nNewman:\nNOOOOO! YOU CAN DOOOOOO IIIIIIT!!!\nO'Conner:\nThat's right. And anyone who says otherwise will have to answer to me.\nAthena:\n(It's like a chivalrous love triangle -- a damsel in distress and two knights in shining armor. Maybe that Themis Herald article wasn't too far from the truth. Speaking of the latest news, I wonder how the mock trial turned out.)\nYour performance (subsequent times)\nWoods:\nI was responsible for making everyone's stage costumes. And this is what I'll be wearing.\nAthena:\nThat's amazing, Junie, but then again, you were always good at that kind of thing. These constellations in particular are really something.\nWoods:\nOh! Um, thank you. One of my favorite things to do is to look up at the stars in the middle of the forest.\nApollo:\nHuh, so you're a fan of the night sky then?\nAthena:\nWow Apollo, didn't know you were such a romantic.\nApollo:\nI-It's not like that! I have this friend -- he and I go way back -- who got me really interested in space.\nAthena:\nWait, you had friends when you were young? Color me surprised!\nWoods:\nAs Student Council President, I cannot allow such mean-spirited teasing to continue.\nAthena:\nEep.... (I think she's angry.)\nWoods:\nThe costumes were no problem, but as for singing, I'm not sure I--\nNewman:\nNOOOOO! YOU CAN DOOOOOO IIIIIIT!!!\nO'Conner:\nThat's right.

Maybe that Themis Herald article wasn't too far from the truth. Speaking of the latest news, I wonder how the mock trial turned out.)\nSo, who won? (appears after \"Your performance\")\nLeads to:\n\"So, how did the mock trial end?\"\nAthena:\nSo, how did the mock trial end?\nWoods:\nWe were just about to reach a verdict when the police arrived. Now we'll never know how it would've turned out.\nApollo:\nI guess that's what happens when there's a real murder during a fake murder trial.\nAthena:\nIt ended right before the verdict? Talk about bad timing...\nO'Conner:\n.........\nNewman:\nI was THIS close, maaan! I bet I woulda won!!!\nApollo:\nBut I bet the defense wasn't doing too badly either, right?\nO'Conner:\nWe'll settle this some other time. And I assure you, I WILL win when that time comes.\nNewman:\nLike I'm gonna let that happen! I DON'T THINK SO!!!\nAthena:\nI hope they don't end up hurting each other.\nWoods:\nOh, don't worry. The three of us have been good friends since we enrolled here.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. We even have proof of our friendship.\nAthena:\nProof? Like physical evidence, proof?\nWoods:\nYes. We're studying for a career in law, and in the legal world, evidence is everything.\nNewman:\nYeaaaaaah!!! As long as our friendship lasts! You can bet we'll be carrying them around!\nAthena:\nAh, the famed \"Themis Legal Academy ingenuity\" at work! So, what exactly is this \"proof of friendship,\" anyway?\nWoods:\n.........Well... It's a secret. And if I show you, it would be bad luck.\nAthena:\nOh, okay... (I knew it. There's definitely some discord in Junie's voice.)\nO'Conner:\nOur friendship is sacred and inviolable. It's not something to be put cheaply on display.\nNewman:\nProof?! We don't need no stinkin' proof! Us three are friends foreveeeeeer!!!\nAthena:\n(I can hear discord in their voices, too! But they're talking about their friendship. What's going on here?)\nApollo:\nSomething wrong, Athena?\nAthena:\nNo, it's... it's nothing.\nApollo:\nOh... All right, then... Hey, isn't that--!\n???:\nEveryone, stay right where you are! Don't move a muscle!\nAthena:\nD-Detective Fulbright? Is something wrong?\nFulbright:\nWhy, if it isn't my little lawyer friends! Sorry, but the small talk will have to wait. Juniper Woods, you're under arrest for the murder of Constance Courte!\nWoods:\n...I'm what?\nAthena:\nW-Wait a second! What's going on here?! Why are you arresting Junie?!\nApollo:\nPlease, Detective Fulbright. We're involved in this case, too.\nFulbright:\nAh-ha! So, you're the lawyers the dispatch said were first on scene! I can't tell you everything, but I will say this. There are two major reasons for her arrest. Number one! The suspect led someone to where the body was.\nWoods:\nI-I didn't--!\nFulbright:\nAnd number two! The crime scene is exactly how the suspect portrayed it in her script!\nAthena:\nBut...! You can't arrest her on just those grounds!\nFulbright:\nTrue. But there's more! However, Prosecutor Blackquill specifically told me to say no more than that!\nAthena:\n(So Blackquill's the prosecuting attorney on this one, too...?)\nPoliceman:\nDetective Fulbright! We found this in the suspect's pocket!\nFulbright:\nHm? Wh-Why there's...! There's blood on this!\nWoods:\nTh-That's evidence we made for the mock trial!\nFulbright:\nA mock... trial? Never heard of such a thing, but it sounds fishy to me! Real fishy! Now, if you would, officers.\nPoliceman:\nYes, sir!\nWoods:\nB-But... *cough, cough* I... *cough*\nAthena:\nJunie! (I have to do something! I... I can't let them take her away like this!)\nFulbright:\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.\nAthena:\n............\nAthena:\nAnime cutscene\nAthena:\nHold it! I refuse to believe that she's the killer! ...Junie! I've decided... I'm going to defend you! I'll fight with everything I've got!\nWoods:\nTh-Thena...!\nAthena:\nJunie! It's good to hear you say that name again.\nFulbright:\nHate to interrupt your bonding time, but... Aren't you rather new to all this? You're barely even a lawyer!\nAthena:\nWell, I don't have much experience, and I may need Apollo and Mr. Wright's help at times... ...but nobody believes in Junie as much as I do!\nApollo:\nI'll help you, too, Juniper. There's no way you murdered your professor.\nWoods:\nThena... *cough* Apollo... Thank *cough* you both. I'm counting on you! *cough, cough*\nAthena:\nWe've got your back, Junie!\nFulbright:\nGuess things worked out after all. Now that you have your lawyers, Ms. Woods, it's time for us to head back to the station.\nAthena:\n(I can't believe Junie's been arrested for murder. And I can't believe I accepted her case without asking Mr. Wright!)\nApollo:\nTake a deep breath and relax, Athena. I'm here to help with whatever you need, so let's get right on the case!\nAthena:\nRight!\nO'Conner:\nHeh. I won't have this case left in the hands of rank amateurs. If anyone's going to solve this case, it'll be me. Time to investigate.\nAthena:\nWhy that smug little--! (He hasn't even finished law school!)\nNewman:\nHUUUUUUGH!!! That was totally ruuude!!! And you're not the only one on the case, maaaaaan!!! I'm in, too! Big time! JUUUUUUUUUNIPER WOOOOOOODS!!! I'm gonna save yooooooooou!!!\nApollo:\nNow that those two are gone, let's get back to what I was talking about in front of the stage. ...About the mock trial, that is.\nAthena:\nOh, right! You said the victim's location, position, and so on were just like in the script!\nApollo:\nExactly. But without the script or any props, it's kind of hard to explain.\n???:\nPerhaps I could help... Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\nP-Prosecutor Gavin! What are you doing here?\nAthena:\nYou two seem to know each other. Is someone going to introduce me?\nKlavier:\nWhy, I do believe we have a fresh face here. Greetings, Fräulein. I am Klavier Gavin. Some know me as a prosecutor, but I'm most famous for my former rock band. We were quite popular you know, but regrettably, the band went kaput. Perhaps you've heard of us? The Gavinners? I was the lead vocalist.\nAthena:\nNever heard of your band. Then again, I was out of the country till only recently. But... can I get your autograph?!\nApollo:\nYou just met him like three seconds ago and you want his autograph?\nKlavier:\nForgive me Fräulein, but I've retired from the music biz. But I'd be happy to offer my autograph as rock star prosecutor, Klavier Gavin.\nAthena:\nOh, okay. That one, then!\nKlavier:\nShe's a lively one, eh, Herr Forehead? Didn't know she was your type.\nApollo:\n.........She's the newest member of Wright Anything Agency, that's all.\nAthena:\nNice to meet you! I'm Athena Cykes!\nKlavier:\nA pleasure to meet you too, Athena Cykes. Now that the intros are out of the way... ...I'm sure you have some questions for me, ja, Herr Forehead?\nTalk\nWhy are you here?\nApollo:\nSo, what are you doing here, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nI'm here for the same reason as your boss -- to give a lecture and a training seminar.\nAthena:\n(So HE'S the famous prosecutor they invited!)\nKlavier:\nAnd... I have another crucial role to play. The Gavinners are getting back together for a one-time special performance.\nApollo:\nEven though you guys disbanded? ...Which was a shame, by the way. Really.\nKlavier:\nJa, I know how much you... adored our music, Herr Forehead. Anyway, I studied abroad in Germany to get my badge early, but I did graduate from here.\nAthena:\nWait, so that performance Junie mentioned...\nKlavier:\nI see you've already heard about that. One student representative was selected to sing with us onstage. And the stage was supposed to look like this tomorrow. Two big banners and a pair of wicked statues. This is just an illustration, but it's not half bad.\nAthena:\nWicked statues...? Wait are these supposed to be you and Mr. Wright?\nKlavier:\nBingo, Fräulein. And they were so big and magnificent, too! What a terrible waste. But the worst part of this whole thing is... ...my long-awaited reunion with my mentor never came to pass.\nAthena:\nWait, don't tell me your mentor was--!\nKlavier:\nProf. Courte. She was the one who taught me how to think about the law.\nConstance Courte (appears after \"Why are you here?\")\nLeads to:\n\"So, Constance Courte was your professor here at the academy...\"\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nKlavier:\nMay I ask why you people present your attorney's badges like that? It seems like Herr Forehead and Mr. Wright always want to show theirs off, too.\nAthena:\nWell, let me ask you, Prosecutor Gavin. Why do you play air guitar?\nKlavier:\nAh!\nAthena:\nIt would seem the answer we seek can be found in much the same place.\nApollo:\nI never gave it that much thought, actually. I always just whip it out.\nThemis Herald\nKlavier:\nDid I ever mention I'm a graduate of this fine institution? The mock trials... They sure bring back memories. So many unforgettable battles.\nAthena:\nReally? So, you stood on that stage, too?\nKlavier:\nJa, I waited on my air guitar, rocked out to the beat, and exposed crimes for all to see. You could say this is where my hard-rocking prosecutorial style made its debut.\nAthena:\nHard-rocking prosecutorial style? How did your mock trial turn out?\nKlavier:\nAchtung, baby! I brought the house down and had the crowd on its feet! Ever since, the academy has held a live concert in conjunction with the mock trial.\nAthena:\n(All I wanted to know was how the trials turned out...)\nAnything else\nKlavier:\nWhy, Fräulein, what a wonderful piece of evidence you have there. But I imagine no matter what you present... ...it would be impossible for it to be more persuasive than your beauty.\nAthena:\n(Too bad it doesn't work that way in court, too...)\nAthena:\nSo, Constance Courte was your professor here at the academy...\nKlavier:\nShe may have taught the judge course, but she had a huge impact on me. She was fond of saying, \"The end is only justified through proper means.\" She wouldn't tolerate dishonesty and always revered what was right beyond all else.\nAthena:\n(I can feel Prosecutor Gavin's sadness. Oh, no, I think I'm gonna cry... *sniffle*)\nApollo:\nAthena? Are you tearing up? Though I can't blame you... Prosecutor Gavin owes a lot of who he is to Prof. Courte.\nKlavier:\nExactly. So, as you can see, we are both joined in purpose, so to speak, ja? Now, let's rock this place hard!\nApollo:\nHuh? I don't follow. Let's rock what?\nKlavier:\nForget already, Herr Forehead? I said I'd help you explain the mock trial. We're going to reprise it right here in the Lecture Hall! It might help us catch her killer!\nOctober 24Themis Legal Academy - 3F Lecture Hall\nMock Trial ReenactmentAll Rise\nKlavier:\nRight. the stage is ready. And you, Herr Forehead? Ready to rock?!\nApollo:\nUm, no, the defense is not ready to rock.\nKlavier:\nYou saw the actual mock trial earlier, right? Just relax, you'll do fine. Besides, we have the script right here.\nAthena:\nJunie's masterpiece?! The one everyone's been talking about?!\nKlavier:\nJa, and there's only one in existence. I \"borrowed\" it, if you will. Now, Fräulein, we'll need you to play the part of defendant and judge as per the script.\nAthena:\nOkay, got it!\nKlavier:\nI've only read the case outline so far. I don't know how it actually turns out, so I'll treat this like I'm prosecuting a real case. You, Herr Forehead, will play the part of a fledgling lawyer, a role you were born to play. All the evidence is also here with us. We have everything we need to reprise the mock trial.\nAthena:\nTrès bien! Let's get started. Defendant-slash-judge Athena Cykes, is psyched and ready to rock! Court is now in session for our reenactment of the mock trial... ...or what I'd like to call the mock mock trial!\nKlavier:\nJa, a double mockery, perhaps, but a trial is still a trial. Achtung, baby! It's no holds barred! Let's rock!\nApollo:\nAw, can't we take it easy today?\nAthena:\nAthena:\nIt may just be a mock of a mock, but there's only one way to compete! You play to win! So remember, each time I catch you slacking off, I'm holding you in contempt of court!\nApollo:\nGreat... A judge that voices her own objections AND abuses her judicial powers.\nTalk\nSummary of the facts\nAthena:\nNow, then, Prosecutor Gavin, your opening statement if you please.\nKlavier:\nYou got it, Fräulein Judge! Our case is set in a school very much like this one. The victim -- a professor, female. The defendant -- an Archery Club member, also female.\nAthena:\nOh me, oh my... I'm innocent! Innocent I tell you!\nKlavier:\nThat's some seriously bad acting, Fräulein. Anyway, the victim's body was discovered in the middle of the quad. Here's a shot of the crime scene. Ironically, it was Prof. Courte who posed as the corpse. Herr Forehead, how did the mock trial participants react to this photo?\nApollo:\nMr. Newman was surprised by what Prof. Courte was wearing. He reacted with, \"Oh, the green sweat suit.\"\nAthena:\n(That's not exactly what I would pick to focus on, so why would he care about that?)\nKlavier:\nAh, too much of a fledgling to know what's important, that one. In any case... ...both in the mock trial and the actual case, Prof. Courte was wearing a sweat suit. Moving right along--\nApollo:\nApollo:\nHey, wait a sec! The body was discovered in the same area as the mock case, although there was a stage. Plus, the murder weapon, an arrow, and the lack of blood are also the same!\nKlavier:\nThat's right. And therein lies the significance of this mock mock trial. So let's keep rockin' it hard, just like that!\nDefense's argument (appears after \"Summary of the facts\")\nKlavier:\nBefore the crime occurred, the defendant was to meet the victim in the quad.\nAthena:\nUm, ahem... Let's see here... \"When I arrived at our meeting place, I found the professor with an arrow in her stomach! But... it wasn't me! I didn't kill her!\"\nApollo:\nYou don't have to ham it up like that, Athena.\nKlavier:\nIt's called getting into character, Herr Forehead. Don't be such a wet blanket.\nApollo:\nRight... Um, let's see... Oh yeah, then Hugh said... \"A frail coed used her bare hands to stab her professor with an arrow? I don't think so. At the time of the murder, a male student was seen... ...holding a bow in the Archery Club room, which has a clear view of the quad. He shot the arrow into the victim before my client even got there!\"\nKlavier:\nNein nein, Herr Forehead. That feigned swagger does not suit you in the least.\nAthena:\nOrder! Order!!! ORDER!!! Especially you, Mr. Justice!\nApollo:\nMe?! But I was just trying to get into it like Mr. Euro Rocker said.\nProsecution's rebuttal (appears after \"Defense's argument\")\nAthena:\nSo, the victim was shot from the Archery Club room before the meeting even took place. Hence, the defendant could not be the killer. That seems to be the defense's assertion. Prosecutor Gavin, do you have any objections?\nKlavier:\nThe autopsy report notes that the edges of the victim's wound were unusually ragged. Could such physical trauma possibly result from an arrow shot from a bow? Nein! I believe the victim was impaled with the arrow by hand... postmortem. In short, the real murder weapon was not the arrow at all.\nApollo:\nWhen Robin was prosecutor, he had a tough time determining the real murder weapon.\nKlavier:\nWell, he's just a student, a warm-up act, while I am the real deal, the headliner, so to speak. The true murder weapon was most likely the awl that was left in the art room.\nAthena:\nAn awl, what's that? Er, I mean... Hmm... An awl, you say? What might that be?\nKlavier:\nIt's a kind of tool used for poking holes in paper, wood, and other materials. It's kind of like an ice pick. I have a photo here if you're interested.\nAthena:\nGross.. It's all bloody up to the handle. Please tell me it's just paint.\nKlavier:\nMost likely, Fräulein. Pretty realistic, ja? Let's pretend it's real blood for now. The defendant's prints were lifted from the murder weapon. Furthermore, traces of the victim's blood were discovered in the art room. That's where I believe the murder actually took place.\nAthena:\nSo, the question now is, how did the body get from the art room to the stage?\nHow the body was moved (appears after \"Prosecution's rebuttal\")\nLeads to:\n\"The murder took place in the third floor art room, but the body was found in the quad.\"\nKlavier:\nThe murder took place in the third floor art room, but the body was found in the quad.\nAthena:\nIt must've been quite a chore moving the body all that way.\nKlavier:\nNot at all. There's a maintenance area and storehouse right outside the art room. And a cart used to carry balls around was found there.\nAthena:\nOh, I think I've seen one of those before. But that's a pretty big one.\nKlavier:\nA jumbo, ja? Big enough to fit a person -- or a body -- in it. The defendant dropped the body from the art room window, then moved it with the cart. That is how a high-school girl could easily move a body all by herself!\nAthena:\nY-You don't saaaaaaaaaaay!\nApollo:\nApollo:\n\"A body dropped from three stories up would show signs of massive blunt force trauma!\"\nKlavier:\nKlavier:\nThat may be true, but... ...you failed to account for the large high jump mat in the storehouse. A body dropped onto such a mat would show no signs of blunt force trauma.\nApollo:\nYikes... It's almost scary how similar this whole case is to the mock trial proceedings.\nKlavier:\nQuite the crafty killer. In an attempt to case suspicion on the Archery Club... ...they moved the body to the quad where it would be an easy shot from the clubroom. Then the killer faked the murder weapon by inserting an arrow into the awl's stab wound.\nAthena:\n(Sounds like he has only high praise for Junie's script.)\nKlavier:\nWere there any further arguments from the defense?\nApollo:\nNope. It seemed like the teacher who was playing the judge was satisfied, too.\nKlavier:\nTime for the finale, then. Your verdict if you please, Fräulein Judge!\nAthena:\nHuh? Oh, right, that's me! Very well, this court finds the defendant, Juniper Woods-- Wait a second. Even if this is just a mock trial of a mock trial... ...I don't want to declare Junie guilty!\nKlavier:\nYeah, perhaps that's not such a good idea. Let's end our mock mock trial here. Besides, it's about time I get back to my investigation.\nAthena:\nThanks, you two! That little run-through of the mock trial cleared up quite a few things!\nMock Trial Script added to the Court Record.\nKlavier:\nAchtung, baby! The prosecution's already got a witness sized up, too.\nAthena:\nThat was quick. (Prosecutor Blackquill's almost too good...)\nApollo:\nYou're in such a helpful mood today, Prosecutor Gavin...\nKlavier:\nWell, like I said, I just want to catch whoever killed Prof. Courte. And there's no reason for me to start butting heads with you two. Anyway, I won't say goodbye, as I'm sure I'll be seeing you later.\nAthena:\nI always thought prosecutors were all a rather scary bunch. But Prosecutor Gavin seems pretty nice.\nApollo:\nYeah, he's not so bad as prosecutors go. We should get back to investigating, too. We don't have nearly enough information yet.\nAthena:\nAnd we also have to tell Mr. Wright that we accepted Junie's case.\nApollo:\nRight. Looks like we have our work cut out for us!\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nApollo:\nThe most prominent feature of this case is how closely it resembles the script. That makes it a tough one because we have to have a firm understanding of them both.\nAthena:\nNo sweat! We can reenact the mock trial as many times as we want by reading the script! I'll check it out in the Court Record and commit it to memory later!\nApollo:\nGood. I bet the script and the mock trial are going to be the centerpiece of the real trial. Make sure you know them inside and out.\nAthena:\nYes, sir, Mr. Justice!\nApollo:\nMr. Justice? Careful, I could get used to that.\nThe investigation\nAthena:\nApollo, any advice on how to investigate this case?!\nApollo:\nOh, uh... Start by interviewing people about the basic facts.\nAthena:\nInterview people! Got it! Hey, you there! What can you tell me about the--\nApollo:\nWhoa, hold on, Athena! The trial's tomorrow, so try to limit it to people with some relation to the case.\nAthena:\nOkay, got it! Limit the interview pool!\nApollo:\nRight... You might also want to take it down a notch, otherwise you'll be dead by tomorrow.\nAthena:\n(He wants me to calm down?! At a time like this?! Junie's fate rests in my hands. I just HAVE TO win this one...!)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nApollo:\nOh, nice. Your attorney's badge! That's the first thing you want to present when you meet someone new. I heard that's what all lawyers do.\nAthena:\nYou heard that? From whom?\nApollo:\nWho else, Mr. Wright. Just remember, your badge comes first! See, Athena! Check it out! This is my attorney's badge!\nAthena:\n(Ooh! That's so intense! I want to present mine like that, too!)\nThemis Herald\nApollo:\nA torrid love triangle? Juniper sure is popular with the guys.\nAthena:\nOf course she is. She's pretty, plus she has such a sweet and caring personality.\nApollo:\n.........\nAthena:\nI know what you're thinking. Why can't Athena be more like that, right?\nApollo:\nArgh! N-No, no! The thought never crossed my mind!\nAthena:\n(Let's see... Panic... Sorrow... Yep, that's exactly what crossed his mind. *sigh*)\nMock Trial Script\nApollo:\nThe mock trial was quite the heated battle.\nAthena:\nTsk, Mr. Wright didn't even hear me when I said I wanted to see it. That was so unfair. We should've done rock, paper, scissors to decide who got to watch. I know I would've totally beaten you.\nApollo:\nHow could you know that? The game's totally random.\nAthena:\nNo, I can tell you favor scissors. I mean, the proof's sticking right out of your head.\nApollo:\nHuh? What're you talking about?\nAthena:\n(Like I said, it's right there on your head!)\nAnything else\nApollo:\nYes! Nice one, Athena. Keep it up! I don't care if it's totally unrelated to the case or just plain annoying or even embarrassing. Just keep presenting evidence without any regard for others! That's the first step towards becoming a successful trial lawyer!\nAthena:\nLeave it to me! I'll one piece after another, and then another!\nOutdoor Stage (before clearing \"Rumor about the academy\" Talk option in Themis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway)\nPoliceman:\nHey, what do you think you're doing? The crime scene is off-limits to students.\nAthena:\nTsk, I'm no student. I'm a lawyer!\nPoliceman:\nYeah, right! Just because you're in law school doesn't mean you're a lawyer!\nApollo:\nYou should see what she did to the last cop who said something like that her.\nPoliceman:\nWhy you--! Are you threatening an officer of the law?!\nApollo:\nYikes! N-N-No, it's not a threat! It's more like a friendly warning!\nAthena:\n(...*sigh* Guess we should go before I get myself arrested for assaulting an officer.)\nWright Anything Agency\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nTrucy:\nA school festival? Why didn't you take me with you?\nAthena:\nOh, um... Only Mr. Wright was officially invited. Apollo and I are just tagging along, but we ARE lawyers, after all.\nTrucy:\nWell, my magic act would've made a great warm up for the mock trial. They'd have seen how even the most crucial evidence could vanish in the blink of an eye!\nAthena:\n(That's probably precisely why Mr. Wright didn't invite you.)\nThe academy\nTrucy:\nAthena, don't you think the Wright Anything Agency has about run its course?\nAthena:\nWh-What do you mean?\nTrucy:\nIsn't it obvious? It's time for the Wright Anything Academy! And you, Athena, I want you to be the head of our Psychology Department.\nAthena:\nOh... What other departments will we have?\nTrucy:\nWell, I'll be the head of the Magic Department... ...and we'll have a Chords of Steel Department and a Bluffing Department!\nAthena:\n(But then who'll be the head of the Toilet Cleaning Department?)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nTrucy:\nHey, that's an attorney's badge!\nAthena:\nPromise me you won't make it disappear.\nTrucy:\nAh! What a mean thing to say! Do I look like someone who'd do something like that?\nAthena:\nNo, I didn't mean it like that. Anyway, I hear they reissue badges that get lost, so...\nTrucy:\nHey, isn't that great! That means you have nothing to worry about!\nAthena:\nYeah! ...But seriously, please don't make mine disappear. I wouldn't want to have to explain.\nThemis Herald\nTrucy:\nHey, is that the morning paper?\nAthena:\nSomething like that. It's a school paper. I was thinking, your magic tricks would make a great article.\nTrucy:\nReally?! A newspaper article about my tricks? That would be so cool! The moment the interview starts, I'd suddenly disappear, shocking the interviewer! Without an actual interview, they could call the article, \"The Interview that Vanished\"!\nAthena:\n(I'll just leave it at that.)\nAnything else\nTrucy:\nWow, thanks, Athena! That'll make a great new prop for my magic act!\nAthena:\nHuh? But that's--\nTrucy:\nSo, what kind of trick should I do with it? Make it disappear? Burn it? Rip it in two?\nAthena:\nHa ha ha. Let's just save that fun little detail for later.\nTrucy:\nAww, you're no fun.\nOctober 24Themis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway\nAthena:\nAh, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nI heard they arrested your friend Juniper.\nApollo:\nYeah, Detective Fulbright just took her in.\nMeans:\nI refuse to believe that one of our students is capable of murder. We must prove her innocent by any means necessary! The end justifies the means!\nAthena:\nWhat do you mean, the end justifies the means?\nMeans:\nI, Prof. Means, always say what I mean, and mean what I say by all means! Here at our esteemed academy, we train our students to produce meaningful results. You believe in Juniper's innocence, do you not?\nAthena:\nOf course, I do! Junie wouldn't even hurt a fly!\nMeans:\nPrecisely. We have justice on our side. The only other thing we need are results. It is the height of folly to endanger your client by failing to pursue all means possible!\nAthena:\nUm... sure I want to prove her innocence, but... (I don't like the sound of that \"end justifies the means\" part.)\nMeans:\nWell, you are still young and idealistic. It's no wonder you fail to see the wisdom therein. There is but one thing to do now. I must personally take up Juniper's defense.\nPhoenix:\nYou're going to take her case, Prof. Means?\nMeans:\nI may be a professor, but I am still licensed to practice law. In fact, I have even battle Prof. Courte in... well... in court!\nApollo:\nNo kidding?! So you guys were rivals or something?\nMeans:\nNo, nothing of the sort. She was an esteemed colleague at the academy and in court. You see, both Prof. Courte and I graduated from this academy at the top of our class.\nAthena:\n(Wow, I bet they both used to really bring it.)\nMeans:\nNow, if you would excuse me, I had best go discuss the case with Juniper.\nAthena:\nProf. Means, please, wait! I didn't want to say anything, but Apollo and I already agreed to take her case.\nApollo:\nIt's true. Juniper is counting on us to prove her innocence.\nMeans:\nReally now? You two?\nPhoenix:\nAnd when were you planning on telling me?\nAthena:\nS-Sorry, Boss. I know we should've asked first, but...\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha. Relax. Your friend was just hauled away in front of your eyes. Sometimes you just have to make snap decisions. And I think you made the right one.\nMeans:\nHow wonderful! Very well, Athena Cykes, let me ask you just one thing. As a lawyer, what is it that you treasure beyond all else?\nAthena:\nHeh heh! That's an easy one, Professor! Seeking justice for my clients! (Changed from [Heh heh! That's any [sic] easy one, Professor! Seeking justice for my clients!] in the original release)\nMeans:\nWhat a wonderful answer. Juniper must be overjoyed to have a friend such as you. As her professor, I too, shall do whatever I may to help her. And if you decide to take the-end-justifies-the-means strategy, come see me at once!\nAthena:\n(Let's hope it never comes to that.)\nMeans:\nNow, if you would excuse me.\nPhoenix:\nWell, time's a wasting. You better start investigating and fast. But first, how about I tell you everything I know so far?\nAthena:\nYes, please!\nTalk\nAbout the murder\nAthena:\nHave you learned anything new about the case?\nPhoenix:\nActually, I ran into Prosecutor Gavin, and he told me something interesting. Seems the murder took place in the art room. There's traces of a large pool of blood there. So the police believe the body was moved from there to the stage.\nAthena:\nWhat? Really?! (Just like the mock trial again!)\nPhoenix:\nThe police are searching the art room, but whether they'll find anything, well...\nAthena:\nWell what? (Come to think of it...)\nPhoenix:\nLet's do our own crime scene investigation before it gets too crowded around here.\nAthena:\nHuh?! Are we even allowed to do that?\nPhoenix:\nIt's no big deal, as long as we leave it exactly like we found it. Plus... No, never mind.\nAthena:\n(Now, where was I again?)\nPhoenix:\nBut there's really no need to talk about it right here, right now. I want you two to find out for yourselves.\nRumor about the academy (appears after \"About the murder\")\nPhoenix:\nSo, were you shocked by your conversation with Prof. Means?\nAthena:\nOh, umm, I guess so. (Actually, that was pretty shocking.)\nPhoenix:\nThe dark age of the law... I'm sure you've heard those words before.\nAthena:\nSure, a number of times. Prosecutors file false charges and lawyers fight back by fabricating evidence. There's a lot of that going around these days.\nApollo:\nBut the question is, how is it related to the case at hand?\nPhoenix:\nTraining students to produce results... That is the school's policy.\nAthena:\nWell, that in and of itself isn't a bad thing.\nPhoenix:\nRight. ...As long as those results come by fair and honest means.\nAthena:\nOh, but what was it that Prof. Means said?! \"The end justifies the means\"?\nPhoenix:\nTo survive the dark age of the law, you must use any means necessary. Fabrication of evidence and false charges are unavoidable in the quest for results. That's what they're preaching here at Themis Legal Academy.\nAthena:\nB-But... What'll happen to our legal system if results are all that matter anymore?!\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha, relax. It's just a rumor. I'd take it with a grain of salt if I were you.\nAthena:\nOh, that's a relief. (He had me going there for a minute. Wait a second! What if Mr. Wright examined the victim's body for a reason! Maybe he was worried someone might actually tamper with the evidence!)\nPhoenix:\nI think that about wraps up what I know so far. The fact that this case closely resembles Ms. Woods's script is obviously important. Knowing that, you should probably try and identify what's the same and what's different.\nAthena:\nOkay! I'll try talking to as many people as I can on campus!\nRumor about the academy (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo, were you shocked by your conversation with Prof. Means?\nAthena:\nOh, umm, I guess so. (Actually, that was pretty shocking.)\nPhoenix:\nThe dark age of the law... I'm sure you've heard those words before.\nAthena:\nSure, a number of times.

Maybe he was worried someone might actually tamper with the evidence!)\nPresent\nThemis Herald or Mock Trial Script\nPhoenix:\nThings like that sure scream out \"school days,\" don't they?\nAthena:\nWere you involved in any extracurricular activities like school papers or mock trials?\nPhoenix:\nNah, that wasn't my thing. I was an art major.\nAthena:\nAn art major? Then how did you become a famous attorney?\nPhoenix:\nIt's kind of complicated. And when I say, kind of, I mean really, really complicated.\nAthena:\nOh... (...He must really mean it. I'm picking up a lot of complex emotions in his voice.)\nAfter clearing \"Rumor about the academy\" Talk option in Themis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway:\nOctober 24Themis Legal Academy - 3F Lecture Hall\nAthena:\nLook, there's Hugh! Hey, Huuuuugh!\nO'Conner:\nOh, it's you two. Do you want something?\nApollo:\nDid you find anything? You said you were going to do some investigating of your own.\nO'Conner:\nNope, nothing yet. I'm afraid it's not looking very good for Juniper.\nApollo:\nYou don't really think Juniper could have done something like this, do you?\nO'Conner:\nOnly the author and the victim knew the contents of the script. Both the stage and the art room were in the exact same state as described therein. Nobody could mimic the crime like that unless they'd already read the script... or... wrote it.\nAthena:\nB-But!\nO'Conner:\nLook, Prof. Means is better able to handle this than you two, so just leave it to him!\nAthena:\n(There it is again. I'm picking up some discord in Hugh's voice.)\nTalk\nHugh O'Conner\nAthena:\nHugh, would you mind telling me a bit about yourself?\nO'Conner:\nHeh, whatever. I'm 6'1\" and under this uniform, I'm one hundred percent lean muscle. My grades are outstanding and I'm the ace of the Archery Club. Needless to say... ...I never miss my mark. Oh, and I'm incredibly humble, too.\nAthena:\n(How can he even say that with a straight face?)\nO'Conner:\nThose around me call me a genius, but I pay them no mind. But when it comes to tests... I always get a hundred percent, so I suppose it's only natural for them to say I'm a genius. But, as I said before, I pay them no mind.\nAthena:\n(I heard you the first time.)\nApollo:\nBut what about the mock trial? It sounded like you were about to lose to Robin.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. There's a very good reason for that. You see, right before the mock trial started... I saw the body.\nAthena:\nY-You saw the body?!\nO'Conner:\nRight, and I was so distraught that I basically handed Robin a victory.\nApollo:\nHugh, would you mind telling us a little more about that?\nDiscovering the body (appears after \"Hugh O'Conner\")\nO'Conner:\nRight before the mock trial, the campus was empty. Everyone was here in the Lecture Hall.\nYour attention please. This is an announcement from the Mock Trial Committee. The mock trial will begin shortly. All students and faculty please proceed at once to the Lecture Hall.\nAthena:\n(That's right... There was that announcement and the everyone came in here.)\nO'Conner:\nThe only exceptions were the mock trial participants. Juniper, Robin and I were in our personal dressing rooms next door.\nApollo:\nWow, your own personal dressing rooms? That's total VIP treatment.\nO'Conner:\nActually, they're for student-teacher meetings. They don't even have windows. The other two waited patiently in their rooms, but that's not my style. So, I headed over to the archery range on the other side of the quad. I did some meditation while I waited. That's the best way to relax. Then, just before the mock trial was about to start, I headed back toward the main building. As I walked across the quad, I passed in front of the stage.\nAthena:\nSo, that's when you saw the body?\nO'Conner:\nRight. It was quite a shock. As much as I hate to admit it, my legs were shaking. I could've easily beaten Robin if it hadn't been for that.\nApollo:\nWait, hold it right there. You went through with the mock trial even though you had just discovered a body? Why didn't you tell anyone? I mean, we're talking about someone getting killed here!\nAthena:\nI think I know why... Was it because of this?\nO'Conner:\nAh! Where'd you get that?!\nAthena:\nSo, this article in the Themis Herald IS true. The winner of the mock trial would get to make his confession to Junie.\nO'Conner:\nRight. But if I reported the body I'd found, the whole thing would be called off.\nAthena:\n(He really wanted to win that bad? Bad enough to ignore a dead body? Sorry, but that's not normal. ...Or could their love for Junie really be that strong?)\nApollo:\nThanks for sharing that important piece of information with us. It may prove useful at tomorrow's trial.\nO'Conner:\nGood. Because that's all I have to say about the matter.\nAthena:\nThanks. And don't worry, we'll prove Juniper's innocence, you'll see.\nO'Conner:\nHeh, I can't say you two inspire much confidence.\nApollo:\nOkay, Athena, what next?\nDiscovering the body (subsequent times)\nO'Conner:\nRight before the mock trial, the campus was empty. Everyone was here in the Lecture Hall.\nYour attention please. This is an announcement from the Mock Trial Committee. The mock trial will begin shortly.

That just shows how inexperienced and useless you are.\nAthena:\nWell, when you get your badge, it will be new and shiny, too!\nO'Conner:\nHeh. You mouth-breathers just don't get it, do you? My badge will be a symbol of my genius. From the moment I get it... It will be chipped, bent, and worn as if it's been through a thousand courtroom battles.\nAthena:\n(He's like some hipster doofus.)\nArrow\nO'Conner:\nThat's from the Archery Club. We let the school use it for the mock trial. Never figured it would end up being used like it was.\nAthena:\nOf course, the real murder weapon isn't an arrow at all.\nO'Conner:\nI know. But the fact remains that it was used in this whole insidious plot. But a mouth-breather like you couldn't possibly understand. You see, archery is a sport that demands advanced mental focus. And the killer's actions have done harm to its image.\nAthena:\nI know exactly what you mean, except for that mouth-breather remark.\nO'Conner:\nWell, let's hope that someday you will because it couldn't be any more self-evident.\nAthena:\n(I like him less and less every time he opens his mouth.)\nCourte's Planner\nAthena:\nIs it just me or is this your name here?\nO'Conner:\nHeh, that's my name, but how should I know what it's doing there? But being that the whole campus looks up to me... ...I'm not surprised to find my name mentioned here and there.\nAthena:\n(And I'm not surprised he said that, being the narcissist he is.)\nThemis Herald or Themis Herald Extra\nAthena:\nSo, you really declared that you'd confess to Junie if you won the mock trial? (Because he's definitely not the shy type.)\nO'Conner:\nHeh. Yeah, well, that's just the genius that is me. My thoughts and actions are on a whole other level from you mouth-breathers.\nAthena:\n(No, it's your vanity that's on a whole other level.)\nMock Trial Script\nO'Conner:\n...I get it. This is your way of mocking my defeat. You like shoving people's shame in their faces. That's your modus operandi.\nAthena:\nNo, that wasn't my intention. Besides, you were never actually defeated.\nO'Conner:\nOh, I suppose you're right. ...Or is this a trick intended to provoke me.\nAthena:\nThat wasn't my intention, either!\nO'Conner:\nThen what WAS your intention?! I know! You're trying to toy with my emotions!\nAthena:\n(Wow, this guy can't take being humbled, old country style.)\nAnything else\nO'Conner:\nRandom junk from some mouth-breather? What makes you think I'd want to see that? Heh. The least you could do is make it more interesting, like by telling me how cool I am.\nAthena:\n(Who does this guy think he is?!)\nAfter clearing \"Rumor about the academy\" Talk option in Themis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway:\nOctober 24Themis Legal Academy - Maintenance Area\nAthena:\nSo this is the maintenance area. Let's see... During the mock mock trial, Prosecutor Gavin said... ...that the art room is right above here on the third floor... ...and that they body was dropped from there onto a high jump mat from the storehouse.\nApollo:\nRight. And then he claimed that the body was transported to the stage in a ball cart. And then... Hm? There's someone else here...\nAthena:\nHey, it's Robin!\nNewman:\nWhoooooooooa! You scared the crud outta meeeeee!!!\nAthena:\nYikes! Right back at you! ...So, what are you doing out here?\nNewman:\nI'm working out so that I can become strong enough to save Juniper! But I'm so worked up... my training brace is almost breaking at the seams!\nAthena:\nOh, right... The girl you like got arrested, so you're psyching yourself up to rescue her?\nNewman:\nYes! Because! I'm the manliest of manly men! ...That's why I work out with my manly brace!\nAthena:\n(Except that I hear some discord in that manliest of men's voice of yours...)\nApollo:\nI don't mean to be rude, but can't you talk without shouting?\nNewman:\nSorry! I'll try not to shout so much! If at all possible, that is!!!\nAthena:\n(...Which is \"not at all possible\" by the sound of it.) Um, so do you mind if I ask you some questions as Junie's lawyer?\nNewman:\nNo problem! Ask away! Keep 'em coming, maaaaaan!!!\nAthena:\n(Ouch... My ears ache already.)\nTalk\nRobin Newman\nAthena:\nRobin, could you tell me a little more about yourself?\nNewman:\nYou wanna know about meee?! I'm a second-rate member of the Fine Arts Cluuub!!!\nAthena:\nThe Fine Arts Club?\nAthena:\nLooks like broken pottery or plaster. Maybe this is the source of that noise we heard.\nPhoenix:\nHmm, there were supposedly two statues on this stage. I seem to recall hearing that a coed from the Fine Art Club had made them.\nKlavier:\nTwo big banners and a pair of wicked statues. This is just an illustration, but it's not half-bad.\nAthena:\nWicked statues...? Wait are these supposed to be you and Mr. Wright?\nKlavier:\nBingo, Fräulein. And they were so big and magnificent, too! What a terrible waste.\nAthena:\nSay... Did you create those stage statues by any chance?\nNewman:\nYou bet I did! Both of 'em! Put my blood, sweat, and tears into those things, maaan!\nApollo:\nIt must've been terrible seeing them all smashed up like that.\nNewman:\nNah! I couldn't face Prof. Courte if I let something like that get me down!!!\nAthena:\nWhat do you mean?\nNewman:\nProf. Courte was the Fine Arts Club advisor! She was all about truth and beauty, maaan!!! She always said, \"The only good result is the truth\"! That and... ...\"Only lawyers who seek the truth through legitimate means produce worthwhile results\"!\nAthena:\nYeees! I'm totally on your guy side! She must have been an incredible woman!!!\nApollo:\nYeesh, and you call ME loud when I practice my Chords of Steel...\nAbout the murder\nNewman:\nAw, maaaaaaaaan! Why'd I have to take the prosecutor course! I mean, how am I supposed to save Juniper if I'm studying to be a prosecutor?!\nAthena:\nDon't worry. I'll clear Junie's name, you'll see.\nNewman:\nThe three of us had a dream! We swore we'd make it happen TOGETHER!!! Prosecutor! Lawyer! Judge! The three of us would hold fair and honest trials! The dark age of the law? Ha! We were gonna put a nail in its coffin, maaaaaan!\nApollo:\nWow, you guys swore to do that?\nNewman:\nBut, noooo! That stupid school rule had to ruin it!\nAthena:\nSchool rule? Which one?\nNewman:\nAnyone with a prior conviction, no matter how minor the offense, they won't...! They won't be allowed to graduate from this stupid, holier-than-thou schoooool!!!\nApollo:\nA tough legal academy, with even tougher rules...\nAthena:\n(Junie will never become a judge unless I can prove her innocence. And if I fail, the three of them will never realize their dream. ...It's like someone put pressure on my pressure.)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nNewman:\nWhooooooa! Check out your badge!\nAthena:\nWhat do you think? Nice and shiny, huh?\nNewman:\nYeah! It's AWESOME!!! If the plating ever starts to peel or it gets all bent up, lemme fix it up for you!!!\nAthena:\nReally?! Thanks!\nNewman:\nNo problemo! I'll have some primo clay and glaze at the ready, just in case!!!\nAthena:\n(Wait, what does clay have to do with my badge?)\nThemis Herald\nNewman:\nAh! That paper!!!\nAthena:\nSo, Robin, is this article true?\nNewman:\nThe author of that article has been gunning for the three of us for some reason! It's been nothing but trashy articles like this as long as I can remember!\nAthena:\nHmm... Maybe the author just wants your attention?\nNewman:\nNo waaaaaaay, maaan! The venom in those articles is waaay beyond that!!!\nAthena:\n(Hmm, I wonder...)\nMock Trial Script or Themis Herald Extra\nNewman:\nWhoooa! Déjà vu, maaaaaan! It's like I can almost taste my near victory again! But noooooo!!! The final showdown was canceled because of that murder!\nAthena:\nThis topic sure seems to strike a raw nerve. I hope it doesn't come between you guys.\nNewman:\nYou kidding?! Our friendship...! It's like a diamond, only tougher!!! It's like a powder keg before a spark!!! It's like the calm before the storm!!!\nAthena:\n(In other words, it's under a lot of pressure and ready to blow at any moment...?)\nAnything else\nNewman:\nWhooooooa! Did you make that?! Lemme fire it in the kiln for you! Just give it to me and I'll take care of the rest!\nAthena:\nI think I'll pass on the kiln firing this time. (Phew, dodged a bullet there!)\nAfter clearing \"Rumor about the academy\" Talk option in Themis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway:\nOctober 24Themis Legal Academy - Outdoor Stage\nApollo:\nI thought the area was cordoned off. Hey, the police are discussing something over there.\nAthena:\nOoh, I know! I'll just quietly sneak over for a listen. Here goes...\nApollo:\nAh! Athena, watch where you're--!\nAthena:\nHuh? Eeeeeeeeek! Ouch! Who put this stupid box here? Wait............ Eek! A-A-Apollo! This box, there's...!\nApollo:\nWh-What now?\nAthena:\nTh-Th-There's! There's someone or... *gulp* something inside!\nApollo:\nDon't let it be a SNAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!\n???:\n............Sss, sss, sss. You morons just blew my cover.\nApollo:\nWhat the--? There really is someone inside...\n???:\nSss, sss, sss, sss, sss! That someone is me, Myriam Scuttlebutt.\nScuttlebutt:\nAnd I'm a senior in the judge course.\nAthena:\nWh-What's with the box?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. It's the fate of we who live in the shadows. There's a very good reason why none may see my face by the light of day!\nApollo:\nWait, if you're taking the judge course, did you write a mock trial script, too?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. You really want to see my script that bad? Well, you better watch out. Read it without my permission and you'll wish you hadn't!\nAthena:\n(Who cares? I'm sure it was rejected for a good reason.)\nTalk\nMyriam Scuttlebutt\nAthena:\nOh, so you're studying to be a judge, too? You must be classmates with Juniper. Are you a friend of hers?\nScuttlebutt:\nJuniper? Sss, sss, sss. Sure, she's my friend. That's why I'm gathering info. Now, tell me all you know. You know, for tomorrow's trial.\nAthena:\nFor tomorrow's trial? What are you talking about?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. I'm going to take the stand, naturally.\nAthena:\nSo, the witness for the prosecution is... some weirdo in a cardboard box?\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk! This disguise is how I get my scoops! ...But you're right. It's me. So tell me everything you know for Juniper's sake!\nApollo:\nW-Wait a second, Myriam. Repeat what you just said.\nScuttlebutt:\nA lawyer with brains as bad as his ears. Poor Juniper! I'm taking the stand tomorrow. Tell me everything you know for Juniper's sake. Clear enough for you this time?\nBRACELET THUMPS\nApollo:\nI thought so. Athena, my bracelet's reacting.\nAthena:\nReally?! That means...! (A lie, already? That was quick!)\nPresent Bracelet\nScuttlebutt:\nI'm taking the stand tomorrow. Tell me everything you know for Juniper's sake.\nPerceive tightening grip on box on \"for Juniper's sake.\"\nApollo:\nApollo:\nThat's strange. You suddenly tightened your grip when you said, \"for Juniper's sake.\" It's like you subconsciously tensed up because you're lying.\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk! Wh-What're you talking about?! When did I ever lie?!\nAthena:\nOkay, then let me ask you this... Why were you selected as a witness?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. That's an easy one. I'm the editor-in-chief of the Themis Herald. I know everything there is to know around campus, even the darkest of secrets.\nApollo:\nEditor-in-chief, huh? Pretty impressive.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, yeah well, it's a lonely, one-woman operation. I do it all myself, from reporting, to editing, to publishing. Still impressed? I'm a perfect storm of journalism because I bring it all to the table, sss, sss, sss, sss! ...And this is the evidence. Here! An extra edition of the Themis Herald, published to coincide with the mock trial!\nThemis Herald Extra added to the Court Record.\nAthena:\nThanks, Myriam. You've revealed who you truly are: Someone who's never had Junie's best interests in mind. (Changed from [As someone who's never had Junie's best interest in mind.] in the original release)\nScuttlebutt:\nWhat?! Are you questioning our friendship?!\nAthena:\nLook, you may want answers, but... No can do, because what you're saying conflicts with this piece of evidence.\nPresent Themis Herald\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"That's the Themis Herald, the paper I publish. What about it?\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! You just gave me an idea for an extra addition headline! Extra, Extra! \"Juniper Woods Headed for Conviction? Scatterbrained Attorney to Blame.\"\nAthena:\nScatterbrained? If I'm wrong, just say so.\nApollo:\nThere's nothing iffy about it. You're way wrong.\nAthena:\nUgh!\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss! Scatterbrained, scatterbrained! Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss! Now, out with it! Tell me everything you know for Juniper's sake!\nLeads back to:\n\"No can do, because what you're saying conflicts with this piece of evidence.\"\nScuttlebutt:\nThat's the Themis Herald, the paper I publish. What about it?\nAthena:\n...Are you really that dense? This article is full of malicious lies about Junie! It's definitely not something a true friend of hers would write!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk! Y-You got it all wrong! Another staff member wrote that one!\nAthena:\nI don't think so, Myriam. You even said it yourself just a moment ago. \"It's a one-woman operation.\" Or did you forget already?\nScuttlebutt:\nKaaahk kahk-kahk-kahk! If you'd just give me the info you have--! Stupid pawn! Juniper's just using you!\nLeads back to Talk options\nPerceive wrong area\nApollo:\nApollo:\nMyriam, your unease is betrayed by a little habit of yours.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! Think you can see through me with your silly little guesses? You're wasting your time! My box is impenetrable! Nobody sees the real me!\nApollo:\nGah... I blew that one.\nAthena:\nYou're completely boxed in now, Myriam! And Apollo's power is like a box cutter with x-ray vision! Prepare to be exposed!\nApollo:\nDon't exaggerate, Athena. I'm a lawyer, not a superhero.\nLeads back to Talk options\nMyriam Scuttlebutt (after perceiving)\nAthena:\nNow, I want the truth, Myriam! You hide in your box in order to collect gossip for your sleazy paper, isn't that right?!\nApollo:\nYou're not really friends with Juniper, are you?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. No duh! She's the target of my scoops, and my readers demand dirt! Extra, extra! \"The Dirty Little Secret of the Squeaky Clean Student Council President!\"\nAthena:\nDirty little secret...? All right, what are you planning to say in court, huh?\nScuttlebutt:\nI'm a witness to her part in the crime. I'm going to tell it all in a shocking exposé! The end justifies the means. That's my brand of tell-all journalism!\nAthena:\n(The end justifies the means? Wait a second!)\n\"End justifies the means\" (appears after \"Myriam Scuttlebutt\")\nScuttlebutt:\nIn this dark age of the law, many of us embrace Prof. Means's methods, even future judges. I've even adopted an end-justifies-the-means brand of journalism, which includes... ...tape recorders secretly hidden all over our campus... ...secretly recording every last word without anyone being any the wiser!\nAthena:\n(Doesn't she realize that's totally illegal?!)\nScuttlebutt:\nAnd one of them was at the scene of the crime -- the art room!\nApollo:\nYou put a tape recorder in the art room? What did it record?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. You wanna know? You really wanna know?\nAthena:\nYes, please! That's so nice of you to--\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! Like I'd really tell you now! The big scoop comes out in court tomorrow!\nAthena:\nTsk! You're so mean, Myriam!\nScuttlebutt:\nAccording to my evidence, a fatal fissure had opened between the three of them.\nAthena:\nWho? Junie, Hugh, and Robin? And what do you mean by fatal fissure?\nA rift in the trio (appears after \"\"End justifies the means\"\")\nScuttlebutt:\nJuniper, Hugh, and Robin used to be the best of friends.\nAthena:\nUsed to be? They still seem to get along fine to me. (I did sense some discord, though.)\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. You don't know anything. Prof. Means has his followers and Prof. Courte had hers. Their influence is inescapable!\nAthena:\nAre you implying that one of them adheres to that extreme idea you and Prof. Means have? (But why would anyone follow that philosophy?)\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. How could you possibly understand. You're new around here.\nApollo:\nMyriam, wouldn't you feel better if you came out of the dark and into the light?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. I can see fine in here. You'll be the ones seeing the light in court tomorrow. (Changed from [Sss, sss, sss. I can see fine in here. You'll be the one's [sic] seeing the light in court tomorrow.] in the original release) Then you'll realize how guilty Juniper Woods really is! Sss, sss, sss! Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss!\nAthena:\nUgh. We're going to have to cross-examine her tomorrow, but I don't know where to start. (Changed from [Ugh. We're going to have cross-examine [sic] her tomorrow, but I don't know where to start.] in the original release)\nApollo:\nWell, let's at least take care of whatever we can today.\nAthena:\nYou're right. Let's see what else we can find out!\nA rift in the trio (subsequent times)\nScuttlebutt:\nJuniper, Hugh, and Robin used to be the best of friends.\nAthena:\nUsed to be? They still seem to get along fine to me. (I did sense some discord, though.)\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. You don't know anything. Prof. Means has his followers and Prof. Courte had hers.

Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss!\nPresent\nThemis Herald\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! I love this newspaper! The paper quality, the printing method, the smell of the ink... Could it be more perfect?!\nAthena:\nUmm... Is it really that amazing?\nScuttlebutt:\nMeh! You just don't get it, do you?! Toilet paper, hamster cage lining, window wiper! My paper is so awesomely versatile!\nAthena:\n(Am I to understand that the contents run the entire spectrum of fecal matter as well...?)\nMock Trial Script\nScuttlebutt:\nMy script was way more popular than Juniper's.\nAthena:\nReally? Wow, was that the majority opinion?\nScuttlebutt:\nYep. My behind-the-scenes maneuvers, threats, and deceptions worked like a charm.\nAthena:\nMyriam, this may come as a surprise to you, but that's called \"cheating.\"\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. Says you. I didn't break the law. Besides, the end justifies the means. That's what they teach us here.\nApollo:\nApparently, some people are already thriving in the dark age of the law.\nAnything else\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! If you wanna give me a present, slip it through a hole in my box. Or if it's too big, you can open the top and gimme it that way! So, which way is it gonna be? Sss, sss, sss!\nAthena:\n(Either way creeps me out.)\nAfter clearing \"Discovering the body\" Talk option in Themis Legal Academy - 3F Lecture Hall, clearing all Talk options in Themis Legal Academy - Maintenance Area, and clearing \"A rift in the trio\" Talk option in Themis Legal Academy - Outdoor Stage:\nAthena:\nWell, I think I've talked to everyone who is somehow linked to the case.\nApollo:\nOkay, maybe it's about time we wrapped up our investigation.\nAthena:\n...Oh, wait. We haven't met with Junie yet.\nApollo:\nYeah, you're right.\nAthena:\nLet's head over to the detention center.\nOctober 24Detention Center - Visitor's Room\nWoods:\nTh-Thena. Thank you so much for coming.\nAthena:\n(She called me \"Thena,\" like she used to. Maybe she's finally letting her guard down.)\nTalk\nThe script\nAthena:\nJunie, the crime's unfolding exactly like your script. Any idea what's going on here?\nWoods:\nWe wanted to make it fair, so the script was kept secret until the day of the mock trial. And the only people who knew the details were Prof. Courte and I.\nAthena:\n(Hmm... Nothing we haven't heard already so far.)\nWoods:\nHowever...\nAthena:\nYes?! What is it, Junie?\nWoods:\nWell, there was this one article in the school paper.\nApollo:\nYou mean this one? It's more like a tabloid piece than a newspaper article, if you ask me.\nWoods:\nI've... been worried that the trial would wreck the friendship between Robin, Hugh and me.\nAthena:\n(She wants to stay friends, but both of the guys are hoping to take it to the next level. Oh, the passion of high school drama...! Wish I could've experienced it...)\nWoods:\nAnd I know I shouldn't have, but... I revised the script to favor the prosecution. But Prof. Courte noticed it immediately and changed it back.\nAthena:\n(Ahh, so if Robin had won, Hugh wouldn't have been able to confess his love to Junie. That would've kept the trio's relationship the same. Never knew Junie could be so devious.)\nWoods:\nSorry. I guess my personal problems won't be of any help in court, huh?\nApollo:\nYou never know. Help often comes from the most unexpected places. Thanks, Juniper.\nThe awl\nAthena:\nI was wondering about that awl you had on you when you were arrested.\nPoliceman:\nDetective Fulbright! We found this in the suspect's pocket!\nFulbright:\nHm? Wh-Why there's...! There's blood on this!\nWoods:\nTh-That's evidence we made for the mock trial!\nFulbright:\nA mock... trial? Never heard of such a thing, but it sounds fishy to me! Real fishy!\nWoods:\nIt was the murder weapon from the mock trial. Prof. Courte and I were prepping it in the art room until the day before the trial. I didn't even realize I still had it on me until I was arrested.\nApollo:\nThen we've nothing to worry about. There shouldn't be any way to link it to the crime.\nWoods:\nStill, that blood-red color on the awl bothers me.\nAthena:\nWasn't it just paint or something? I mean, I was looking at it from pretty far away, but...\nWoods:\nIt probably was just paint, but that's what bothers me. It wasn't on the awl when we were prepping it yesterday.\nApollo:\nIt wasn't? Then how and when did it get there?\nWoods:\nWell, before the mock trial began, I showed Thena and Mr. Wright to the waiting room... ...then I went back to my dressing room to get the trial props we were going to use. That's when I found the art room key and the awl with what looked like blood on it.\nAthena:\nA key... and the awl?\nWoods:\nProf. Courte normally has the art room key since she's the Fine Arts Club's advisor. And since that key was there in the dressing room... ...I thought she was the one who had painted the awl to look like it had blood on it. After all, she always insisted that the props should be realistic, so...\nAthena:\nThe awl suddenly shows up on the day of the trial with what looks like blood on it? I have a really bad feeling about this.\nApollo:\nMe, too. But let's not jump the gun on this.\nMock trial prep work (appears after \"The script\" and \"The awl\")\nLeads to:\n\"You and Prof. Courte were busy preparing for the mock trial together yesterday, right?\"\nPresent\nStage Costume\nWoods:\nUm... I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't go around showing that to everyone.\nAthena:\nHow come? I mean, it's so well made. Aren't you going to wear it when you sing?\nWoods:\n*sigh*... Yes, unfortunately, I've been chosen to sing. But I don't think I'm up to the task.\nAthena:\n...Reminds me of the old Junie when you talk like that. Makes me want to protect you.\nWoods:\nI can't let you do that. After all, I'm Student Council President! It's my job to look after our entire student body.\nAthena:\nSo what if you took that can-do spirit and applied it to your singing?\nWoods:\n*sigh*... But we're talking about me singing in front of a huge crowd.\nAthena:\n(Maybe she is in over her head.)\nMock Trial Script or Themis Herald Extra\nWoods:\nI wish the mock trial had ended better than it did...\nAthena:\nYeah, but to have three good friends all play leading roles? It's pretty amazing if you think about it.\nWoods:\nThat's true. And it's thanks to the strength of our friendship. There's nothing we can't do if we help and support each other.\nAthena:\nI don't know... Is that really the issue here? (But whenever I bring it up...)\nWoods:\nYes, that's what it's all about! The friendship between the three of us is absolute!\nApollo:\nAthena, it's obvious that they're friends, so let's leave it at that.\nAthena:\nYes, I know that, but... (Her words seem kind of forced.)\nAthena:\nYou and Prof. Courte were busy preparing for the mock trial together yesterday, right? Was that the last time you saw her?\nWoods:\n...Yes. I left school at around 6:00 PM.\nApollo:\nDid you notice anything different about her?\nWoods:\nNo, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. She looked and acted the same as always. I would've never guessed she'd end up like this. It looks like we're about out of time. Thank you for coming to see me.\nAthena:\nWe'll do everything we can to prove you innocent tomorrow.\nWoods:\nI know. And I believe in you, Thena. Well, I should go now. Bye.\nApollo:\nIs she gonna be all right? She's like a shadow of the girl we met back at the academy.\nAthena:\nThe Junie I knew was always like that -- a little weak and sickly. But the fact that she's lifted her façade shows that she trusts us. Even still...\nApollo:\nWhat is it?\nAthena:\nWell, when Junie and her two friends were talking about their friendship... ...I sensed some discord in their hearts.\nApollo:\nSeriously?\nAthena:\nYeah, but it was really faint. I might've been mistaken. (There's no reason to doubt their friendship... is there?)\nApollo:\nDon't worry, everything will be fine! You and Juniper are friends, right? You know that friend I mentioned to you earlier? Well, get this. Whenever something's troubling one of us, the other can just feel it. That's real friendship.\nAthena:\nI suppose you're right... Might as well forget about that and concentrate on the trial!\nApollo:\nYup! Tomorrow's the big day. Let's sort out what we know so far.\nAthena:\nOkay! The victim Prof. Constance Courte was murdered in the art room on the third floor. Then, her body was moved to the outdoor stage in the quad. Also, the location where we found the body was just as the mock trial script described.\nApollo:\nI wish those were the only similarities they shared.\nAthena:\nWhat do you mean?\nApollo:\nWhat I mean is the script and this case are exactly the same in almost every respect. So it follows that the actual trial may very well unfold just like the mock trial did!\nAthena:\nOh, no! (The mock trial ended right before the prosecution was about to win! Well, that's not gonna happen! This time, Junie WILL be declared \"not guilty\"! Of course, I intend to get our results the honest way. We can do this! We'll be fine! After all, I have Apollo and he's the king of being fine.)\nTo be continued\nNothing to examine during investigation\nAthena:\nThere's really not much of interest here. At least, that's what my intuition tells me.\nTurnabout Academy\nImage Gallery\nTranscript\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nOctober 25, 9:47 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3\nAthena:\n(Ugh. My butterflies have butterflies in their stomach.)\nApollo:\nSo, what's it like to have your very own case for the first time?\nAthena:\nMy heart hasn't raced this fast since I ran that full marathon last year.\nApollo:\nIf it keeps up, you might get a lawyer's high -- you know like a runner's high?\nPhoenix:\nRelax, everyone's nervous their first time.\nMeans:\nSo my fears weren't unfounded. After all, today's prosecutor is so terribly brutal... ...and willing to use any means necessary to win a conviction.\nAthena:\n(There's that the-end-justifies-the-means concept again.)\nMeans:\nNow that it has come to this... ...we have no choice but to fight fire with fire. The end justifies the means.\nAthena:\n(I wish he'd stop saying that.) That's your method, Professor. I'm going to defend Juniper in my own way.\nMeans:\nBut, Ms. Cykes. Just yesterday you told me...\nMeans:\nAs a lawyer, what is it that you treasure beyond all else?\nAthena:\nHeh heh! That's an easy one, Professor! Seeking justice for my clients!\nMeans:\nBut if this trial proceeds in the same manner and ends in the same way as the mock trial... ...would you not lose everything you've worked so hard to gain?\nAthena:\nWell, I'll just have to make sure that doesn't happen, then, won't I!\nMeans:\nMy, but aren't you a stubborn one. Well, I suppose you will have to learn of your own inefficacy the hard way.\nAthena:\n(Grrrrrrr...)\nApollo:\nForgive me, Prof. Means, but can we just leave it at that?\nMeans:\nOh, dear, please forgive me. It's just, I wish to protect Juniper by any means I can.\nAthena:\n(I do, too, but...)\nMeans:\nNow, if you would excuse me...\nAthena:\nUgh! Thanks to him, I'm feeling even more pressure than before.\nApollo:\nDon't let it get to you, Athena. And don't forget to keep smiling.\nAthena:\nI'll be fine! And I haven't forgotten what Mr. Wright said! \"The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles.\"\nBailiff:\nThe trial is about to begin. I'll show you to the courtroom if you please.\nPhoenix:\n...Apollo, I'm counting on you to support Athena this time.\nApollo:\nOkay, Mr. Wright! Leave it to me!\nAthena:\n(That's right. I have Apollo to back me up. Junie's fate rests in my hands. I won't rest until she walks free!)\nOctober 25, 10:00 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4\nDay 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Juniper Woods.\nAthena:\nA-Athena Cykes, d-defense team leader, is ready, Your Honor!\nApollo:\nThat didn't sound very confident. You sure you're okay?\nAthena:\nI'll... I'll be fine!\nBlackquill:\n...Your Baldness.\nJudge:\nI know, I know. As usual, you want me to deliver the opening statement. Agh!\nBlackquill:\nThis case is crystal clear. I see no need to explicate it any further. ...Now, summon the witness.\nJudge:\n.........\nBlackquill:\n.........Is there something the matter? Please do share, Your Baldness.\nJudge:\nWh-Whatever gave you that idea?! Bailiff, please call our first witness!\nAthena:\n(And now we don't even get an opening statement...?)\nAthena:\n(Detective Fulbright... He and Prosecutor Blackquill have become quite the team.)\nBlackquill:\n.........\nFulbright:\nOh, right! The case brief! Leave it to me! Yes, let the detective in charge, everyone's favorite friend of justice, explain!\nApollo:\nWhat was THAT just now...? It's like he and Blackquill are totally in sync.\nAthena:\nWell, I don't think they're capable of mind melding, if that's what you're thinking.\nJudge:\nAll right, Detective Fulbright. Would you please explain the case to the court?\nFulbright:\nProf. Courte's body was discovered on October 24th at approximately 2:30 PM. She was murdered with this awl I have here! The victim's blood and the defendant's prints were both discovered on it!\nAwl added to the Court Record.\nAthena:\nEEEK!\nCourte's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nApollo:\nWow, that bird can deliver evidence, too? Blackquill has trained him well.\nAthena:\nMaybe Blackquill should train it not to mess up people's hair while he's at it.\nFulbright:\nMoving right along! The body was discovered on the outdoor stage, although no blood was found there! However, we detected traces of a massive amount of blood in the third floor art room. In short, the murder took place in the art room!\nJudge:\nSo, then the body had been moved from the art room to the stage?\nFulbright:\nPrecisely! And there is one more piece of irrefutable evidence! A recording made by a tape recorder that a school paper reporter hid in the art room! It captured a female voice screaming, \"You're a goner!\"\nJudge:\nWhat's this?! You have such a recording?!\nApollo:\nMust be from that tape recorder Myriam mentioned.\nAthena:\n(But why is this the first we've heard of a death threat at the moment of the murder?)\nFulbright:\nShhhhhh! Silence, please! I would like to play the tape for you now.\n.................................... ...You're a goner!\nJudge:\nHmm... It is quite hard to hear.\nAthena:\n(But the voice does sound female...)\nTape Recorder added to the Court Record.\nFulbright:\nThe noise and low volume of the voice have made voiceprint analysis all but impossible.\nJudge:\nThen, you haven't identified the voice as belonging to the defendant.\nFulbright:\nNot so fast. After all, voiceprint analysis isn't everything! The victim was killed at night, then discovered in the afternoon the next day. The question is... when was the body moved!\nJudge:\n............Oh, oh! I know! It could've been moved in the middle of the night when no one was around!\nFulbright:\nSorry, but no! The campus was full of students that morning. However, no one reported seeing a body. That means the body was moved sometime before the mock trial when all the students... ...and faculty were gathered in the Lecture Hall and the rest of the campus was empty! It was during this time Hugh O'Conner, one of the mock trial participants, found the body.\nAthena:\n(So the prosecution heard about Hugh seeing the body...)\nJudge:\nWait one moment. If all of the students and faculty were gathered in the Lecture Hall... ...then there wouldn't have been anyone who could've moved the body!\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! Have no fear, for there is always an exception.\nJudge:\nAn exception?\nFulbright:\nThe three mock trial participants were standing by in individual dressing rooms. They were the only ones who had free access to the deserted campus before the mock trial.\nJudge:\nWhat?! Then that would mean...! ...What would that mean?\nFulbright:\nThose three students were the only ones who could've moved the body! In justice we trust!\nApollo:\nI don't like where this is headed, Athena.\nAthena:\nMe neither...\nFulbright:\nAnd by those three, I mean... ...Hugh O'Conner, Robin Newman and Juniper Woods.\nAthena:\nI knew it... (Please, Detective Fulbright... Don't say what I think you're about to say...)\nFulbright:\nIn justice we trust! I take it EVERYONE understands now! The voice believed to be that of the murderer was female! And out of the three people who could've moved the body, just one is a girl. That leaves the defendant Juniper Woods as the only possibility!\nAthena:\nNoooooooooooooooo!\nApollo:\nImpressive. He has you on the ropes even before any cross-examinations.\nAthena:\n(You could at least pretend to be upset for me.)\nBlackquill:\nA splendid job, Fool Bright. That could not be any clearer. Feel free to anticipate a salary raise next month.\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha ha! I don't do this for the money. It's all about justice! In justice we trust!\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Not only a halfwit, but a perennial stick-in-the-mud you are.\nAthena:\n(I guess neither the carrot nor the stick works on Detective Fulbright.)\nJudge:\nNow, Bailiff, please bring our next witness to the stand.\nScuttlebutt:\n.........\nJudge:\nSo... our first witness... is a cardboard box?\nScuttlebutt:\n......... Kaaahk! Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss...! Stealth mode deactivated!\nJudge:\nOh, my! The box has hands!\nScuttlebutt:\nSmile, Your Honor. Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss, sss!\nJudge:\nWhat the dickens?! I've just had my picture taken!\nScuttlebutt:\nMyriam Scuttlebutt. Senior at the legal academy. I'm a reporter on the judge course. Juniper's been a bad, bad girl. I'll tell you all about her crime, sss, sss, sss!\nJudge:\n...Umm, might I ask whether you could come out of that box?\nScuttlebutt:\nHow will I get any more scoops if I blow my cover? So, the answer is no. After all, covert action is an undercover reporter's bread and butter!\nJudge:\nHmm... But testimony from a faceless witness is highly irregular.\nBlackquill:\nA former ninja I met in the clink said that exposing those who work in the shadows... ...is to pass the death sentence upon them.\nJudge:\nOh, my! I had never thought of it that way. Very well, if it would spare a life, I'll make a special exception this time.\nAthena:\n(A former ninja in prison? Holy shinto! How can the judge believe this load of crock?!)\nJudge:\nNow, your testimony please. Oh, but take care not to reveal your face.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Similarity of the Case and the Script --\nScuttlebutt:\nThe murder happened exactly like Juniper's mock trial script.\nUp until the mock trial began, only Prof. Courte and Juniper knew the script's content.\nBut Prof. Courte's sudden decision not to use the script sparked Juniper's murderous rage.\nJuniper has to be the killer. She has a motive and the murder is just like her script.\nJudge:\nThe murder is just like her script?! Could such a thing be true?!\nScuttlebutt:\nCompare her script with the murder case and crime scene photos. Then you'll see!\nBlackquill:\nThis is so simple, even an ape posing as a decrepit old judge could understand. Only the victim and the defendant were privy to the script. Ergo, the defendant is the killer. Furthermore, in the art room where the crime supposedly occurred, this witness's script... ...along with an envelope on which \"Use\" was written were found. This proves that the accused's script had been rejected the day before the mock trial. She pressed the victim to use her script, an argument ensued, and then the fatal stabbing.\nAthena:\n*gulp* (That makes perfect sense. What now?!)\nApollo:\nProsecutor Blackquill has all his ducks lined up in a row. He's really on a roll now.\nAthena:\nUgh. He's like a pit bull once it sinks its teeth into you.\nScuttlebutt:\nHow dare she! My script had it all! A bum rap and phony evidence! Grudges and betrayals!\nJudge:\nHmm... I trust the defense is ready to cross-examine the witness?\nAthena:\nN-No problem! I-I mean, yes I'm ready... I think... (Time to find a hole in her testimony, and unbox the truth! I've seen it done over and over. I know I can do this!)\nCross Examination\n-- The Similarity of the Case and the Script --\nScuttlebutt:\nThe murder happened exactly like Juniper's mock trial script.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThere must be places where the script and the case diverge!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk! Don't sweat the details! That kind of stress will give you wrinkles!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nI'm not worried. My skin is as fair as silk.\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\n...Hmph. Indeed, you are quite fair -- fairly desperate!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nWh-What did you just say?!\nApollo:\nHa ha ha. Blackquill really turned that one around on you.\nAthena:\nTsk, whose side are you on?! Hurry up and think of a clever comeback!\nApollo:\nWhoa, easy there, Athena.\nBlackquill:\nNow you listen to me. The two cases do, indeed, have their differences. For one, the stage hadn't yet been erected in the mock trial script. And in the actual case, there were signs indicating the victim's wrists had been bound. But such differences pale in comparison to the host of similarities. In any event, replicating the crime without knowledge of the script is an impossibility.\nAthena:\nHmmm... (Looks like I won't be passing this off as a coincidence.)\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! What a total burn! Try again, why dontcha, Pawn of Woods?\nScuttlebutt:\nUp until the mock trial began, only Prof. Courte and Juniper knew the script's content.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nSomebody could've stolen a peek beforehand!\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! I don't think so. I mean, I tried any number of times.\nAthena:\n(Shame on you, Myriam!)\nScuttlebutt:\nBut that crafty she-devil Juniper has eyes in the back of her head! What chance does your average person have if an undercover reporter like me failed?!\nAthena:\n(Interesting point. Still...) Ms. Scuttlebutt, won't you get in trouble later for admitting to such underhanded tactics?\nScuttlebutt:\nWhy, you...! I plead entrapment!\nAthena:\n(How is you blurting out your own crime entrapment?!)\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk... But you haven't scooped me yet! They were all set to use Juniper's script...\nScuttlebutt:\nBut Prof. Courte's sudden decision not to use the script sparked Juniper's murderous rage.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nHow do you know that Professor Courte wasn't going to use her script?\nBlackquill:\nHmph. There in the art room where the heinous crime took place... ...an envelope marked \"Use\" and Myriam Scuttlebutt's script were found. Evidently, the script that was going to be used belonged to the girl in the box over there.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! It's only natural that my script would be accepted and hers rejected. I introduced all sorts of brand-new concepts, including bribery and fake evidence! It was a cutting-edge script portraying a courtroom battle in the dark age of the law!\nAthena:\n(I can't help but feel Prof. Courte went out of her way NOT to use it.)\nScuttlebutt:\nBut Juniper... She used some devious, underhanded tactics to get her script chosen. That's why her script, and not my masterpiece, was used in the mock trial! How's that for an explanation?\nScuttlebutt:\nJuniper has to be the killer. She has a motive and the murder is just like her script.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nAnyone who saw the mock trial could have recreated the crime! After they saw the mock trial, they could've easily staged the body just like the script.\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\n.........Hmph. Weary is the trial which pits hawk against canary.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nWh-Wh-What did you just say?!\nApollo:\nHa ha ha. If he's so weary, he should try hmph-ing less. I bet that'd save some energy.\nAthena:\nThis is no time for jokes, Apollo! He just called me a canary!\nApollo:\nDon't let him get to you. At least canaries pick up on things quickly, just like you.\nBlackquill:\nI shan't repeat myself, so listen carefully, Cykes-dono. Hugh O'Conner discovered the body before the mock trial even began. How could one stage the body as it is in the script before anyone knew its contents?\nAthena:\nGah... That's right...\nBlackquill:\nDo you even fathom the intricacies that go into staging a crime scene? No, I think not. You have the rudimentary mind of an elementary school child.\nAthena:\nElementary school?!\nScuttlebutt:\n\"Reporter's Testimony Throws Attorney Athena Cykes for Loop!\" The perfect caption!\nJudge:\nHow marvelous! A photo in the newspaper is just the thing to boost your brand.\nAthena:\n(In a school paper? Seriously?)\nAthena:\n(Anyone can see the similarities between the script and this case. But that doesn't mean Junie's the killer!)\nApollo:\nI know it's frustrating, Athena, but we don't have much to go on at this point. All you can do is relentlessly press the witness and hope you find a hole.\nAthena:\nOkay, got it! (Press relentlessly! Right!)\nAfter pressing first and fourth statements:\nJudge:\nI believe you've pressed the witness more than enough, Ms. Cykes.\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Now do you see how clear-cut my case is? Take it now, and in that fair, desperate mind of yours... ...etch it deep so you may never forget!\nAthena:\nN-No... Nooooooooooooooo! (Even my arguments get thrown back in my face. It wasn't supposed to be like this. What am I going to do?)\nApollo:\n...Athena. You should just about have all the answers you've been looking for now.\nAthena:\nHuh?\nApollo:\nThink about it this way: If the killer knew the details of the mock trial... ...would they really commit the crime in the exact same way?\nAthena:\nI don't follow.\nApollo:\nTry to place yourself in the killer's shoes. I bet you'll discover an inconsistency if you do.\nAthena:\n.........Ah! I get it! Thanks, Apollo! Ms. Scuttlebutt! Just so we're clear, you're claiming... ...that the killer INTENTIONALLY made the crime scene just as it was in the script... ...and that it is beyond the shadow of a doubt NOT a coincidence. Is that correct?\nScuttlebutt:\nNo duh! After all, it's just more evidence of Juniper's evil she-devil ways.\nAthena:\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk! Wh-What'd I say, what'd I say?!\nAthena:\nOur client made the crime scene look just like the script, something known only to her? That would be not just foolhardy, but completely irrational!\nScuttlebutt:\nWh-What do you mean?\nJudge:\nYes, Ms. Cykes. Please tell this court what you mean by \"irrational.\"\nAthena:\n(It wouldn't make any sense for Junie to mimic her own script on purpose because it would...)\nMean leaking the script\nAthena:\nIntentionally making the crime scene look like the script... ...would expose the secret script for all to see!\nScuttlebutt:\nSo?! Juniper's a ruthless she-devil! She'd easily do that and a lot more to achieve her evil designs!\nJudge:\nHmm... Does the defense care to offer a counter-argument?\nAthena:\nNo, I'm good. Moving right along...\nJudge:\nJust one moment. Here in court, we have a special gift for intentionally evasive lawyers.\nAthena:\nI want a refuuuund! (Ugh. There's something obviously wrong with this whole set-up.)\nLeads back to:\n\"It wouldn't make any sense for Junie to mimic her own script on purpose because it would...\"\nMake her the culprit\nLeads to:\n\"The murder scene was the same as it was in the mock trial script.\"\nNot be possible\nAthena:\nHere's the thing. The mock trial details were kept secret. In short, there was no way our client could've known what was in the script!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Have you forgotten who penned the script?\nAthena:\nOf course I didn't forget! Our client wrote--! Er... whoops.\nJudge:\nTo say that the script's own author didn't know the details is quite a stretch, Ms. Cykes.\nAthena:\nEeeeeek! (Ugh. I think I need to find an explanation that actually makes sense.)\nLeads back to:\n\"It wouldn't make any sense for Junie to mimic her own script on purpose because it would...\"\nAthena:\nThe murder scene was the same as it was in the mock trial script. That in and of itself is irrational!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk-kahk! What's wrong with them being the same?!\nJudge:\nYes, Ms. Cykes. Care to explain what you mean?\nAthena:\nOkay, let's say for argument's sake, that Ms. Woods is the killer. If so, then... ...what reason would she have to intentionally make the actual murder mimic her own script?\nScuttlebutt:\nThat's easy! She was admitting that she was the-- Ah!\nAthena:\nThat's right. If she had really done that... ...it would've been like proclaiming to the world that she was the killer! So, what we ACTUALLY have here is evidence of someone trying to frame our client!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk... Kaaahk kahk-kahk!\nAthena:\nThe body was found on the day of the mock trial, in short, the day the details were revealed. So it would be completely inconceivable for the murder to go exactly like the script!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk-kahk! Don't let it go to your head just yet!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\n...Hmph. It would seem Justice-dono's comrade in arms has finally drawn her sword. However, the blade is dull, and it shall remain so until you master its use.\nAthena:\nE-Enough with the stupid sword metaphors, already!\nBlackquill:\nThere is a perfectly good reason for the inconsistency of which you speak.\nAthena:\nR-Reason? What reason?\nBlackquill:\nMust I spell out everything? Hmph, you are what people today call \"high maintenance.\" The accused had intended to stop the mock trial. And in that event... ...nary a soul would have been the wiser to the similarities of the case and script.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nNo! The mock trial was only stopped after the body was accidentally discovered! (Changed from [No! The mock trial was only stopped after the body was accidently [sic] discovered!] in the original release)\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Our witness here had also discovered the body. In fact, she was led to our dearly departed professor by the accused herself.\nAthena:\nWh-What?! Ms. Scuttlebutt saw the body, too?!\nBlackquill:\nPrecisely. And with the discovery of the body, the mock trial ought to have been canceled.\nAthena:\nWait, so you didn't call the police?!\nScuttlebutt:\nNope! I kept it secret for my big scoop!\nAthena:\nY-You can't do that!\nBlackquill:\nHmph. I made her pay long and hard penance for her sin. Did I not, my little box top?\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk! Compared to the work of a war correspondent, the sheer terror of that was-- Aaaaaaaaagh!\nApollo:\nJeez, I wonder what the Twisted Samurai did to her.\nAthena:\n...Block off all the holes in her box... ...and spin her like a top while Detective Fulbright cackled in delight?\nApollo:\n...That sounds more nauseating than scary.\nBlackquill:\nEnough jabbering. Witness! Continue your testimony!\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss, sss... Sure, Mr. Samurai. I'm ready to finish off that she-devil!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What Scuttlebutt Saw --\nScuttlebutt:\nI snuck into Juniper's dressing room while everyone was in the Lecture Hall.\nJuniper had changed into her stage costume. I asked her, \"What are you doing?\"\nWhen suddenly, she fled into the hallway, as if she wanted me to follow her.\nI followed her all the way to Prof. Courte's body! She led me right to it!\nI'm positive it was Juniper because she was wearing the costume that she had made!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nWhy did you withhold such key testimony?!\nScuttlebutt:\nKaaahk! Wh-What's that supposed to mean?!\nApollo:\nA-Athena! You haven't even started your cross-examination.\nAthena:\nI know, but her testimony points to her as being a potential suspect!\nApollo:\nWell, I don't think Prosecutor Blackquill is-- No, wait, I bet he's already thought of that.\nAthena:\nThe witness left the Lecture Hall to sneak into Ms. Woods's room before the mock trial. That means she, too, could have moved the victim's body!\nScuttlebutt:\nKaaaaaahk!\nAthena:\nThe prosecution's claim no longer has any ground to stand on! Heeeeeelp!\nBlackquill:\nNow, now, no need to ruffle your own feathers so. When you squeak like a little brat, it agitates Taka. Do you want him to peck your eyes out?\nWidget:\nNo, thanks!\nBlackquill:\nYou listen here. The witness has a perfectly good alibi.\nScuttlebutt:\nOh, yeah, I do! Around the estimated time of death... ...I was at undercover reporter class. It's right near my home!\nAthena:\n(Undercover reporter class?)\nBlackquill:\nThe proverbial rug has been pulled from under you. The witness could not be the killer.\nJudge:\nThe defense must look before leaping -- or at least make sure the rug's secured to the floor.\nApollo:\nI tried to warn you.\nAthena:\nOooh...\nBlackquill:\nWell, there ends the cross-examination. Let's allow the witness to step down.\nAthena:\nHuh? N-No, wait a minute...\nBlackquill:\nThe defense has no right to cross-examine the witness after that little spectacle. For whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.\nAthena:\nUgh. (Why can't he say, \"You reap what you sow\"?)\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well, if the cross-examination is over, I suppose the witness may go home. Perhaps spend some time in her lovely box and recover from today's stressful events.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! Don't you worry about me, Your Honor! There's no rest for the wicked... or journalists, either! My third eye's always eyeing a scoop!\nApollo:\nShe's always eyeing a scoop...?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! Well, back to the trenches! Buh-bye!\nApollo:\nApollo:\nNot so fast, Ms. Scuttlebutt!\nAthena:\nA-Apollo?\nApollo:\nThere's... just one thing I'd like to ask. Did you take a picture of the victim's body, and if not, why not?\nScuttlebutt:\nI, well... that is... No... I-I didn't take one.\nApollo:\nWell, that's strange... Why wouldn't you take a picture if you're always eyeing a scoop?\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk!\nApollo:\nDid you or didn't you really see the victim's body?!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk! Er... it's not like I, uh... actually SAW it, saw it, but...\nBlackquill:\nWhat the devil?!\nApollo:\nDid you hear that, Your Honor? The witness didn't actually see the body! That completely overturns the prosecution's claim that the witness was led to it!\nBlackquill:\nJustice-dono! You dare bare steel at me again?!\nScuttlebutt:\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss, sss! Nice try, boy wonder! So what if I didn't see the body? The fact remains that Juniper led me there. Feast your eyes on this!\nApollo:\nWhat exactly am I looking at here?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! It's a crucial moment forever frozen in time by my third eye. A photo clearly showing Juniper Woods! Kaaaaaahk!\nBlackquill:\n...Why did you not tell me of this?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. It's a shocking scoop I was saving for just the right moment. And that would be now, right here in court. Surprise! Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss. Kaaaaaaaaaaaahk! What'd I do, what'd I do?! All journalists keep their scoops secret until the right moment!\nApollo:\nShe's pretty brave hiding it from Blackquill like that.\nAthena:\nOr pretty stupid. ...Well, this is an unexpected turn.\nApollo:\n...Um, Athena? About this picture... See how it only shows the back of the subject?\nAthena:\nAh! So, then...!\nApollo:\nRight, who knows whether this photo Juniper in the first place!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph. A completely irrelevant point. What IS relevant here is... ...there was someone who did try to lead the witness to the body. Take a gander at this -- the route by which the accused escaped. The witness pursued the accused this way, after she fled the dressing room. The accused descended to the first floor and exited to the quad. Then what, Carton Cretin?\nScuttlebutt:\nThen I... tripped and fell. Caught my knee on my own box.\nAthena:\n(She stayed under the box, even while running after someone? Sounds difficult...)\nBlackquill:\nRecall that the body was already there, for Hugh O'Conner had already seen it. She was trying to show someone the body because she wanted to stop the mock trial!\nAthena:\nHrgh!\nApollo:\nApollo:\nBut if the facts have changed, that's all the more reason to cross-examine the witness!\nJudge:\nHmm... The defense has a point there. Very well, you may proceed with your cross-examination.\nBlackquill:\nHmph! It seems Justice-dono has saved your pretty little hide, missy. ...For now, at least.\nApollo:\n...Whew. Guess I pulled that off somehow.\nAthena:\nThanks, Apollo. You're a lifesaver.\nBlackquill:\nIncidentally, my compliments to the witness for her very fine box.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss, sss! It's primo cardboard, lovingly selected from among many-- Kahk!\nBlackquill:\nTell another lie or hide another fact from me... ...and I shall put it to the torch!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk... Kaaaaaahk! P-P-Please, anything but that!\nJudge:\nI think it would be more eco-friendly to recycle it, but that's just me. All right, Ms. Cykes. You may cross-examine the witness.\nCross Examination\n-- What Scuttlebutt Saw --\nScuttlebutt:\nI snuck into Juniper's dressing room while everyone was in the Lecture Hall.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nYou said you snuck in, but why would you do something like that?!\nScuttlebutt:\nBecause if I got a big scoop on Juniper, club membership would go through the roof! Right now, the Newspaper Club only has one member, me. The club's history once I'm gone. So, the Themis Herald's brand recognition is a matter of life and death!\nApollo:\nHer means may be questionable, but her motive is surprisingly sound.\nScuttlebutt:\nExtra, extra! \"Students seeking the Thrills and Chills of Exposé Journalism, Report to the Clubroom!\" This has been a paid advertisement. Anyway, where was I...?\nAthena:\n(Huh. Never took Myriam for such a go-getter.)\nScuttlebutt:\nJuniper had changed into her stage costume. I asked her, \"What're you doing?\"\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nWhy would she change into that costume? The mock trial was about to begin.\nScuttlebutt:\nHow should I know? But if you don't believe me, take a look at this photo! I captured this critical moment like the gonzo journalistic pro that I am.\nAthena:\nBut, this only shows the back of whoever was fleeing.\nScuttlebutt:\nYou expect me to shoot her face when she's running away from me?\nAthena:\nI guess you're right, but... (This doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere.)\nScuttlebutt:\nAt any rate, as this photo shows, Juniper was in her stage costume.\nScuttlebutt:\nWhen suddenly, she fled into the hallway, as if she wanted me to follow her.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThat doesn't mean you had to chase her.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! Call it a journalist's instinct! I see something fishy, I go after it!\nAthena:\nBut you never did catch up to her, did you?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss! A true undercover journalist gets up and dusts herself off when she stumbles!\nAthena:\nThat reminds me. Didn't you fall during the chase? When you tripped on your box?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! A true undercover journalist is always ready to stumble over a great story!\nAthena:\nSure are a lot of holes in your story. Or is that just the Scuttlebutt brand of journalism?\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk-kahk! A true undercover journalist always prevails against her adversaries!\nScuttlebutt:\nI followed her all the way to Prof. Courte's body! She led me right to it!\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nWhat would our client have to gain from leading you there?\nBlackquill:\nThe accused had employed her self-penned script as a manual for murder. Ergo, she had to stop the mock trial before the script's details became public. And that accounts for her desperate attempt to lead our carton cretin here to the body.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nBut, as we all know, Ms. Scuttlebutt didn't alert the authorities. And as a result, the mock trial began as scheduled!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nThe issue here is not whether it was, in fact, halted. The fact remains that the accused was trying to lead the witness to the body. Does that not show clear intent to halt the mock trial?\nAthena:\nArrrgh!\nScuttlebutt:\nI'm positive it was Juniper because she was wearing the costume that she had made!\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nYou say it was our client because the figure you witnessed was wearing her costume. Isn't that a bit simplistic?\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! It's only as simple and clear-cut as a good piece of journalism should be!\nAthena:\n......... (Sure it's simple, but I'd hardly call it clear-cut.)\nScuttlebutt:\nThat's why I chased her, sss, sss, sss, sss!\nPresent Stage Costume\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Scuttlebutt's sole basis for identifying our client as the figure in this photo...\"\nAthena:\nShe keeps saying that it was Junie, but she didn't even actually see the body.\nApollo:\nYeah, but Blackquill's assertion takes that into account.\nAthena:\nSo, even if I press her on never seeing the body... ...I won't be able to overturn this testimony.\nApollo:\nWell, whoever it was that was fleeing, Myriam never did see their face. So, I'm wondering why she thought it was Juniper. Try thinking along that line and see what you can come up with.\nAthena:\nMs. Scuttlebutt's sole basis for identifying our client as the figure in this photo... ...is the fact that it shows someone in Ms. Woods's stage costume.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. Well, it IS Juniper's costume. So that must be Juniper in it. It's clear-cut.\nAthena:\nNo, that's where you're completely mistaken!\nScuttlebutt:\nWhaaat?!\nAthena:\nThis is a design drawing of our client's stage costume.\nJudge:\nOh, my, what a wonderful creation! The constellations are extraordinary.\nAthena:\nI'm glad you noticed, because those stars are precisely what's important here. In the drawing, there are constellations all over the outside of the costume. But there's not a single star on the costume in the photo!\nJudge:\nO-Oh, then that means... Uh... What exactly?\nAthena:\nYour Honor, there were no other blue costumes at the scene. Which leads me to believe... ...that the figure in the photo was wearing our client's costume inside out.\nJudge:\nHmm... But why would Ms. Woods make a mistake like that?\nAthena:\nWell, it's not really a matter of why... ...but rather, who made the mistake of putting it on inside out.\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk... W-Wait, you're not suggesting...!\nAthena:\nThat's right. I'm glad you're catching on. The costume's designer wouldn't put her own costume on inside out!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk! Kaaaaaaaaaahk!\nAthena:\nSorry, Ms. Scuttlebutt, but... ...doesn't believing you had a scoop when you really didn't make you a failure as a reporter?\nScuttlebutt:\nA f-failure as a r-reporter?! Kahk-kahk-kahk. Kaaahk kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk! Ack! ...Ah!!!\nAthena:\nWhy hello, Ms. Scuttlebutt! So nice to meet the woman beneath the box!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk! Y-- You didn't see nothing!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nNow, I would have you stop right there, Cykes-dono. For it is the why of the matter upon which I would have this court focus.\nAthena:\nWhat do you mean?\nBlackquill:\nMs. Juniper Woods!\nWoods:\nYes?!\nBlackquill:\nWhat were you doing on the morning of the mock trial?\nWoods:\nI was in my dressing room, *cough* painting my costume in fluorescent paint.\nAthena:\nFluorescent... paint?\nWoods:\nMy design drawing shows twinkling stars on the costume. *cough* *cough* I was going to make the costume shimmer like that by painting the inside fluorescent.\nJudge:\nFluor... what was that again? Fluoride? Did your costume have cavities?\nWoods:\nNot fluoride -- fluorescent, as in glowing. The paint would make it glow in the dark. *cough*\nBlackquill:\nYes, yes, so you applied that to the inside of the costume. And then?\nWoods:\nI let it dry for a while because I heard it takes a long time. So I put the costume on my mannequin inside out.\nAthena:\nInside out...? So, then...\nBlackquill:\nThis is a photograph of the inside-out costume taken in the dark. As you can see, there is a heavy layer of paint over the entire inside surface. If someone were to properly don this costume in this state... ...the wet paint would get all over their body.\nJudge:\n...Why, yes! I believe it would!\nBlackquill:\nIndeed. Ergo, the costume was worn the way it was, not by anyone's mistake... ...but because this was the way it was on the mannequin -- inside out!\nAthena:\nGah!\nGlowing Costume Photo added to the Court Record.\nApollo:\nFigures he would have a photo.\nAthena:\nUgh. Did we just fall into his trap?\nApollo:\nYeah, I bet Blackquill had it all planned out. Still, I think you should give this photo a nice, long look.\nAthena:\nOh, please tell me you found something that doesn't add up.\nApollo:\nCheck out the chest area. It kinda looks like handprints to me. (Changed from [Check out the chest area. It kinda looks like a hand print to me.] in the original release)\nAthena:\nHey, you're right! But Junie would know better than to touch it while the paint was still wet.\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nI believe the term to describe your thought process is wishful thinking. After all, if master painters make mistakes, why not a rank amateur such as the accused?\nAthena:\nAthena:\nSo basically... you're saying, my claim requires evidence to back it up?\nApollo:\nEvidence? That shouldn't be a problem, right? After all, you've come this far.\nAthena:\nJust because I've come this far, that doesn't mean I've thought everything through, though...\nApollo:\nWhat?! You mean you've just been bluffing?!\nAthena:\nWhat did you expect me to do?! I'm sick of losing to this guy! But you're right... There's only one thing left to do at this point! And that's to present some evidence! Pronto!\nBlackquill:\n............A showdown, is it? I gladly accept!\nAthena:\n(The fluorescent paint must have stuck to the hands of whoever touched the costume. And that paint should glow in dark places... So, I just need to carefully check every last piece of evidence!) This piece of evidence shows who touched the costume!\nPresent Themis Herald Extra\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"A school newspaper?\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nBlackquill:\n.........\nJudge:\nIt seems Prosecutor Blackquill is not too pleased with your off-target evidence.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nOr is it so on target that it's rendered him speechless?!\nJudge:\nHmm... Let's ask him what he thinks. Prosecutor Blackquill?\nBlackquill:\n.........\nJudge:\nAs I thought. My initial suspicion was correct.\nAthena:\nGah hah! (Now I'M speechless...) Please! I think I've got it this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"The fluorescent paint must have stuck to the hands of whoever touched the costume.\"\nJudge:\nA school newspaper?\nBlackquill:\n...Interesting.\nAthena:\nTake a look at the photo where the lights are dimmed and the spotlight is on Ms. Woods. Observe Mr. Newman's hand in that photo as he stands at the prosecutor's bench. As you can see, it's glowing, just like Ms. Woods's fluorescent paint.\nJudge:\nHmm... It is glowing -- quite brightly I might add.\nAthena:\nBut why would he put fluorescent paint on his hand for the mock trial, you may ask? The answer is he wouldn't -- not on purpose. It got there when he put the costume on.\nJudge:\nOh...? I mean, oh! That means...! ......What again?\nAthena:\nIt means the figure photographed in the costume was not our client Juniper Woods. It was her classmate, Robin Newman!\nJudge:\nWHAAAAAAAAAT?!\nApollo:\n...To think you were actually able to prove that...\nAthena:\nWell, you never know what's going to happen next. That's the thrill of the courtroom!\nApollo:\nHmm... So, then... ...does that mean that Robin is our man...?\nAthena:\nHmm... Well... That's certainly how it looks...\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Very well, Robin Newman it is! He is here in the gallery, I trust? Show yourself! I challenge you to a duel!\nJudge:\nWill the witness please state his name and occupation.\nNewman:\nIIIIIIIIIII'M ROBIIIIIIIN NEWMAAAAAAAAN!!! I want to become a great artist! I practice day and night!!! YEAAAAAAH! NOOOOOO! That's not it! Art's gotta be sincere, maaaaaan!!!\nJudge:\nSo, for occupation, should we put down ...budding artist?\nNewman:\nNOOOOOO! Themis Legal Academy! Senior! PROSECUTOR COOOURSE! This brace is proof of my masculinity! I've been training to be a prosecutor for eighteen years! (Changed from [This brace is proof of my masculinity! I've been training to be a prosecutor for 18 years!] in the original release)\nJudge:\n*ahem* I assume you will be cleaning up the pottery you smashed before you leave today.\nNewman:\n.........Aaaaaaaaagh! AWWW, MAAAAAAAAAN!!! Aaaaaaaaagh! Aaagh...\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems the witness has finally settled down.\nAthena:\n(I guess nothing fazes the judge after all these years.)\nJudge:\nYou may proceed with your testimony, Mr. Newman. Specifically, the court wishes to hear why you had fluorescent paint on your hand.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Why I Touched the Costume --\nNewman:\nI went to see Juniper in her dressing room! BUT SHE WASN'T THERE!\nWhen I walked by that frilly costume, I was like, whoaaaaaa!!!\nThe mannequin it was on! IT WAS ABOUT TO FALL ON ME!!!\nI got that paint on me when I caught it!\nBut I never put it on! That's just STUUUPID!!!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nYour Honor! I recommend a short therapy session for the witness.\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Newman does seem particularly agitated, but...\nNewman:\nAgh! ...Arrrgh! Aaaaaaaaagh! Nooooooooooooooo!\nApollo:\nNot again. What's his problem?\nAthena:\nI sensed it the moment Robin took the stand. ...The discord in his heart!\nApollo:\nSo, you think he might be hiding something?\nAthena:\nProbably! You ready, Mr. Newman? Let's see what the Mood Matrix can do for you!\nNewman:\nI went to see Juniper in her waiting room!\nNewman:\nBUT SHE WASN'T THERE!\nNewman:\nWhen I walked by that frilly costume, I was like, whoaaaaaa!\nPinpoint Happy marker\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"When you mentioned the stage costume...\"\nNewman:\nThe mannequin it was on! IT WAS ABOUT TO FALL OVER!!!\nNewman:\nI got the paint on me when I caught it!\nNewman:\nI never put it on! That's just STUUUPID!\nAthena:\nHe had to catch the mannequin as it suddenly started to fall over?\nApollo:\nEven I can guess this one. The most natural response would be surprise.\nAthena:\n(Apollo's right, so maybe I should try focusing on some other emotion.)\nAthena:\nWhen you mentioned the stage costume... ...I sensed a sudden, powerful feeling of joy. Would you care to explain, Mr. Newman?\nNewman:\nW-W-Wait?! WHAAAAAAT?! Wh-Why would a frilly scarf-thing and a long skirt make me feel like that?!\nAthena:\nI don't know, but you seem awfully interested in that costume for some reason. You didn't happen to put it on, did you?\nNewman:\nL-Like I'd be into that kinda thing! I'm a dude! And I'm into braces! (Changed from [L-Like I'd be into that kinda thing! I'm a dude! I'm into braces, not dresses!] in the original release)\nApollo:\nYou don't think... Robin's actually got a thing for Juniper's outfit... do you? (Changed from [You don't think... Robin likes girls' clothes... do you?] in the original release)\nAthena:\nOh, come on! Isn't it obvious?!\nApollo:\n...You're enjoying this a bit too much, Athena.\nNewman:\nNO WAY, MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN! The mannequin came falling toward me, so I stuck out my hands to stop it! End of story!!!\nAthena:\nThat's a new piece of information! Time to run an update! (Hmm... Even after that update, something just doesn't feel right here. Do I have anything that could prove his statement contradicts what really happened?)\nPresent Glowing Costume Photo\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"You said the mannequin came falling toward you, so you stuck your hands out to stop it.\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThis piece of evidence clearly shows the contradiction in your statement!\nNewman:\nNo way, maaaaaan! The only contradiction that thing shows... ...is your existeeeeeeeeeeeeence!!!\nAthena:\nUgh! (I-I object to that statement! Okay, so... Maybe I should compare when he caught the mannequin against the evidence.)\nLeads back to:\n\"Do I have anything that could prove his statement contradicts what really happened?\"\nAthena:\nYou said the mannequin came falling toward you, so you stuck your hands out to stop it. If so, then then fingers of your hands would've been pointing outward like this. But that's not what the handprints show. In fact, this looks more like just your thumbs and the base of your palms.\nNewman:\nWh-Why in the world would I leave such weird handprints?\nAthena:\nYou know why! You left them when you went to adjust the scarf after putting it on. Just like the model in this drawing!\nNewman:\nWHOOOOOOA!\nAthena:\nWhy don't you admit it, Mr. Newman? You DID put the stage costume on, didn't you? And you really DO like Ms. Woods's clothes, don't you? (Changed from [And you really DO like frilly clothes, don't you?] in the original release)\nNewman:\nFine! I admit to putting the costume on! BUUUUUUT! I DON'T LIKE GIRLY CLOTHES, MAAAN!!!\nNOISE LEVEL90%\nAthena:\nYes! New information to plug in! Time for another update!\nNewman:\nI snuck in, knowing the costume was in there!\nNewman:\nMy heart was pounding, even though I'm a guy.\nNewman:\nThen I saw it! It was even more amazing than I'd imagined!\nNewman:\nI was like, WHOAAA! I'm a guy, but I got all excited!\nPinpoint Sad marker\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"There! Another emotion that doesn't fit.\"\nNewman:\nIt's true! I did put on girly clothes!\nPinpoint Sad marker\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"There! Another emotion that doesn't fit.\"\nNewman:\nBut it was strictly for artistic purposes!\nAthena:\nHopefully, we can figure out what Robin's hiding based on this new information.\nApollo:\nJust hope it's not more than we bargained for, although that usually seems to be the case.\nAthena:\nThere! Another emotion that doesn't fit.\nNewman:\nSo what?! You're really starting to get on my nerves, maaaaaan!\nAthena:\nMr. Newman, you got excited when you put the costume on... ...but you also felt sad.\nNewman:\nWho cares if I felt sad?! It's no big deaaaaaal!\nAthena:\nOkay, Mr. Newman, out with it! Why did you feel sad?! You're hiding something, aren't you?!\nNewman:\nOoh! Nooooooooo!\nAthena:\nYou're not fooling anyone anymore. Now, tell us why you were sad!\nNewman:\nOKAAAAAY, FIIINE! If you're gonna be that way, I'll tell you!!! The reason I felt sad is... is... is...!!! No matter how much I dress up, I'll never be as pretty as Juniper!!!\nApollo:\nWell, no offense, but his habit of shouting at the top of his lungs... doesn't exactly help... (Changed from [Well, no offense, but for one thing, he's a guy -- and a real hothead at that.] in the original release)\nNewman:\nNOOOOOOOOOOOO! THAT'S NOT IIIIIIIIIIT! I totally owned those girly clothes! I should've been totally pretty!!! BUT! BUT! THERE'S SOMETHING THAT KEEPS GETTING IN MY WAAAAAAY!!!\nAthena:\nWow! That's a whole lot of anger and raw emotion right there! His heart is crying out in pain -- his emotions are out of control!\nApollo:\nOut-of-control emotions...! We saw those during the Nine-Tails Vale incident. (Changed from [Out-of-control emotions...! We saw those during the Nine-Tales [sic] Vale incident.] in the original release) So, all we have to do is find the source of his uncontrollable anger, right?\nAthena:\nRight. Help me look for a conflict between his statements and the images we see. If we can find that we can wrestle him away from whatever's tormenting him. (Mr. Newman said that there's something \"getting in the way\" of him being pretty. Something that doesn't go with \"girly clothes\"... But what could it be?)\nNewman:\nFINE! I'LL TESTIFY, MAAAAAAN!!!\nNOISE LEVEL85%\nNewman:\nI snuck in, knowing the costume was in there!\nNewman:\nMy heart was pounding, even though I'm a guy.\nNewman:\nIt's true! I felt a powerful feeling when I saw that long frilly scarf.\nNewman:\nI admit it! I wore girly clothes!\nNewman:\nI felt like a diva when I pulled the hood over my head!\nProbe Brace\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Newman, you feel a great deal of anger toward your brace, don't you?\"\nNewman:\nIt felt so right I was totally dressed up like a girl!\nProbe Brace\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Newman, you feel a great deal of anger toward your brace, don't you?\"\nApollo:\nSo, we're looking for the source of his anger?\nAthena:\nRight. The conflict in his testimony will most likely arise from his emotional repression. Let's compare the images to his testimony! We might find the problem that way!\nAthena:\nMr. Newman, you feel a great deal of anger toward your brace, don't you? Is that what you feel is holding you back from being as pretty as you think you should be?\nNewman:\nHuh? Wh-Wh-Wh-WHAAAAAAT?!\nAthena:\nMr. Newman! The truth is, you really want to take that brace off, don't you?\nNewman:\nNo way maaan! This is a symbol of masculinity! I could never take it off!!!\nAthena:\nIs it that you can't take it off, or that you don't want to take it off?\nNewman:\nAw, maaaaaaaaaaaan! I shoulda kept my big mouth shut!!!\nAthena:\n......... (This is really weird. He exhibits intense anger toward his brace, which he calls a \"symbol of masculinity\"... ...but he can't take it off, not even when he's trying to look pretty. (Changed from [...but he can't take it off, even when dressing like a girl.] in the original release) What could be at the root of his complicated relationship with his brace? (Changed from [And why is he so interested in girls' clothes in the first place?] in the original release) I have a feeling we're on the verge of uncovering an earth-shattering secret.)\nApollo:\nAthena? You okay?\nAthena:\nIt seems Robin is still hiding a secret. A big one.\nApollo:\nBigger than the fact that he's secretly jealous of Juniper's looks? (Changed from [Bigger than the fact that he likes to wear girls' clothes?] in the original release)\nAthena:\nYes, at least I think so. ! (No, it can't be! I just thought of something, but it's totally insane!) Mr. Newman!\nNewman:\nWh-What?!\nAthena:\nI'm on to your little secret. And if I'm correct, it's not very little at all. It's huge! This sounds completely insane, but it's the only possibility left.\nYou want to be pretty like a girl (Changed from [You like girls' clothing] in the original release)\nAthena:\nRobin Newman! You want to be as pretty as you feel! (Changed from [Mr. Newman! You like to dress like a girl!] in the original release)\nNewman:\nThat's right! And I'm never gonna change! I'll show you how real men cross-dress!!!\nAthena:\nYou will? (Now???)\nApollo:\nAthena, we already know he likes to cross-dress. This line of discussion is a dead end.\nAthena:\n(And yet, he can't take that \"symbol of masculinity\" off... (Changed from [But if he really likes to dress like a girl, you'd think he'd want to...] in the original release) ...even when it clashes with his ideal self-image. Wait, could this mean...? (Changed from [...take that 'symbol of masculinity' off when he does it. Wait, could this mean...?] in the original release))\nLeads back to:\n\"This sounds completely insane, but it's the only possibility left.\"\nYou hate girls\nAthena:\nYou don't like girls, do you?\nNewman:\nWhat?! Whaaaaaat?! WHAT GAVE YOU THAT IDEA?!\nAthena:\nOh... Then, what? You like girls?\nNewman:\nI-I-I! I refuse to answer thaaaat!\nApollo:\nAthena, you're not asking just of curiosity, are you?\nAthena:\nWhat? N-No, of course not! (Better try something else.)\nLeads back to:\n\"This sounds completely insane, but it's the only possibility left.\"\nYou're a girl\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Newman, or should I say... Ms. Newman...\"\nAthena:\nMr. Newman, or should I say... Ms. Newman... You are and always have been a girl!\nApollo:\nWhat?! Have you lost the plot, Athena?!\nAthena:\nNo, I'm completely serious. I don't have any direct evidence. But that's what Robin's heart is shouting out, loud and clear!\nApollo:\nApollo:\nI still think you've totally lost it! I mean, Robin reeks of testosterone! How could he possibly be a she?! I, for one, have never seen a girl who shouts like a maniac all the time!\nNewman:\nOoh. Ooh hoo hoo. Ooooooh.\nJudge:\nI've seen plenty of witnesses in my day... ...but if he's a she, then she's the most convincing actress I have ever encountered. Therefore, let me pronounce my verdict. Robin Newman is without question... a man!\nNewman:\nOoh. Ooh hoo hoo. Ooooooh. Ooh hoo hoo.........\nBlackquill:\nYou are now truly Justice-dono's equal in one area. You are just as equally insane! Never in the history of this planet has there been a finer specimen of the masculine spirit.\nNewman:\nNewman:\nOooh... AAAAAAAAAAAAGH! IF YOU GUYS ARE DONE TALKING ABOUT MEEEEEEEEEEE!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAGH! I'M...! I'M...!\n.................. ............Heh... Ha ha! Ah ha ha ha ha ha! Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!\nAthena:\nAhhhhhhh! The brace! It's...!\nNewman:\nMs. Cykes... No, allow me to call you \"Athena.\" I wanted to keep this a secret at all costs! But noooo!\nApollo:\nWh-- No waaaaaaaaaaaay!\nBlackquill:\nGnnnaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! .........S-Surely this must be some kind of jest?\nNewman:\nEh heh heh, nope, it's for real. I'm a girl, body and soul. If you don't believe me, I'll give you a P-E-E-K.\nBlackquill:\nAaaaaaagh!\nNewman:\nAs if! Ah ha ha ha ha!\nAthena:\n(What an amazing transformation.) Well, all the discord is gone. The image is now complete!\nNOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYE\nNewman:\nI was raised as a boy since I was little, and I studied law just as my parents wanted. But now, this living lie that had me pinned to the ground, it's...! Aaaaaagh! *huff* *puff* It's been blown to smithereens by you, Athena! Now I can stop pretending I want to be a prosecutor! I'm gonna be an artist! Yaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!!! What a shocking development. He really DID turn out to be she!\nNewman:\nEek! Why's everyone looking at me like that?! Tee hee! I feel like a movie star or something! But no paparazzi please! I value my privacy, O-K-A-Y? RAAAAAAAAAWH! No pics or you'll regret it, maaaaaaaaaan!!!\nApollo:\nAm I just imagining things, or is Robin even more hyper now than when she was a he?\nAthena:\nI don't know. Maybe it's because she finally got her troubles off her chest, literally.\nJudge:\nThis is all well and good, but does he being a she actually change anything?\nAthena:\nThe fact that the witness is a girl does change things. Because there is now a piece of evidence that we must re-evaluate!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well, let's see what the defense has for us now. What piece of evidence must we reconsider now that we know that the witness is a girl?\nPresent Tape Recorder\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"This is what I'd like the court to reconsider.\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThis piece of evidence must be reconsidered because Mr. Newman is really Ms. Newman!\nJudge:\nHmm... Please do explain.\nAthena:\nYes, Your Honor. You see, I feel that if you have a sharp eye and an open mind... ...you can discover something completely new in the most obvious of places!\nJudge:\nHmm... Yet, the defense's statement reflects anything but those two admirable traits.\nAthena:\nEeek! (Guess that won't fly! But I know we have some sort of evidence that could be seen differently based on sex.)\nLeads back to:\n\"What piece of evidence must we reconsider now that we know that the witness is a girl?\"\nAthena:\nThis is what I'd like the court to reconsider.\nJudge:\nOh, the tape recorder -- the one that recorded the threat, \"You're a goner!\"\nAthena:\nThat's right. And we have already established that it's a female voice in the recording. Of all the students who could've moved the body before the mock was to start... ...our client was the only female if you exclude Ms. Scuttlebutt because of her alibi. And that is why the tape recorder made our client the prime suspect.\nJudge:\nAh... So then...!\nAthena:\nThat's right! The witness just revealed that she's a girl! Therefore! If we are using the voice in this recording as the basis for hurling accusations... ...this witness must be labeled a suspect, too!\nNewman:\nOh... Oh, noooooo!\nApollo:\nWow... Talk about a sudden turn of events. You've done it. You've found a hole in one of the prosecution's key pieces of evidence.\nAthena:\nYeah... But, wow, that was a lot of work for a single one.\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nNot so hasty, now. You're forgetting that only one person here was privy to the script. Ergo, Ms. Juniper Woods is still the prime suspect!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nBut Ms. Newman hid the fact that she was a girl, both at the crime scene and in court! I'd say that puts her in Camp Suspicious!\nNewman:\nEek! That's not nice, Athena! How can you accuse me of being a killer? I mean, I'm just a weak, innocent little girl! Just thinking about murder makes me--\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph! Suspicious is as suspicious does. Undoubtedly, the witness does have some sort of connection to this crime. Perhaps our newfound lady is merely feigning ignorance. We can surmise that she lent support to the principal offender, Juniper Woods. By leading Ms. Scuttlebutt to the body, that would make her an accessory to the crime.\nNewman:\nHow can you say that?! I'm not an accessory to any crime, Mr. Birdman!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\n...B-Birdman...? In any event, with the witness as an accessory, it explains quite a bit, does it not?\nAthena:\nAthena:\n............Argh! (He made it all make sense somehow! And he'll keep accusing Junie unless we can show someone else knew the script's details. But how could someone have gotten their hands on that kind of info? The only way they could've known what was in the script was if they...)\nSaw the mock trial\nAthena:\nNothing could be more simple. All anyone had to do was watch the mock trial.\nBlackquill:\n.........\nApollo:\nBut Athena, the murder took place before the mock trial even began.\nAthena:\nOof, that's right.\nBlackquill:\n.........\nJudge:\nI believe Prosecutor Blackquill wishes to penalize you, Ms. Cykes.\nAthena:\nYeowch! (What is this, Athena the Piñata Day?)\nLeads back to:\n\"The only way they could've known what was in the script was if they...\"\nHeard it from Junie\nLeads to:\n\"Sorry, Junie, but...\"\nHad penned the script\nAthena:\nI've got it! All anyone has to do is write their own script! In a completely stream-of-thought, devil-may-care way!\nJudge:\nI'm not even going to ask how such a Frankenstein could resemble the actual script!\nAthena:\nNoooooo! (Oh, well, if at first you don't succeed...)\nLeads back to:\n\"The only way they could've known what was in the script was if they...\"\nAthena:\n(Sorry, Junie, but... You're not going to like this.) Our client may have leaked the script's details to someone.\nBlackquill:\n...What the devil?\nWoods:\nAnd I know I shouldn't have, but... I revised the script to favor the prosecution. But Prof. Courte noticed it immediately and changed it back.\nAthena:\nMs. Woods did not want Hugh O'Conner to win the mock trial. That's why I believe she leaked the details to the witness, Robin Newman.\nApollo:\nI get it. If Robin won, Hugh wouldn't be able to confess to Juniper.\nAthena:\nRight. Junie was probably trying to keep their friendship from becoming awkward.\nNewman:\nNewman:\n*sob* *sniffle* How could you, Thena! WHADDA BUNCH O' BULL! I...! I...! I NEVER HEARD A WORD ABOUT THE SCRIPT FROM JUNIPER. NEVER EVEEEEEER!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nYou sure?! Can you look me in the eye and swear you didn't?\nNewman:\nB-A-D Athena... YOU DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDEEEEEEEENCE!\nAthena:\nGrr...\nApollo:\n.........Actually, we might have just the thing.\nAthena:\nReally?\nApollo:\nYeah, one of Robin's lines I read when we were reenacting the mock trial.\nKlavier:\nHere's a shot of the crime scene. Ironically, it was Prof. Courte who posed as the corpse. Herr Forehead, how did the mock trial participants react to this photo?\nApollo:\nMr. Newman was surprised by what Prof. Courte was wearing.\nApollo:\nRobin said, \"Oh, the green sweat suit.\"\nNewman:\nS-U-R-E, I might have said that. But... SO WHHAAATTT?!\nApollo:\nWell, think of it this way, Athena.\nAthena:\nY-Yeah. Uh, which way, exactly?\nApollo:\nIf I told you that I'd be wearing a blue suit today... ...but then showed up wearing what I've got on now, what would you say?\nAthena:\nUmm... \"Oh, the red suit.\" Ah! (I-I think I've got it...!) Your Honor! We have evidence proving that Ms. Newman knew the contents of the script. The defense moves to present said evidence to the court!\nJudge:\nVery well, Ms. Cykes. Present away.\nAthena:\nThis evidence proves that Ms. Newman had prior knowledge of the script's contents.\nPresent Mock Trial Script\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"...The mock trial's script?\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nJudge:\nHmm... And on what are you basing your assertion?\nNewman:\nI don't understand! Why are you just making stuff up? Oh, Athena! Shame on Y-O-U!\nJudge:\nYes, that's R-I-G-H-T!\nAthena:\nS-O-R-R-Y!\nNewman:\nOh my gawd, you two! That was so C-U-T-E!\nJudge:\nWhy, thank you! Erhm, but I'm afraid I must award Ms. Cykes a penalty.\nAthena:\n(When Robin commented about the body in the mock trial... ...it was like she was saying Prof. Courte was wearing the sweat suit she always wore. That's not something you'd expect her to say, unless...!)\nLeads back to:\n\"This evidence proves that Ms. Newman had prior knowledge of the script's contents.\"\nJudge:\n...The mock trial's script?\nAthena:\nMs. Newman, during the mock trial, you were shown a photo of the victim's body... ...and reportedly, you reacted by saying, \"Oh, the green sweat suit.\"\nNewman:\nOh, um... Yes, I said that. What's your point?\nAthena:\nYou seemed to have some issue with the green sweat suit, and I think I know why. The proof is in the script, specifically on the \"Things to Prepare\" page. \"Sweat suit: Victim's outfit will be a red one from the prosecutor course.\"\nNewman:\nAh!\nAthena:\nYou were surprised because the sweat suit in the photo was green. But, if you didn't know about the script's content... Then that shouldn't have surprised you!\nNewman:\n...N-- Noooooooooooooooooo! I thought we were friends, Athena! How could I have been so bliiiiiiiiind!\nAthena:\nIn light of her privileged knowledge, I move to declare Ms. Newman a suspect, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nYou whaaaaaat?!\nNewman:\nNewman:\nIf knowing script details makes me a suspect... ...then there must be others besides me! I mean, someone else could've also seen Prof. Courte's note!\nAthena:\nNote...? What note?\nNewman:\nThe professor and Juniper were working together to prepare for the mock trial. But only one copy of the script was made to prevent it from being leaked. But that gets kind of inconvenient, right?\nAthena:\nYou're not seriously going to suggest...!\nNewman:\nEek! But it's the truth! Prof. Courte did do exactly what you're thinking! She didn't write down any of the proceedings or the truth behind the case... But she did write a note to herself about the props and details about the victim's B-O-D-Y!\nAthena:\n...Is this really true, Ms. Newman?\nNewman:\nIf you don't believe me, send the police over to my house! Tell them to check the pictures on my camera. I thought it might give me an advantage... ...so I took a picture of the note!\nApollo:\n.........I'd say she's telling the truth.\nAthena:\n(...Wait a sec!) If there's a note with details about the body, then that means... ...there are others who could have made the murder look like our client's script!\nJudge:\nYes, I believe you're right!\nBlackquill:\n...Hmph!\nAthena:\nApparently, this case isn't as clear-cut as Prosecutor Blackquill would have us believe. This new revelation blasts a big fat hole in the prosecution's case!\nJudge:\nO-hoooooooooo!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nBully for you, missy. But don't think this spells victory.\nAthena:\nAnd why not?!\nBlackquill:\nThe battle is still young. And my blade is now fully drawn. Between it and my next witness, your life will be forfeit. So, put away your wooden sword... ...and show me what you are truly capable of if you wish to live!\nAthena:\n(You want it? Don't worry, I'm gonna bring it!)\nO'Conner:\n......... I already said I want nothing to do with this trial.\nBlackquill:\nHow juvenile. It is not a matter of what you want, for you WILL cooperate, Hugh O'Conner.\nJudge:\nProsecutor Blackquill. Why have you called this witness?\nBlackquill:\nYou will recall that the day before the mock trial -- in short, the day of the murder... ...the accused testified that she left for home at around 6:00 PM.\nJudge:\nYes. My notes here do confirm that fact.\nAthena:\nRight. Our client wasn't at school at the estimated time of death, so she couldn't be--\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nYet, that was but a felicitous lie. Or am I mistaken, Golden Boy?\nO'Conner:\n...I've no intention of saying anything more. Now, if you'll excuse me.\nBlackquill:\nHold! I am not through with you yet.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. It seems the rogue prosecutor has it out for me.\nBlackquill:\nLeave, and we just might discuss you-know-what.\nO'Conner:\nAck! N-No, wait!\nAthena:\n(One little statement and Mr. Cool loses it? What's that all about?)\nO'Conner:\nI changed my mind. ...I'll stay and testify.\nJudge:\nHmm... Are you sure, Mr. O'Conner?\nO'Conner:\nHeh. The word of a genius is as good as gold. Let's get on with this. Hugh O'Conner. A senior at Themis Legal Academy, lawyer course. How's that?\nJudge:\nJ-Just fine. Your testimony, then... If you please.\nApollo:\nYou're up against the top of the class now. I'd be careful if I were you.\nAthena:\nI know Junie would never lie like that! That pompous schoolboy won't know what hit him!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Around the Time of the Murder --\nO'Conner:\nTo get mentally prepared for the mock trial, I meditated at the archery range till 7:00 PM.\nAt around 7:15, I went to the main building before going home. That's when I saw Juniper.\nWe didn't say much as we passed by each other. She seemed her usual self.\nThat's it. Anything else you'd like to ask?\nBlackquill:\nThat is quite enough. Well done, Golden Boy.\nO'Conner:\n...Heh.\nBlackquill:\nThe final bell rings at 7:00 PM, at which point, the campus is a desolate place. Now, you will recall the tape recorder. We know the time of the voice recording. It was 7:10 PM, the day before the mock trial. That was the dark hour of this heinous crime.\nAthena:\nD-Do you have any proof of that?!\nBlackquill:\nAs its final bell, this school plays a special broadcast when the clock strikes seven. The female voice on the tape appears ten minutes after that broadcast. The killer waited until the school was empty to spring her devious and deadly trap.\nTape Recorder updated in the Court Record.\nJudge:\nSo, when the witness saw the defendant, that would've been...!\nBlackquill:\nIndeed. It was five minutes after the voice was captured on tape in the art room. Ergo, we know that the accused was still in the main building, even after the killing.\nJudge:\nHmm... So the time of the murder and the time of when the body was moved...\nAthena:\n(Great... Another inconvenient testimony.)\nJudge:\nMs. Cykes, your cross-examination, please.\nCross Examination\n-- Around the Time of the Murder --\nO'Conner:\nTo get mentally prepared for the mock trial, I meditated at the archery range till 7:00 PM.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nSo, um... do you meditate often?\nO'Conner:\nHeh. Don't tell me you're going to start pestering me, too.\nAthena:\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\nO'Conner:\nNo need to play dumb with me. All the girls want to know about my private life.\nAthena:\nWha--?!\nJudge:\nI will remind the defense this is a court of law, not a pick-up spot.\nBlackquill:\nHmph. It seems miss fancy-pants lawyer is smitten with the witness.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nObjection! Objection!!! OBJECTIIIIOOOOON!!! I'm just trying to establish the witness's--\nO'Conner:\nIf you must know, I never go a day without meditating. Satisfied now, stalker girl?\nAthena:\nThat's it! You'd better take that--!\nApollo:\nWhoa, whoa, there, tiger. Just take a deep breath and relax.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. I'll just continue my testimony now, if you don't mind.\nO'Conner:\nAt around 7:15, I went to the main building before going home. That's when I saw Juniper.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nOur client has stated she went home at 6:00 PM!\nAthena:\nYou and Prof. Courte were busy preparing for the mock trial together yesterday, right? Was that the last time you saw her?\nWoods:\n...Yes. I left school at around 6:00 PM.\nO'Conner:\n...No, wrong. I don't know what she was doing, but Juniper was definitely at school after 7:00 PM. But I suppose neither side can prove one way or the other.\nAthena:\nUgh. (But if Junie was there, that means she's lying.)\nO'Conner:\nTruth be told, I only saw her for the briefest of moments.\nO'Conner:\nWe didn't say much as we passed by each other. She seemed her usual self.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nSo you just walked past a good friend, barely saying a word?\nO'Conner:\nThe final bell had already rung. They get mad when you stand around chatting. Then again, we're not like you people, talking endlessly in those annoyingly loud voices.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nAnnoyingly loud voices?! I'd like it if you refrained from insulting my partner like that!\nApollo:\nNormally, I'd shout, \"Objection!\" right about now, but I'll take this one for the team.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. Anyway, I think that's about all I have to say.\nO'Conner:\nOh, let me add I never went to the art room. There was no reason for me to be there.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nYou had no reason to be in the art room... Really?\nO'Conner:\nThe lawyer course I'm in is supervised by Prof. Means. Plus, I'm not a member of Prof. Courte's Art Club, so why would I even go there?\nAthena:\nWhat about art class?\nO'Conner:\nHeh. Nice try, but Seniors don't take art class.\nAthena:\nAll right, then let me ask you--\nO'Conner:\nWait. I just remembered something important!\nAthena:\nYou did?\nO'Conner:\nI scored only a hundred percent on all the art tests I took through Junior year. (Changed from [I scored only 100% on all the art tests I took through Junior year.] in the original release) ...That's it.\nAthena:\n(Riiight... Always happy to indulge in some ego-stroking. Anyway, what to ask next...)\nHow did you prep for the mock trial?\nAthena:\nPlease tell the court what you were dong on October 23rd, the day before the mock trial.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. That's an easy one -- nothing in particular.\nAthena:\nNothing at all? You didn't help with the preparations?\nO'Conner:\nYou don't get it, do you? I was merely playing the role assigned to me. I left the preparations and the like to others. My job was to be mentally prepared.\nAthena:\n(Junie put her heart and soul into getting things ready, while he just sat on his behind?)\nO'Conner:\nJust to reiterate, I spent most of the 23rd meditating at the archery range. I didn't talk to anyone until the school closed at 7:00 PM. I supposed a few Archery Club members did come and go while I was there.\nAthena:\nBut you didn't talk to anyone? Not a single soul?\nO'Conner:\nThat's right. I didn't say a word to anyone till the final bell at 7:00 PM.\nAthena:\nI see... This is crucial information. Please add it to your testimony.\nO'Conner:\nI don't know if you're bluffing, but if you are, you have a pretty good poker face.\nChanges statement from \"Oh, let me add I never went to the art room. There was no reason for me to be there.\" to \"I didn't talk to anyone until the final bell. I'd been meditating alone at the archery range.\"\nWhy did you stay past the last bell?\nAthena:\nWhy would an honor student like you ignore the last bell?\nO'Conner:\nI wouldn't say I ignored it. I was simply running a little late.\nAthena:\nDo you remember exactly how late?\nO'Conner:\nHeh. You're a stickler for details, lady. But if I had to say, it was maybe about ten, fifteen minutes. If you think that's important, I'll add it to my testimony.\nAthena:\nI was hoping you'd say that.\nChanges statement from \"Oh, let me add I never went to the art room. There was no reason for me to be there.\" to \"The final bell had rung ten, fifteen minutes earlier. No biggie.\"\nNo further questions\nAthena:\nActually, never mind. I've got all the info I need.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. My, don't we seem confident.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nO'Conner:\nThe final bell had rung ten, fifteen minutes earlier. No biggie.\nPress\nAthena:\nAthena:\nYou ignored the last bell for no reason? Shame on you!\nO'Conner:\nNo, shame on YOU! Pressing me for no reason...\nAthena:\nGrrr...!\nApollo:\nWell, people do run late sometimes. Like you on the day this whole case began.\nAthena:\nArrrgh!\nJudge:\nIt appears we have a culprit in the case of \"The Pot Calling The Kettle Black.\"\nAthena:\nEt tu, Your Honor...?! (Hmmm... Now what? Ask another question?)\nDid you go to the art room?\nAthena:\nDid you stop by the art room, or as it's now known, the scene of the crime?\nO'Conner:\nNo, I didn't.\nAthena:\nCan you prove it?\nO'Conner:\nAs much as I'd like to say I could, I can't. But let me ask you, can YOU prove that I did?\nAthena:\nAs much as I'd like to say I could, I can't. But I will ask how often do you visit there?\nO'Conner:\nHardly ever. There's no reason for me to be there, anyway.\nAthena:\nThere's no reason for you to be there?\nO'Conner:\nIs there an echo in here? If something's bothering you, I'll just add it to my testimony.\nAthena:\nHow considerate. Thank you for noticing.

But what does that matter?\nAthena:\n(So, he didn't have any conversations? The entire day? Me thinks that claim needs a little more scrutiny. But what should I do? Is there anything I should ask about in more detail?)\nDid you go to the art room?\nAthena:\nDid you stop by the art room, or as it's now known, the scene of the crime?\nO'Conner:\nNo, I didn't.\nAthena:\nCan you prove it?\nO'Conner:\nAs much as I'd like to say I could, I can't.

Our job is still the same.\nAthena:\n(Sure, but if Junie was really still at school after 6:00 PM... Ugh. I didn't spot any inconsistencies in Hugh's testimony, either. What am I supposed to do now?)\nAthena:\nSo, you didn't talk to anybody on October 23rd? Are you sure about that?\nO'Conner:\nHeh. I already told you, my word is as good as gold.\nAthena:\nOkay, then how do you explain this? And don't spare any details.\nO'Conner:\nSorry, never seen that before.\nAthena:\nThis is the victim's planner. She recorded all of her plans in great detail. Take a look at this page here. It reads, \"23rd - Meet with Hugh\" and \"Important.\" Don't you find that... interesting?\nO'Conner:\nWha-?! Where'd you get that?!\nAthena:\nThe keyword here is \"important.\" You say you were at the archery range all day. But you also said a few students came and went while you were there. That doesn't sound like a great place for an important talk.\nJudge:\nBut the entire campus was buzzing with activity before the mock trial. Where could they have possibly had a private conversation?\nAthena:\nI thought about that, too. But the situation changes after the last bell.\nJudge:\nWhat's this, now?!\nAthena:\nThe witness stayed after the last bell... ...in order to have a private talk with the victim. Am I right, Mr. O'Conner?!\nO'Conner:\nThis is insane!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Must we go through this yet again? I suppose you also have no evidence, as usual.\nAthena:\nNo, I don't have any direct evidence. However, the witness was meditating until after the last bell. And he attempted to conceal his private meeting with the victim!\nO'Conner:\nHeh. First Robin, now me? Who are you going to accuse next? You're just another unscrupulous attorney looking to get ahead.\nApollo:\nDon't let him get to you. He's definitely hiding something. I mean, he was supposed to meet with the victim around her estimated time of death.\nAthena:\nI had my suspicions about Robin, but... ...Hugh seems just as guilty! These three are the only possible suspects, after all!\nAthena:\nMr. O'Conner, answer me this! Did you meet with Prof. Courte that day?\nO'Conner:\n..................... Sorry, Mr. Jailbird Prosecutor. I don't mean to steal your thunder, but I've something to say.\nBlackquill:\nIf it will save me some trouble, then by all means, speak away.\nO'Conner:\nIf you would recall, Ms. Cykes, the voice on the tape recorder was female. Knowing that, I'd like you to explain how I could possibly be a suspect.\nAthena:\nOoh... (He has a point...)\nBlackquill:\nHmph, impressive. Golden Boy here does shine gold, indeed. Care to take the reins? You're more than capable of prosecuting this case.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. Sorry, but I'm studying to be a lawyer.\nBlackquill:\nWhat a pity. To think such genius is to be wasted on mere lawyering. At last, your moment is here, Cykes-dono. Time to refute Golden Boy's statement... ...and prove that you're the young prodigy worthy of the badge on your lapel!\nAthena:\nUuuurgh! (Could he lay any more pressure on...?!)\nApollo:\nThe voice is unmistakably female, so there's no point in arguing about that.\nAthena:\nYeah... You're right. In which case...! (To whom does the voice on the tape really belong to?)\nThe witness\nAthena:\nThe voice on the tape is that of this witness!\nO'Conner:\nBut I'm a man with a man's voice. All you have to do is open your eyes and ears.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThen let me ask, did you know Robin was a girl all along?\nO'Conner:\nAgh... But th-that's different...!\nAthena:\nSee, Your Honor, I have him squirming on the stand!\nJudge:\nYes, but it would have been nice if it had been due to a fact relevant to your rebuttal.\nAthena:\nArghh! (Now I'M the one squirming at my stand... The voice is definitely female. That much we know. In that case...)\nLeads back to:\n\"To whom does the voice on the tape really belong to?\"\nThe victim\nLeads to:\n\"The voice on the tape belongs to the victim. That's the only thing that makes sense.\"\nThe defendant\nAthena:\nIf the voice is female, it must belong to our client Juniper Woods!\nBlackquill:\nWell, now. Finally seen the light, have we?\nAthena:\nHuh?\nO'Conner:\nSo, you're going to explain how Juniper is guilty?\nAthena:\nWait... Oh, oops! Your Honor, let's pretend I never said that!\nJudge:\nHow about you at least pretend to take ownership of your statements.\nAthena:\nUuugh! (If it wasn't Junie's voice, then...)\nLeads back to:\n\"To whom does the voice on the tape really belong to?\"\nAthena:\nThe voice on the tape belongs to the victim. That's the only thing that makes sense.\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nAre you mad? The voice on the recording says, \"You're a goner!\" That is something a murderer shouts at their victim, not the other way around.\nAthena:\nHmm... (Yeah, that is a problem.) You're a goner... You're a goner... You're a goner...\nApollo:\nUm, Athena?\nAthena:\nYou're a goner... You a goner... Hew a corner... Hue o conner? ...Wait a second!\nApollo:\nWhoa, Athena, you're scaring me here.\nAthena:\nYOU'RE scared? I'm terrified for even coming up with this!\nApollo:\nWith what?\nAthena:\nProsecutor Blackquill! You wanted to know if I am worthy of my badge. Well, I'm about to show you why, despite my age, I can wear it with pride! (Changed from [Well, I'm about to show you why, despite my age, I'm able to proudly wear this at all!] in the original release)\nBlackquill:\nOh? Then can I take it you won't be changing your argument? Still, it stands that it's a bit odd for the victim to be the one yelling, \"You're a goner!\"\nAthena:\nI agree, if that's what the victim was saying. But it's not.\nJudge:\nHmm... I assume you have something to back up your assertion, Ms. Cykes?\nAthena:\n(Not exactly... But you don't have to add fuel to his fire, Your Honor!) If it is indeed Prof. Courte's voice on the tape, then she was shouting because she was...\nThreatening O'Conner\nAthena:\n\"You're a goner!\" was a threat directed at the witness!\nO'Conner:\nAnd what possible reason would she have to do that?\nAthena:\nOh, well, she was at that rebellious age. You know how students can be.\nJudge:\nThe victim was neither a student nor at a rebellious age. She was a professor.\nAthena:\nNoooooo! (How could I forget such a basic fact?! You're a goner... You a goner... Hew a corner... Wait! Maybe...!)\nLeads back to:\n\"If it is indeed Prof. Courte's voice on the tape, then she was shouting because she was...\"\nBeing threatened by O'Conner\nAthena:\n\"You're a goner\" was a threat the witness shouted at the victim!\nBlackquill:\nAs has been mentioned countless times, the voice in the recording is female. How the devil do you reckon it belongs to the witness?\nAthena:\nOh, right, heh heh.\nJudge:\nI'm confused how you could be confused about that, so without further ado, a penalty.\nAthena:\nNo fair! (Two against one! You're a goner... You a goner... Hew a corner... Wait! Maybe...!)\nLeads back to:\n\"If it is indeed Prof. Courte's voice on the tape, then she was shouting because she was...\"\nScolding O'Conner\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to call one basic fact into question.\"\nAthena:\nI would like to call one basic fact into question. Is that shout on the tape really saying, \"You're a goner!\"?\nApollo:\n...What are you up to now, Athena?\nAthena:\nProf. Courte's planner says she was supposed to meet with the witness for an important talk. Perhaps our witness, despite being a genius, had done something wrong... And this made Prof. Courte get angry with him during their private meeting.\nJudge:\nI don't see how this changes what we heard on the tape.\nAthena:\nWell, if you want to see how it changes things ...then let's try a little experiment. Your Honor, I want you to tell at the witness as if you're mad at him. But... and this is important... use his full name!\nJudge:\nO-Okay! Let's see, um... Hugh O'Conner!!!\nO'Conner:\nHeh. What did I do to deserve that?\nAthena:\nYes, like that! Now try again, but faster!\nJudge:\nHugh Aconner!!! ...Hm? Hue... a coner? Hew... o coner? You... a coner? W-Wait a second! ...No, no, no, this can't be.\nAthena:\nAthena:\n(You think I'd spend the energy to lead you this far if it wasn't true?!) Ah, but it is, Your Honor. Humans are not perfect, that's a scientific fact. We sometimes mistake shadows for monsters, or the winds for voices.\nJudge:\nHmmm... Now that you mention it...\nAthena:\n(You can do this, Athena! Just give the old guy one more little push...!) The sound on the tape recorder never was the phrase \"You're a goner!\" (Changed from [The voice on the tape recorder never was 'You're a goner!'] in the original release) That's only what we thought we heard, when in fact, it was the witness getting yelled at! The court will note that this is different from the selective hearing men are so good at!\nApollo:\n...I think you're right, but what was that last part again?\nAthena:\nNever mind. The important thing is that the voice that was recorded isn't our client's. And since it was the victim scolding the witness, he must now join the list of suspects!\nO'Conner:\nHrrrgh!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph. I had thought that testimony would suffice, but it seems it has come to this. I will not allow such fallacious quibbles to upend this case. The prosecution has one final piece of evidence to present to the court.\nAthena:\n(E-Evidence? What's he going to pull out now?!)\nBlackquill:\nFeast your eyes on this photo, and let me see that insolent look vanish from within them.\nJudge:\nLet's see here... Oh, it's a picture of the defendant and the victim.\nBlackquill:\nThe photograph shows professor and student preparing for the mock trial together.\nAthena:\nWait, was this taken in the art room -- the room where the murder occurred?\nBlackquill:\nIndeed it was. But the revelations do not end there. Do you see the clock on the wall? It reads 7:05, a mere five minutes before the voice was recorded on the tape.\nAthena:\nWH-WHAAAAAAT!\nBlackquill:\nThe accused brutally stabbed the victim to death five minutes after this photo was taken.\nSchool Camera Photo added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems the defendant's culpability in this crime is quite obvious.\nAthena:\n(Junie was with Prof. Courte just five minutes before she was murdered? What now? Nothing I say can change that fact...!)\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Understand now? You can believe in your client all wish, but try as you might... ...such misplaced faith will inevitably be cut down before the cruel, steely blade of truth.\nAthena:\nNgaaah!\nBlackquill:\n...Listen, missy. The person you'd like to save more than anyone else in the world? I'd be willing to wager that your defense isn't what they desire.\nAthena:\nB-B-But...! I became a lawyer so I could--\nBlackquill:\nYou still fail to understand? After so much pain and defeat? The courts are not the play yards of little children dressed as lawyers. So before you break your back in failure... ...run along home and grow up!\nAthena:\nGrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!\nAthena:\n(If he thinks I'm giving up now, he's got another thing coming! I have to find my inner strength if I ever hope to save him. But I can't think of any way to strike back. The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles? That's impossible! How could I smile under these circumstances, even if I forced it?!)\nApollo:\nThis is badder than bad! Who knew Blackquill had that one waiting in the wings! Why didn't that Twisted Samurai just present it at the beginning?\nAthena:\n(Wait, maybe this was his real plan? Was he just trying to show me how weak and powerless I am?! Maybe he's right, because I really haven't got a clue! Who's the real killer? Who murdered Prof. Constance Courte?) Robin Newman, a girl who had been forced to live a lie as a guy? Or was it Hugh O'Conner, the honor student who had met with Prof. Courte?\nJudge:\nThere seems to be little reason to debate the defendant's guilt any longer. The time for a verdict has come.\n???:\nNewman:\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN, MAAAAAAN!\nJudge:\nWhat's the meaning of this? You can't interrupt a judge about to hand down a--\nNewman:\nTee hee hee. Maybe, but false verdicts are a N-O N-O!\nJudge:\nWha-?!\nAthena:\nMs. Newman, please explain yourself!\nNewman:\nJuniper's not the killer. I know because... because I know who the real killer is.\nAthena:\nYou do? You know who the real killer is? (What is she up to now?)\nNewman:\nYup! I know because the real killer is... M-E, me! Tee, hee!\nAthena:\nUh......... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nNewman:\nIT WAS ME! I DID IT ALL ALONE. JUST MEEEEEEEEE!\nAthena:\n(I don't get it. Why is SHE confessing?)\nJudge:\nHmm... Ms. Newman WAS witnessed near the stage. There's even a related photo of her. The more I think about it, the more suspicious she seems...\nNewman:\nROBIN NEWMAN ISN'T THE KIND OF GUY WHO PINS THE BLAME ON FRIENDS... ...JUST SO HE CAN WALK FREEEEEEEEEE!!! GET IT OVER WITH! DECLARE ME GUILTY ALREADYYYYYYYYY!\n???:\nWoods:\n*cough, cough* Please... wait.\nAthena:\nJuniper! Wh-What are you doing?!\nWoods:\nThank you for all you've done, Thena. But you'll have to forgive me. I can't let my friends take the blame any longer!\nAthena:\nJunie! No! Don't do it!\nWoods:\nHugh and Robin have done nothing wrong. They have absolutely no connection to this case. The real killer is... is me. I alone am responsible for the entire crime!\nJudge:\n.........Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaat?!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nJunie! You know that's not true! Hurry up, and retract your statement!\nWoods:\nI'm afraid it is true. Forgive me, Thena.\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!!! Will somebody please explain what's going on here?!\nBlackquill:\n.........Hmph. I see right through your cheap ploy. School rules state that a prior conviction terminates one's eligibility to graduate. A guilty verdict here would make whatever dreams one had go up in a puff of smoke.\nJudge:\nOh, I wasn't aware...\nBlackquill:\nEven meek little mice will fight when cornered. A pitiful spectacle, I might add. These vermin are trying to protect each other now that they've nowhere else to run.\nAthena:\n(Protect each other? Wait... So, was Robin just trying to protect Junie, too? If so, then the real killer is...)\n???:\nO'Conner:\nHeh. This whole thing's a joke.\nAthena:\n(Uh-oh, now it's Hugh's turn...)\nJudge:\nWh-What... What is wrong with kids these days?!\nO'Conner:\nI know what just crossed your mind, Ms. Cykes. You think I'm the killer, don't you?\nApollo:\nWow, he really is a genius. He even knows what you're thinking.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. I think it's about time I told you the truth. And I'll even get right to the point. It was me. I did it.\nAthena:\nWait............ WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nApollo:\nNow both potential suspects are claiming to be the real killer.\nAthena:\nArgh! I... I am so confused right now...!\nO'Conner:\nIf you still have doubts, how about I detail my murder plot? It's absolute genius.\nBlackquill:\nEnough of this nonsense! This is a court of law, not the set of some high-school drama!\nJudge:\nI see I have no choice. I'm afraid I'll have to--\nBlackquill:\nHoy! Wait, Your Baldness!\nJudge:\n...I'm sorry, Prosecutor Blackquill, but I'm in no position to hand down a verdict just yet. I am hoping that the defense and prosecution can come up with some airtight evidence. That is why I am giving you both the rest of the day to continue investigating this case.\nAthena:\n(Pinch me, I think I'm dreaming...)\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Fine. Do as you wish!\nJudge:\nThis brings today's proceedings to a close. Court is adjourned!\nTo be continued\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThat statement contradicts the evidence!\nJudge:\nIt does? And how would that be?\nAthena:\nJ-Just look at it! It's one huge contradiction!\nJudge:\n...I see. The defense is simply making another baseless assertion.\nAthena:\nEeeeeek! (Crash and burn!)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nAthena:\nAthena:\nYour Honor, members of the court, please look at this. That's right. There's no need to explain anything. This piece of evidence says it all.\nJudge:\nAll that says to me is you're completely wrong.\nAthena:\nAaaaahhh! (I guess that won't fly.)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThis piece of evidence clearly reveals the inconsistency in the witness's testimony!\nJudge:\nI've been doing this for far too long to be fooled by such nonsense.\nAthena:\nUgh! (And I really tried hard that time, too.) Your Honor, can I at least get credit for trying?\nJudge:\nVery well, I hereby award Ms. Cykes the court's \"Wasted Effort\" award.\nAthena:\nNoooooo!\nWidget:\nWhere's the love?\nConsult (when evidence must be presented)\nApollo:\nYou mind letting your slightly senior partner help out a little now?\nAthena:\n...If you insist. (Actually, I could really use the help.)\nApollo:\nWell, I find this statement suspicious. You should find the answer if you take a good look at the evidence.\nAthena:\nTh-Thanks, Apollo!\nApollo:\nI could get used to this more humble version of you, you know. (Changed from [I could get used this [sic] more humble version of you, you know.] in the original release)\nConsult (when statements must be pressed)\nApollo:\nYou okay, Athena? You can tell me if something's bothering you.\nAthena:\nN-No, I'm totally fine! (Actually, I'm not anywhere near fine.)\nApollo:\nThe thing with cross-examinations is the answer you need isn't always obvious. You have to dig deep to find clues hidden in the testimony. Really wrestle with it.\nAthena:\nOh, so it's like grabbing a bull by the horns and wrestling it to the ground!\nApollo:\nWell, try not to take it so literally. Just stick with pressing the witness.\nAthena:\nTh-Thanks, Apollo! (Okay, let's give it a try!)\nPinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment \"Why I Touched the Costume\")\nAthena:\nAthena:\nMr. Newman, this emotion is inconsistent with your testimony!\nNewman:\nWhat are you talking about?! It's not truuuue!!! My only emotion is testosterone-fueled stubbornessssssss!!!\nAthena:\nYikes! (I wouldn't really call that an emotion!) Wonder where I went wrong? Well, better try that again!\nNewman:\nBring it on! A million times or a billion!!! I DON'T CAAAAAARE!!!\nProbe wrong area (during Mood Matrix segment \"Why I Touched the Costume\")\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThe source of Mr. Newman's anger... is this!\nNewman:\nNope! You're way off! WAAAY OFFFFFF!\nAthena:\nEeeeek! (No good, huh?) I'm trying to listen carefully, but all his shouting -- it's...!\nApollo:\nWe'd better finish this off quick before you rupture an eardrum.\nAthena:\nNo worries! I'm gonna nail it next time!\nToo many penalties\nJudge:\nThat's enough! I see no need prolong this trial any further. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Juniper Woods...\nGuilty\nTurnabout Academy\nImage Gallery\nTranscript\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nOctober 25Wright Anything Agency\nAthena:\n...Sorry, Boss. I couldn't do it. You know, that little bit of advice you gave me? \"The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles\"? I don't know exactly what you meant... ...but there was no way I could force a smile in that courtroom today.\nPhoenix:\nI'm just glad you remembered that. But now how about relaxing a little--\nAthena:\nR-Relax?! Not gonna happen!\nPhoenix:\n.........\nAthena:\nJunie... she asked me to defend her because she believes in me. But I... I... felt completely helpless. If it weren't for their confessions, I'd...!\nMeans:\nBut if this trial proceeds in the same manner and ends in the same way as the mock trial... ...would you not lose everything you've worked so hard to gain?\nAthena:\nWell, I'll just have to make sure that doesn't happen, then, won't I!\nAthena:\n(No, I can't lose it all! Not now!)\nApollo:\nYou okay, Athena? You're turning kind of pale.\nAthena:\n...I can't just stand around here! I'm going to finish the investigation!\nTrucy:\nCan't it wait? I just took a batch of freshly baked cookies out of my magic panties!\nAthena:\nThanks, but I'd better get going! Save me one for when I get back. Apollo, you wait here! I need to see Junie at the Detention Center first right away!\nApollo:\nNo, wait! I'm going with you! Sorry, Mr. Wright, but I'd better go too!\nPhoenix:\nNo problem. You two be careful.\nOctober 25Detention Center - Visitor's Room\nAthena:\n(There's so much I need to ask Junie. What happened in court today... Where we go from here...)\nMeans:\nWell, now! Fancy meeting you here.\nAthena:\nOh, Prof. Means. What brings you here?\nWoods:\nI asked him to come. He arrived just a little before you. I wanted to ask him something. But first, Athena... I want to apologize for my sudden confession after you worked so hard to defend me.\nAthena:\n(She was calling me \"Thena\" until just now...) No, I should be the one apologizing. The whole thing spiraled out of my control.\nWoods:\nAthena, I--\nAthena:\nDon't worry! I'll really bring it tomorrow! I'll find something to prove your innocence!\nWoods:\nAbout that............ Athena... I've been thinking of asking Prof. Means to defend me.\nAthena:\n...Huh?\nMeans:\nI myself only just heard of this a moment ago.\nAthena:\n(Oh... So, she thinks Prof. Means would be... No! I can't let this happen! Not with the way he wants to do things!) J-Junie!\nWoods:\nI know, Athena, but will you please hear me out?\nTalk\nWhy change lawyers?\nWoods:\nAthena, do you actually think Hugh or Robin could've committed this crime?\nAthena:\n(The body was moved right before the mock trial. Besides Junie, they're the only ones... ...who could move freely around the campus at that time...) I'm sorry, Junie, but at this point, I can't rule them out.\nWoods:\nI was afraid you'd say that.\nMeans:\nJuniper is seeking a lawyer who can clear all three of their names. Only I am capable of such a feat.\nAthena:\nB-But how can you possibly prove that all three of them are innocent?\nMeans:\nI am a result-oriented person. Come tomorrow, I won't fail to have the perfect piece of evidence ready. For the end really does justify the means, especially for me, Prof. Aristotle Means.\nAthena:\n(Ugh... I really don't like the sound of that.)\nWoods:\nI'm sorry, but... Just as you believe I'm innocent, I believe that my friends are innocent, too.\nApollo:\nAll right. If that's how you really feel, we'll respect your decision.\nAthena:\nA-Apollo?!\nApollo:\nBut we want to continue our investigation. Could we ask you some more questions?\nWoods:\nSure, I don't mind. Prof. Means, would you like to stay and join our conversation?\nMeans:\nYes, of course. I am your lawyer, after all.\nAthena:\n(There's that smile again. Why does it always creep me out?)\nWhy did you confess? (appears after \"Why change lawyers?\")\nAthena:\nAbout your confession, Junie. It's not true, is it? You just said what you did because Robin had confessed on the stand, didn't you?\nWoods:\nYes. I wasn't thinking straight. All I knew was I had to help my friend.\nApollo:\nYou mean, because of that school rule? The one that says you can't graduate if you are convicted of a crime?\nWoods:\nNo! I didn't do it because of some rule! I did it because she's my friend *cough* *cough, cough*... *cough*\nAthena:\n(Why is there discord in her voice again? ...Could it really be that the friendship between the three of them is on the rocks? There's more here than meets the eye.)\nThe trio's friendship (appears after \"Why did you confess?\")\nAthena:\nWhen did you three first become friends?\nWoods:\nWell... Even though we were in different courses, we really bonded from the first day of school. We vowed to work together to bring an end to the dark age of the law. That was when our proof of friendship came about.\nAthena:\n(There's that proof of friendship again. I just wish this were as simple as that.)\nO'Conner:\nHeh. We even have proof of our friendship.\nNewman:\nYeaaaaaah!!! As long as our friendship lasts! You can bet we'll be carrying them around!\nWoods:\nBut the situation kind of changed recently. When the school's policy shifted to training legal professionals who produce results--\nMeans:\nAllow me to explain. In the lawyer course I teach, producing results means winning trials. Prof. Courte, on the other hand, taught that finding the truth was the only valid result. Unfortunately, that clash of ideas created a rift among our students.\nWoods:\nAt some point, we stopped talking about it. While that meant fewer arguments... ...it also meant we couldn't be as frank and open with each other as we used to be.\nAthena:\n(I think I understand now. By putting their friendship on a pedestal, they actually did more harm than good. It seems the relationship between the three of them isn't as simple as I thought.)\nApollo:\n...Juniper, thank you for talking to us about this difficult subject.\nAthena:\nYeah, thanks, Junie. Now, if you could tell us about the day of the murder...\nThe day of the murder (appears after \"The trio's friendship\")\nAthena:\nJunie, you told us yesterday that you went home a little after 6:00 PM. Was that a lie?\nWoods:\n...I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before, but... ...what actually happened was I left the art room a little after 6:00 PM and... ...headed over to my dressing room, where I worked on my stage costume until 7:00.\nAthena:\nThat's it? You didn't go anywhere else?\nWoods:\nNo, nowhere else.\nAthena:\n(If that really were it, then there would be no reason to lie in the first place. She's gotta be hiding something else.)\nApollo:\nJunie, do you remember this picture?\nWoods:\nYes, but something's wrong here.\nAthena:\nWrong? What's wrong?\nWoods:\nI took this picture at around 6:00, which was before I'd left the art room.\nAthena:\nBut the clock here says it's just after 7:00.\nWoods:\nBy 7:00, I'd already been working in my dressing room for some time. So, there's definitely something wrong with the time in this picture.\nApollo:\nHm, I guess we'd better go check the art room.\nAthena:\nOkay, just one last question about the day of the murder.\nEncountering O'Conner (appears after \"The day of the murder\")\nLeads to:\n\"On the day before the mock trial -- the evening of the murder -- you ran into Hugh.\"\nPresent\nAwl\nWoods:\nThat was just a prop. To think it would become an actual murder weapon!\nAthena:\nThe killer is trying to make this case look exactly like your script. That's why this awl was used like that.\nWoods:\nBut... But why would anyone do that?\nAthena:\n(Yeah, that's the million-dollar question. I wonder if Junie has her suspicions but is afraid to share them with me.)\nCourte's Autopsy Report, Tape Recorder, or School Camera Photo\nAthena:\nJunie, can you tell us anything about this?\nWoods:\nI don't really know what to say. Um...\nAthena:\n(She went silent. Seems like she doesn't want to talk about it.)\nAthena:\nOn the day before the mock trial -- the evening of the murder -- you ran into Hugh.\nWoods:\n............Yes, I did.\nO'Conner:\nAt around 7:15, I went to the main building before going home. That's when I saw Juniper. We didn't say much as we passed by each other. She seemed her usual self. That's it. Anything else you'd like to ask?\nWoods:\n.........\nAthena:\n(She suddenly went silent. She always was terrible at hiding things. Was she trying to keep their meeting a secret by lying about going home at 6:00?) All right, I won't press the matter any further. Is there anything else you noticed on the night of the murder?\nWoods:\n...Well, I don't know if this will help, but... That evening, I went back to my dressing room to get something I'd forgotten there. It was well after the last bell rang... I'd say, maybe around 8:30.\nAthena:\nAround 8:30, huh? That's over an hour after when the crime supposedly took place.\nWoods:\nThat's when I noticed that both stage statues were finished. They were quite large, and they were each covered with a white sheet, but I could tell. It made me happy to think that after all that hard work, they were finally finished.\nAthena:\nOh, right... The statues that Robin made. So they were covered in white sheets...?\nWoods:\n...*cough*... *cough* *cough*\nAthena:\nJ-Junie! Are you okay?\nWoods:\n*cough* Sorry. I'm a little tired, that's all.\nApollo:\nAthena, I think this meeting is over. Prof. Means?\nMeans:\nI will use any means possible to get the result I want in Juniper's case. But it will require considerable preparation, so I must be off.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nJunie! ...And Prof. Means! I have a proposal!\nWoods:\n...A proposal?\nApollo:\nWait, this isn't another one of your crazy--\nAthena:\nBy sundown today...!\nWoods:\nYes...?\nAthena:\nI, Athena Cykes, along with Apollo Justice...!\nApollo:\nW-Wait a second. Don't drag my name into--\nAthena:\nWe're going to discover the truth behind this murder mystery!\nWoods:\n......What?!\nAthena:\nAnd we're going to bring you solid evidence showing just what that truth is!\nMeans:\nI see... So, it has come to this, has it?\nAthena:\nIf we succeed in doing that... ...I want you to promise that you'll accept it, Junie, no matter how hard it is to hear.\nWoods:\n.........\nAthena:\nThen, you shouldn't need anyone else to defend you except me. Have we got a deal? ...I trust that's okay with you too, Prof. Means?\nMeans:\nI have no objections, as long as Juniper is satisfied with this arrangement.\nWoods:\n............Okay. But only if it's the real truth. I'm sorry to put you through this, Thena. But thank you. I've been thinking only of myself this whole time.\nAthena:\nJunie, it's way too early to thank me. But you can thank me all you want once I get to the bottom of this!\nMeans:\n...Very well, I will see you back here at sundown.\nApollo:\nSorry for all the trouble, professor. It's just, she's new to the agency, so...\nMeans:\nDon't be silly. I find it all rather thrilling. Now, let us meet here again later!\nWoods:\nIf you'll excuse me, I'd better go.\nAthena:\nOkay, see you later!\nMeans:\nBut if this trial proceeds in the same manner and ends in the same way as the mock trial... ...would you not lose everything you've worked so hard to gain?\nAthena:\n(Argh! This is no time to be thinking about that! I've got an investigation to do. I WILL find the truth by sundown, no matter what!)\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nApollo:\nOnly the three mock trial participants could've moved the body before it started. That's why the killer must be Robin, Hugh, or Juniper.\nAthena:\nRight, and that means at least one of them is lying.\nApollo:\nTo make matters worse, I have a feeling each one of them is hiding some sort of secret.\nAthena:\n(We'll have to bring it all to light. I'm not looking forward to it, but it has to be done!)\nAbout the murder\nApollo:\nToday's trial focused on the day of the crime and the actions of those involved.\nAthena:\nYeah, like when the voice was recorded, and who went to the art room and when. If we analyze the info we have, we should be able to ID the killer! There's no lead in these legs! I've been training for a day like this! Okay, on my mark! Ready, set--\nApollo:\nNo running for me. I'm done trying to keep up with you.\nTomorrow's trial\nApollo:\nSo, the main argument tomorrow will be over how the body was moved. Detective Fulbright said Prosecutor Blackquill already has a plan. I bet it involves some bit of info that will damage Juniper's case.\nAthena:\nPoor Junie. She gets discouraged much easier than I do, too. I'll just have to reassure her the best I can!) No problem. All we have to do is find some irrefutable evidence before the day is done!\nWidget:\nCome on, lazybones!\nApollo:\nHa, ha. Very funny, Mr. I-Dangle-Around-Someone's-Neck-All-Day.\nPresent\nAwl, Tape Recorder, School Camera Photo, or Voiceprint Analysis\nApollo:\nMore damaging evidence. Juniper's case seems to have no lack of that.\nAthena:\nWe still have time to turn this whole case upside down! But it'll require some legwork!\nApollo:\nYou're right. Let's give it our best shot.\nAthena:\nThat's the spirit! We'll start with wind sprints! Two hundred yards, ten times! Ready to go?!\nApollo:\nNo, wait! Wouldn't our time be better spent investigating the case?\nWright Anything Agency\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nTrucy:\nHungry, Athena? You haven't had lunch yet, right? Well... It's a virtual snack bar in my magic panties! Cookies, chips, Snackoos! You name it!\nAthena:\n(That's not the most appetizing place to keep snacks...) You know, I'm not that hungry anymore. I'll just have some juice from the fridge.\nTrucy:\nGreat! I've been waiting to have you try drinking from my magic panties.\nAthena:\n(Ugh. That's even worse.) M-Maybe next time. I'm really busy with the investigation and all.\nTrucy:\nOh, you are? Well, when you get back, I'll have all sorts of things ready for you in my magic panties.\nAthena:\n(Just the very thought is making me shudder.)\nToday's trial\nTrucy:\nI saw your debut fight, Athena You looked like an old pro out there!\nAthena:\nI wasn't nearly that good, but thanks.\nTrucy:\nAww, c'mon! You'd put a pitbull to shame! You sunk your teeth in and never let go!\nAthena:\nSure...\nTrucy:\nYou exploited your opponents' faults, and you split hairs like there was no tomorrow!\nAthena:\nOkay...\nTrucy:\nIt was amazing! I can't tell you the last time I was on the edge of my seat for a whole fight!\nAthena:\nRight...\nWidget:\nTrial = Boxing Match = Trial?\nOctober 25Themis Legal Academy - Outdoor Stage\n???:\nAh!\nAthena:\nIs it my imagination or did something just move?\nKlavier:\nAfternoon, you two.\nApollo:\nProsecutor Gavin. What are you doing here? Don't you think sneaking onto campus like this... is just slightly suspicious?\nKlavier:\nI'll have you know I'm continuing my investigation, in the strictest of confidence.\nAthena:\nI don't want to be caught napping again at tomorrow's trial. And that means a thorough investigation today. Think you can lend us a hand?\nKlavier:\nI'm not one to refuse a damsel in distress. But you needn't have asked, Fräulein. I'd intended to help from the start.\nAthena:\nYou're the best, Prosecutor Gavin! (Okay, time for a thorough investigation. I bet we missed lots of stuff yesteday!)\nTalk\nThe stage\nAthena:\nProsecutor Gavin, you were scheduled to perform at the school festival, weren't you?\nKlavier:\nThat's right. But I hadn't seen this stage until yesterday. That backdrop with the starry sky and big crescent moon isn't half bad. We also had some tricks up our sleeve to make the concert really rock. Pyrotechnics, a fog machine, big banners... Things like that. It would've looked like this.\nAthena:\nOh, the plans from yesterday. What's that design on the banner there in the back? I know the scales are the school emblem... ...but what's with the number six? It looks like it's in serious pain or something.\nApollo:\nA-Athena, ixnay on the ixsey.\nKlavier:\nThat's the Gavinners's logo, Fräulein. Oh, and nice Pig Latin, Herr Forehead. Really smooth.\nAthena:\nOh! I, uh... I meant, it looks like the number six rocking seriously hard.\nKlavier:\nNein, Fräulein, it's a G for Gavinners, not a six. But whatever floats your pretty boat.\nApollo:\nSo where is the banner? I don't see it anywhere onstage.\nKlavier:\nIt was an important part of the show, but the school managed to misplace it somehow. It's a pity. We had it specially made from heavyweight high-grade cloth. A missing banner and two broken statues -- there are mysteries aplenty to be solved, ja?\nAthena:\n(Come to think of it, one of the broken statues was of Prosecutor Gavin.)\nThe statues (appears after \"The stage\")\nKlavier:\nAs you can see here in the stage plans... ...right here, we have the statue of me... ...and right here, Herr Wright's statue. But little does that matter now, as we both lie in pieces thanks to you, Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\nWhat did I ever do to you?!\nAthena:\nActually, this statue broke into rather large pieces. Why don't we try to put it back together? Maybe we'll learn something new.\nKlavier:\nHmm... Picking up the pieces of a shattered rock star? Achtung! That's one über-cool idea! There might even be a song in there somewhere!\nAthena:\nYay! Let's do this! Schnell!\nApollo:\nIs this an investigation or am I interrupting a German Language Club social event?\nPresent\nTape Recorder\nKlavier:\nI'm flattered, Fräulein, but the answer is nein.\nAthena:\nWhat do you mean, \"nein\"?\nKlavier:\nYou want to record my godlike voice on your little tape recorder there, ja? Well, sorry. I may have retired from the music biz, but I will not sell myself cheap.\nAthena:\n(It's a piece of evidence, you-- Oh, never mind.)\nExamine (after clearing \"The statues\" Talk option)\n\"67th School Festival\" sign\nAthena:\nSixty-seventh?! Wow, this school festival goes way back. Oh, look. The text on this sign isn't written, it's embroidered! And there's a warning in even smaller embroidery... \"Embroidered sign lovingly crafted by the Handicrafts Club. KEEP DRY!\" (But the sign is outside. What happens if it rains?)\nBackdrop\nAthena:\nI dunno... This is fine for a rock concert, but... The nighttime sky as backdrop for a courtroom?\nKlavier:\nPersonally, I think it's breathtaking. I mean, speaking the truth under a starry sky? Don't you think it's romantic, Fräulein? And the waning crescent moon represents the maximum three-day trial cycle.\nAthena:\n(Three-day trials outdoors? No thanks. If it starts raining my hair'll be ruined!)\nProsecution bench\nAthena:\nThere's even a prosecutor's bench here on this stage.\nKlavier:\nAh, the memories, Fräulein. As a former rock star, and a prosecutor... ...the prosecutor's bench has taught me much about human emotions, passion, and fight.\nAthena:\nI can picture it now -- you with your silvery singing voice and Apollo sweating bullets.\nApollo:\nHey, how about picturing me winning once in a while?\nDefense bench\nAthena:\nThe winner of the mock trial was to take the training seminar right here.\nApollo:\nYou mean, Hugh or Robin?\nAthena:\nYeah... Besides Junie, they're the only ones who could move freely around the campus... ...before the mock trial. That means one of them must be the killer.\nApollo:\nBut that's not really enough to go on, is it? We need to talk with Juniper one more time and persuade her to give us a name.\nAthena:\nRight. And that means we have to find irrefutable evidence before the day ends! (There's no time to lose! But we can't rush it, either! Efficiency is the key!)\nWitness stand\nAthena:\nWow, they built a witness stand, too, even though it's just a temporary stage. (Oh, but I think they're still working on it. Let's see what this notice says.) \"Caution: Pedestal features a high-speed rotation mode. Activate with care.\" (You mean this thing spins...?)\nFront of judge bench\nAthena:\nIt's a bit too far away to get a good look. Maybe we should try a different angle.\nBack of judge bench\nAthena:\nOoh, I like the view. The judge can look down on everything from up here.\nApollo:\nYeah, not bad for a temporary stage.\nAthena:\nHmm... Is that so, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\nHeh, your judge act from the mock mock trial? I don't know why, but it kind of creeps me out.\nAthena:\nWrong answer again, Mr. Justice. A penalty for our mock lawyer!\nApollo:\nArrrgh! ...That is NOT funny!\nChalk outline\nAthena:\nThe body's gone. All that's left is a white outline. I never knew Prof. Courte personally... ...but seeing her reduced to a white outline leaves me cold inside.\nApollo:\nBut in a way, she still lives on in the messages she left behind. Like the strange way her body was posed and the signs of her wrists being bound.\nAthena:\nYou're right. Let's use her final messages to catch her killer!\nBroken Klavier Gavin statue\nAthena:\nOh, no, Prosecutor Gavin! You're a complete wreck, literally! Why in the world would someone do something like this?\nApollo:\nI don't know, but whoever did it must've felt an amazing sense of release.\nKlavier:\nCan I take that as a confession, Herr Forehead?\nApollo:\nWhat?! No! I feel bad for Robin. She worked so hard on these. Let's pick up the pieces for her!\nKlavier:\nYou got it! Let's check every corner of this stage then, ja!\nBroken Phoenix Wright statue\nAthena:\nThe other statue Robin made... It's been smashed to bits. If there were some larger pieces, we might be able to put this one back together, too.\nKlavier:\nYeah, but all I see are itty bitty ones.\nAthena:\nI wonder what Mr. Wright would think... ...if he knew we put Prosecutor Gavin's statue back together, but left his like this.\nApollo:\nWe could always come back to it after the case is solved. I'll help you fix it.\nSpeakers visible from judge bench\nAthena:\nLook! There's your rival over there, Apollo!\nApollo:\nWho, Prosecutor Gavin? We've battled it out a few times before, but I wouldn't call him--\nAthena:\nNo, not him. I meant that speaker over there! (Changed from [No, not him. I'm meant [sic] that speaker over there!] in the original release) It can output massive blasts of sound that rival your Chords of Steel!\nApollo:\nI have better things to do than compete with a speaker, so just forget it.\nBox\nAthena:\nWait... You don't think this weird box here is--\n???:\nSss, sss, sss... Hands off!\nAthena:\nI knew it. I'd know that voice anywhere.\nApollo:\nLet's just ignore it. I mean, it made its wishes loud and clear.\nAthena:\n(So, this is the future cardboard box technology has afforded us, huh...)\nSchool newspaper\nAthena:\nIt's a copy of the school paper with that story about the alleged love triangle. I wonder if people waste their time reading this stuff...\nSss, sss, sss... It's more popular than you think...\nApollo:\nW-What was that?! I thought I heard something just now...\nAthena:\nY-You're just hearing things! It was nothing more than your ears playing tricks on you!\nFirst statue fragment examined (if fragment is white)\nAthena:\nFound one! A piece of Prosecutor Gavin's shattered pride!\nKlavier:\nAre you saying my pride is as fragile as plaster of Paris?\nApollo:\nIt looks like there are other large pieces scattered about.\nAthena:\nOkay, let's find what we can!\nWhite Fragment added to the Court Record.\nFirst statue fragment examined (if fragment is purple)\nAthena:\nFound one!

This makes five piece in all.\nApollo:\nI think we have all we're going to find.\nAthena:\nOkay, let's get back to where Prosecutor Gavin was shattered!\nKlavier:\nI think you might want to reword that.\nWhite Fragments updated in the Court Record.\nLeads to:\n\"Well, I don't see any other big pieces lying around.\"\nFifth statue fragment examined (if fragment is purple)\nApollo:\nThis looks like another piece of the statue.\nAthena:\nThanks, Apollo!

Let's see if we can put this statue back together.\nAthena:\nAll right, Apollo you come over here and Prosecutor Gavin, if you could hold this...\nAthena:\nWe did it! Not bad, if I do say so myself!\nKlavier:\nYeah, but don't you think it's strange? We put the statue back together, but look. What's with all these leftover white pieces?\nAthena:\nHm... These two look like they go together. And this one, too! (Changed from [And these pieces, too!] in the original release)\nApollo:\nUm, Athena? What do you think you're doing?\nAthena:\nDon't stop me now. The artist inside me wants to get out and have a good time!\nApollo:\nSo... what is it...?\nKlavier:\nAh... It's the goddess of law holding a pair of scales in one hand and a sword in the other. That's quite the feat you pulled off there, Fräulein.\nAthena:\nWhew! I love that feeling you get after you work really hard on something!\nApollo:\nNo, no, no! I knew WHO it was! I meant to ask what's it doing here!\nKlavier:\nNot sure. There's no statue like this in the stage plans.\nAthena:\n(Still, I could swear I've seen this statue somewhere before.)\nLady Justice added to the Court Record.\nApollo:\nThe more we learn, the deeper the rabbit hole goes.\nKlavier:\nAt least we're moving in the right direction. Let's keep searching the stage for clues.\nAthena:\nI've been wondering about something this whole time. You know that pole at the edge of the stage?\nApollo:\nYou mean this? It has a wire that goes off and connects to something somewhere.\nExamine\nRestored Klavier Gavin statue\nAthena:\nHey, look what I made! Not bad, huh?\nKlavier:\nYou're like a recording artist who samples other people's work and calls it their own.\nAthena:\nWell, you know what they say. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery! In any case, we have a statue smasher in addition to a killer to catch now!\nKlavier:\nNein, I suspect they might be one and the same. (Changed from [Nein, I suspect they might be one in [sic] the same.] in the original release)\nRestored Lady Justice statue\nApollo:\nThis statue doesn't look anything like you or Mr. Wright.\nKlavier:\nThe goddess bearing scales and a sword... She's a symbol of fairness and strength.\nAthena:\nBut she and her symbols were shattered along with the statues of you and Mr. Wright. This is a direct challenge to the rule of law! Well, if they want a fight, they've got one!\nApollo:\nWhoa, take it down a notch, tiger. Let's save the fighting for when we find our culprit.\nPole\nAthena:\nThis pole supports the wire over the stage. Just seeing it makes me want to climb it.\nApollo:\nWhat's with your constant desire to run and climb things?\nAthena:\nWhat's wrong with being competitive? You need to man up a little, Apollo.\nApollo:\nWell, I'm not climbing that thing, that's for sure. I'd like to keep my spine intact.\nKlavier:\nCare to see where that wire goes?\nBuilding\nApollo:\nAn impressive building fit for an impressive school.\nAthena:\nYeah, and these beautiful walls are like a big blank canvas. See? My shoeprints leave really distinct marks.\nApollo:\nHey, cut that out before you get us in trouble!\nPulley or window\nKlavier:\nThis wire is for hanging banners over the stage. One of the policemen who was here earlier was checking how it worked.\nApollo:\nOh, so that's why the banner looks like it's out of place.\nKlavier:\nThe banners are hung and removed from the art room over there.\nAthena:\nThat's the art room over there? As in the scene of the crime?!\nKlavier:\nBingo, Fräulein. It's still crawling with cops, though.\nAthena:\nHey...! Anyone in the art room?!\nFulbright:\nOh, it's you people! Ha ha ha! In justice we trust!\nAthena:\nAh, it's Detective Fulbright! ...In justice we trust!\nKlavier:\nIs that some kind of a greeting between you two?\nAthena:\nDetective Fulbright! Can you lower that banner from there?!\nFulbright:\nOf course! Just leave it to me!\nFulbright:\nHow's that?! *huff* *puff* Whew!\nAthena:\nThanks, Detective! In justice we trust!\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! Always glad to help! In justice we trust!\nKlavier:\nSo, is that some kind of greeting between you two or not?\nApollo:\nWell, looks like the banner's down now. Let's go take a look.\nWindow (after examining pulley or window)\nAthena:\nThat's the art room -- the scene of the crime -- over there. Let's get Detective Fulbright's attention!\nApollo:\nWait. We probably shouldn't bother him unless we really need something.\nAthena:\nAww... I really wanted to do that whole \"In justice we trust!\" thing again.\nSide of school banner (after examining pulley or window)\nAthena:\nIt’s a little hard to see from this angle. Let’s look at it head-on.\nTied banner (after examining pulley or window)\nApollo:\nLook at this banner. I don't think it would flap very well in the wind.\nAthena:\nAn unflappable banner? Hey, I like that! It goes perfect with unflappable lawyers and unflappable rockers! It's like it was made for this very stage!\nApollo:\nLook at this. The bottom part is all knotted up. Lemme try and unravel it.\nAthena:\nGeez, did you really have to? You don't come across an unflappable banner every day!\nApollo:\nAthena, there are some things that have to yield to forces beyond themselves.\nAthena:\nWhat a cruel world we live in.\nApollo:\nHey, a scrap of paper was caught up inside. ...It's blowing away!\nAthena:\nI got it! ............Yes! Great catch, huh?! Looks like some kind of note. What does it say?\nApollo:\n\"October Hugh 120.\" What's that supposed to mean?\nAthena:\nA test score maybe? Pretty impressive when you consider that a hundred is a perfect score! (Changed from [A test score maybe? Pretty impressive when you consider that 100 is a perfect score!] in the original release)\nApollo:\nI don't see how even Hugh can get beyond perfect...\nKlavier:\nFräulein, shall we inspect the banner again, now that it has been unraveled?\n\"Hugh\" Scrap added to the Court Record.\nUnraveled banner (after examining tied banner)\nAthena:\nThis is the emblem that's on Junie's school uniform.\nApollo:\nHey, you're right. ...Wait a sec! It's hard to see against the red material, but look. There's a dark red stain here, just under the emblem.\nAthena:\nThis banner was on a wire connected to the art room.\nApollo:\nRight, and the art room is where the murder occurred. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?!\nAthena:\nThis stain might be from the victim's blood!\nSchool Banner added to the Court Record.\nUnraveled banner (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nThis is the emblem that's on Junie's school uniform.\nApollo:\nHey, you're right. ...Wait a sec! It's hard to see against the red material, but look. There's a dark red stain here, just under the emblem.\nAthena:\nThis banner was on a wire connected to the art room.\nApollo:\nRight, and the art room is where the murder occurred. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?!\nAthena:\nThis stain might be from the victim's blood!\nAfter examining restored Lady Justice statue and unraveled banner:\nAthena:\nWhew! That was a whole lot of poking around in such a short time.\nApollo:\nDoes that mean you're satisfied?\nAthena:\nActually, there was one more thing I wanted to check out. See that metal fence back there? There's just that one segment, so it seems out of place.\nKlavier:\nIt looks like they were in the process of removing them after the stage was set up. But they were never able to finish on account of the murder.\nApollo:\nWe should take a look if you think it could be important.\nAthena:\nHmm... This track looks man-made.\nApollo:\nHey, you're right. And it looks like it starts from behind the backdrop.\nAthena:\nMaybe a big muddy pro wrestler was hiding back there.\nApollo:\n.........Well, that was totally random, but we'll never know until we take a look.\nAthena:\nLooks like something was being dragged through here, and this is where it started.\nApollo:\nYeah, but whatever it was, it's long gone.\nKlavier:\nMust've been pretty heavy. Perhaps it was used in setting up the school festival.\nAthena:\nAww, then I guess it wasn't a pro wrestler. Still, this could be something important.\nApollo:\nWell, that's about it for the stage.\nAthena:\nRight. I think we'd better search the art room next.\nKlavier:\nI think I'll hang around here for a while. But make sure to tell me once you find it, ja?\nApollo:\nFind what?\nKlavier:\nWhat else? The Gavinners banner that disappeared from the stage. You never know -- it just might be connected to the case at hand.\nAthena:\n(Really? Or does he just want his banner back?)\n???:\nSss, sss, sss. Don't tell me... So, in short, that's...\nAthena:\nHm? Hey...\nApollo:\nThat box... It just took off running.\nAthena:\nI have a pretty good idea who that is, as I suspect you do, too. Come on! We can't afford to have any weird articles written about us!\nApollo:\nThe maintenance area's over in that direction. After that box!\nOctober 25Themis Legal Academy - Maintenance Area\nAthena:\n...Myriam, you're liable to get tossed in the garbage truck if you hang around here.\nScuttlebutt:\nI'm just an empty box. And that's what you do with them -- you throw them away.\nAthena:\nHey, did you change boxes? I like the new look.\nScuttlebutt:\nWhat does it matter anymore?! I was a complete failure in court today! My work, my pride, my dream -- everything I've worked so hard for... Gone!\nAthena:\nSorry, Ms. Scuttlebutt, but... ...doesn't believing you had a scoop when you really didn't make you a failure as a reporter?\nScuttlebutt:\nA f-failure as a r-reporter?! Kahk-kahk-kahk. Kaaahk kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk! Ack! ...Ah!!!\nApollo:\nCome to think of it, calling her a failure as a reporter might've been a bit extreme.\nAthena:\nNngh...\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss! Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss, sss! Scold me! Despise me! Pack me away where I'll never see the light of day! I've been cast aside to waste away into a big pile of mushy paper mache!\nAthena:\n(I kind of feel responsible for this, but...)\nApollo:\nNow's our chance to prod her for information while she's vulnerable! I bet that's what you were just thinking.\nAthena:\nWhat kind of a person do you think I am? (He read me like a book...)\nTalk\nScuttling Scuttlebutt\nAthena:\nThat was you on the stage earlier, wasn't it? Why'd you run off like that?\nScuttlebutt:\n......... Take a look... at this.\nAthena:\nWhy are you showing me a burnt up old rag?\nApollo:\nWait, it's really hard to see, but I think that's the Gavinners's logo there.\nAthena:\nSo, is this the banner that disappeared? It's all burned up.\nScuttlebutt:\nD-Don't look at me. I just happened to find it in the incinerator.\nAthena:\n(Incinerator? Did Blackquill actually make good on his threat to burn her box?)\nApollo:\nWe should probably try to find out whether someone tried to destroy this on purpose.\nAthena:\nYeah, this banner is sounding less and less unrelated to our case, Apollo...\nBurnt Fragments added to the Court Record.\nScuttling Scuttlebutt (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nThat was you on the stage earlier, wasn't it? Why'd you run off like that?\nScuttlebutt:\n.........

I owe you an apology. I shouldn't have said you were a failure as a reporter.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss... Too late. I already decided journalism isn't for me. The last step is to erase all of the photos on my PC! I'm really going to do it! Here goes! Five percent... Ten percent... Sss, sss, sss! Four years of my life down the drain!\nApollo:\nShouldn't we stop her, Athena?\nAthena:\nMyriam, you should keep publishing your paper. I didn't mean what I said, okay?\nScuttlebutt:\nYou didn't mean it? ...Oh, no, my photos! Stop! Cancel! Abort!\nAthena:\n.........Did you stop it in time?\nScuttlebutt:\nDeletion progress... Ninety-nine percent complete... There are only two pictures left. Sss, sss, sss. Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss, sss!\nApollo:\nWhat are you going to do now, Athena?! You owe it to her to make this right!\nAthena:\nI-I know...\nYour photo technique (appears after \"The depths of despair\")\nAthena:\nD-Don't worry, Myriam. Your photos may be gone... ...but the memory of your photographic genius will live on forever in all of our hearts!\nApollo:\nOoh... Athena. That was cringe-worthy.\nAthena:\nHey, Myriam, check this out! You took some amazing photos of the three of them. I'm sure they really appreciated it.\nScuttlebutt:\nObviously. I'm the ace member of the Newspaper Club. The only member, in fact!\nAthena:\nI know this won't make up for the photos you lost, but here are your newspapers back.\nThemis Herald and Themis Herald Extra returned to Myriam.\nScuttlebutt:\nThere's no rest for the wicked! I plan on pursuing those three for as long as I live.\nAthena:\nMyriam, why are you so obsessed with Juniper, Hugh and Robin?\nScuttlebutt:\nO-Obsessed?! I'm not obsessed with them! It's just, they were so close, ever since their freshman year, so uh... well...\nApollo:\nAthena, are you thinking what I'm thinking?\nAthena:\n(Yeah, I think that's the only explanation.)\nScuttlebutt:\nW-W-Wait a second! You're not thinking what I think you're thinking!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThat's exactly what he's thinking, Myriam. You want in on their little trio!\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk! ...kahk-kahk!!! Kaaahk kahk-kahk-kahk!!! How could you possibly know thaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!\nApollo:\n...That's one abused laptop.\nYour photo technique (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nD-Don't worry, Myriam. Your photos may be gone... ...but the memory of your photographic genius will live on forever in all of our hearts!\nApollo:\nOoh... Athena.

Kaaahk kahk-kahk-kahk!!! How could you possibly know thaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!\nApollo:\n...That's one abused laptop.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nScuttlebutt:\n...Kahk-kahk-kahk. My laptop won't turn on. Never thought my life would end so soon. A mere seventeen years...\nAthena:\n(Now I really feel bad.) Oh, I know! Myriam, we have a laptop at the office. We'd be happy to lend it to you.\nScuttlebutt:\nHuh? Y-You have a laptop I could use?!\nAthena:\nSure, but on one condition. I want you to ask Junie, Hugh, and Robin if you can hang out with them.\nScuttlebutt:\nWhat?! Like I could ever do that!\nAthena:\nSorry, but that's the deal if you want to borrow our laptop.\nApollo:\nYou scare me sometimes, Athena. You're like good cop, bad cop all rolled into one.\nScuttlebutt:\nKahk-kahk-kahk-kahk. Fine! I'll do it! If that's all you want!\nAthena:\nYay! I'll be by later to bring you the laptop!\nScuttlebutt:\nW-Wait! It's not like I owe you anything, but here.\nAthena:\nTh-Thanks. Oh, it's a set of pictures.\nApollo:\nLooks like they're setting up the stage.\nScuttlebutt:\nYeah, I took them when they were putting the stage's backdrop into place.\nAthena:\nWow, you sure have an eye for photography! (...From what I can make out, anyway.)\nScuttlebutt:\nThere are the last two photos that didn't get deleted. They're all yours.\nStage Set Up Photos added to the Court Record.\nScuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss, sss! Well, see you around, Scary Lawyer Lady!\nApollo:\nThat was really impressive, Athena. What's next?\nAthena:\nWell... I'd like to talk to Hugh or Robin if possible.\nApollo:\nOkay, let's walk around and see if we can find them!\nPresent\nLady Justice\nApollo:\nPretty impressive the way you fixed that so quickly.\nAthena:\nI wouldn't really say I fixed it. I just looked at the pieces to see how they fit together.\nApollo:\nToo bad we can't put Mr. Wright's statue back together, too.\nAthena:\nOh, I totally forgot! But we're running out of time, so...\nApollo:\nProsecutor Gavin and Lady Justice are back up, but Mr. Wright still lies there shattered. But that was totally your call. I promise not to say anything to Mr. Wright, as long as you don't make me run anymore.\nAthena:\nAh...! You wouldn't...! Would you?\nAthena:\n(Once we take care of this case, I'd better come back and fix Mr. Wright's statue, too!)\nOutdoor Stage\nExamine\nTracks on and near fence\nAthena:\nIt looks like something was dragged through the dirt here. The track seems to start from behind the backdrop.\nApollo:\nI wonder what could've made that.\nAthena:\nI wouldn't rule out a pro wrestler scraping by here.\nApollo:\nWow. Now you're getting oddly specific about your oddly random ideas.\nTalk\nContribution to the case\nAthena:\nI just wanted to say thanks for helping with our investigation!\nKlavier:\nNo danke necessary, Fräulein. I was doing this partly for myself, too. I also have access to police data and gear, what with my many fans on the force.\nApollo:\nI assume you always get official authorization, right, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nYou are such a stick-in-the-mud, Herr Forehead. Let's just say, I have my ways. So relax. Unlike Prof. Means, I believe there is no proper end without justifiable means. And that always includes a bright smile and some wicked air guitar.\nApollo:\nFor a second there, I thought we were going to get philosophical... for once.\nPresent\nBurnt Fragments\nKlavier:\nWhy are you carrying a sooty mess of fabric around?\nAthena:\nYeah, about that. This is kinda hard to say, but...\nApollo:\nThis is the banner you've been looking for. It was found in the incinerator.\nKlavier:\nWhat?! This ash and cinder?! That's all that's left?!\nAthena:\nSomehow, I don't think was a random act of vandalism.\nKlavier:\nYeah, it no doubt bears some relation to the case at hand. In short, this is a challenge directed at me and Gavinners fans everywhere. Mark my words, Fräulein. I WILL find the perpetrator behind the crime!\nAthena:\nGreat, thanks! (Does he mean whoever burned the flag... ...or the professor's killer? I'll just cross my fingers that they're one and the same.)\nWright Anything Agency\nPresent\nLady Justice\nTrucy:\nYou must be so disappointed, Athena. You can't master magic in a day. It takes practice, practice, practice.\nAthena:\nUm... I don't quite follow.\nTrucy:\nI'm talking about that jumbled mess of a statue. Look at all the cracks in that thing! I mean, you totally botched your restore-the-broken-statue trick, right?\nAthena:\nTrick? I wasn't trying to--\nTrucy:\nWhen you botch a trick, don't admit defeat by resorting to glue or things like that. Just smash it to bits and start all over again! Here, give it to me! I'll show you!\nAthena:\nN-N-No, don't! (I don't have time to put it together again!)\nOctober 25Themis Legal Academy - 3F Art Room\nAthena:\nWell, here it is -- the art room where the grisly crime occurred. Let's start looking--\nFulbright:\nStop right there! This is an active crime scene! No unauthorized personnel allowed!\nAthena:\nWhat? Can't you make an exception? You won't even notice we're--\nFulbright:\nFreeze! I don't think so! No exceptions! Now, move along! Nothing to see here!\nAthena:\nUgh. He doesn't seem very accommodating this time. Let's try again later.\nOctober 25Themis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway\nAthena:\nHey! That's Hugh over there! Hugh, we wanted a word with you, if you don't mind.\nO'Conner:\nIf it was Mr. Wright, then sure, but you two? Meh...\nAthena:\n(I knew it. There's a hint of discord in Hugh's voice.)\nApollo:\nYou're not getting off that easy. After all, you're a possible suspect, plus you actually confessed in court.\nO'Conner:\nWhatever. So, what do you want from me? But make it brief. I don't have a lot of time, and I assume you don't either.\nTalk\nWhy did you confess?\nAthena:\nAbout your confession today... You weren't serious about that, were you?\nO'Conner:\nLet's just say I had no choice thanks to a certain lawyer who failed to get the job done.\nAthena:\n*gulp*\nApollo:\nSo, you're really prepared to take the blame for this?\nO'Conner:\nNot gonna happen. The voice on the tape is female, so that rules me out. Let's put it this way: you don't actually believe that ridiculous play on words, do you? Well, my confession is just like that -- a means to an end. Or as we say around here... ...the end justifies the means.\nAthena:\n(Ugh. But I actually DO believe the voice is shouting, \"Hugh O'Conner!\")\nO'Conner:\nJuniper's confession was quite advantageous to the real killer. But if Robin or I were actually the killer, we wouldn't have confessed. It's that simple. Even you should be capable of such reasoning, or have I overestimated you?\nApollo:\nYou'll make a great lawyer someday. I mean, you seem to enjoy getting under people's skin.\nAthena:\n(Hmm... Could Hugh and Robin's confessions really prove their innocence instead of their guilt? This is going to take some serious thinking on my part.)\nRelation to Blackquill\nAthena:\nIt sure looked like Prosecutor Blackquill was twisting your arm to testify earlier today. Is there some sort of secret he's using against you?\nO'Conner:\n...I've no intention of saying anything more. Now, if you'll excuse me.\nBlackquill:\nHold! I am not through with you yet.\nO'Conner:\nHeh. It seems the rogue prosecutor has it out for me.\nBlackquill:\nLeave, and we just might discuss you-know-what.\nO'Conner:\nAck! N-No, wait!\nAthena:\n(One little statement and Mr. Cool loses it? What's that all about?)\nO'Conner:\nI changed my mind. ...I'll stay and testify.\nO'Conner:\nYou really are a rank amateur. Even if that were true, you think I'd open up to you?\nAthena:\n(So, he's not denying it. That secret might be causing the discord in his voice. Then again, we have the same problem with Junie and Robin.)\nO'Conner:\nHeh. You're just wasting your time and mine. Next question.\nCourte's planner (appears after \"Why did you confess?\" and \"Relation to Blackquill\")\nLeads to:\n\"About that meeting with Prof. Courte on the 23rd... Why did she want to see you?\"\nPresent\n\"Hugh\" Scrap\nAthena:\nIs it just me or is this your name here?\nO'Conner:\nHeh, that's my name, but how should I know what it's doing there? But being that the whole campus looks up to me... ...I'm not surprised to find my name mentioned here and there.\nAthena:\n(And I'm not surprised he said that, being the narcissist he is.)\nAthena:\nAbout that meeting with Prof. Courte on the 23rd... Why did she want to see you?\nO'Conner:\nI've no intention of telling you. You'll have to force it out of me any way you can.\nAthena:\nUgh... Prof. Means strikes again. (Then again, Hugh IS in the lawyer course.) But didn't Prof. Courte used to say that the only good result is the truth? So, why don't you drop this whole charade and just tell me the truth!\nO'Conner:\n...The truth. How can you be so sure it will help you solve this case? The truth isn't necessarily your friend, nor Juniper's for that matter.\nAthena:\nNo, you're wrong! I don't care what anyone says. I'm going to defend Junie the right way -- using the truth! (That's the only way to honor Junie's wishes and Prof. Courte's memory!)\nO'Conner:\nI see. Very well, Ms. Cykes. I'll testify tomorrow about that truth you're so interested in.\nAthena:\nHugh...\nO'Conner:\nBut... Heh heh heh. Don't look to me if something happens to Juniper because of it. Understand?\nAthena:\nWh-What's that supposed to mean?\nApollo:\nWhat a terrible thing to say. I thought you guys were friends?\nO'Conner:\nYes, we were. Until just recently, actually.\nAthena:\nWere?\nO'Conner:\nI already told Juniper, so I might as well tell you. I don't really care about her anymore.\nAthena:\nWhat? Why?\nO'Conner:\nJust as I have my secrets, she has a side you've never seen. Juniper's not all sunshine and rainbows like you think she is.\nAthena:\nWh-What are you saying?!\nO'Conner:\nThis conversation is over. I said I don't have a lot of time and I meant it.\nApollo:\nHugh, wait! .........He's gone.\nAthena:\nHe doesn't care about her anymore? Why would he say that?\nApollo:\nThat didn't go so well. I guess we'll just have to pin our hopes on his testimony tomorrow. Athena, what do you say we head over to the art room. Might be a nice change of pace. Hopefully, the police have completed their investigation.\nAthena:\nAll right. We don't really have much time left, anyway.\nOctober 25Themis Legal Academy - 3F Art Room\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! Why, if it isn't my little lawyer friends again!\nAthena:\nThanks again for lowering that school banner for us earlier.\nFulbright:\nDon't mention it. Helping those in need is what my brand of justice is all about!\nApollo:\nRight... So, this art room was where the murder actually occurred?\nFulbright:\nThat's right. You can't see it with the naked eye, but there's blood on the floor! That area roped off in the middle of the room marks the spot. The police investigation is done, so if you want to look around, knock yourselves out!\nExamine\nRoped-off area\nAthena:\nHey, this area with the rope around it...\nFulbright:\nThat's where we detected a large bloodstain. In short, the victim was stabbed here or somewhere close by.\nAthena:\nThe fact that there's no visible blood means it was wiped up with something, right?\nFulbright:\nRight. But we were able to detect trace amounts of blood. Merely wiping it up does not remove all evidence of wrongdoing! And that--\nAthena:\nIn a nutshell, is JUSTICE... right?\nFulbright:\nI'd appreciate it if you'd let me have the cool lines...\nClock\nAthena:\nThis is the clock that created that major problem for Junie. Let's take a closer look!\nFulbright:\nDon't waste your time! I've checked it, and it's a hundred percent accurate!\nAthena:\nYou sure? How'd you check it?\nFulbright:\nOf course I'm sure! I compared it to my own watch! See?!\nAthena:\nUm... Detective Fulbright, didn't you notice that your watch had stopped?\nFulbright:\nIt has? Ah... Ah! This is unacceptable!\nApollo:\nWe obviously can't rely on him. Let's take a look for ourselves.\nAthena:\nLet's see... Wait a second! It's ahead by one whole hour. Well, Detective?\nFulbright:\nAh... Argggh! B-B-But...!\nAthena:\nThis clock must've also been an hour ahead when this photo was taken! If so, that would fit perfectly with Junie's testimony. Prosecutor Blackquill won't like this. I almost feel sorry for the detective... Almost.\nApollo:\nYou can at least pretend to feel sorry by wiping that big grin off your face...\nFulbright:\nW-W-Wait just one minute! The clock is an hour ahead right now, sure! But what proof do you have that it was running ahead on the day of the crime?!\nAthena:\n(Hmm... That's a good question. Wait. I think I just might have something...) Detective Fulbright, you would agree that there is a moon outside this window, right?\nFulbright:\nSure, a nice crescent one -- like something out of a picture book. (Changed from [Sure, it looks like a nice drawing of a crescent moon.] in the original release)\nAthena:\nBut if you look at that window in the back with the winch attached to it... ...you'll see that the only view to be had is the opposite side of the school building.\nFulbright:\nOof! Then... Then what's this moon doing here?!\nAthena:\n(Hmm... I wonder...)\nAthena:\nProsecutor Gavin, you were scheduled to perform at the school festival, weren't you?\nKlavier:\nThat's right. But I hadn't seen this stage until yesterday. That backdrop with the starry sky and big crescent moon isn't half bad.\nAthena:\n(Isn't this the same as the one painted on the stage backdrop?) The proof's right here, Detective. This shows it was 6:00 PM when the photo was taken!\nPresent Stage Set Up Photos\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"I know what this moon really is.\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! Nice try! But evidence like that will never sway me from the true path of justice! It will also please Prosecutor Blackquill to know how wrong you were!\nAthena:\nUgh. Guess I blew that one. What now?\nFulbright:\nWhat's this?! Is that the voice of someone in need?!\nAthena:\n(Yeah, because of you!)\nLeads back to:\n\"The proof's right here, Detective. This shows it was 6:00 PM when the photo was taken!\"\nAthena:\nI know what this moon really is. And if you look at this photo, you'll know too. This shows where that moon in the photo came from and the truth of Junie's testimony.\nFulbright:\nWh-Wha-What?! Where?! Where does it show that?!\nAthena:\nIf you look right here, it will all become crystal clear!\nPresent board\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"They were still prepping the stage, so its backdrop wasn't in place yet.\"\nPresent anywhere else\nAthena:\nFulbright:\nWell, stop stalling! Tell me what I should be looking at!\nAthena:\nUm, right here. See where I'm pointing?!\nFulbright:\nVery funny. Now hurry up and show me what you're really talking about!\nAthena:\nUgh... (Guess that wasn't it. Let's think about it step by step. What was that moon in the photo really made of?)\nLeads back to:\n\"If you look right here, it will all become crystal clear!\"\nAthena:\nThey were still prepping the stage, so its backdrop wasn't in place yet. This photo shows them in the process of moving the backdrop into position.\nApollo:\nI can see that. That's the big board hanging here. The size matches, too.\nFulbright:\nBut there's no picture. That's a crucial detail.\nAthena:\nIt is, but I believe what we're seeing in this photo is the back of the board.\nFulbright:\nThe back of the...?\nAthena:\nThat's right. And at around 6:00 PM when this was taken... ...a photo of that same board was being taken from the front.\nFulbright:\nWhat do you mean the front? The front is against the wall!\nAthena:\nThat's where you're wrong. What about the window? Remember how we said the moon shouldn't even exist in this photo? Take a good look.\nFulbright:\nAre you suggesting the moon is the one on the backdrop?!\nAthena:\nExactly! In short, this photo was taken while the backdrop was being moved! And as you can see here, it was around 6:00 when the backdrop was being set in place. So, the art room clock was running fast at least as far back as the day of the murder.\nFulbright:\nHow-ow-ow... How can I ever face Prosecutor Blackquill now?!\nAthena:\n(Yes! I just blew a hole in a piece of the prosecution's evidence!)\nClock (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nThe photo taken with the school camera was from 6:00 PM or thereabouts.\nFulbright:\n*sob* How am I ever going to explain this to Prosecutor Blackquill?!\nAthena:\nHonesty is the best policy! Look him right in the eye and say you're sorry for screwing up!\nFulbright:\nYes, you're right! Only in sincerity is there justice! Plus, I'd like to avoid getting chewed out all over again.\nAthena:\n(Knowing Blackquill, Detective Fulbright's going to get chewed out no matter what.)\nTable next to easel\nApollo:\nHey, it's gone. Remember that strange statue in the school camera photo?\nAthena:\nYou're right. Wonder where it is? (Robin's a member of the Fine Arts Club. Maybe she can shed some light on this.)\nPalette\nAthena:\nThere's a paint palette here. No surprise there, considering this is the art room.\nApollo:\nLooks like someone mixed yellow and red to make orange.\nAthena:\nI prefer yellow. You, on the other hand, are way too red.\nApollo:\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\nAthena:\nI think this is saying that the two of us have to work together to solve this case. Ooh! What if this is Prof. Courte sending us a message from beyond the grave?!\nApollo:\nWhat about the blob right next to it -- the one with red and green?\nAthena:\nMaybe she's implying that you need more delicious greens in your diet?\nApollo:\nAre you saying Prof. Courte is watching over our dietary habits from the Pearly Gates?\nPhony Phanty mobile\nAthena:\nHey, look! That's you on this mobile, Apollo! A red demon!\nApollo:\nA red demon? Looks more like a snake curled around a brush to me.\nFulbright:\nNo, no, see the antennas and the yellow spots on its back! Anyone can see it's a ladybug!\nApollo:\nHmm... I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.\nFulbright:\nFine, we can investigate this further at a later date. Agreed?\nApollo:\nOkay, let's do that. You okay with that, Athena?\nAthena:\n(I really regret bringing this up.)\nPainting\nAthena:\nA picture of a girl wearing a floral hat... Oh, it has the artist's name right here. \"C. Courte.\" Wow, Prof. Courte must've painted this!\nApollo:\nSo is this what they consider art? I really don't get it.\nAthena:\nI swear I've seen this girl before. There's an air of fragility about her. And those pity-inducing eyes... Who is this again? Her name's on the tip of my tongue.\nWindow\nAthena:\nI can see the other half of the building over there, and the quad and the stage down below.\nApollo:\nYeah. This must be the window Detective Fulbright stuck his head out of earlier.\nAthena:\nOh, yeah, thanks for the help, Detective!\nFulbright:\nA true champion of justice always comes running to those in need!\nAthena:\nGreat, then how about telling us Prosecutor Blackquill's strategy for tomorrow?\nFulbright:\nAll right, let me think...\nAthena:\n.........Well?\nFulbright:\n.........Hm? Oh! Hey, I'm not falling for that!\nAthena:\n(So close I could almost taste it.)\nWinch\nAthena:\nSome wire and a winch... So this is how they reeled the banners in and out. There's a nice view of the stage from here.\nApollo:\nProsecutor Gavin is still standing in front of that broken statue.\nAthena:\nSo, it really wasn't you, Apollo? Don't worry, you can tell me. I won't tell anyone.\nApollo:\nArgh... I'll never clear my name unless we catch the real culprit!\nPottery\nAthena:\nLook, a piece of pottery. Looks like it's already been fired. I bet Robin made it.\nApollo:\nAnd I bet it won't last long, not with the way she deals with her own work, anyway.\nAthena:\nYeah, it seems like such a waste. I mean, this one already has some color on it. It looks just like bloodstains the way the glaze was dribbled on to it.\nApollo:\nJust like... b-bloodstains?\nFulbright:\nIn justice we trust! That DOES look like bloodstains. We'd better examine it at once!\nApollo:\nI get it. The victim was stabbed in the middle of the room where the big bloodstain is... ...and then brought over here, at which point, some of her blood dripped onto these pieces. That means the body very well could've been dropped from this window.\nAthena:\nIn the mock trial script, the body was dropped onto a mat. Then, a ball cart was used to move it over to the stage.\nFulbright:\nThe maintenance area is below this room, and the storehouse there has a mat and ball cart.\nAthena:\nSo, even the moving of the body was carried out just like in the script. The killer sure had a thing for Junie's script.\nFulbright:\nWell, what did you expect?! That's why we suspected the defendant in the first place.\nAthena:\nWell, you're wrong! And I'm going to prove it in court!\nShelf\nApollo:\nIsn't that a mock trial script? Actually, there's a whole bunch of them here.\nAthena:\nLet's see... Looks like everyone from the judge course submitted one.\nFulbright:\nThe victim Constance Courte was the Fine Art Club's advisor. So, she probably spent a lot of time up here in addition to her other duties. This isn't where I'd keep a bunch of scripts, but I'd wager that's how they wound up here.\nAthena:\nPoor stressed-out, overworked Prof. Courte! I know exactly how that feels!\nApollo:\nYou must, because your desk always looks like a tornado hit it.\nAthena:\nTsk, you're one to talk, Apollo!\nApollo:\nMe? What about Mr. Wright?\nAthena:\nMaybe we should rename the firm \"Wright Stuff-All-Over-the-Place Agency.\"\nBusts\nAthena:\nThree busts sitting on a shelf... A judge, a defendant and either a lawyer or prosecutor. The bearded one must be the judge, and the bummed out-looking one, the defendant.\nApollo:\nLook, there's another one that's fallen onto the floor.\nAthena:\nI wonder which one fell -- the lawyer or the prosecutor. Think, Apollo, think! This could tell us how tomorrow's trial will go!\nApollo:\nI'll... just wait for tomorrow's horoscopes, thanks.\nPainting on floor\nAthena:\nA picture of a girl wearing a floral hat... Oh, it has the artist's name right here. \"R. Newman.\" Wow, Robin must've painted this!\nApollo:\nIs this Juniper? The clothes are different, but...\nAthena:\nOh, look. There's a piece of paper stuck to the back. Let's see what it says... \"Completely lacks Prof. Courte's artistry. Must keep practicing. --Robin\" Huh... I think this is plenty good myself.\nApollo:\nI wonder what it would've looked like if Prof. Courte had painted Juniper.\nAthena:\nI bet it would've been really artistic looking.\nStatue\nAthena:\nIt kinda looks like there's a Prosecutor's Badge at the top of this statue.\nApollo:\nBut it's not if you look real close. Another strange, difficult-to-understand work of art...\nAthena:\nOh, look, it has a title. \"Guilty, Guilty, Guilty.\" Heh, real creative...\nApollo:\nArt... Either it's too abstract to understand or as subtle as a sledgehammer.\n\"Use\" envelope or mock trial script on floor\nAthena:\nA mock trial script on the floor, and nearby, an envelope marked \"Use.\"\nApollo:\nI wonder if Myriam's script was ever really inside that envelope.\nAthena:\nLet's see here... \"by Myriam Scuttlebutt.\" And the title is... \"Rouge et Noir: Crimson Blood and Dark Judgment\"\nApollo:\nI wouldn't take part in that mock trial if she begged me.\nAthena:\nIt says there are special rules allowing the payment of bribes while court is adjourned. Oh, and you can bring in up to three dollars worth of fabricated evidence. It also says... \"Welcome to the darkest mock trial ever, where the end justifies the means!\"\nApollo:\nThe prosecution claims this is the script that was supposed to have been used.\nAthena:\nBut the scripts were selected by Prof. Courte. Considering how much she valued the truth... ...I seriously doubt she's pick a script entitled \"Crimson Blood and Dark Judgment.\"\nApollo:\nWow, you have that title memorized already?\nTalk\nArt room investigation\nAthena:\nFind anything new, Detective Fulbright?\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! Good question! Unfortunately, the answer is nothing much yet!\nAthena:\n(He sure is confident for having found nothing...)\nFulbright:\nBut if we're talking outside of the art room, there has been a major breakthrough!\nAthena:\nOh, dear! Unless I find out what that is, I don't know what I shall do.\nFulbright:\nNo need for the theatrics. I was told I could fill you in on this one!\nAthena:\nWow, you saw right through me, Detective! I'm impressed.\nApollo:\nLooking to get arrested for murder via unwarranted flattery, are we?\nThe breakthrough (appears after \"Art room investigation\")\nApollo:\nSo, what's the major breakthrough you mentioned?\nFulbright:\nYou want to know?! You really want to know?! You really, really--\nAthena:\nCome on, just tell us, already!\nFulbright:\nAww, you're no fun. ...Anywho, we got the results of the voiceprint analysis back!\nAthena:\nVoiceprint? You mean for this tape recorder?\nFulbright:\nExactly. The voice belongs to the suspect Ms. Woods, beyond a shadow of a doubt! See right here?! They analyzed the voice on the tape inside and out!\nVoiceprint Analysis added to the Court Record.\nFulbright:\nAnd you thought the voice on the tape was saying, \"Hugh O'Conner!\" Ha ha ha ha ha! Thanks for the good laugh, Ms. Cykes!\nAthena:\nArgh! (He's the last person I want laughing at me!)\nApollo:\nSo now there's evidence of Juniper shouting, \"You're a goner!\" around the time of death. If we were to take this as truth, how are we supposed to make sense of it?\nAthena:\n(I don't know... I can't think of any reason why Junie would shout that in the first place.)\nThe breakthrough (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nSo, what's the major breakthrough you mentioned?\nFulbright:\nYou want to know?! You really want to know?! You really, really--\nAthena:\nCome on, just tell us, already!\nFulbright:\nAww, you're no fun. ...Anywho, we got the results of the voiceprint analysis back!\nAthena:\nVoiceprint? You mean for this tape recorder?\nFulbright:\nExactly. The voice belongs to the suspect Ms. Woods, beyond a shadow of a doubt! See right here?! They analyzed the voice on the tape inside and out! And you thought the voice on the tape was saying, \"Hugh O'Conner!\" Ha ha ha ha ha! Thanks for the good laugh, Ms. Cykes!\nAthena:\nArgh!

If we were to take this as truth, how are we supposed to make sense of it?\nAthena:\n(I don't know... I can't think of any reason why Junie would shout that in the first place.)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nFulbright:\nHm? That was totally random. Well, two can play at that game! In justice we trust! How do you like them apples?! Pretty spiffy, huh? I polish the leather case to a rich luster daily. And once a week, I apply an anti-rust protectant to my badge!\nAthena:\nIs all that really necessary?\nFulbright:\nOf course, it is! A detective's badge is his first line of defense! I'm sure you treat your badge with tender loving care, too!\nApollo:\nAthena, I always see your badge gathering dust on your desk. And you usually scramble to find it right before leaving the office.\nAthena:\nNngh...... (Hmph. No comment!)\nMock Trial Script\nFulbright:\nThe mock trial is the key to this case. That much I'm sure!\nAthena:\nYeah, but even if the case and the script are similar, that doesn't mean Juniper's guilty. I already proved that in court this morning!\nFulbright:\nOh, right. This could be a problem. What to do, what to do!\nAthena:\nWell, we better get back to our investigation.\nFulbright:\nHey! Don't walk away like that! Even champions of justice need help sometimes!\nAthena:\n(Seriously? He wants me to help him convict our client?)\nAwl, Tape Recorder, or Voiceprint Analysis\nFulbright:\nThat's gonna give the prosecution a decisive advantage! Prepare to get owned tomorrow!\nAthena:\nI don't think so. We have new evidence that will blow your case out of the water!\nFulbright:\nOh, yeah? Well, Prosecutor Blackquill has a witness ready to deliver brand-new testimony! Plus, he has a new tie and a pair of even flimsier shackles just ready to break! Tomorrow's trial will be ours! In justice we trust!\nAthena:\nWell, tomorrow I'll be using a new shampoo and I'm changing breakfast cereals, too! What about you, Apollo?! What'll be new with you tomorrow?!\nApollo:\nI think we should approach the case with a fresh, new attitude. It's what's on the inside that's important. We'll be fine as long as we stand strong.\nAthena:\nW-Wow, Apollo! That was actually really inspiring!\nAnything else\nFulbright:\nI see! So, that's your symbol of justice! Well, here's mine! In justice we trust!\nAthena:\n(I'd be happy if I never saw one of those again.)\nAfter clearing \"The breakthrough\" Talk option and examining roped-off area, clock, table next to easel, winch, pottery, and \"Use\" envelope or mock trial script on floor:\nApollo:\nWell, I think we've examined pretty much everything we can. By the way, did Prosecutor Blackquill happen to tell you anything about tomorrow's trial?\nFulbright:\nIn justice we trust! It's no use trying to pry more information out of me! Having just learned that the clock had been one hour fast... ...means we're back to square one concerning the suspect's actions that day.\nAthena:\nHmm... I wonder what the main argument will be about now.\nFulbright:\nHow the body was moved would be my guess, but Prosecutor Blackquill's got his own plans.\nApollo:\nOh? Does he now...?\nAthena:\nUm, Detective Fulbright--\nFulbright:\nTry as you might, I won't say another word about the investigation!\nAthena:\nNo, I wasn't going to ask about that. I was just wondering if you'd seen Robin.\nFulbright:\nOh, you mean Ms. Robin Newman? She was just here a moment ago! And she mumbled something about watching videos in the Lecture Hall.\nAthena:\n(Video? What video?)\nApollo:\nThanks, Detective. ...Athena, I think we should stop by the Lecture Hall.\nAthena:\nRight, let's go!\nOctober 25Themis Legal Academy - 3F Lecture Hall\nAthena:\nThere she is! Robin! Hey, Robin!\nNewman:\nOh, Athena, Apollo!\nApollo:\nWhat are you watching there?\nNewman:\nHeh heh... Oh, it just so happens to be a video of the mock trial. I had to use a bit of coercion to get it, but the end justifies the means, right?\nAthena:\n(There it is again. Prof. Means sure has a lot of influence around here.)\nNewman:\nCare to look into the true connection between the murder and the mock trial with me?\nAthena:\nSounds great, but do you mind if we ask you some questions first?\nNewman:\nEh heh heh. Sure, I'll tell you anything you W-A-N-T.\nTalk\nWhy did you confess?\nAthena:\nAbout your confession today... Why'd you do it?\nNewman:\nBecause! Juniper hasn't done anything wrong! I had to stop the trial by any means possible!\nAthena:\nRight... The end justifies the means. So, you're a follower of Prof. Means, too?\nNewman:\nProf. Means is a wonderful teacher, as was Prof. Courte. I like them B-O-T-H!\nAthena:\n(She brushed that one off like a pro.)\nApollo:\nBut with that style of justice, you run the risk of breaking the law.\nNewman:\nWell... I'm prepared to quit school because of this case.\nAthena:\nWh-What? Why?\nNewman:\nI-I... I wanna be an artist! That's what I really want, maaaaaan! But noooooo! My parents forced me to study to become a prosecutor!\nAthena:\nBut if the trial went south, you'd have to drop out and give up on being a prosecutor... That's what you're really after, isn't it?\nNewman:\nMm-hm. *sniffle*\nAthena:\n(Talk about someone who literally changes at the bat of an eyelash...)\nApollo:\nI guess she's been dealing with her own problems, too. That totally makes sense.\nAthena:\n(Yeah, I suppose so, but that doesn't make what she did right.)\nThe day of the crime\nApollo:\nCould you tell us about what you were doing on the night of the murder?\nNewman:\nFinishing a statue. I was on the stage until the last bell.\nAthena:\nThat's right. You made the statues of Mr. Wright and Prosecutor Gavin, didn't you?\nNewman:\nOh, uh, yes... yes I did. Both of them.\nApollo:\nThis is just a formality, but can you prove you were making the statues at that time?\nNewman:\nC-C-CAN I PROVE IT?! YOU THINK I'M THE KILLER NOW?!\nApollo:\nN-No... That's not what I meant.\nAthena:\n(Both Hugh and Robin were still at school after 7:00 PM. But neither of them can prove exactly what they were doing. Could one of them really have murdered Prof. Courte?)\nNow that the secret's out...\nAthena:\nHave there been any problems now that everyone here knows you're a girl?\nNewman:\nHeh heh, no worries there! I discussed the matter with Prof. Courte some time ago. I told her I wanted to let everyone know I was really a girl. And just today I found out that she spoke with the school administration on my behalf.\nApollo:\nWow, they must really like you...\nNewman:\nI know, right? But now I can finally be myself here at school! I don't have to hide the fact that I love girly clothes! That's why, Athena, I simply must have this and... this by any means possible!\nAthena:\nWhat? B-But this is evidence we need for the trial. ...Sorry, but no can do!\nNewman:\nAww, don't be a party pooper, Athena. Come on, please? Pretty please?\nStage costume-related evidence taken in classic end-justifies-the-means style!\nAthena:\nOh, darn it...\nNewman:\nAnyway, thank you again, Athena! Thank you for revealing who I really am! I wanted everyone to know before the snitch found out!\nAthena:\nThe snitch? (Sounds like a new lead!)\nNow that the secret's out... (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nHave there been any problems now that everyone here knows you're a girl?\nNewman:\nHeh heh, no worries there! I discussed the matter with Prof. Courte some time ago. I told her I wanted to let everyone know I was really a girl. And just today I found out that she spoke with the school administration on my behalf.\nApollo:\nWow, they must really like you...\nNewman:\nI know, right? But now I can finally be myself here at school! I don't have to hide the fact that I love girly clothes! Anyway, thank you again, Athena! Thank you for revealing who I really am! I wanted everyone to know before the snitch found out!\nAthena:\nThe snitch? (Sounds like a new lead!)\nThe snitch (appears after \"Now that the secret's out...\")\nNewman:\nThere's a rumor going around that one of the students here is a snitch. I hear they're watching everything we do, our activities, our relationships, our interests... ...and reporting it all to one of the professors.\nApollo:\nBut why would anyone do that?\nNewman:\nOfficially, I heard it's to seek out misconduct among the student body... ...but rumor has it grades were being bought and sold through this surveillance network.\nApollo:\nThat's bribery. The situation at Themis Legal Academy is worse than I thought.\nAthena:\n(While all of this is important stuff, I still want to ask about that thing in the art room. I'll have to present some evidence to show her what I'm talking about, though.)\nCourte's artistic sense (appears after correctly presenting School Camera Photo)\nNewman:\nProf. Courte's artistic sense... That's a tough one. I'd say it's avant-garde and very eclectic.\nAthena:\n(In other words, it's weird and all over the place. Come to think of it, that strange-looking painting in the art room... ...was one of Prof. Courte's works, wasn't it.)\nNewman:\nThe statue in that photo was originally a statue of Lady Justice.\nAthena:\nLady Justice?\nNewman:\nProf. Courte had planned on placing it on the judge's bench in the Lecture Hall... Heh heh. But the day before the mock trial, it broke while she was polishing it. She said she'd take it back to the art room and try to fix it somehow.\nAthena:\nSo... this... is the statue in its proper state?\nNewman:\nYou bet! Just look at that wild silhouette! Wow! It's so C-U-T-E!\nAthena:\n(I... don't get it... Do you have to be an artist to appreciate stuff like this?)\nApollo:\nAthena... The Lady Justice that you put back together on that stage...\nAthena:\nOh, right. I didn't realize before because it was in pieces, but before it was smashed... ...maybe it didn't look like Lady Justice, but more like it does in the photo! But what in the world was it doing on the stage?\nLady Justice updated in the Court Record.\nCourte's artistic sense (subsequent times)\nNewman:\nProf. Courte's artistic sense... That's a tough one. I'd say it's avant-garde and very eclectic.\nAthena:\n(In other words, it's weird and all over the place. Come to think of it, that strange-looking painting in the art room... ...was one of Prof. Courte's works, wasn't it.)\nNewman:\nThe statue in that photo was originally a statue of Lady Justice.\nAthena:\nLady Justice?\nNewman:\nProf. Courte had planned on placing it on the judge's bench in the Lecture Hall...

It's so C-U-T-E!\nAthena:\n(I... don't get it... Do you have to be an artist to appreciate stuff like this?)\nApollo:\nAthena... The Lady Justice that you put back together on that stage...\nAthena:\nOh, right. I didn't realize before because it was in pieces, but before it was smashed... ...maybe it didn't look like Lady Justice, but more like it does in the photo! But what in the world was it doing on the stage?\nPresent\nStage Costume\nNewman:\nOoh, that's Juniper's stage costume! It's so C-U-T-E! Why don't you try it on, Athena?! C'mon, just try it!\nAthena:\nUmm, it's really pretty to look at. But it's really not my style with all the frills and stuff.\nNewman:\nWhat?! No, that's not true! I mean, there's a Cinderella inside every girl! You'd look great in anything! Just put it on and I'll brush on some yellow glaze. It's your favorite color, right?! Then it's in the kiln you go! How would you like that? Rare, medium, well done?\nAthena:\n(So when she said Cinderella, she literally meant burn me to cinders?)\nSchool Camera Photo (after clearing \"The snitch\" Talk option)\nAthena:\nRobin, I just remembered something I wanted to ask you. This photo shows a piece of art on the table. Do you know what it is?\nNewman:\nWH-WH-WHOOOOOOOOOA! Look at that unique artistic sense! That has to be one of Prof. Courte's creations, maaaaaan!\nAthena:\nProf. Courte's... artistic sense?\nLady Justice\nNewman:\nOoh! Lady Justice! That's sooo C-U-T-E!\nAthena:\nYou think this is cute?\nNewman:\nYeah, totally! The balance of the scales! The keenness of the sword! The cracks running all the way up!\nAthena:\nThat last one's only because I put it back together.\nNewman:\nOoh, I totally know what you mean! It's that feeling you get when something is so cute you want to smash it to bits! R-I-G-H-T? RAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!\nAthena:\n(Sorry, but that sounds more like a case of the crazy than a fondness for the cute.)\nStage Set Up Photos\nNewman:\nAww, maaaaaan... That's my blood, sweat and tears in a pile of rubble right there!\nAthena:\nWhy not make the statues again? I'm sure the two of them would be delighted.\nNewman:\nYeah! I could totally do that! And this time... ...I'm gonna make them even more realistic by making full body molds of the models!!!\nAthena:\nFull body molds? Um... are you sure that's safe? How about plain old measurements?\nNewman:\nOh, Athena. Measurements are for wimps! Full on YOLO is what art's all about! I'm gonna drop both of 'em in a big pool of plaster! YEAAAAAAH!\nAthena:\nI know I should stop you, but some part of me really wants to see how this plays out.\nAnything else\nNewman:\nYay! A present from Athena! Ooh, this is so exciting!\nAthena:\nUm... sorry, but it's not a present. I wanted to know whether you knew anything about it.\nNewman:\n*sob* ...That's not nice, Athena. Why are you so cranky today?\nAthena:\n(I wasn't until a moment ago.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nApollo:\nWell, I think that about covers it.\nNewman:\nOkay, then how about watching the mock trial video with me? What do you say?\nAthena:\nSure, sounds good to me. Er, so, how do you wanna watch it?\nNewman:\nEh heh heh. All classroom desks at this school have their own built-in computer, you know.\nApollo:\nWow, this place is definitely a lot cushier than I thought!\nNewman:\nI know you guys are in a hurry, so I'll just fast-forward to the important parts. Let's start with the professor's pre-trial speech.\n\"Good afternoon. I would like to start by thanking you for coming here today.\"\nAthena:\nOh, that sounds like Prof. Means.\n\"The mock trial, the crown-jewel event of the school festival will begin shortly!\"\nApollo:\nIs the camera like this the whole time?\nNewman:\nYeah, it's in a fixed position in front of the stage.\n\"When I was a student, I, too, could hardly wait for this day to come.\"\nApollo:\nHow come teachers' speeches always make me so sleepy?\nNewman:\nEh heh he. Let's just skip to the end of his speech.\n\"Now, let the mock trial begin!\"\nAthena:\nHey! What's the deal here? Why's Junie so large in this shot?\nApollo:\nLooks to me like she cut right in front of the camera.\nNewman:\nEh heh heh heh. Juniper was also in charge of the audio.\nAthena:\nEven though she was already playing a part in the mock trial itself?\nNewman:\nShe had to do it to keep the script details secret. She was all over the place that day. When she wasn't in the trial, she was in the audio control room dealing with the music.\nAthena:\nOoh, so this is what the Lecture Hall looks like.\nApollo:\nLooks like there's a judge's bench back by the screen, and a witness stand up front. What about those balconies with the professors' names on them?\nNewman:\nThose are the faculty seats. Prof. Means and Prof. Courte were in charge of scoring the mock trial.\nLecture Hall Diagram added to the Court Record.\nNewman:\nOkay, let's fast forward this a bit.\n\"...And that's why the defendant is... DEFINITELY GUILTYYYYYY!!!\"\nNewman:\nAh, that was me! Could you tell?\n\"Objection! A frail coed used her bare hands to stab her professor with an arrow? I don't think so.\"\nAthena:\nYou read that line in the mock mock trial, Apollo, but you made it sound kind of weird.\nApollo:\nCut me some slack. It was my first time reading that script.\nNewman:\nI think Juniper's going to speak next.\n\"I didn't do it! I had suffered a breakdown and pretty much lost it. It's true I shouted, 'You're a goner!' but I didn't mean it!\"\nApollo:\nWow, what an emotional performance. She'd put a real actress to shame.\nAthena:\nWait. Could you go back and play that scene again?\nApollo:\nYou really think that's necessary?\n\"I didn't do it! I had suffered a breakdown and pretty much lost it. It's true I shouted, 'You're a goner!' but I didn't mean it!\"\nAthena:\nStop! Did you hear that?!\nApollo:\nI think you're on to something! Let's play that last part again!\nNewman:\nI don't follow. What are you guys so excited about?\nAthena:\nI think this piece of evidence should explain it. (Time to show Robin a piece of evidence that links the line we just heard to the case.)\nPresent Tape Recorder\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"I'm sure you remember this. It contains a female voice shouting a violent threat.\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nNewman:\nThat's it?! I don't see the connection.\nAthena:\nOh, right... What was the connection again?\nNewman:\nC'mon, Athena! I know you know!\nAthena:\nI do? Really?! (That voice shouting, \"You're a goner!\" has come up over and over again.)\nLeads back to:\n\"Time to show Robin a piece of evidence that links the line we just heard to the case.\"\nAthena:\nI'm sure you remember this. It contains a female voice shouting a violent threat. I'll play it for you.\n\"...You're a goner!\"\nNewman:\nThe voices and performance do sound similar, but... I can't believe this is happening!\nAthena:\nIt's just a possibility, but if the voice on this tape is really a recording... ...one made from the mock trial video, then that means this evidence was fabricated.\nApollo:\nThey didn't get to do a voiceprint analysis in time for court today. That's why the gender of the voice became so important. And if the real killer had foreseen that gender would become key in today's trial...\nAthena:\n...He would've tried to deflect attention away from himself by making the suspect female. So basically, the only one with something to gain from doing this is our sole male suspect.\nNewman:\nWait a second! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!\nApollo:\nProf. Means's credo is \"The end justifies the means.\" So it makes perfect sense that a student who took those words to heart... ...would fabricate evidence. We need to get that tape analyzed as soon as possible!\nTape Recorder updated in the Court Record.\n???:\n......Allow me to assist you with that.\nAthena:\nProsecutor Gavin! At least make some kind of noise so we know you're there!\nKlavier:\nIt's go big or go home with rock star entrances, Fräulein. Timing is everything. Let me make a copy of that tape right now, and I'll get you the results as soon as I can. I trust that would be all right?\nAthena:\nVery much so! Thanks!\nApollo:\nWell, Athena? It's almost sundown. Isn't it about time we head over to the Detention Center?\nAthena:\nI think Junie will agree that this is something that could prove her innocence. But... (Will her heart really be open to accepting it? She had to have known this was what I'd find!)\nOctober 25Detention Center - Visitor's Room\nAthena:\n...And that about covers the main gist of our investigation.\nMeans:\nI see. Very interesting. You've been quite the busy beaver today.\nWoods:\nThank you for all your hard work, Athena. Well, my time's about up. And it will be getting dark soon, so...\nAthena:\nJunie!\nWoods:\nYou must be tired after being on your feet all day. You should go home and--\nAthena:\nNo, wait! You have to listen to me!\nWoods:\nI don't... I don't want to hear any more. I know what you're going to say, Athena.\nAthena:\nJunie, you promised.\nAthena:\nWe're going to discover the truth behind this murder mystery! And we're going to bring you solid evidence showing just what that truth is! If we succeed in doing that... ...I want you to promise that you'll accept it, Junie, no matter how hard it is to hear.\nWoods:\n............Okay. But only if it's the real truth.\nAthena:\nSo please. Please just listen to what I have to say. Once you've heard me out, I'll let you decide what to do.\nWoods:\n.........\nTalk\nSuspicions about O'Conner\nAthena:\nThe voice in this recording has been proven to be yours, Junie. And in the mock trial video, we can hear you reading your line from the script. We're having both of them analyzed now, but from what I can tell, the voices are the same. And the only one who'd benefit from faking the voice recording would be Hugh.\nWoods:\n......... But that doesn't make any sense. I mean, Hugh confessed in order to protect me!\nAthena:\nThis may sound strange, but his confession is a ploy to make himself look less suspicious. In other words, he was just pretending to protect you. Besides, his confession came after you and Robin had already confessed. If he hadn't confessed right then as well, wouldn't that have seemed a little suspicious?\nWoods:\n...Say what you will, Athena, but none of us would hurt a fly, let alone kill someone. Hugh is a gifted student. He gets outstanding grades and never causes trouble.\nBRACELET THUMPS\nApollo:\nWait. Athena. My bracelet reacted just now...!\nAthena:\nIt did? (But why?!) ......... Junie, can you look me in the eye and repeat what you just said?\nWoods:\nOh, um... none of us would hurt a fly, let alone kill someone. Hugh is a gifted student. He gets outstanding grades and never causes trouble.\nBRACELET THUMPS\nApollo:\nNow I'm sure of it. She's lying.\nPresent Bracelet\nWoods:\nHugh is a gifted student. He gets outstanding grades and never causes trouble.\nPerceive fluttering scarf on \"and never causes trouble.\"\nApollo:\nApollo:\nJuniper, you start coughing when you're under stress. You can't hide it from me no matter how hard you try. When you said, \"and never causes trouble,\" a cough escaped and made your scarf flutter. As for why you were stressed, it's because you were lying.\nWoods:\n.........\nAthena:\nJunie, you're trying to hide Hugh's connection to this case, aren't you? And I believe that also ties into a secret about yourself.\nWoods:\nA-A secret? About me? I don't understand.\nO'Conner:\nI already told Juniper. so I might as well tell you. I don't really care about her anymore.\nAthena:\nWhat? Why?\nO'Conner:\nJuniper's not all sunshine and rainbows like you think she is.\nAthena:\n(He ended their friendship after he found out about Junie's secret, which means... Hugh must've felt betrayed by Junie, making her...)\nThe killer\nAthena:\nYou're the killer! ...Just kidding.\nWoods:\n.........\nAthena:\nI had you going there for a moment, didn't I? Thought it might lighten the mood a bit.\nWoods:\n.........\nApollo:\nAthena, it's probably not a good idea for lawyers to punk their clients.\nAthena:\nAh... right... (Well, that didn't go as planned...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Hugh must've felt betrayed by Junie, making her...\"\nAn accomplice\nAthena:\nYou're an accomplice to the crime. You weren't at first, but you got involved to help cover for Hugh.\nWoods:\nAthena... I knew it was a mistake to ask you to be my lawyer. Maybe it's not too late to ask Prof. Means--\nAthena:\nN-No, wait! That was just a little slip up. (I better not hurt her feelings again. Time for some serious thinking.)\nLeads back to:\n\"Hugh must've felt betrayed by Junie, making her...\"\nThe snitch\nLeads to:\n\"You were Prof. Courte's snitch, weren't you?\"\nAthena:\nYou were Prof. Courte's snitch, weren't you?\nNewman:\nThere's a rumor going around that one of the students here is a snitch. I hear they're watching everything we do, our activities, our relationships, our interests... ...and reporting it all to one of the professors.\nAthena:\nAnd while fulfilling that role, you learned something about Hugh you'd rather forget.\nWoods:\nI-I don't know what you're talking about.\nAthena:\nJunie, please. Stop hiding things from me. I hate having to force things out of you like this.\nWoods:\n.........\nAthena:\n(Looks like we're going to have to do this the hard way. Time to review the evidence and see if I can't prove my hypothesis. I must have something that proves Junie's the snitch, and Hugh's connection to the case.)\nPresent Courte's Planner\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"Right here in Prof. Courte's Planner, it says, \"Routine Report.\"\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nWoods:\n...I'm relieved to see you're coming around. You see, I wasn't trying to hide anything.\nApollo:\nJuniper's one cool customer, Athena.\nAthena:\nW-Wait! I don't think that was the right piece of evidence.\nWoods:\nWhatever you show me won't change the fact that I've already told you all I know.\nLeads back to:\n\"I must have something that proves Junie's the snitch, and Hugh's connection to the case.\"\nAthena:\nRight here in Prof. Courte's Planner, it says, \"Routine Report.\" I believe this is meant to mean when the snitch would report in to Prof. Courte. I also believe Prof. Courte planned to meet Hugh in private based on the snitch's info. And from their meeting, Hugh must've put two and two together, and figured out your secret. So you see, it all makes sense only if you're the snitch, Junie.\nWoods:\n*sniffle* ...Aaah...! Forgive me... Forgive me, Thena. I... I... *sob* I've been lying to you this whole time! The truth is, I... I suspected Hugh from the start!\nAthena:\nYou did? (Now this is surprising...)\nWoods:\nI'm so sorry. I've talked about friendship so much, but I've been a terrible friend.\nApollo:\nJuniper, I don't have that special kind of hearing that Athena does... ...but I don't need it to sense the pain you're feeling inside. And its intensity is directly proportional to how you feel about your friend. Am I right?\nWoods:\n*sob* Apollo...!\nAthena:\nPlease, Junie, tell me why you suspected Hugh. I have a feeling that will be the key to getting to the bottom of this whole case.\nLeads back to Talk options\nPerceive wrong area\nApollo:\nApollo:\nThere it is. Juniper, you're feeling nervous, aren't you?\nWoods:\nNo. That's the one thing I'm not. The Student Council President isn't so easily shaken.\nApollo:\nNice try! But I just spotted a telltale habit of yours!\nWoods:\nHuh? I don't know what you're--\nAthena:\nApollo! It's you and your loud voice that's unnerving her.\nWoods:\nNo, I already told you, I'm not nervous! I'm not Student Council President for nothing!\nApollo:\nWell, in any case, it looks like I got that one wrong...\nLeads back to Talk options\nSuspicions about O'Conner (after perceiving)\nAthena:\nWhat exactly was your role as class snitch?\nWoods:\nProf. Courte had told me how academy alumni had strayed from the path of justice.\nApollo:\nThe dark age of the law, huh...\nWoods:\nShe didn't want any more of our students going astray like that. But few others at the academy shared her view.\nMeans:\nI thought her ideas were beautiful, though sad and unrealistic.\nAthena:\nShe asked you to be her eyes and ears, didn't she?\nWoods:\nI used to report to her once a month about any wrongdoings I'd seen or heard about.\nApollo:\nAnd that report session in her planner, the one from October 22nd, was a part of that?\nWoods:\nYes. That's when I reported Hugh to Prof. Courte.\nAthena:\n(She snitched on her own friend?!)\nYour report on O'Conner (appears after \"Suspicions about O'Conner\")\nWoods:\nI had accidentally overheard Hugh talking. (Changed from [I had accidently [sic] overheard Hugh talking.] in the original release)\nApollo:\nWhat did you hear?\nWoods:\nHe was talking to someone on the phone. I think it was one of his parents.\nAthena:\nWhat were they talking about?\nWoods:\nSomething about having paid money for good test scores. I only overheard him talking, so I never did find out who the money was going to.\nAthena:\nWhat?! (That's bribery! Hugh was buying his way through school, and if that's the case... ...then that evidence that always seemed out of place might actually be about his secret!)\nPresent \"Hugh\" Scrap\nAthena:\nLeads to:\n\"We found this while we were investigating the stage. It's got Hugh's name on it.\"\nPresent anything else\nAthena:\nAthena:\nJunie, I was thinking that this might have something to do with the bribery...\nWoods:\nI-I'm not sure I see what you mean...\nAthena:\nOh, um, never mind then! (Besides, I know what this evidence is for...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Hugh was buying his way through school, and if that's the case...\"\nAthena:\nWe found this while we were investigating the stage. It's got Hugh's name on it. I didn't know what the number meant at the time, but now that I'm hearing about bribes...\nApollo:\n...it must mean that a bribe of 120 grand was to be paid in October.\nAthena:\nWhat's more, take a look at this mark. The same mark is on the pages of Prof. Courte's planner.\nApollo:\nHey, you're right!\nWoods:\nW-Wait... But would Prof. Courte have that kind of information in her planner? You don't really think the person who was taking the bribe money was--\nAthena:\nIt's just a possibility at this point, but it may indeed have been Prof. Courte.\nWoods:\nB-B-But...!\nMeans:\nTh-That is impossible! She'd be the last person I'd ever suspect of accepting bribes!\nAthena:\nLike I said, it's just a possibility. (But a rather good one. Maybe their private talk had to do with the possibility of the bribery being exposed. And what started out as a little argument soon got out of hand.)\nApollo:\nIt's not your fault, Junie. Anybody would've suspected Hugh if they knew what you knew.\nWoods:\nNo, I don't believe that alone would've driven him to murder. There's another reason why I suspected Hugh.\nAthena:\n(You've got to be kidding me. There's another reason?)\nYour other reason (appears after \"Your report on O'Conner\")\nLeads to:\n\"I saw Hugh around 7:00 PM the day before the mock trial.\"\nPresent\nTape Recorder or Voiceprint Analysis\nWoods:\nOh, that. It's my voice, isn't it?\nAthena:\nApparently, it's a recording of you reading your script during the mock trial.\nWoods:\nBut earlier, when you said it was Prof. Courte's voice -- that was quite shocking. I never would've imagined it was the professor yelling at Hugh.\nAthena:\nOh, uh, that? That was just... you know...\nWoods:\nThat was such an inspired leap of logic. You really are something special, Thena.\nApollo:\nYeah, it takes a special kind of person to make a claim like that with a straight face.\nAthena:\n(It doesn't take my sensitive hearing to detect dripping sarcasm, genius.)\n\"Hugh\" Scrap\nAthena:\nJunie, can you tell us anything about this?\nWoods:\nI don't really know what to say. Um...\nAthena:\n(She went silent. Seems like she doesn't want to talk about it.)\nWoods:\nI saw Hugh around 7:00 PM the day before the mock trial.\nAthena:\n(Oh, so she's finally ready to talk about that.)\nWoods:\nWhen I... When I saw him... his... his....! *cough* *cough* Oh... Thena! *cough* *cough, cough*\nAthena:\nJ-Junie, are you all right? Just try to relax and tell me what happened.\nAnime cutscene\nWoods:\nI... I never wanted to see what I did... But I'll have to live with it, won't I...?! In that hallway... H-Hugh's hands... His hands were... dripping with blood...!\nWoods:\nHis hands were... dripping with blood...!\nAthena:\n(What?! But why?!)\nWoods:\nWhat am I... going to do? Deep down, I know Hugh can't be the killer! But my mind keeps telling me he is, no matter how hard I try to convince myself he isn't! Oh, what am I going to do?! Hugh... Hugh... He's...! I... I can't take this anymore, Thena!\nAthena:\n(So she hid the fact that she had seen Hugh and said she went home at six because... ...she wanted to avoid talking about what she saw...) Junie... It must've been terrible holding all of that in. But it's going to be okay. I'll get to the bottom of this. And that's my promise from one good friend to another. I'll be defending Juniper tomorrow. If that's okay with you, Prof. Means.\nMeans:\nMy main concern is whether you can defeat that prosecutor. ...But I won't try to stop you. I will be watching from the gallery. And shall look forward to seeing what sort of results your methods can produce. Good luck tomorrow. Now, if you would excuse me.\nWoods:\nThena... I'm sorry. I really mean it. I wish I had trusted you from the start. You have to uncover the truth tomorrow. I know you can do it.\nApollo:\nDon't worry. We already know that the prosecution's key piece of evidence is a fake. And thanks to you, we figured out the motive, too. Let's give this our best shot, Athena. Let tomorrow be the day Juniper walks free!\nAthena:\nI wouldn't have it any other way! (We should be all ready now. What could possibly go wrong this time?! Still... There's this strange, uneasy feeling I can't shake... I'd better be imagining it.)\nTo be continued\nNothing to examine during investigation\nAthena:\nThere's really not much of interest here. At least, that's what my intuition tells me.\nArea already examined\nAthena:\n(Hmm... We've pretty much finished searching around here, but... just one more look.)\n-- What O'Conner Saw --O'Conner:\nThe Lecture Hall was packed before the mock trial, but the rest of the campus was empty.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nHold it! Hold it! Hold it right there!\nO'Conner:\nWhat. I was just getting to the important part.\nBlackquill:\nEager to unsheathe your blade, Cykes-dono? Your heavy breath heaves to where I stand.\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nTsk, how rude! A human's breath doesn't travel anywhere near that far!\nO'Conner:\nSo, the only issue is distance? You're not denying that you're a heavy breather?\nAthena:\nArgh! I'm just saying that scientific studies have proven that it's not--\nApollo:\nHang in there, Athena. No matter how many insults they hurl, it won't affect the judge's opinion of you.\nAthena:\n(What about my own self-esteem?!)\nO'Conner:\nHeh. Let's get back to what happened before the mock trial.O'Conner:\nThat's when I saw Juniper dragging a large mat from behind the stage.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nOur client was simply putting the mat away. It had nothing to do with this case.\nBlackquill:\n\nBlackquill:\nThat is where you are wrong. There is but one mat in the entire school that could cushion a three-storey fall. Hence, the mat dragged by the accused was essential to moving the body.\nAthena:\nUgh! (If we win this one, I promise to donate another thick mat to the academy.)\nO'Conner:\nNow, show me how to show you the truth. You'll have my full cooperation.O'Conner:\nI was watching her from a vantage point between the stage and the maintenance area.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nMr. O'Conner, are you positive you were standing exactly where you said?\nO'Conner:\nI was between the stage and maintenance area, and she was behind the backdrop.\nAthena:\n(Hmm, he's sticking to his guns. The issue here is where Hugh was standing when he says he saw Junie. But nothing I say will mean anything without evidence. Time to dig a little deeper...)\nO'Conner:\nOh, and before you ask, I had my glasses on. Therefore, I'm positive it was Juniper. That is not an issue.Present Stage Set Up Photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nLeads to:\n\"So, you saw the back of the stage from the between the stage and the maintenance area?\"O'Conner:\nShe was heading towards me, so I assume she was on her way to the maintenance area.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nYou shouldn't assume anything! It only shows that you're NOT positive!\nBlackquill:\n\nBlackquill:\nSuch wild momentum. Perhaps you were a raging bull in your past life.\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nTsk! Don't compare me to some stupid farm animal!\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Hoy, Justice-dono!\nApollo:\nOur assertion is Juniper was simply putting the mat away. In that case, where would she be taking it?\nAthena:\nOh, umm... to the storehouse... over in the maintenance area...\nBlackquill:\nPrecisely. Therefore, there is naught wrong with witness's judgment in this matter. It is your wild charges that are the issue here. But I cannot help it if you keep seeing red.\nApollo:\nHe's going to get a face full of Justice, Apollo-style, if he keeps that up.\nO'Conner:\nHeh... Anyway, I saw her heading towards me...O'Conner:\nBut I didn't have time to stand around and see what she did after that.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nThen it's entirely possible someone else moved the body, correct?\nBlackquill:\n\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Are you mad or merely delusional? Everyone was in the Lecture Hall before the mock trial. The rest of the campus was empty. Ergo, the only probable suspects were the three trial participants.\nAthena:\nI know. Thank you for stating the obvious. (I also know that you, Hugh O'Conner, were one of the participants.)Apollo:\nMr. Confidence sure goes all out when he tells the \"truth.\"Athena:\nWell, I don't think he meant for any of that to be misleading, but it doesn't make it factual.Apollo:\nCareful now, Athena. A genius like Hugh could be leading you right into a trap.Athena:\n(I'd be surprised if he wasn't. But all I can do is charge forward with both eyes opened!)Athena:\nSo, you saw the back of the stage from the between the stage and the maintenance area? Well, let's take a look at this photo taken by Ms. Scuttlebutt, shall we? This photo shows the students setting up the stage the day before the mock trial. Do you see the big construction screen to the right of the stage in the background here?Judge:\nWhy, yes. In fact, there were a bunch of those next to my house until a few days ago, too. It was so noisy behind there, but I couldn't take a peek. Oh, how it piqued my interest!Athena:\nExactly, Your Honor. You cannot see past such screens. That is their purpose. Now, let's see... How exactly is that screen positioned again...? Ah hah! Since it was to the right of the stage, it should be right here. And from this vantage point... ...the witness claims to have seen our client behind the stage backdrop.Judge:\nOh, my! But the screen would've been completely in the way!Athena:\nThat's right. Therefore, the witness couldn't have possibly seen our client from this point!O'Conner:\nHrrrgh! ...Youch!Judge:\nOrder! Order!!! Mr. O'Conner! Have you been lying to this court?!O'Conner:\nThe screen... Right... It must have slipped my mind.Athena:\nWhat?! Are you telling me you, Mr. Genius, forgot something as literally big as that?!O'Conner:\nThere are two kinds of memory lapses: the normal kind you mouth-breathers have... ...and the genius-level lapses of memory that people like me have.Athena:\n(Why don't you just admit that it was a normal, everyday brain fart already?!)Judge:\nWill the witness now please restate what he remembers minus the lapses of memory?O'Conner:\nHeh, that's easy. I was on the other side of the screen. In other words, I witnessed Juniper from the stage side of the screen.Athena:Athena:\nYou are testifying that our client was behind the stage. But need I remind this court, the back of the stage is not visible from the front. To actually see our client behind the stage from the stage side of the screen... ...the witness himself would also have to be in the same area behind the stage! But in that case, our client would have definitely seen Mr. O'Conner!O'Conner:\nHrrrrrrgh! ...Youch!Apollo:\nNice one, Athena! Keep it up!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nAll right, Golden Boy, is this not your chance? Telling the truth will be like a weight lifted from your chest.Athena:\nThe truth? What truth?Blackquill:\nThe fact that Golden Boy here was where he initially stated. That is to say, he was between the maintenance area and the stage.Athena:Athena:\nBut then the screen would've blocked his view of--Blackquill:Blackquill:\nOn the ground, yes, his view would have been blocked, indeed. But consider how smoke always wants to rise up high.Apollo:\nA-Athena, look at the photo again! Do you think...?!Athena:\nSomething on the other side of the screen... Something high enough to see the stage... No way! This crane right here? But I don't remember seeing a crane there on the day of the mock trial.Apollo:\nMe neither, but it's probably safe to assume it was moved before you found the body.O'Conner:O'Conner:\nThat's far enough, Prosecutor Blackquill! Remember, you promised!Blackquill:\n...Hmph. I recall making no such promise. It was you who came blubbering to me about keeping quiet in exchange for information.O'Conner:\nArgh!Athena:\nWhat's this about a promise? Is this about whatever Blackquill is using against him?Apollo:\nAnd what's it got to go with going into the crane?Blackquill:\nGolden Boy did not go up in that crane for fun. ...He was working part time as a crane operator within school grounds.Judge:\nWhat? Do you mean to tell me a high school student was operating a crane?!O'Conner:O'Conner:\nThe witness... er... I mean, I object to the prosecutor's last statement! There's no proof I ever operated that crane!Athena:Athena:\nActually... there just might be something that proves you did.O'Conner:\nWhat?!Athena:\nIf this whole part time job thing is true, I doubt it would be limited to a single day. You were probably working at the same site the previous day, too.Apollo:\nIs this what you're thinking of, Athena?Athena:\nYep. As the court can see, this photo captured the crane's operator. And if you look carefully, he bears a definite resemblance to Mr. O'Conner.O'Conner:\nAre you serious?! This is ridiculous!Blackquill:\nHow very interesting. Let's ascertain whether this is as ridiculous as the witness maintains.Athena:\nThe defense agrees with the prosecution. Let's bring the facts to light.Judge:\nHmm... That's all very well and good, but just how do you propose to do that?Athena:\n(The person in this photo has one really distinguishing feature. I'm not a hundred percent sure, but it's at least worth a try!) We can clearly identify the person in this photo as the witness by examining...His fingerprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\nWe should check for Mr. O'Conner's fingerprints on and around the crane!\nO'Conner:\nOf course you'd find my fingerprints there. I was watching Juniper from there. ...And besides, what do fingerprints have to do with the person in the photo?\nAthena:\nYes, what DO they have to do with that person?\nJudge:\nThe court would like to remind Ms. Cykes that it is her job to answer such questions!\nAthena:\nAaaaah! (If I could match a feature from the person in this picture to one of Hugh's features... I'd prove that the two are one and the same!)\nLeads back to:\n\"We can clearly identify the person in this photo as the witness by examining...\"His neck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The figure in this photo is wearing a very unique object around his neck.\"His hobby\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\nI have a question for the witness. What is your hobby?\nO'Conner:\nHeh. My hobby? If I had to say, it would be... ...scrapbooking tests on which I scored at least one hundred, which is all of them, actually. (Changed from [...scrapbooking tests on which I scored at least 100, which is all of them, actually.] in the original release) I use an iron to perfectly flatten each one before it goes in.\nAthena:\nJust as I thought. Mr. O'Conner is obsessed with his own genius. It's no surprise, then, that he has one or two repugnant hobbies like that.\nBlackquill:\n\nBlackquill:\n...Hmph. It may be true, but what relation does it bear to the case at hand?\nAthena:\nNone... None at all, does it?\nJudge:\nNo it doesn't, but apparently, you have an interest in pain!\nAthena:\nYikes! (I'd better think more carefully before people start to think the worst of me...)\nLeads back to:\n\"We can clearly identify the person in this photo as the witness by examining...\"Athena:\nThe figure in this photo is wearing a very unique object around his neck.Judge:\nWhy, yes. You can see it right there. But then, are you saying you mean to...Athena:\nMr. O'Conner's neck is almost entirely concealed by his tall collar... ...but that's exactly why I believe this warrants further examination!O'Conner:\nNo! Not a chance! That would be a blatant violation of my privacy!Blackquill:\nHmph. You are a disgrace of a man. Now start unbuttoning that collar before I hack it off!Athena:\nYeah! What's the big deal? Now, let's see your neck!O'Conner:\n......... Guess I have no choice.Blackquill:\n.........Hmph.Judge:\nHm? ...Oh, my!Athena:\nSo, where did you buy that neckband, if I might ask?O'Conner:\nI didn't buy it. It's handmade, and there's only one like it in the world.Athena:\nWell, it sure looks like the neckband in the photo. Should we have the photo analyzed?O'Conner:\nHeh. You are one irritating lady. ...Fine. I admit it. I work a part-time construction job. It has nothing to do with our school. Operating heavy equipment's no big deal for a guy who can parallel park one-handed. But I never expected one of my jobs would take me to my own school.Judge:\nBut when you factor in all of the required tests and apprenticeship period... ...wouldn't you have to be at least twenty to have a license for operating a crane?O'Conner:\nOh, um... about that... You see, I'm a genius, so, you know...Blackquill:Blackquill:\nLet us dispense with this inane charade, Golden Boy.O'Conner:O'Conner:\nNo, Prosecutor Blackquill! Please, don't! (Changed from [No, Prosecutor Blackquill! Please, don'! [sic]] in the original release)Blackquill:\nHigh school seniors are nineteen at most, thus, they fail to complete the requirements. But that does not apply to you, does it, Mr. O'Conner?Athena:\nWhy doesn't it apply? He's a senior, so he's around that age, right?O'Conner:\nNo, don't! Please!Blackquill:\nActually, Golden Boy here is twenty-five. He took a seven-year break from school.Athena:\n............Wait. Come again?Blackquill:\nTake a gander at the official school enrollment documentation. 'Tis all right there.O'Conner:\nArrrrrrrrrgh! ...Youch!Apollo:\nT-T-Twenty-five? You mean he's older than me?!Judge:\nA twenty-five-year-old high school student?!O'Conner:O'Conner:\nHeh. A seven-year break... Seven years... I've just one thing to say. There are two kinds of seven-year breaks. The ordinary kind you mouth-breathers take... ...and the genius kind people like me take.Athena:Athena:\nBut a genius would quickly become a chore for a seven-year-break!Apollo:\nI think you have that backwards, Athena...O'Conner:\nHeh. Even geniuses make mistakes. I just happened to make mine only seven years in a row.Athena:\n(Only Hugh could get away with using \"only\" like that.)Blackquill:\nEnough of this jibber-jabber. Suffice to say, the witness was up in the crane when he saw the accused dragging the mat. The accused readied all she needed to move the body immediately prior to doing so. That much is clear. I see no need to deliberate the matter further.Judge:\nHmm... Considering that the body was moved in the same manner as in the script... ...I find Prosecutor Blackquill's claim to be quite persuasive. Does the defense care to dissuade me?Athena:\nUgh! As long as a mat was used to move the body, Junie's going to be under suspicion...!Apollo:\n...Athena. I just thought of something. What was Hugh doing in the crane right before the mock trial? He couldn't have been on the job at the time. I mean, he was waiting for the trial to start.Athena:\nYeah, why was he in the crane? Wait, you don't think...?! Your Honor!Judge:\nYes, Ms. Cykes?Athena:\nI've got it! I've got an amazing idea that will turn the prosecution's claim on its head! (A little conjecture has never stopped us before!)Blackquill:\nInteresting...Athena:\nMr. O'Conner, you were using the crane to...Move the screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\nThe screen was in your way, so you wanted to move it!\nBlackquill:\nThen why, pray tell, is it still in the exact same spot it always was?\nAthena:\nThat's easy. The witness changed his mind.\nJudge:\nThis court is close to changing its mind about the defense.\nAthena:\nNoooooo! Ugh. ...Another chance at that one, please!\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. O'Conner, you were using the crane to...\"Move yourself\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\nMr. O'Conner, you were using the crane to commute to school!\nO'Conner:\nHeh. That would be a feat, considering we aren't even allowed to commute by bicycle.\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nMaybe they made a special exception just for you!\nJudge:\nOh, my! W-Would they really do such a thing?!\nAthena:\n...Probably not.\nJudge:\nOh, that's too bad. And too bad for you, too, as I must give you a penalty. No exceptions!\nAthena:\nYiiikes! (But commuting by crane sounds kinda fun!) P-Please, let me give that another try!\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. O'Conner, you were using the crane to...\"Move the body\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The body was just like it was in the script, so it must've been moved like in the script, too.\"Athena:\nThe body was just like it was in the script, so it must've been moved like in the script, too. At least, that's what the prosecution believes. ...How simplistic, even foolish.Blackquill:\n.........Apollo:\nThose are pretty strong words, Athena. You sure about this?Athena:\nThe witness is a licensed crane operator, so he could have used it to move the body!Blackquill:Blackquill:\n...Hmph. Well, Golden Boy? Care to chime in? I intend to say no more on the matter, save that this does not bode well for you.Athena:\n(Wait, he's on my side this time? Or is this another trap?)O'Conner:\nHeh. Watch this! I can use a bow and arrow one handed.Athena:\n(Wow, that's a crazy level of dexterity.)O'Conner:\nI can even drive a crane with one hand. That's easy. But operating the crane itself is so complex, it requires both hands. Now, I would have the court look at this.Athena:\nOh... Please tell me that's a ketchup stain.O'Conner:\nYou wish. My hand was injured and required surgery. That's the reason I kept my hand in my pocket all this time.Blackquill:\nI have already verified this with the hospital of treatment. Quite a nasty wound, they say.Athena:\nS-So, how did you hurt it?O'Conner:\nI see no need to discuss that. It has no relevance to this case.Blackquill:\nTwo hands are required to operate complex machinery such as a crane. Ergo, on the day of the mock trial, the witness was incapable of moving the body by crane!Athena:\nN-Now I'm the fool?!O'Conner:\nI'd planned on moving the crane the night before the mock trial, but then I got injured. Wanting to keep my part-time job a secret, I had to do it just before the mock trial instead.Athena:\n(Arrrgh! And here I thought this was the big break we've been waiting for!)Blackquill:\nNow that the defense's sophistry is laid bare, I would have the court recall my claim.Judge:\nThe body was dropped out of a third-floor window to a mat near the maintenance area. Then, a ball cart was used to move it to the stage. See? I've been paying attention!Blackquill:\nWell done, Your Baldness. Now consider this! The accused was sighted dragging that mat. Ergo, it was she who moved the body!Apollo:\nWell, I think you were on the right track, Athena.Athena:\nYou do?Apollo:\nYeah, Juniper remains the prime suspect if we assume the body was moved as per her script. So, as the defense, you have to figure out how else the body could've been moved.Athena:\nB-But... (Oh, is he telling me to think of another way besides the crane?)Judge:\nMs. Cykes. If you have a counterargument, this court would love to hear it. And if--Blackquill:\nIf you do not, it is time for the verdict. Isn't that correct, Your Baldness?Athena:Athena:\nNo, not yet! All I have to do is show that the body wasn't moved like it was in the script, right?Judge:\nWell, that WOULD show that the mat had nothing to do with this case.Blackquill:\nThere is a sword of great renown that cuts down sophistic lawyers. Its name is Evidence.Athena:\nTsk, you don't scare me! (Force a smile, Athena! You can do it!)Apollo:\nWhat's wrong with your face, Athena? It's a weird mix of terror and creepy grin. Just focus on how the body could've been moved without it being dropped.Athena:\n(How could anyone lower it without just dropping it? It's not like it could fly... ...Or maybe it could. After all, there IS a way to zip between the art room and the stage! Someone could've easily used that thing!)Judge:\nHm? ...Oh, yes, of course! Ms. Cykes, the court would like to see what you have for us.Athena:\n(All I have to do is show the tiniest shred of a possibility.) The mat and ball cart weren't used to move the body! This is what was used!Present School Banner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The key here is the thing that ties the art room and the stage together.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nBy using this just right, the body could've been moved without the mat!\nJudge:\nReally? I would love to hear how that would be possible.\nAthena:\nYeah, I'd love to hear that, too!\nJudge:\nMs. Cykes, that would be your job, in case you've forgotten!\nAthena:\nOh, right! (I know there's something that connects the art room and stage! I just have to show it!)\nLeads back to:\n\"The mat and ball cart weren't used to move the body! This is what was used!\"Athena:\nThe key here is the thing that ties the art room and the stage together.Blackquill:\nMight I propose an idea? It might do you well to tie your lips together, lest you further expose your ignorance.Athena:\nThis isn't exactly the time for black comedy, Prosecutor Blackquill... Anyway! The court will recall the wire on which the school banner was hung. That wire was strung between the art room and the stage... ...which allowed students to run or reel in the school banner from the art room. The body could've easily been lowered down to the stage via this wire!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nSpare me your armchair theories. This wasn't some kind of high-wire act. The body surely would have fallen, yet there are no signs of blunt force trauma!Athena:Athena:\nOh, you surprise me, Prosecutor Blackquill. You didn't actually think I failed to account for that?Apollo:\nI'm sure that's exactly what he thought.Athena:\nWhen we investigated the stage yesterday... ...the bottom part of the school banner had been tied into a pouch-like shape. And pouches are useful for carrying things. What do you think this one could've carried?! (Changed from [And pouches are useful for carrying things. What do think [sic] this one could have carried?!] in the original release)Judge:\nW-Well, go on. Please explain!Athena:\nThe body was bundled into the pouch-like section of the banner and sent down the wire. The body would've been down on that stage in a flash! And there'd be no need for a mat!Judge:\nHmm... I've heard the phrase \"carrying the banner,\" but the banner doing the carrying?Blackquill:Blackquill:\n...Hmph. I've no patience for you and your cheap parlor tricks. Your claim is as shaky as a corpse performing that absurd high-wire act.Athena:\nIf you have an actual objection, then just come out and say it!Blackquill:\nI trust you recall the bloodstains left on the art room pottery. If the wire had been used to move the body... ...it would have to be via the window above the quad -- the one with the winch. However, the bloodstained pottery was next to the window above the maintenance area. Ergo, the wire and banner had naught at all to do with this case.Athena:\nOh, um, ha ha. The bloodstained pottery... I remember that.Apollo:\nThis doesn't look good. We'll be back to the mat theory if you don't do something.Judge:\nWell, Ms. Cykes? I hope you have something better this time than a circus act.Athena:\n(If my wire theory is true, then that blood on the pottery must not have been...)The victim's blood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Maybe it's not the victim's blood.\"Blood at all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\nAt first we thought it was red glaze, but it turned out to be blood. But what if we go back to the time when it was just red glaze by all accounts?\nBlackquill:\n\nBlackquill:\nBut the police have clearly identified it as blood.\nJudge:\nYou can't change fact to fiction, Ms. Cykes, let alone travel back in time.\nAthena:\nWhoops...\nJudge:\nNow, then, Ms. Cykes. Please share your thoughts on what this blood really is.\nLeads back to:\n\"If my wire theory is true, then that blood on the pottery must not have been...\"Athena:\nMaybe it's not the victim's blood. Did the police check to see from whom the blood on the pottery came from?Blackquill:\nShame on you, Cykes-dono. Have a little more respect for the constabulary. ...Fool Bright.Apollo:\nLooks like they didn't check it.Athena:\nAh, don't let it get you down, Prosecutor Blackquill! Everyone makes mistakes.Blackquill:\nSpare me your cheek. We will know not either way till the tests are run.Athena:\n(True, but in the meantime, I'm going to press my claim as far as I can!)Blackquill:\nYour Baldness. I demand that the blood on the pottery be analyzed this instant!Judge:\nOf course. It shouldn't take long to get the results back.Judge:\nOh, my. That was quick.Apollo:\nWe're history if it turns out to be the victim's blood.Athena:\n(Please, please let it be someone else's.)Blackquill:\n............Nngh. It seems the blood was not from the victim.Judge:\nWh-What?!Blackquill:\nFurthermore, a comparison with other parties involved with this case reveals... ...that the blood belongs to one Hugh O'Conner.Athena:\n(Score!)O'Conner:\n.........Woods:\n*cough*... *cough, cough*Athena:\nDon't worry, Junie. Just try to relax.Woods:\nH-Hugh's hands... His hands were... dripping with blood...!Athena:\nYour Honor, as we saw earlier, the witness's left hand had suffered a serious injury. He sustained the wound in a struggle with the victim, and his blood got on the pottery. (Then, Junie saw his bloodstained hands as they passed each other in the first floor hall.) It's the only explanation that covers everything!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nThere is but one way now to turn aside her blade. But do not cast the blame on me. Your grudge is with Cykes-dono, for it is she who forces me to expose your secret.O'Conner:\nH-H-Heh. F-Fine, whatever.Athena:\n(Wow, how much dirt does he have on Hugh?)Blackquill:\nThe court will observe this odd-looking envelope. It was inside this that Myriam Scuttlebutt's script was found.Athena:\nMs. Scuttlebutt's...? But didn't the prosecution already claim that... ...this envelope is the one that contained her script?Blackquill:\nCircumstances have changed. You see, Golden Boy had hidden this from us all.Judge:\nLet's see here... My word! Talk about the world's most painful paper cut!Blackquill:\nIndeed. You can clearly see that if this envelope is not opened correctly... ...a powerful spring-loaded blade will shoot forth, leaving a horrible gash upon the hand. The only one who had been told of the correct way to open it was Constance Courte.Scuttlebutt:\nSss, sss, sss. You really want to see my script that bad? Well, you better watch out. Read it without my permission and you'll wish you hadn't!Athena:\n(Yikes... Myriam wasn't kidding when she said that!)Blackquill:\nThe blood on the blade is the witness's. Our genius here tried to sneak a peek at the wrong script and paid for his foolishness!Athena:\nOuuuuuuuch! (This guy's the worst genius I've EVER seen!)Apollo:\nDon't worry, Athena. The wound isn't that deep. We've still got the wire theory.Athena:\nY-Yeah... I've got it! Since the blood by the window overlooking the maintenance area isn't the victim's... ...there's no longer any basis for denying the body was moved using the wire and banner. Therefore, the defense once again asserts just that!O'Conner:O'Conner:\nYou call yourself a lawyer? Heh. Don't you see the glaring contradiction in your thinking?Athena:\nHuh?Judge:\nThe court would like to remind the witness that his role is not to point out--O'Conner:\nHeh. And you... How can you adhere to such outdated beliefs. But whatever. It seems you've forgotten the two statues that were onstage directly below the wire. A body sent sliding down that wire would've crashed into them. Care to explain that away?Judge:\nWhy, I believe he's right. The statues and the wire are extremely close together.Athena:\n(Ugh... So the body would've collided with the statues? Hmm... What if they did collide? Wait, that's it!) Speaking of those statues, we still don't know how they were broken. But if we assume the body crashed into them... ...that would also explain that loud sound we heard while we were in the waiting room.Judge:\nOh, now that you mention it... ...you and Mr. Wright went out to the stage after you heard that sound, correct?Blackquill:Blackquill:\nInteresting... How very interesting. But may I ask just one question? When was it that you heard said sound?Athena:\nIt was a little after the mock trial had started. Mr. Wright and I were practically bored to tears there in the waiting room, when-- Ah!Blackquill:\nPrecisely. If that sound you heard did happen while the body was being moved... ...that would place it during the mock trial!Athena:\n(Oof. Which means the body wouldn't have been there before the mock trial started.)O'Conner:\nYou see, right before the mock trial started... I saw the body.Athena:\n(He said he saw the body before the mock trial. If so... ...then my claim that the body was moved during the mock trial doesn't hold water! Stupid contradiction! It's going to get me and our case killed!)Judge:\nThe focus was on just three suspects because the body was moved before the mock trial. That has been the major premise thus far. Your assertion, therefore, contradicts the very foundation of this case.Blackquill:Blackquill:\nBoth sides still lack incontrovertible evidence. So, should we not also treat Golden Boy's testimony with some level of suspicion?Judge:\nHmm... Good point.O'Conner:\nAck!Athena:\nP-Prosecutor Blackquill... is on our side! I bet he's figured out the truth behind this case!Apollo:\nWell, great, as long as he's not up to something else.Athena:\n(If the statues really were broken when the body hit them... ...then Hugh's statement about seeing the body before the mock trial is a big fat lie!) Okay, Mr. O'Conner! Let's get to the bottom of this contradiction about when you saw the body. Look me straight in the eyes and repeat your statement to me!O'Conner:\nArgh! L-Like I said before, uh... before the mock trial, the body was, you know...Blackquill:\nI shall only say this once, Golden Boy. You had best tell the truth, and do it now. That is, if your head wish to enjoy the continued companionship of your body.O'Conner:\nYikes!Blackquill:\nNow, out with it! Did you truly witness the body?!Athena:\nOr were you just lying about it?! Well, which is it?!O'Conner:\n............I...Blackquill:\nYou what?Athena:\nI...!O'Conner:\nI............ I never saw the body.Athena:\n!Judge:\nAre you sure about that? Lie to this court again and I'll charge you with perjury.O'Conner:\nThere was no body on that stage! I've been lying about that this whole time! I'm... I'm sorry.Athena:\n(Yes! We've exposed Hugh's big lie for what it is! But why would he lie about this to begin with?)Judge:\nOrder! The base premise that the body was moved before the mock trial has been overturned. I imagine that this has an impact on both the defense and the prosecution's case.Athena:\nWell, first I'd like to thank the prosecutor. This brings us one step closer to the truth. Now, at least we know the body was moved using the wire and school banner.Blackquill:\n...Indeed. That much I shall concede, Cykes-dono. The body was moved as you stated, and in the midst of the mock trial.Judge:\nHmm... So both sides are satisfied then?Blackquill:\nHmph. If the body was moved before the mock trial, we have our three suspects... ...but if the move took place in the midst of the mock trial, it is an entirely different story.Athena:\nRight. All three suspects were in the mock trial. That gives them solid alibis.Blackquill:Blackquill:\n...Hmph. How simplistic. Did you forget about the student in charge of the audio? Amidst the mock trial, she was the one soul who could leave and reenter the Lecture Hall.Judge:\nWh-What's this?! Who is this person in charge of the audio?!Athena:\n(Oh, no! How could I forget! It was...!)Athena:\nHey! What's the deal here? Why's Junie so large in this shot?Newman:\nEh heh heh heh. Juniper was also in charge of the audio. When she wasn't in the trial, she was in the audio control room dealing with the music.Blackquill:\nIndeed. The one who could enter the art room amidst the mock trial to move the body... ...was none other than the accused, Juniper Woods, for she was in charge of the audio!Athena:\nEee... Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Judge:\nWhy, yes! I see! That DOES make perfect sense!Athena:\n(This can't be happening. Instead of exposing Hugh's crime, Junie's in even deeper. No matter how you slice it, we're cooked! And here I thought Prosecutor Blackquill was on our side, at least on this issue.)Apollo:\nThe Twisted Samurai strikes again.Athena:\nTsk, twisted?! It's more like dirty rotten!Blackquill:\nHmph. Your Baldness, it is time to put an end to this farce.Judge:\nHmm... The prosecution has presented a quite convincing case. But the defense has one last chance to voice any remaining objections. Well, Ms. Cykes?Athena:\nApollo! What are we going to do?! I've got nothing left! Nothing! Nada! Niente!Apollo:\nI've been trying to think of something, but I'm drawing a big blank, too!Athena:\n(Ugh... Poor Junie. Unless we figure out something, she'll be...) O-Objection... Objection... Umm... well... I object to...!???:O'Conner:\nHeh. Heh heh heh. Ha ha ha ha ha! Stop right there!All ears to me! It's time you heard about the rare genius of Hugh O'Conner!Listen and you will hear the secret behind my perfect crime!Athena:\nP-P-P-P...Apollo:\nPerfect...Judge:\nCriiiiiime?!Athena:\nWait, this is some serious déjà vu. Didn't we just go through something like this yesterday?Apollo:\nYes, yes we did... This had better not be another one of his enraging traps...O'Conner:\nThe murder, the moving of the body, the cover up! It all sprung from my brilliant mind! Well, go ahead, arrest me! The real killer is right before you!Judge:\nOrder, Order, I say! M-M-Mr. O'Conner! You already confessed yesterday, then earlier today recanted your confession!O'Conner:\nAs if you mouth-breathers could comprehend my genius! The end justifies the means! Now, bow down and kneel! Kneel before my great and maddening intellect.Blackquill:Blackquill:\nEnough! The only thing maddening is the ignominy you bare for all to see. For it is impossible for you to have been the perpetrator behind this crime.Athena:\nAh!Blackquill:\nThere is no perfect crime, only a perfect alibi, for you were at the mock trial. And it is silly that I must remind you of this, but you were a participant the entire time. There shall be no mercy if you persist in hindering this trial with your silly little act!Athena:\n(Hugh doesn't seem the least bit shaken by Blackquill's threat.)O'Conner:\nListen, Mr. Prosecutor. Calling that a perfect alibi is beyond contempt. Your Honor, I'd like to take this opportunity to offer further testimony. I will now demonstrate the very moment of genius that transcended even perfection!Witness Testimony-- Hugh's Confession --O'Conner:\nYou won't believe this, but I used a body double!\nThat wasn't the real me at the mock trial!\nThat means I didn't almost lose! My body double almost did!\nI slipped out stealthily while my double took care of the trial.\nI had the run of the campus. In short, I'm the killer. Juniper's innocent!Judge:\nHmm... I have a question I was hoping the defense and prosecution might help answer. Is it just me or does the witness's testimony make no sense at all?Athena:\nNo, it's not just you, Your Honor. All I got from listening to that was a headache.Apollo:\nYeah, that was just plain weird, especially the whole thing about a body double.Judge:\nWell, I'm relieved it's not just me. ...And the prosecution?Blackquill:\nYour Baldness, summon an ambulance this instant. The witness is stark, raving mad. (Changed from [Your Baldness, summon an ambulance this instance. [sic] The witness is stark, raving mad.] in the original release)Judge:\nHmm... Yes, I think that would be for the best. Now, then, let's pretend that never happened and move on to my verdict--O'Conner:O'Conner:\nYou people don't believe me?!Athena:\nIt's not a matter of believing you. It's more along the lines of questioning your sanity.Apollo:\nYeah, the funny farm just called. They want their \"genius\" back.O'Conner:O'Conner:\nShut your pie holes! The intellect of a genius transcends even logic! Besides, don't you guys have that weird device for testimony like this?!Athena:Athena:\nWidget's not a weird device and I don't waste him on ridiculous testimonies!Apollo:\nEasy there, tiger. Think of it this way. We don't want a verdict to be passed just yet. So how about we give Widget a try?Athena:\nWell, this is against my better judgment, but I'd like to conduct a short therapy session.Judge:\nYour better judgment? I'm a judge, and it's far beyond mine, yet I find it hard to say no. Prosecutor Blackquill, I trust you have no objections? ...Um, Prosecutor Blackquill?Bailiff:The prosecutor said, \"Rubbish! We will be out on a stroll!\" then left with Detective Fulbright.Athena:\n(How does he get away with stuff like that?)Judge:\n...Then I'll interpret that as meaning he has no explicit objections. All right, Ms. Cykes, you may proceed with your therapy session.Apollo:\nI've seen my share of crazy trials, but this one takes the cake!O'Conner:\nYou won't believe this, but I used a body double!O'Conner:\nThat wasn't the real me at the mock trial!O'Conner:\nThat means I didn't almost lose! My body double did!O'Conner:\nI slipped out stealthily while my double took care of the trial.O'Conner:\nI had the run of the campus.O'Conner:\nIn short, I'm the killer.O'Conner:\nJuniper's innocent!Probe Woods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. O'Conner, yesterday you said that you didn't really care about Ms. Woods anymore.\"Athena:\nI don't get it. His confession is overflowing with happiness.Apollo:\nMaybe he enjoys thinking how us mouth-breathers can't comprehend his genius.Athena:\nBut this goes way beyond normal happiness. He seems to take an insane level of delight in his confession!Apollo:\nHmm, even a normal level of delight would be weird for a confession. Then again, he's not what I'd call normal.Athena:\n(Hugh... Why are you confessing? Who is this really for? I feel like that's the key to his out-of-control emotion!)Athena:\nMr. O'Conner, yesterday you said that you didn't really care about Ms. Woods anymore.O'Conner:\nI already told Juniper, so I might as well yell you. I don't really care about her anymore.Athena:\nWhat? Why?O'Conner:\nYeah, well, Juniper reported my secret to Prof. Courte.Athena:\n(His secret? ...Oh, the bribe.)O'Conner:\nShe wanted nothing to do with me because I had disappointed her. That's why I don't care about her anymore. I was never trying to protect her. My confession was always about one thing and one thing only: the truth!Athena:Athena:\nMr. O'Conner, you felt great happiness in the fact that you might help set Ms. Woods free. So much that it overshadowed all of your other emotions.O'Conner:\nWhat are you...Athena:\nI can hear it clearly now, Mr. O'Conner -- the discord you've been trying to suppress. People don't normally feel like you do when you confessed.Apollo:\nSo, Hugh really was trying to protect Juniper?Athena:\nYes, I'm sure of it. Hugh's feelings for her are the real deal.NOISE LEVEL90%Athena:\n(But that means his confession is...)???:\n...Finally figured out the obvious, have we?Judge:\nWhy, Prosecutor Blackquill, you're back.Blackquill:\nThe confession was naught but lies, save for the part about being in the mock trial. Can we all agree now that the killer is the one in charge of the audio, i.e. the accused?!Athena:\nGaaah! (Why couldn't you have taken a longer stroll?)O'Conner:\nN-No! You haven't unraveled the genius of my body double trick yet!Apollo:\nYou can't be serious. Do you really expect us to believe you had a body double?O'Conner:\nYes! Yes I do! But if you think I didn't, then prove it! Heh!Apollo:\nEither we quit here and Juniper is found guilty, or we play along with Hugh's delusion.Athena:\nLet's go with the least worse choice. But first, let me update his testimony.O'Conner:\nYou won't believe this, but I used a body double!O'Conner:\nThat wasn't the real me at the mock trial!O'Conner:\nThat means I didn't almost lose! My body double did!Pinpoint Happy marker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... \"I didn't almost lose,\" you say?

What a bunch of baloney.Athena:\nI know, but I can hear the noise. It means there's a contradictory emotion somewhere.Apollo:\nContradictory emotion? Everything he says is one big contradiction.Athena:\nRight, and that's why I can hear his inner voice loud and clear! If we just think about Hugh and his competitive nature... ...we should be able to figure out the root cause of his discord!Athena:\nHmm... \"I didn't almost lose,\" you say? Very odd... You exhibited happiness the entire time, except during this statement.O'Conner:\nArgh! You don't know when to give up! ...Wait, now that I think about it...Athena:\n(No, don't! Stop making stuff up!)O'Conner:\nWhen I left the Lecture Hall... ...it was during Prof. Means's pre-trial speech. That's when I moved the body. I then slipped back in just before the verdict.Athena:\nSo, you're saying you were there the moment your double was about to lose?O'Conner:\nYes, I was! Naturally, I wasn't happy when I saw that. In any case, I was at the far end of the Lecture Hall behind the screen. I figured no one would see me if I came and went through the doors there.Blackquill:Blackquill:\nCykes-dono. How much longer will you indulge him in this charade? While it's true that none in the audience might see him go through either of those doors... ...the faculty seats on the balconies are a different story, and have a splendid view!O'Conner:\n...Heh. I thought you could do better than that. The lawyer's bench is on the right side when facing the front of the hall. I used the door on the right side near the lawyer's bench. That means my movements were only visible to someone in the left balcony seat. But that seat was empty at the time, which is only natural. After all, it belonged to Prof. Courte, and as we all know, she was already dead by then.Athena:\n......... (That can't be right.

Was the seat Hugh pointed out really supposed to be empty?)\nLeads back to:\n\"An empty balcony seat on the left side contradicts this piece of evidence!\"Athena:\n(I've no idea where this contradiction is going. But I don't have any other moves at this point. Guess I'll just have to follow it and see where this takes me!) You said the left balcony seat was empty. But was it really?O'Conner:\nI saw it with my own eyes! It was definitely empty!Athena:\nBut what about this diagram? According to this, Prof. Means was supposed to be seated in the left balcony seat. But if you left the Lecture Hall during his pre-trial speech... ...he would've been standing there at his seat addressing the students and faculty!O'Conner:\nGah!

You do no one any favor by exposing the falsities of his confession.O'Conner:\nI've told plenty of lies so far, but this part is true, I tell you! There was nobody in the left balcony seat. You gotta believe me!Athena:\n(Hmm, it doesn't seem like he's lying this time.) Okay, Mr. O'Conner! Let's have you testify again, but this time, don't spare any details!O'Conner:\nYou got it! I'll repeat it as many times as you like! I mean, my ingenious escape act warrants repeating, considering I'm the real killer!Athena:\n(All I really care about is whether that seat was empty or not.)O'Conner:\nThe second floor was deserted!O'Conner:\nWhy won't you believe me?!

That's who you think was there when I passed through?\nAthena:\nYes, positive! ...Or at least I wish I was.\nJudge:\nIt appears to this court that the defense has a bad case of wishful thinking.\nAthena:\nEeeeeek! (Darn it! There's only one person who went between the Lecture Hall and audio control room!)\nLeads back to:\n\"And that someone who was in the audio control room was...\"Athena:\nI know you realized there was a problem with your statement as you were saying it. That's why you felt so uneasy. If the audio control room really was empty... ...that would mean Ms. Woods was roaming around the campus.O'Conner:\nAaaaaaaaagh!Athena:\nMr. O'Conner, if you really want to protect Ms. Woods, just tell the truth. If you believe in her, revealing the truth is the same as protecting her.O'Conner:\n...Juniper's innocent. That's the truth. But in this dark age of the law, the truth can be easily twisted to serve anyone's needs. When the end justifies the means, your only choice is to fight back with lies!Athena:\n(Hugh's heart won't hold out under this battle between truth and lies. Is there something I can do to make him recant his false testimony?)O'Conner:\nHeh heh heh. I fear nothing now that I have lost everything! Go ahead, Prosecutor Blackquill.

(I never learned about this in law school!)Apollo:\nCareful, Prosecutor... Remember that shocking experience you had last time!Blackquill:\n...Hmph. Very well, Golden Boy may live.. for now.Athena:\nEnough already, Mr. O'Conner. Ms. Woods would never want you to protect her this way. She values the friendship between the three of you more than anything!O'Conner:O'Conner:\nThat's where you're wrong. She doesn't feel anything for me now. Heh. But what does it matter anymore? I might as well tell you everything. This is, no doubt, news to you, but I am not and never was a genius.Athena:\nSorry, but I already knew.Apollo:\nMe, too.Judge:\nAnd don't forget me! ...Though, in all fairness, it was pretty obvious.Woman:I thought he was a genius at first, but...Man:The stuff he said was crazy.O'Conner:\nArrrrrgh! No need to rub it in! Just shut up and listen! It all started several days ago. I accidentally learned that my parents have been paying good money for my grades. (Changed from [I accidently [sic] learned that my parents have been paying good money for my grades.] in the original release)Judge:\nB-But that's...! That's bribery!Athena:\n(So the bribery wasn't Hugh's idea?)O'Conner:\nAll of my perfect scores were the product of cold hard cash, not genius. Even worse, when I confronted my parents about it over the phone... ...Juniper overheard me.Judge:\nOh, my... What a terrible misunderstanding.O'Conner:\nI've been living a lie! I don't know what else there is to say! I'm no genius. I'm completely worthless...A perfect zero.Athena:\nHugh...O'Conner:\nEven so, I still wanted to make it up to Juniper for disappointing her like that. That's why I wanted to clear her name by pinning the blame on me! I mean, she probably hates me now, so it'd be a relief for her to see me locked away.Apollo:\nIf you were trying to help her, then why did you testify against her?O'Conner:\nYou were the ones who told me to tell the truth yesterday! So, I thought if I did, it would help her.Athena:\n(He wasn't trying to provoke us?)Apollo:\nIt looks like we seriously misunderstood him, in more ways than one.Athena:\n(At the detention center yesterday, Junie was in tears when she opened up to me. But the truth is, the friendship between the three of them is still rock solid! If there were something that could help me prove that to Hugh...)O'Conner:\nHeh. We even have proof of our friendship.Newman:\nYeaaaaaah!!! As long as our friendship lasts! You can bet we'll be carrying them around!Athena:\n(I know! What about that proof of friendship they mentioned?! Hmm... I wonder where or what it is.)... I didn't buy it. It's handmade, and there's only one like it in the world.Athena:\n(Maybe it's... No, that's definitely it! That band around his neck!) Mr. O'Conner! That band around your neck! That's your proof of friendship, isn't it?O'Conner:\n!Judge:\nProof of friendship? Is that anything like a proof of purchase barcode?Athena:\nIn court, evidence is everything. That's why the three friends created friendship bands. It's the evidence that proves their friendship.Judge:\nHo ho. How very interesting... and chic!Athena:\nIf they have doubts about their friendship, they can look to the proof they have on hand. That's why Mr. O'Conner's hand always goes to his neck when he is pressured. It proves he still has feeling of friendship towards the other two.O'Conner:\nIt doesn't matter if I wear it if those two...Athena:Athena:\nBut they feel the same way, too. I know they wear their friendship bands somewhere. (Junie and Robin must both feel the same as Hugh. I just know it! Everything Hugh has said leads me to believe that.

The time for a verdict is nigh!Athena:Athena:\nPlease, wait!Blackquill:\nWhat sort of devilry are you up to now?Athena:\nWhat if our client wasn't the only one without an alibi? The trial would continue, right?Judge:\nW-Well, yes, I suppose it would. But after such a thorough investigation, does such a person really exist?Athena:\nYes, we've found someone. It may have seemed like a major roundabout... ...but Mr. O'Conner's testimony has cracked the case! (There's no more noise. Hugh is telling the truth now.

If that's really true, then Prof. Means has guilt written all over him!) Your Honor! The defense moves to call Prof. Aristotle Means to the stand!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nHmph. The seat was never empty. 'Twas but an oversight by our dullard of a witness. An inmate who was formally [sic] a surgeon once told me something.

If the speech was pre-recorded, the basis for suspecting our client would be shattered! Let's check with Prof. Means and see whether the empty seat was a witness oversight. A verdict without first looking into that would be inconceivable!Judge:\nThat's enough, both of you. ...Now, here's my opinion on the matter. While a surgeon overlooking critical symptoms is a problem... ...a witness's oversight, too, must not be overlooked. Thus, as to the matter of whether Prof. Means was or was not in his faculty seat... ...I believe we must ask the professor himself.Athena:\nI agree. Prof. Means should be here in the gallery today.Blackquill:\nHmph! Do as you please!Judge:\nWill you please state your name and occupation for the record?Means:\nCertainly. I am Aristotle Means. I teach the lawyer course at Themis Legal Academy. And let me add that while... ...I welcome any opportunity to assist with the trial, I don't care for this undue suspicion.Athena:\nDon't worry, Professor, we're just interested in the mock trial video right now. We just need to take another look at that speech you gave. Can we count on your cooperation in this?Means:\nVery well, if that's all you're interested in.

Now, it's true that this statue is pure white... ...but it broke before the mock trial began. The one you see here is its replacement.Judge:\nOh, well, that's a shame on every count!Athena:\nIronically, this golden statue sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the white one. Meaning the professor wouldn't have made a mistake in its color if he'd been present!Means:\nIt seems that I have caused some confusion, but it was merely an oversight on my part.Athena:Athena:\nThe statue was in the middle of the room. How could you not know what it looked like?!Means:\nWell, I was in a balcony seat. Furthermore, the statue had previously been white.Judge:\nHmm... I'm afraid this isn't sufficient evidence of the speech being pre-recorded.Blackquill:\nWe had our answer long ago. The accused was the only one to leave the Lecture Hall.Athena:\nNo, wait! (There's got to be something that can prove that the speech was pre-recorded!)Apollo:\nAccording to the mock trial video... ...the speech started here... ...and ended here. It was a little over ten minutes, but I doubt anyone wants to be tortured again.Athena:\n(It was only a little over ten minutes? It felt like it went on forever.) How'd you figure out how long it was?Apollo:\nEasy. There's a timestamp in the top right. All you have to do is... ...subtract the time the speech started from the time it ended.Athena:\n(The speech goes from 10:00-minute mark to 20:35. Wait a second... I could swear I've seen this same interval of time listed among the evidence... Maybe there's a way for me to use the speech time to show that it was prerecorded.)Present Voiceprint Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I would like the court to take a look at this.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nThe speech was pre-recorded!

I think.\nJudge:\nPerhaps this penalty will help you make your case with more conviction.\nAthena:\nAaaaaaagh! (Let's see... The speech took a total of ten minutes and thirty-five seconds. Hmm... 10:35... Where have I seen that number before?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Maybe there's a way for me to use the speech time to show that it was prerecorded.\"Athena:\nI would like the court to take a look at this.Judge:\nAnd this is...?Athena:\nThe voiceprint analysis that proves the voice on the tape recorder belongs to our client.Judge:\nYes, but didn't we just establish that the voice on the tape recorder was a fabrication?Athena:\nWe did, but what I'd like to focus on is the noise that is also there.Blackquill:\nNoise?Athena:\nYes. The defense believes it resulted when the tape's previous recording was erased.Blackquill:\nHmph. And what do you hope to prove by that?Athena:\nThe length of the noise is what's important. It's ten minutes and thirty-five seconds in all. And what did the timestamp read at the moment Prof. Means began his speech?Judge:\nHmm... That would be exactly 10:00.Athena:\nNow, let's fast forward this long-winded exercise in boredom to the end. Okay, stop. The video timestamp now reads 20:35. Based on this, we know the time it took for the speech alone.Judge:\nRight, subtract ten minutes and you get 10:35. Hm? Ten minutes and thirty-five seconds?Athena:\nRight, ten minutes and thirty-five seconds -- the same as the noise on the tape recording. I assume you all understand what this means. Prof. Means's pre-recorded speech had been where the noise is now!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nYou seem rather confident considering this is a mere happenstance match of numbers.Athena:Athena:\nBut is it really just numbers?Klavier:\nThe lab is continuing their study of the tape. So far, they've found signs of overdubbing. But it's going to take a bit longer to recover the audio that was erased.Athena:\nThe police are analyzing the noise as we speak. It won't be long until we know what was originally there. (Now I'm sure of it. The professor was trying to create an alibi with the recording... ...by pinning the crime on Junie. Well, he's not gonna get away with it! Not on my watch!)Means:\n...Ms. Cykes. I believe you are well aware of my methodology. Even if Juniper were the perpetrator, I would vigorously defend her as per my word. And to that purpose, I offered to be her lawyer. Alas, look what's happened.Athena:\nAll I've stated are obvious deductions derived from evidence and testimony.Means:\nTruth be told, I had no intention of testifying. I had been keeping quiet for Juniper's sake. But now that you cast this blame upon me, I have no choice but to reveal the truth...Athena:\n(Uh-oh! This doesn't sound good...)Means:\nI will now reveal the truth behind why I had to pre-record my speech before the mock trial. I, Prof. Means, always say what I mean and mean what I say by all means!Witness Testimony-- Prof. Means's Testimony --Means:\nThe defendant came to me with what she said was very important, and by necessity, secret.\nShe asked me to pre-record my speech and come to the audio room during the mock trial.\nJuniper confessed to the murder and asked that I get her declared innocent in court.\nShe also said I'd become an accomplice after losing my alibi due to the pre-recording.\nBut when I said I would protect Juniper, I meant it because it's the humane thing to do.Judge:\nOh, my! So, you're saying the defendant threatened you?!Apollo:\nThis has to be a lie... I mean, everything about it lines up too perfectly to be true.Means:\nOn this most consequential of occasions, let me be completely frank with you. Juniper has truly taken to heart my teaching that states the end justifies the means.Athena:\nI don't believe you!Means:\nWhen she asked me to defend her, she said I must also prove her two friends innocent.Judge:\nHer two friends? The witnesses?Means:\nCorrect. Hugh O'Conner and Robin Newman. I was to ensure all three walked free. All three were to achieve their dream. That was the result Juniper was seeking. And she was even willing to threaten me, her own professor, to that end.Blackquill:\n...Hmph. You, no doubt, had high praise for her ruthless tactics.Means:\nYes, well, that is why I vowed to vigorously defend her despite her threatening me. There was a time when lawyers merely sought the truth if they wished for victory in court... ...but, alas, those days are over. Now, in the defense of justice, order and all that is good, the end justifies the means.Athena:\n(I am so sick of hearing that phrase!)Means:\nThough it truly grieves me so, I must tell you this. Forsake the truth if it's victory you seek. Steel yourself for this new courtroom reality.Athena:\n(That does it! He's gonna regret dragging those dismal, depressing ideas in here! Since he's already surrendered to the dark age of the law, it's up to me to fight it!)Blackquill:\nWhy so silent, Cykes-dono? Something the matter?Athena:\nThis... This is a court of law. It's no place for longwinded talks about idealistic principles. That's why I'm going to let the evidence do the talking.Means:\n...Let's not get carried away, now, Ms. Cykes. It will not do to have you attempting to discredit my doctrine. Do not force me to rectify this situation.Athena:\nNo, go ahead and rectify it! ...Only if I lose and you win, that is!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Prof. Means's Testimony --Means:\nThe defendant came to me with what she said was very important, and by necessity, secret.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nI doubt our client would've come to you with something like that.\nMeans:\nYou have a point there. If only Prof. Courte had been alive, I suspect Juniper would have gone to her instead.\nAthena:\nSo, our client came to talk to you after Prof. Courte was dead?\nMeans:\nLet's go through this step by step, shall we? First, Juniper came to me that day.Means:\nShe asked me to pre-record my speech and come to the audio room during the mock trial.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nAre you suggesting it was our client who told you to fake an alibi?\nMeans:\nYou have every reason to be surprised. I, too, was shocked when she told me that. Simply put, Juniper has a secret that she wished to protect that badly.\nAthena:\n(Is he kidding me?! That lie couldn't be further from the truth! The problem is, how am I going to expose it?)\nMeans:\nIt was an earnest request from an outstanding student. How could I possibly have refused?Means:\nJuniper confessed to the murder and asked that I get her declared innocent in court.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nDid you consider that a threat?\nMeans:\nYes. But it's now you to whom she has passed her demands on to. Ms. Cykes, you must realize that you, too, are being used by Juniper.\nAthena:\nWhat?!\nMeans:\nYour Honor, I ask that you, too, do not let her feigned weakness and innocence fool you. Juniper Woods is quite clever and extremely tough. And, perhaps most important of all, she is a fervent follower of my teachings.\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nYour Honor! The witness's testimony is nothing but an attack on our client's character!\nJudge:\nVery well, objection sustained.\nMeans:\n...So be it. Nevertheless, the fact that she threatened me is immutable.Means:\nShe also said I'd become an accomplice after losing my alibi due to the pre-recording.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nHow could you overlook such a threat? As a teacher, it's your duty to discipline students!\nMeans:\nYes, well, perhaps I do have some serious reflection to do on this matter. I suppose it was just wishful thinking on my part. I wanted to believe that... ...Juniper hadn't actually committed murder and that she hadn't meant to threaten me.\nJudge:\nR-Really?! Please do explain!\nMeans:\nLong had I waited for a student who would embody my teachings.\nJudge:\nD-Does the witness realize what he is saying?!\nMeans:\nSurely you must see the true meaning in my words. I am merely staying true to what I teach. And my methods are but a reflection of the times.\nApollo:\nOh, wow, his way of thinking is really warped, but I haven't heard any inconsistencies yet.\nAthena:\n...I wouldn't be so sure.\nApollo:\nReally?\nAthena:\n(The more he tries to avoid logical inconsistencies in his testimony... ...the more likely we'll see inconsistencies between his actions and words.)\nMeans:\nIt is a dark age in which we live. And there is much I would like to say on the matter. (Changed from [It is a dark age in which live [sic]. And there is much I would like to say on the matter.] in the original release)Means:\nBut when I said I would protect Juniper, I meant it because it's the humane thing to do.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nYou were trying to protect our client? (Yeah, right! He'll say anything to pin the blame on Junie!)\nMeans:\nWhat a frightful look. I would ask that you not glare at me so. I've nothing but admiration for how Juniper was willing to go as far as to threaten me. That is why I am protecting her by any means possible. She has been a model student.\nAthena:\n(Liar! You're trying to pin the blame on her! How am I going to show that what he's saying isn't what he's really thinking?)\nMeans:\nYou cannot possibly overturn my claims, so isn't it about time you admitted defeat? (Changed from [You cannot possible [sic] overturn my claims, so isn't it about time you admitted defeat?] in the original release) After all, if my unassailable logic is not truth, then what is?\nAthena:\n(If he thinks I'm going to give in to his pack of lies, he's got another thing coming! I'm gonna find a hole in his story if it's the last thing I do!)Present Tape Recorder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\n\nLeads to:\n\"So let me get this straight. You were trying to help Ms. Woods?\"Apollo:\nEven though he's rotten to the core, he's a total pro. I mean, that all made perfect sense.Athena:\nYeah, but you can't believe a word he says! (He's making this up as he goes along. He'll trip up on his own words yet!

    "response": "Let's examine Professor Means's statement: \"She also said I'd become an accomplice after losing my alibi due to the pre-recording.\" This statement implies that Juniper Woods threatened Means by making him record his speech and thus lose his alibi, making him an accomplice in her crime. However, if we consider \"Courte's Planner\" from the pieces of evidence, it plays a significant role in establishing Professor Means's knowledge of the script details. When the planner is checked, it contains a sword emblem, which suggests a direct connection to Professor Courte that could point towards a motive or additional context not openly discussed by Means. Therefore, there's a contradiction in Means's claim of being forced to comply. His cooperative actions could imply that he was involved by his own initiative, motivated by circumstances not confessed in his testimony.\n\n{\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}",

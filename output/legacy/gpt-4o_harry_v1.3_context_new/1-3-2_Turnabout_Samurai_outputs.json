For it will be the last moon you ever see! See you in hell, Evil Magistrate! Whoooooooaaaaaaa!\nGrrrrrraaaaaaaah!\nThe warriors' swords gleam and strike in the moonlight! One has fallen... but who?

What was that surreal show you were watching?\nMaya:\nWhat!? Nick, you mean, you don't know the Steel Samurai!? He's only the most popular TV hero for young people!\nPhoenix:\nYoung...? Like, how young?\nMaya:\nUmm... 10 years old?\nPhoenix:\nThen what the heck are YOU doing getting all excited!?\nMaya:\nHey! I'm only 17! That's seven-\"teen.\" See? I'm a teen! Not like you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHey! Don't talk to me like I'm your grandpa or something. I'm only 24 myself.\nMaya:\nThen watch it with me! He's really cool! And... it's really popular! When they asked grade school kids what they wanted to be, \"Steel Samurai\" was no. 1! ([no. 1] written as [no.1] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nI really worry about kids these days.\nMaya:\nGramps! Well, the Steel Samurai's over. I guess it's time to close up the office.\nPhoenix:\nI guess... Wish we had some clients!\nPhoenix:\nA month has passed since my trial. Mia's murder was the talk of the town for some time... But no one paid any attention to the Wright & Co. Law Offices... How am I going to pay the rent this month?\nMaya:\nIt'll be okay. I'm sure some big client is just around the corner!\nPhoenix:\nHmph.\nOctober 16, 8:14 AMPhoenix Wright's Bedroom\nCellular:\nBrrrrring... Brrrrring...\n*beep*\nPhoenix:\nH-hello? This is Phoenix.\nMaya:\nN-N-Nick!!!\nPhoenix:\nMaya? What? It's still early...\nMaya:\nI-it's the Steel Samurai! The Steel Samurai got arrested!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? You mean the guy on that show?\nMaya:\nYes! They're saying that the Steel Samurai killed a villain!\nPhoenix:\n... Umm... Isn't that what he's supposed to do?\nMaya:\nYeah, on TV!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, on TV.\nMaya:\nNo! I mean, he actually did it! In real life! He skewered a villain with his Samurai Spear!\nPhoenix:\nI have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.\nMaya:\nJust come to the office, quick! Please, Nick!\nCellular:\n*beep*\nOctober 16, 9:22 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's here... watching television.)\nTV:\nNow for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo.\" He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the \"Evil Magistrate.\" His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The \"Samurai Spear\" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.\nPhoenix:\n... This has to be a joke.\nMaya:\nNo, no, no! It's a nightmare! The Steel Samurai is over! The world is over!\nCellular:\nBrrrrring... Brrrrring...\n*beep*\nMaya:\nYes... Wright & Co. Law Offices. ... What!? Nick! I-it's the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\nW-what!?\nMaya:\nYes... yes, of course! We'll be right there!\nCellular:\n*beep*\nMaya:\nLet's go, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nGo? Go where?\nMaya:\nThey have the Steel Samurai down in detention!\nPhoenix:\nSo what!?\nMaya:\nSo, I've decided this will be our first case!\nExamine\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nThere's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.\nHouseplant\nPhoenix:\nMia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.\nMovie poster\nPhoenix:\nA poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional.\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nIt's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room.\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nWell, what should we do?\nMaya:\nWhat should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\n(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)\nAny ideas\nMaya:\nWe don't have enough information to make a case yet.\nPhoenix:\nJust admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.\nMaya:\nNo! We just don't have enough information!\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this?\nMaya:\nYou like showing that off, don't you, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(My poor, poor ego...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this?\nMaya:\nSorry, but I don't see how that will help us figure this out...\nOctober 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's wrong, Maya? It's him! In the flesh!\nMaya:\nUmm... Is that guy really him?\nPhoenix:\nWhaddya mean \"that guy\"? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him.\nMaya:\nUm, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice.\nPhoenix:\nWhoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!?\nWill:\nUmm...\nMaya:\nY-yes!?\nWill:\nSomething wrong...?\nMaya:\nN-no! No!\nPhoenix:\n(This is getting off to a great start.)\nWill:\nI know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you?\nMaya:\nD-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no.\nWill:\nNo, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams.\nMaya:\nOh...\nWill:\nI guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah!\nMaya:\nNick!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nHe's a good guy! I mean, he's good!\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nMaya:\nHe didn't do it!\nPhoenix:\n...\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile for the camera...\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers.\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you could start by telling us what happened.\nWill:\nY-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\nThe \"Samurai Spear\"...?\nWill:\nYes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.\nThe Steel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you could explain to me just what \"the Steel Samurai\" is.\nMaya:\nNick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.\nPhoenix:\nHey! Who's \"new to this\"!?\nWill:\nNo, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!\nPhoenix:\nI-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)\nPowers's alibi (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nNow, where were you on the day of the murder?\nWill:\nWell, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)\nWill:\nWhat will the kids think? *sniff*\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nUm, here.\nWill:\nI... I see. ...\nPhoenix:\n(Let me guess... this guy wasn't the top student in improv class.)\nAnything else\nWill:\nI-I'm sorry. I'm sure that's very important and all. I just don't see what it has to do with my problem.\nAfter clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option:\nPhoenix:\nI think I should probably check out the scene of the murder...\nWill:\nRight... Global Studios. I'll draw you a map.\nMaya:\nWow! Nick! Let's go!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm willing to bet 10 bucks she asks for autographs.)\nWright & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nWell, what should we do?\nMaya:\nSitting around here won't get us anywhere, that's for sure. The studio! We should go to the studio! I'm sure we could find some clues there!\nPhoenix:\n(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)\nOctober 16Global StudiosMain Gate\nMaya:\nWow! So this is where they make the Steel Samurai show! Awesome! Aren't you excited!?\nOldbag:\nHey! You there! You want in, you gotta go through me!\nMaya:\nO-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers.\nOldbag:\nOh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT.\nMaya:\nG-gawkers?\nOldbag:\nGawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in...\nMaya:\nUmm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say \"no.\"\nPhoenix:\nI dunno! It's possible.\nOldbag:\nHey! Listen when you're being spoken to! Youths today!\nExamine\nComputer\nPhoenix:\nThe computer that runs the studio security cameras.\nOldbag:\nHey! No touching!\nGuard station\nPhoenix:\nThe security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.\nMain gate\nPhoenix:\nThe main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate.\nStudio map\nPhoenix:\nAn overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios.\nStudio van\nPhoenix:\nLooks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment.\nTalk\nThe studios\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you do here at the studios?\nOldbag:\nAt Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...\nMaya:\nNo! You were a star!?\nOldbag:\nOnly a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.\nMaya:\nWo... wow.\nOldbag:\nThis place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...\nPhoenix:\nHammer...?\nOldbag:\nThe victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...\nWill Powers\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?\nOldbag:\nHe's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his \"big chance.\" No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...\nMaya:\nWe don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!\nOldbag:\nPowers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.\nMr. Hammer (appears after \"The studios\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of person was Jack Hammer?\nOldbag:\nWhat \"kind of person\"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!\nPhoenix:\n(Should I have heard of that...?)\nOldbag:\nBut... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.\nReason for suspicion (appears after \"Will Powers\")\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?\nOldbag:\nI was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!\nPhoenix:\nAnd... that person was Mr. Powers?\nOldbag:\nYes. I saw him!\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.\nOldbag:\nOh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nWhat's that? You giving that to me?\nPhoenix:\n(Absolutely not!)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nOldbag:\nIsn't it about time for you to be heading home? There's nothing to see here. Move along.\nPhoenix:\nUm, actually, we're here at Mr. Powers's request.\nOldbag:\nHmph! I thought you were suspicious lookin'! Show me a \"letter of request.\" And maybe I'll just let you in.\nMaya:\nThis lady here thinks she owns this place, obviously.\nDetention Center\nWill:\nHello! How was the studio? They all think I did it, don't they?\nMaya:\nN-no, not at all! Isn't that right, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nRight, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect.\nWill:\n*sniff*\nTalk\nYour alibi\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?\nWill:\nW-what? No! I'd never do that!\nPhoenix:\nJust now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.\nWill:\nYes. Like a baby.\nPhoenix:\nBut the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!\nWill:\nW-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.\nWill:\nI know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?\nPhoenix:\n(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)\nThe security lady\nPhoenix:\nUmm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...\nWill:\nOh, the security lady?\nMaya:\nShe's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"!\nWill:\nY-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.\nMaya:\nGrr! She's got some nerve!\nPhoenix:\nDo you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation?\nWill:\nOf c-course.\nPowers's Request added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(I just hope this will get me past that security lady.)\nThe security lady (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nUmm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...\nWill:\nOh, the security lady?\nMaya:\nShe's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"!\nWill:\nY-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.\nMaya:\nGrr! She's got some nerve!\nPresent\nPowers's Letter\nPhoenix:\nThank you for the letter of request.\nWill:\nShow that to the security lady and she should let you in.\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nPowers's Letter\nPhoenix:\nHey, look what I have!\nMaya:\nHey! The Steel Samurai said we'd need that to get into the studio.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Will Powers said we'd need it...?\nMaya:\nYes, the Steel Samurai.\nPhoenix:\n*sigh*\nStudio - Main Gate\nPresent\nPowers's Letter\nLeads to:\n\"Ma'am, have a look at this.\"\nPhoenix:\nMa'am, have a look at this. It's a letter of request from Mr. Powers.\nOldbag:\nHmm...? Yes, yes. I recognize the bold, childish scrawl.\nGave Powers's Request to the security lady.\nOldbag:\nTo think he would entrust his fate to youths of such unreliable appearance... Really!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnyway, you may pass. But only left from here, toward the studios! No going to the right. That's the Employee Area. \"No one allowed inside, pal\" were my instructions. The good detective told me himself.\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nThere were maps in the security guard station.\nPhoenix:\nHey! Not bad!\nOldbag:\nThose are 50 cents a piece,\nthank you!\nMaya:\nWell, time to go, Nick.\nOldbag:\n50 cents!\nGuidemap of Global Studios added to the Court Record.\nOctober 16Studio One Entrance\nGumshoe:\nHey! Aren't you that murderer from the other day!\nMaya:\nAah! It's that confused detective!\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, you know Prosecutor Edgeworth is all upset, and it's your fault! I saw him sipping tea and staring gloomily out the window!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... so?\nMaya:\nHey! If he's depressed, it's all your fault for doing sloppy detective work!\nGumshoe:\n!!! ... ... ...\nMaya:\nUm, Detective?\nPhoenix:\nI think you hurt his feelings.\nMaya:\nOh no! I... I'm sorry!\nPhoenix:\nWell, I think his feelings are easily hurt.\nGumshoe:\nYou're right, pal. It's all my fault. I can blame other people all I want, but I know the truth in my heart!\nMaya:\nHey, hey! Don't take it so hard! There's always the next case!\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I suppose you're right. Hey! What exactly are you two doing here?\nMaya:\nUm, well... We're on this case too, pal!\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? Hey! You can't just go saying \"pal\" like that! That's MY endearing character trait!\nMaya:\nI'd say he's a character alright...\nExamine\nBench\nPhoenix:\nI'm a little bushed. Maybe I'll take a short rest here.\nGumshoe:\nHey, good idea, pal!\nMaya:\nDetective! Aren't you on the case?\nGumshoe:\nW-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal!\nLeft path\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.\nStatue with broken head\nPhoenix:\nThe studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]\nMaya:\nWhat's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.\nGumshoe:\nOh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nHey, there's a camera here.\nGumshoe:\nThat's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!\nPhoenix:\nThere's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.\nStudio One entrance\nPhoenix:\nThe entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.\nMaya:\nLet's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!\nPhoenix:\nLooks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.\nWelcome sign\nMaya:\nThere's a big welcome sign above the path.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.\nMaya:\nHuh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?\nPhoenix:\nYeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!?\nTalk\nThe investigation\nPhoenix:\nSo, how is your investigation going, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nWell, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.\nMaya:\nNick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?\nPhoenix:\nRight. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?\nGumshoe:\nWhat I got?\nPhoenix:\nThe autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...\nGumshoe:\nHmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nThe investigation (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo, how is your investigation going, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nI'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh well, it was worth a try.)\nReason for arrest\nPhoenix:\nWhy was Mr. Powers arrested?\nGumshoe:\nSimple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.\nMaya:\nNick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!\nPhoenix:\nThanks for cheering me up...\nThe security lady\nPhoenix:\nAbout the security lady...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? A-are we talking about the same person?\nGumshoe:\nWhen I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!\nMaya:\nRemember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.\nGumshoe:\nShe even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!\nMaya:\nWhaat!?\nDecisive evidence (appears after \"The security lady\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of evidence!?\nGumshoe:\nWell, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!\nMaya:\nWhat! Who took that!?\nGumshoe:\nSee the camera up on that gate, pal?\nMaya:\nThe gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!\nMaya:\nOh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!\nPhoenix:\n(Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.)\nGumshoe:\n...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nDetective, see this? This is my attorney's badge.\nGumshoe:\nUh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!\nPhoenix:\nI'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...\nMaya:\nMaybe it should just be a big \"L\" for \"Lawyer\"?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I'm not so sure about that.\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, Detective. Any ideas about this?\nGumshoe:\nLook, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal?\nAfter clearing \"The investigation\" and \"Decisive evidence\" Talk options:\nGumshoe:\nWhat's wrong, pal? You seem down.\nPhoenix:\nDon't look so happy when you say that.\nGumshoe:\nOh hoh hoh hoh hoh!\nMaya:\nUmm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...\nGumshoe:\nSure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)\nMaya:\nNick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!\nStudio - Main Gate\nMaya:\nNick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...\nOldbag:\nHey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?\nPhoenix:\n(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)\nTalk\nPhotographic proof\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?\nOldbag:\nHmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.\nReason for suspicion\nOldbag:\nThis guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe... it was you?\nOldbag:\nGyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.\nPhoenix:\n(She thinks I was joking.)\nMr. Hammer\nPhoenix:\nWas the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?\nOldbag:\nOh, he was the biggest star in the studio!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Was\"? Past tense?)\nMaya:\nOh yes! He was great as the \"Bearded Samurai\"!\nOldbag:\nThat too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the \"Evil Magistrate\"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?\nAutomatic camera (appears after \"Photographic proof\")\nPhoenix:\nAbout the security camera...\nOldbag:\nOh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.\nOctober 16Wright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nWhat's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?\nPhoenix:\nDon't look at me! How should I know?\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think?\nMaya:\nThat photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.\nPhotographic proof\nPhoenix:\nOnly one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.\nMaya:\nI guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?\nMaya:\nOn thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio.\nOctober 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nApparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... right.\nGumshoe:\nLook pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers!\nPhoenix:\nI have to ask him about that photograph!\nMaya:\nOh well. Let's try again later.\nExamine\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera.\nOctober 16Global StudiosEmployee Area\nMaya:\nNick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!\nExamine\nBicycle\nPhoenix:\nLooks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?\nMaya:\nIt makes it a lot easier to go up hills!\nPhoenix:\nDon't people cycle to get exercise!?\nDrain grate\nPhoenix:\nThe metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.\nMaya:\nYeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!\nPhoenix:\nWell, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.\nMaya:\nRight! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!\nGrate\nPhoenix:\nThe grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on.\nLunch table\nPhoenix:\nThe remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.\nMaya:\nMmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.\nPhoenix:\nYou just had a burger!\nMaya:\nYeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.\nPhoenix:\n(What!?)\nStage backdrop\nPhoenix:\nThere's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably \"Neo Olde Tokyo Castle.\"\nDressing room door\nPhoenix:\nThe door to the dressing room. It's not locked.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean \"find\"!?\nMaya:\nYou never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear!\nPhoenix:\nWe don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!)\nDressing room sign\nPhoenix:\nThere's a sign on the dressing room door. \"Mr. Will Powers\"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this.\nDressing room window\nPhoenix:\nA window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside.\nStorage room door\nPhoenix:\nThat must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.\nMaya:\nWow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry!\nPhoenix:\nUmm, what else would they keep in a film studio?\nVending machine\nPhoenix:\nLet's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!\nMaya:\nW-wait! Look! \"Samurai Soda\"! Nick! Try this!\nPhoenix:\n(Ladies first...)\nOctober 16Global StudiosDressing Room\nPhoenix:\n(Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.)\nMaya:\nNo one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?\nPhoenix:\nRight, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)\nExamine\nCosmetics\nPhoenix:\nThere's a vast array of cosmetics here.\nMaya:\nOoh! This is the wig he used in \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey\"! Nick! Try this on!\nPhoenix:\nNo. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!?\nMaya:\nI, um, kinda like samurai movies.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Kinda\"...?)\nCostume rack\nPhoenix:\nThere's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.\nMaya:\nIt'd be fun to wear one of the costumes...\nPhoenix:\n(I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.)\nCouch\nPhoenix:\nLooks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday...\nMirror\nPhoenix:\nThey always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it.\nBag\nMaya:\nHmm? This must be Powers's bag.\nPhoenix:\nHey, don't open that.\nMaya:\nLook!\nPhoenix:\nAn employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says \"Studio One.\"\nMaya:\nLet's take it, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nBorrow it. You mean borrow.\nCardkey added to the Court Record.\nBag (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nI wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...?\nPhoenix:\nStop that! (My partner, the thief in training.)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...\nMaya:\nNick... I'm hungry!\nPhoenix:\nYou just had a burger!\nMaya:\nYeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!\nPhoenix:\n(How many stomachs does this girl have!?)\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nIt's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside.\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nCardkey\nMaya:\nOh, hey! That's the cardkey to get into Studio One where the murder took place! Let's go check it out!\nStudio - Main Gate\nPresent\nCardkey\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about this, ma'am?\nOldbag:\nOh that! Isn't that a studio cardkey? You better watch it! The scene of a murder is no place for sightseeing! I'll be taking that! Hand it over!\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! No, that's mine!\nOldbag:\nLook, I don't have a cardkey to the studio, see? I want to go pay my respects to Jack Hammer where he died.\nPhoenix:\nW... well you'll just have to wait!\nOutside Studio One\nExamine\nStudio One entrance\nPhoenix:\nThe entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.\nMaya:\nLet's go in and check it out, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI wonder if this cardkey we borrowed from the dressing room will work...\n*beep*\nPhoenix:\nIt opened!\nMaya:\nAlright! We're in!\nPhoenix:\n(She's way too happy for someone visiting a crime scene.)\nPresent\nCardkey\nMaya:\nHey, Detective! Take a look at this!\nGumshoe:\nWhazzat?\nPhoenix:\nWhoa whoa whoa! Don't show him that! He'll confiscate it!\nMaya:\nAww... I just wanted to show it off.\nAfter examining Studio One entrance in Studio One Entrance:\nOctober 16Studio One\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYou're real quiet all of a sudden.\nMaya:\nDoesn't it give you the shivers, Nick? That white tape! It's so... so real!\nPhoenix:\nWell, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me...\nExamine\nDirector's chair\nMaya:\nHey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nReady, Nick? Action!\nPhoenix:\n(This girl is more troubled than I thought...)\nFilm camera\nLeads to:\n\"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!\"\nReflecting screen\nMaya:\nWhat's this?\nPhoenix:\nThat's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming.\nMaya:\nHuh.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?\nMaya:\nWell, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\n(I think she's being serious...!)\nStage backdrop\nPhoenix:\nLooks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.\nMaya:\nOf course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?\nMaya:\nNot Olde Tokyo, Nick! \"Neo\" Olde Tokyo!\nPhoenix:\nOh. Right.\n(Step)ladder\nMaya:\nLook, a ladder!\nPhoenix:\nThat's a \"step\"-ladder.\nMaya:\nSo? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nR-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)\nTape outline\nPhoenix:\nThey outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...\nMaya:\nWow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!\nPhoenix:\nYeah! So don't touch it!\nMaya:\nWhoa! It's heavier than I thought...\n???:\nHey! You! No touching that!\nPhoenix:\nAh, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...\nMaya:\n\"Y'know\"!? No I don't know!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... who are you?\nPenny:\nWho me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera.\nMaya:\nWe're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers.\nPenny:\nOh, you're WP's people.\nMaya:\n\"WP\"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it.\nPenny:\nI don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent.\nMaya:\nDon't worry, leave it to us!\nTalk\nThe day of the crime\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me anything about the day of the murder?\nPenny:\nYes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see.\nMaya:\nOnly one assistant!?\nPenny:\nYes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.\nMaya:\nOh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release)\nPenny:\nIn the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.\nPhoenix:\nThe employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?\nPenny:\nYes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that.\nWill Powers\nPhoenix:\nDid you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?\nPenny:\nNo! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!?\nPhoenix:\nW-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.)\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nUm, any thoughts about this?\nPenny:\nSorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\nWhat do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nPenny:\nUmm... Sorry... I know you're busy.\nPhoenix:\nNot really.\nPenny:\nActually, there's been something bothering me.\nMaya:\nAh hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!\nPenny:\nWell, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...\nPhoenix:\nYou \"sensed\"?\nPenny:\nYes, several times.\nPhoenix:\nSome other studio employees, maybe?\nPenny:\nNo, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.\nPhoenix:\nR-really!?\nMaya:\nBut wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you're right.\nPenny:\nI'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.\nMaya:\nNo, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!\nTalk\nSensing someone\nPhoenix:\nSo you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?\nPenny:\nYes... I think.\nPhoenix:\n(\"I think\" doesn't cut it in a witness testimony.)\nMaya:\nNick! What about that security lady! If someone else came into the studio, she must have seen them!\nOctober 16Global StudiosMain Gate\nOldbag:\nWhat? You're still here? Really! You look as though you've seen a ghost!\nTalk\nAssistant's claim\nLeads to:\n\"What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!\"\nOldbag:\nWhat? I saw that suspicious look on your face!\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?\nOldbag:\nSure as can be!\nMaya:\nBut we have a witness who thinks there was \"someone from outside\" here that day.\nOldbag:\nWhat!?\nMaya:\nAre you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?\nOldbag:\n...\nMaya:\nMa'am?\nOldbag:\nWho was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!?\nMaya:\nEek!\nOldbag:\nAlright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!?\nMaya:\nUh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.\nOldbag:\nHer! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!\nPhoenix:\nShe left...\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders!\nExamine\nComputer\nPhoenix:\nThe computer that runs the studio security cameras.\nMaya:\nNick! Maybe we can see that photo of Powers with this computer!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?)\nTry it\nPhoenix:\nOkay. Let's give it a try.\nMaya:\nYou know how to work these things, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nLooks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)\n[Please enter the number of the security camera.]\nST1-703\nPhoenix:\nThere! Entered!\nMaya:\n... ... Nothing happened.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Maybe I got the number wrong.\nMaya:\n*sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again?\nLeads back to examination\nST1-307\nLeads to:\n\"There! Entered!\"\nST1-370\nPhoenix:\nThere! Entered!\nMaya:\n... ... Nothing happened.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Maybe I got the number wrong.\nMaya:\n*sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again?\nLeads back to examination\nLeave it alone\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I'd better not fool around with this, or that security lady will get me. Maybe next time.)\nMaya:\nWhat? You're not going to look at it? Bo-ring!\nLeads back to examination\nPhoenix:\nThere! Entered! ...\nMaya:\nHey! It printed out the data for that day!\nPhoenix:\nLet's see what we got... ... Huh?\nMaya:\nHow is this a picture of Will Powers?\nPhoenix:\nWell, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him.\nMaya:\nI don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]\nMaya:\nWhat does that mean?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe there's more photo data from that day?\nMaya:\nNope--that's the only one in the computer.\nPowers's{?} Photo added to the Court Record.\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial?\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nMaya:\nWe'll put that security lady in her place with this!\nPhoenix:\nRight, we'll put her in her place...\nMaya:\nHey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says!\nPhoenix:\nWait. Let's not.\nMaya:\nWhy not?\nPhoenix:\nIt's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon.\nMaya:\nNick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate!\nPhoenix:\nHey! Why do I have to be the villain.\nMaya:\nRelax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?\nPhoenix:\nI think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...?\nTo be continued.\nBefore selecting \"ST1-307\" upon examining computer in Global Studios - Main Gate:\nOctober 16Studio One\nMaya:\nNo one's here.

Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:\nHmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:\nVery well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nDetective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:\nYes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I think I can probably remember that...\"Listen again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?\nGumshoe:\nI shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)\nLeads back to:\n\"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?\"Phoenix:\n(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:\nSo the murder weapon was a \"spear\"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: \"What did the security lady at the guard station see?\"Judge:\nUnderstood.Edgeworth:\nLet's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:\nWill the witness declare her name?Oldbag:\n... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:\nY-your name, please!Oldbag:\nOh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\"Edgeworth:\nYOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:\n(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:\nWendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nO-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:\nObjection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:\nI was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:\nPerhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:\nNow, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:\nYessey I was.Judge:\nAnd to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:\nYou know your stuff, dearie!Judge:\n... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:\n(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:\nYou saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?\nOldbag:\nWell, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.\nPhoenix:\n(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)\nEdgeworth:\nWas there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA \"run-through\"...?\nOldbag:\nThey were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.\nPhoenix:\n(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)\nEdgeworth:\nIf there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of \"errands\"?\nOldbag:\nOh, well, you know.\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question!\nOldbag:\nActually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?\nPhoenix:\nO-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.\nMaya:\nWow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!\nPhoenix:\nYou could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.\nMaya:\nNot a bad idea...Oldbag:\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see the victim then?\nOldbag:\nDid I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.\nEdgeworth:\nTell us what happened next.Oldbag:\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?\nOldbag:\nO-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...\nOldbag:\nI can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!\nMaya:\n\"Snipperwhapper\"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you raise an objection?\nJudge:\nSo, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag:\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know that?\nOldbag:\nOh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)Oldbag:\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n2:00? You're sure?\nOldbag:\nSure as spit!\nJudge:\nWell, who was the man!?\nOldbag:\nReally, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something.\nJudge:\n...\nOldbag:\nNow, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!Present Powers's(?)

You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "To identify a contradiction, let's look at Wendy Oldbag’s testimonies and the relevant evidence. \n\nOldbag claims in her testimony that she arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM (Testimony 3). However, we have the Guidemap (Evidence 2), which shows the layout and suggests that for anyone to move from the Employee Area to Studio One, they would have to pass by the guard station, where Oldbag claims she was stationed.\n\nOldbag also insists she was at the main gate from 1:00 PM until 5:00 PM without breaks (Testimony 4), meaning no one should have passed the gate unnoticed. However, the implication of her statement that Powers walked past at 2:00 PM (Testimony 6), and the photo timestamped at 2:00 PM (Evidence 5), challenges her claim if she alone saw Powers, as the photo does not clearly identify Powers but merely someone in the Steel Samurai costume. \n\nIn summary, Oldbag says she saw Powers heading towards the studio, but the evidence suggests an unauthenticated assumption since the costume obscures the wearer’s identity, while she claims to have maintained strict surveillance without pause. Thus, the specific contradiction that stands out from Oldbag's stationing at 1:00 PM is further evaluated against her capacity to accurately discern Powers from behind a concealing costume alone and unerringly.\n\nHowever, focusing solely on clear, simple contradictions, the mismatch in testimonies appears when her claimed vigilance seems improbable given the concrete photographic evidence she bases her identification on, there is a complication with her reliability doubting her assurance that Powers is whom she saw.\n\nConsequently, examining strictly plausible counterpoints direct to her general stationing is complicated but initially observing:\n1. The main issue concerns her ability to see Powers directly as she claims at a time marked by the photo contradicts any decisive identification of Powers.\n\nUpon broader analysis of a direct contradictory moment, for precise identification follows from claims about entrance times and scrutinized gatekeeping, where the identification hinges on assumed visuals when only photographic captures exist (Testimony: Oldbag 7, Evidence: 5).\n\n{ \"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 7 }",

The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo.\" He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the \"Evil Magistrate.\" His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The \"Samurai Spear\" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.\nPhoenix:\n... This has to be a joke.\nMaya:\nNo, no, no!

That's him.\nMaya:\nUm, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice.\nPhoenix:\nWhoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!?\nWill:\nUmm...\nMaya:\nY-yes!?\nWill:\nSomething wrong...?\nMaya:\nN-no! No!\nPhoenix:\n(This is getting off to a great start.)\nWill:\nI know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you?\nMaya:\nD-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no.\nWill:\nNo, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams.\nMaya:\nOh...\nWill:\nI guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah!\nMaya:\nNick!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nHe's a good guy!

He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers.\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you could start by telling us what happened.\nWill:\nY-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\nThe \"Samurai Spear\"...?\nWill:\nYes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.\nThe Steel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you could explain to me just what \"the Steel Samurai\" is.\nMaya:\nNick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.\nPhoenix:\nHey! Who's \"new to this\"!?\nWill:\nNo, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!\nPhoenix:\nI-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)\nPowers's alibi (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nNow, where were you on the day of the murder?\nWill:\nWell, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)\nWill:\nWhat will the kids think? *sniff*\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nUm, here.\nWill:\nI... I see. ...\nPhoenix:\n(Let me guess... this guy wasn't the top student in improv class.)\nAnything else\nWill:\nI-I'm sorry. I'm sure that's very important and all. I just don't see what it has to do with my problem.\nAfter clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option:\nPhoenix:\nI think I should probably check out the scene of the murder...\nWill:\nRight... Global Studios. I'll draw you a map.\nMaya:\nWow! Nick! Let's go!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm willing to bet 10 bucks she asks for autographs.)\nWright & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nWell, what should we do?\nMaya:\nSitting around here won't get us anywhere, that's for sure.

You want in, you gotta go through me!\nMaya:\nO-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers.\nOldbag:\nOh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT.\nMaya:\nG-gawkers?\nOldbag:\nGawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in...\nMaya:\nUmm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say \"no.\"\nPhoenix:\nI dunno! It's possible.\nOldbag:\nHey! Listen when you're being spoken to! Youths today!\nExamine\nComputer\nPhoenix:\nThe computer that runs the studio security cameras.\nOldbag:\nHey! No touching!\nGuard station\nPhoenix:\nThe security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.\nMain gate\nPhoenix:\nThe main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate.\nStudio map\nPhoenix:\nAn overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios.\nStudio van\nPhoenix:\nLooks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment.\nTalk\nThe studios\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you do here at the studios?\nOldbag:\nAt Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...\nMaya:\nNo! You were a star!?\nOldbag:\nOnly a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.\nMaya:\nWo... wow.\nOldbag:\nThis place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...\nPhoenix:\nHammer...?\nOldbag:\nThe victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...\nWill Powers\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?\nOldbag:\nHe's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his \"big chance.\" No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...\nMaya:\nWe don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!\nOldbag:\nPowers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.\nMr. Hammer (appears after \"The studios\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of person was Jack Hammer?\nOldbag:\nWhat \"kind of person\"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!\nPhoenix:\n(Should I have heard of that...?)\nOldbag:\nBut... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.\nReason for suspicion (appears after \"Will Powers\")\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?\nOldbag:\nI was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!\nPhoenix:\nAnd... that person was Mr. Powers?\nOldbag:\nYes. I saw him!\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.\nOldbag:\nOh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nWhat's that? You giving that to me?\nPhoenix:\n(Absolutely not!)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nOldbag:\nIsn't it about time for you to be heading home? There's nothing to see here. Move along.\nPhoenix:\nUm, actually, we're here at Mr. Powers's request.\nOldbag:\nHmph! I thought you were suspicious lookin'! Show me a \"letter of request.\" And maybe I'll just let you in.\nMaya:\nThis lady here thinks she owns this place, obviously.\nDetention Center\nWill:\nHello! How was the studio? They all think I did it, don't they?\nMaya:\nN-no, not at all! Isn't that right, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nRight, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect.\nWill:\n*sniff*\nTalk\nYour alibi\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?\nWill:\nW-what? No! I'd never do that!\nPhoenix:\nJust now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.\nWill:\nYes. Like a baby.\nPhoenix:\nBut the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!\nWill:\nW-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.\nWill:\nI know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?\nPhoenix:\n(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)\nThe security lady\nPhoenix:\nUmm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...\nWill:\nOh, the security lady?\nMaya:\nShe's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"!\nWill:\nY-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.\nMaya:\nGrr! She's got some nerve!\nPhoenix:\nDo you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation?\nWill:\nOf c-course.\nPowers's Request added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(I just hope this will get me past that security lady.)\nThe security lady (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nUmm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...\nWill:\nOh, the security lady?\nMaya:\nShe's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"!\nWill:\nY-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.\nMaya:\nGrr! She's got some nerve!\nPresent\nPowers's Letter\nPhoenix:\nThank you for the letter of request.\nWill:\nShow that to the security lady and she should let you in.\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nPowers's Letter\nPhoenix:\nHey, look what I have!\nMaya:\nHey!

Really!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnyway, you may pass. But only left from here, toward the studios! No going to the right.

If he's depressed, it's all your fault for doing sloppy detective work!\nGumshoe:\n!!! ... ... ...\nMaya:\nUm, Detective?\nPhoenix:\nI think you hurt his feelings.\nMaya:\nOh no! I... I'm sorry!\nPhoenix:\nWell, I think his feelings are easily hurt.\nGumshoe:\nYou're right, pal. It's all my fault. I can blame other people all I want, but I know the truth in my heart!\nMaya:\nHey, hey! Don't take it so hard! There's always the next case!\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I suppose you're right. Hey! What exactly are you two doing here?\nMaya:\nUm, well... We're on this case too, pal!\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? Hey! You can't just go saying \"pal\" like that! That's MY endearing character trait!\nMaya:\nI'd say he's a character alright...\nExamine\nBench\nPhoenix:\nI'm a little bushed. Maybe I'll take a short rest here.\nGumshoe:\nHey, good idea, pal!\nMaya:\nDetective! Aren't you on the case?\nGumshoe:\nW-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal!\nLeft path\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.\nStatue with broken head\nPhoenix:\nThe studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]\nMaya:\nWhat's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.\nGumshoe:\nOh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nHey, there's a camera here.\nGumshoe:\nThat's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!\nPhoenix:\nThere's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.\nStudio One entrance\nPhoenix:\nThe entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.\nMaya:\nLet's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!\nPhoenix:\nLooks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.\nWelcome sign\nMaya:\nThere's a big welcome sign above the path.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.\nMaya:\nHuh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?\nPhoenix:\nYeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!?\nTalk\nThe investigation\nPhoenix:\nSo, how is your investigation going, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nWell, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.\nMaya:\nNick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?\nPhoenix:\nRight. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?\nGumshoe:\nWhat I got?\nPhoenix:\nThe autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...\nGumshoe:\nHmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nThe investigation (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo, how is your investigation going, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nI'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh well, it was worth a try.)\nReason for arrest\nPhoenix:\nWhy was Mr. Powers arrested?\nGumshoe:\nSimple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.\nMaya:\nNick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!\nPhoenix:\nThanks for cheering me up...\nThe security lady\nPhoenix:\nAbout the security lady...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? A-are we talking about the same person?\nGumshoe:\nWhen I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!\nMaya:\nRemember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.\nGumshoe:\nShe even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!\nMaya:\nWhaat!?\nDecisive evidence (appears after \"The security lady\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of evidence!?\nGumshoe:\nWell, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!\nMaya:\nWhat! Who took that!?\nGumshoe:\nSee the camera up on that gate, pal?\nMaya:\nThe gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!\nMaya:\nOh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!\nPhoenix:\n(Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.)\nGumshoe:\n...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nDetective, see this? This is my attorney's badge.\nGumshoe:\nUh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!\nPhoenix:\nI'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...\nMaya:\nMaybe it should just be a big \"L\" for \"Lawyer\"?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I'm not so sure about that.\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, Detective. Any ideas about this?\nGumshoe:\nLook, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal?\nAfter clearing \"The investigation\" and \"Decisive evidence\" Talk options:\nGumshoe:\nWhat's wrong, pal? You seem down.\nPhoenix:\nDon't look so happy when you say that.\nGumshoe:\nOh hoh hoh hoh hoh!\nMaya:\nUmm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...\nGumshoe:\nSure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)\nMaya:\nNick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!\nStudio - Main Gate\nMaya:\nNick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...\nOldbag:\nHey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?\nPhoenix:\n(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)\nTalk\nPhotographic proof\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?\nOldbag:\nHmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.\nReason for suspicion\nOldbag:\nThis guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe... it was you?\nOldbag:\nGyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.\nPhoenix:\n(She thinks I was joking.)\nMr. Hammer\nPhoenix:\nWas the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?\nOldbag:\nOh, he was the biggest star in the studio!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Was\"? Past tense?)\nMaya:\nOh yes! He was great as the \"Bearded Samurai\"!\nOldbag:\nThat too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the \"Evil Magistrate\"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?\nAutomatic camera (appears after \"Photographic proof\")\nPhoenix:\nAbout the security camera...\nOldbag:\nOh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.\nOctober 16Wright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nWhat's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?\nPhoenix:\nDon't look at me! How should I know?\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think?\nMaya:\nThat photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.\nPhotographic proof\nPhoenix:\nOnly one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.\nMaya:\nI guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?\nMaya:\nOn thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio.\nOctober 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nApparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... right.\nGumshoe:\nLook pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers!\nPhoenix:\nI have to ask him about that photograph!\nMaya:\nOh well. Let's try again later.\nExamine\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera.\nOctober 16Global StudiosEmployee Area\nMaya:\nNick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!\nExamine\nBicycle\nPhoenix:\nLooks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?\nMaya:\nIt makes it a lot easier to go up hills!\nPhoenix:\nDon't people cycle to get exercise!?\nDrain grate\nPhoenix:\nThe metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.\nMaya:\nYeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!\nPhoenix:\nWell, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.\nMaya:\nRight! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!\nGrate\nPhoenix:\nThe grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on.\nLunch table\nPhoenix:\nThe remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.\nMaya:\nMmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.\nPhoenix:\nYou just had a burger!\nMaya:\nYeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.\nPhoenix:\n(What!?)\nStage backdrop\nPhoenix:\nThere's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably \"Neo Olde Tokyo Castle.\"\nDressing room door\nPhoenix:\nThe door to the dressing room. It's not locked.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean \"find\"!?\nMaya:\nYou never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear!\nPhoenix:\nWe don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!)\nDressing room sign\nPhoenix:\nThere's a sign on the dressing room door. \"Mr. Will Powers\"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this.\nDressing room window\nPhoenix:\nA window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside.\nStorage room door\nPhoenix:\nThat must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.\nMaya:\nWow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry!\nPhoenix:\nUmm, what else would they keep in a film studio?\nVending machine\nPhoenix:\nLet's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!\nMaya:\nW-wait! Look! \"Samurai Soda\"! Nick! Try this!\nPhoenix:\n(Ladies first...)\nOctober 16Global StudiosDressing Room\nPhoenix:\n(Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.)\nMaya:\nNo one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?\nPhoenix:\nRight, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)\nExamine\nCosmetics\nPhoenix:\nThere's a vast array of cosmetics here.\nMaya:\nOoh! This is the wig he used in \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey\"! Nick! Try this on!\nPhoenix:\nNo. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!?\nMaya:\nI, um, kinda like samurai movies.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Kinda\"...?)\nCostume rack\nPhoenix:\nThere's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.\nMaya:\nIt'd be fun to wear one of the costumes...\nPhoenix:\n(I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.)\nCouch\nPhoenix:\nLooks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday...\nMirror\nPhoenix:\nThey always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it.\nBag\nMaya:\nHmm? This must be Powers's bag.\nPhoenix:\nHey, don't open that.\nMaya:\nLook!\nPhoenix:\nAn employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says \"Studio One.\"\nMaya:\nLet's take it, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nBorrow it. You mean borrow.\nCardkey added to the Court Record.\nBag (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nI wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...?\nPhoenix:\nStop that! (My partner, the thief in training.)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...\nMaya:\nNick... I'm hungry!\nPhoenix:\nYou just had a burger!\nMaya:\nYeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!\nPhoenix:\n(How many stomachs does this girl have!?)\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nIt's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside.\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nCardkey\nMaya:\nOh, hey! That's the cardkey to get into Studio One where the murder took place! Let's go check it out!\nStudio - Main Gate\nPresent\nCardkey\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about this, ma'am?\nOldbag:\nOh that! Isn't that a studio cardkey? You better watch it! The scene of a murder is no place for sightseeing! I'll be taking that! Hand it over!\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! No, that's mine!\nOldbag:\nLook, I don't have a cardkey to the studio, see? I want to go pay my respects to Jack Hammer where he died.\nPhoenix:\nW... well you'll just have to wait!\nOutside Studio One\nExamine\nStudio One entrance\nPhoenix:\nThe entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.\nMaya:\nLet's go in and check it out, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI wonder if this cardkey we borrowed from the dressing room will work...\n*beep*\nPhoenix:\nIt opened!\nMaya:\nAlright! We're in!\nPhoenix:\n(She's way too happy for someone visiting a crime scene.)\nPresent\nCardkey\nMaya:\nHey, Detective! Take a look at this!\nGumshoe:\nWhazzat?\nPhoenix:\nWhoa whoa whoa! Don't show him that! He'll confiscate it!\nMaya:\nAww... I just wanted to show it off.\nAfter examining Studio One entrance in Studio One Entrance:\nOctober 16Studio One\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYou're real quiet all of a sudden.\nMaya:\nDoesn't it give you the shivers, Nick? That white tape! It's so... so real!\nPhoenix:\nWell, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me...\nExamine\nDirector's chair\nMaya:\nHey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nReady, Nick? Action!\nPhoenix:\n(This girl is more troubled than I thought...)\nFilm camera\nLeads to:\n\"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!\"\nReflecting screen\nMaya:\nWhat's this?\nPhoenix:\nThat's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming.\nMaya:\nHuh.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?\nMaya:\nWell, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\n(I think she's being serious...!)\nStage backdrop\nPhoenix:\nLooks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.\nMaya:\nOf course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?\nMaya:\nNot Olde Tokyo, Nick! \"Neo\" Olde Tokyo!\nPhoenix:\nOh. Right.\n(Step)ladder\nMaya:\nLook, a ladder!\nPhoenix:\nThat's a \"step\"-ladder.\nMaya:\nSo? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nR-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)\nTape outline\nPhoenix:\nThey outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...\nMaya:\nWow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!\nPhoenix:\nYeah! So don't touch it!\nMaya:\nWhoa! It's heavier than I thought...\n???:\nHey! You! No touching that!\nPhoenix:\nAh, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...\nMaya:\n\"Y'know\"!? No I don't know!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... who are you?\nPenny:\nWho me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera.\nMaya:\nWe're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers.\nPenny:\nOh, you're WP's people.\nMaya:\n\"WP\"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it.\nPenny:\nI don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent.\nMaya:\nDon't worry, leave it to us!\nTalk\nThe day of the crime\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me anything about the day of the murder?\nPenny:\nYes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see.\nMaya:\nOnly one assistant!?\nPenny:\nYes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.\nMaya:\nOh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release)\nPenny:\nIn the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.\nPhoenix:\nThe employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?\nPenny:\nYes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that.\nWill Powers\nPhoenix:\nDid you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?\nPenny:\nNo! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!?\nPhoenix:\nW-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.)\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nUm, any thoughts about this?\nPenny:\nSorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\nWhat do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nPenny:\nUmm... Sorry... I know you're busy.\nPhoenix:\nNot really.\nPenny:\nActually, there's been something bothering me.\nMaya:\nAh hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!\nPenny:\nWell, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...\nPhoenix:\nYou \"sensed\"?\nPenny:\nYes, several times.\nPhoenix:\nSome other studio employees, maybe?\nPenny:\nNo, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.\nPhoenix:\nR-really!?\nMaya:\nBut wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you're right.\nPenny:\nI'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.\nMaya:\nNo, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!\nTalk\nSensing someone\nPhoenix:\nSo you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?\nPenny:\nYes... I think.\nPhoenix:\n(\"I think\" doesn't cut it in a witness testimony.)\nMaya:\nNick! What about that security lady! If someone else came into the studio, she must have seen them!\nOctober 16Global StudiosMain Gate\nOldbag:\nWhat? You're still here? Really! You look as though you've seen a ghost!\nTalk\nAssistant's claim\nLeads to:\n\"What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!\"\nOldbag:\nWhat? I saw that suspicious look on your face!\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?\nOldbag:\nSure as can be!\nMaya:\nBut we have a witness who thinks there was \"someone from outside\" here that day.\nOldbag:\nWhat!?\nMaya:\nAre you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?\nOldbag:\n...\nMaya:\nMa'am?\nOldbag:\nWho was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!?\nMaya:\nEek!\nOldbag:\nAlright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!?\nMaya:\nUh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.\nOldbag:\nHer! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!\nPhoenix:\nShe left...\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders!\nExamine\nComputer\nPhoenix:\nThe computer that runs the studio security cameras.\nMaya:\nNick! Maybe we can see that photo of Powers with this computer!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?)\nTry it\nPhoenix:\nOkay. Let's give it a try.\nMaya:\nYou know how to work these things, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nLooks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)\n[Please enter the number of the security camera.]\nST1-703\nPhoenix:\nThere! Entered!\nMaya:\n... ... Nothing happened.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Maybe I got the number wrong.\nMaya:\n*sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again?\nLeads back to examination\nST1-307\nLeads to:\n\"There! Entered!\"\nST1-370\nPhoenix:\nThere! Entered!\nMaya:\n... ... Nothing happened.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Maybe I got the number wrong.\nMaya:\n*sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again?\nLeads back to examination\nLeave it alone\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I'd better not fool around with this, or that security lady will get me. Maybe next time.)\nMaya:\nWhat? You're not going to look at it? Bo-ring!\nLeads back to examination\nPhoenix:\nThere! Entered! ...\nMaya:\nHey! It printed out the data for that day!\nPhoenix:\nLet's see what we got... ... Huh?\nMaya:\nHow is this a picture of Will Powers?\nPhoenix:\nWell, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him.\nMaya:\nI don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]\nMaya:\nWhat does that mean?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe there's more photo data from that day?\nMaya:\nNope--that's the only one in the computer.\nPowers's{?} Photo added to the Court Record.\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial?\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nMaya:\nWe'll put that security lady in her place with this!\nPhoenix:\nRight, we'll put her in her place...\nMaya:\nHey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says!\nPhoenix:\nWait. Let's not.\nMaya:\nWhy not?\nPhoenix:\nIt's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon.\nMaya:\nNick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate!\nPhoenix:\nHey! Why do I have to be the villain.\nMaya:\nRelax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?\nPhoenix:\nI think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...?\nTo be continued.\nBefore selecting \"ST1-307\" upon examining computer in Global Studios - Main Gate:\nOctober 16Studio One\nMaya:\nNo one's here. I wonder if the security lady got mad at that assistant?\nPhoenix:\nHmm. That's definitely a possibility.\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.\n-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, I haven't said anything yet!)\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know I'm not pointing fingers at anyone behind their backs! Everything I've said is on the straight and narrow! The up and up! Youth today! Always whining about each other, pointing fingers this way and that! It's enough to make an old lady want to cry...\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness!\nPhoenix:\n(I think Edgeworth has met his match...)Oldbag:\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho was present at the run-through?\nOldbag:\nWell, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me.\nJudge:\nAnd what exactly were you doing?\nOldbag:\nObserving! Just... observing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the assistant?\nOldbag:\nOh, she was off moving backdrops around and such.\nPhoenix:\n(So she didn't see the run-through, then...)Oldbag:\nI saw Powers trip and fall!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Trip and fall\"...?\nOldbag:\nYes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.\nJudge:\nYou... helped make it better?\nOldbag:\nI kissed it where it hurt.\nJudge:\nL-let's just skip over that part, shall we?\nPhoenix:\nWhere was the assistant then?\nOldbag:\nOh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nEdgeworth:\nYou may continue your testimony.Oldbag:\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did! His own Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\n(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)\nOldbag:\nLuckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.\nPhoenix:\n(This strikes me as a significant detail... I'd better write this down in the Court Record.)\nSamurai Spear updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did! His own Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\n(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)\nOldbag:\nLuckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.\nPhoenix:\n(This strikes me as a significant detail...)Oldbag:\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas Mr. Power's [sic] ankle badly sprained?\nOldbag:\nNot so bad that he couldn't walk around. He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch.\nPhoenix:\n(Thus the nap...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked.\nPhoenix:\n(Dragging his foot... okay.)Oldbag:\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...)\nJudge:\nHmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot.\nOldbag:\nSee! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper!Oldbag:\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nStill, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!\nJudge:\nHe has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers.\nPhoenix:\n(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)Maya:\nWell, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?Phoenix:\nWell, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...After pressing second or third statement, then pressing fourth statement:Edgeworth:\nI think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?Judge:\nWell, there is one thing that bothers me.Edgeworth:\nWhich is?Judge:\nWhere is this \"Steel Samurai\" costume now?Edgeworth:\nUmm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nAnyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!Judge:\nHmm... I suppose that's right.Phoenix:\n(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)Object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHold it right there!

    "response": "The contradiction arises from the testimony that no one else entered the studio because the security camera and gate area were monitored closely by the Security Lady. However, according to the Powers's(?) Photo evidence, the picture of the Steel Samurai was taken at 2:00 PM on October 15th, which suggests that someone else could have been moving around the studio area at a time close to the murder. This photo undermines the reliability of the testimony that she would have definitely seen anyone who came in or left during that time, as there’s at least one instance where someone's identity was likely confused.\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 3}",

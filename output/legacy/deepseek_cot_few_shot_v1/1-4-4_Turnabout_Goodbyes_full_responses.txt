Alright, let's tackle this question step by step. We need to find a contradiction between one of the evidences and one of the testimonies provided. Let's start by reviewing all the evidence and testimonies to see where they might conflict.

First, looking at the testimonies. The testimonies here are all from Larry Butz (Testimony 0 to 5). Let's go through each one:

- Testimony 0: Larry was out in a boat on the lake that night.
- Testimony 1: He found something he was looking for.
- Testimony 2: He quietly slipped the boat back at the rental dock.
- Testimony 3: He heard a "bang" just as he was thinking about going home.
- Testimony 4: He looked out over the lake but didn't notice the boat.
- Testimony 5: After hearing a single gunshot, he went home.

Now, let's look at the evidences. Some key points here:

- Evidence 3 (Robert's Autopsy Report): Time of death is between 24th or 25th, cause is a bullet to the heart from about one meter away.
- Evidence 4 (Lake Photo): Taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Click for details. (Assuming this photo might show something relevant)
- Evidence 10 (Pistol): The murder weapon, 22-caliber, fired 3 times, with Edgeworth's prints.
- Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition): She heard two gunshot-like sounds just after midnight on 12/25.
- Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo): Shows an empty lake taken on 12/24 at 11:50 PM.
- Evidence 20 (Letter from the Safe): Details the murder setup, mentions revenge on Edgeworth.

Now, looking for contradictions. Let's see. Larry's testimony mentions hearing a single gunshot (Testimony 5), but Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) states she heard two sounds like gunshots. That's a direct contradiction. Larry says one shot, Lotta says two. However, Lotta's deposition is evidence, not testimony. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 5 (Butz's claim of a single shot) and Evidence 11 (Lotta's statement of two shots). 

Alternatively, considering the Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times. If the murder required three shots, but Larry heard only one, that's another contradiction. Wait, the autopsy says one bullet killed Robert, but the pistol was fired three times. So maybe the number of shots fired vs. what was heard. But Larry's testimony 5 says he heard a single gunshot. However, the pistol has been fired three times. So if the gun was fired three times, but Larry only heard once, that's a contradiction. But the user needs to find one pair: evidence and testimony.

So possible pairs:

1. Testimony 5 (Butz says one shot) vs Evidence 11 (Lotta heard two). But Lotta's deposition is evidence 11, and Butz's testimony is testimony 5. So that's a contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 11.

Another possibility: The pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times, which would mean three shots, but Butz only heard one. So Testimony 5 vs Evidence 10.

Alternatively, the autopsy report (Evidence 3) states the cause was a single bullet, which matches the three shots (if two missed and one hit). But that's not a direct contradiction. 

Wait, the murder weapon (Evidence 10) was fired three times. So three shots were fired. But Larry's testimony says he heard a single gunshot. So if three shots were fired, how come Larry only heard one? Unless there's another explanation, like two shots being silenced or something else. But that's a possible contradiction.

But the user's previous examples show contradictions like autopsy report location of wound vs testimony's description. So in the previous answers, the testimony says bullet hit the forehead, but autopsy says temple. So here, if the testimony says one shot heard, but the gun was fired three times, and perhaps the camera (Evidence 2) took a photo that shows something else.

Wait, Evidence 2 is Lotta's Camera, set to take a picture when a loud noise is detected. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) was taken at 12:15 AM on 12/25. The Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) is from 11:50 PM on 12/24, showing an empty lake. If the camera was triggered by loud noises, then each shot would trigger a photo. If the pistol was fired three times, there should be three photos? But Evidence 4 and 16 are two photos. Maybe the times don't align. Let me check.

Evidence 16 is taken at 11:50 PM on 12/24 (Second Lake Photo), shows empty lake. Evidence 4 is taken at 12:15 AM on 12/25. The camera is triggered by loud noises. So if three shots were fired, perhaps three photos? But only two are listed here. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, Lotta's deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard two shots. So if the camera was triggered by each loud noise, then there should be two photos (assuming the third shot wasn't loud enough, but that's speculative). 

But focusing on the direct contradictions: Testimony 5 by Butz states he heard a single shot. Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition) states she heard two. That's a direct contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 11. Alternatively, if the Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times, but Butz heard only one, that's another contradiction. However, the problem is the user wants only one pair. In previous examples, they paired the testimony about the bullet location with the autopsy report. Similarly here, the number of shots heard versus reported.

So the answer should be {"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5} because Testimony 5 (Butz says one shot) contradicts Evidence 11 (Lotta heard two). Alternatively, if the Pistol (Evidence 10) being fired three times contradicts the single shot heard. But in the case of the pistol, it's possible that three shots were fired but only one was heard because the others were muffled or something. However, Lotta's testimony as evidence directly states two shots, which directly contradicts Butz's testimony of one. So that's a clearer contradiction.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 5 states, "So after I heard that single gunshot I went home." However, Evidence 11, "Lotta's Deposition," states she heard "two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25," directly contradicting the number of shots heard.
{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's tackle this problem. First, I need to look through the characters, evidences, and testimonies provided to find contradictions. The goal is to find one pair where an evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

Starting with the characters, there's Maya Fey, Miles Edgeworth, Dick Gumshoe, and others involved in a case related to the DL-6 Incident. The evidences include things like autopsy reports, photos, a pistol, and testimonies from Larry Butz.

Looking at the testimonies, Testimony 5 by Larry Butz says: "Just when she said 'Hey! It's almost Christmas!' I heard the gunshot!" So Larry claims he heard a gunshot right when the DJ mentioned Christmas approaching. 

Now, checking the evidences related to the timing. Evidence 3 is the Autopsy Report for Robert Hammond. It states the time of death as sometime on the 24th or 25th. But more importantly, Evidence 11 is Lotta's Deposition, which says she heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. Also, Evidence 4 is the Lake Photo taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Evidence 16 is the Second Lake Photo taken on 12/24 at 11:50 PM. 

Wait, Larry's Testimony 5 mentions the gunshot when the DJ said "It's almost Christmas!" which would be just before midnight on Christmas Eve (24th). But Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard the gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. So if the gunshot Larry heard was on Christmas Eve before midnight, but the actual murder's time of death is on the 25th, then there's a contradiction. 

Additionally, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) says time of death is 24th or 25th, but the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) is taken at 12:15 AM on the 25th, which would be just after midnight. If Larry heard the gunshot before midnight (on the 24th), but the murder happened after midnight (25th), then his testimony about the timing contradicts the evidence. 

Moreover, Evidence 10 is the Pistol, which was fired 3 times. Larry's testimony mentions one gunshot, but Lotta's deposition mentions two. But maybe that's not directly contradictory. The key contradiction is the timing. The DJ's comment "It's almost Christmas" would be just before midnight on the 24th, but the actual murder, according to the photo timestamp and Lotta's testimony, was after midnight on the 25th. Therefore, Larry's testimony about hearing the gunshot on the 24th contradicts the evidence showing the murder occurred on the 25th.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 5 states, "Just when she said 'Hey! It's almost Christmas!' I heard the gunshot!" This implies the gunshot occurred just before midnight on 12/24. However, Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) shows a photo taken at 12:15 AM on 12/25, and Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition) mentions gunshots "just after midnight on 12/25," indicating the murder occurred on the 25th. This contradicts Larry's claim of hearing the shot on the 24th.
{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 5}

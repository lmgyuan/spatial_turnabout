Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. Let's start by looking at the testimonies and the evidence provided.

First, the testimonies are all from Acro. He's talking about his ability to lift the bust and whether he could have committed the crime. Testimony 0 says he could have lifted the bust. Testimony 1 mentions he has a strong upper body but injured legs. Testimony 2 states that lifting the bust and looking out the window was impossible. Testimony 3 says he couldn't exert force on his lower body. Testimony 4 and 5 argue that he couldn't have known where the Ringmaster's head was, making it unrealistic to drop the bust on him.

Now, looking at the evidence. Let's check the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11): the cause of death is blunt force trauma to the back of the head. The bust (Evidence 15) is a heavy bronze statue that was taken from the cafeteria. There's also the wooden box (12) and seasoning bottle (13) with pepper, which connects to the scarf (19) stained with pepper. 

Hmm, the key contradiction might be in Acro's claim that he couldn't have dropped the bust because he couldn't see where the Ringmaster's head was. But maybe there's evidence that contradicts this. The Crime Photo (2) shows the victim's footprints leading to where he was found. If the bust was dropped from above, like a window, maybe Acro could have seen him from there. But he says he couldn't look out the window (Testimony 2). Wait, the Circus Map (6) shows that Acro is on the third floor of the lodging house. If the crime scene is in the plaza, maybe he could have looked down from his window. But he claims lifting the bust and looking out the window was impossible. 

Wait, the bust is heavy (15), so if he's strong in the upper body (Testimony 1), maybe he could lift it. But Testimony 2 says he couldn't lift it and look out the window. However, if he was on the third floor, perhaps the window's position allowed him to drop the bust without needing to look out much. Or maybe there's evidence that the bust was indeed dropped from above, which would require looking out. 

Wait, the Autopsy Report says the injury was to the back of the head. If the bust was dropped from above, hitting the back of the head, the positioning would require the victim to be facing away from the window. So maybe Acro could have seen the victim's position. But he says he couldn't have known the location of the head (Testimony 4). However, if the victim was standing in a specific spot, maybe Acro could have anticipated that. 

Alternatively, the note (16) lured the Ringmaster to the plaza at 10 PM. If Acro knew about the meeting, he could have planned to drop the bust when the Ringmaster was there. But he claims he couldn't have known where the head was. However, the note might indicate that the meeting place was known, so Acro would know where to aim. That could contradict his testimony that he couldn't know the head's location. But how does that tie to evidence?

Wait, the Wooden Box (12) was locked with a key, and the seasoning bottle (13) inside has pepper. The Scarf (19) has pepper stains, linking Bat's accident. Maybe that's part of the motive. But the key contradiction here is between Acro's testimony and a piece of evidence. 

Looking at Testimony 4: "There's no way I could have known the location of the Ringmaster's head." But if the victim was lured to a specific spot via the note (Evidence 16), which says to meet at the lodging house plaza at 10 PM, then Acro could have anticipated where the Ringmaster would be. Thus, he would know where to drop the bust. Therefore, Testimony 4 is contradicted by Evidence 16, the Note, which sets the meeting location. That means Acro's claim that he couldn't know the head's location is false because the note specifies the meeting spot. So the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (Acro) and Evidence 16 (Note).

Wait, but the Note was torn by the Ringmaster and found in his pocket. So the Ringmaster received the note and went to the plaza. If Acro wrote the note, he would know exactly where the Ringmaster would be. Therefore, Acro's testimony that he couldn't know the location is contradicted by the note's existence, which set up the meeting place. Therefore, Evidence 16 (Note) contradicts Testimony 4.

Let's think step by step:
Acro's Testimony 4 claims he couldn't have known where the Ringmaster's head was, making dropping the bust impossible. However, Evidence 16 (Note) lured the Ringmaster to the lodging house plaza at 10 PM, implying the killer knew his location. This contradiction exposes Acro's testimony as false.

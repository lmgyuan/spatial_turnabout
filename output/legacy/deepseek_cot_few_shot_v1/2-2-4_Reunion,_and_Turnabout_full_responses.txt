Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to look at the characters, evidence, and testimonies provided to find a contradiction between a piece of evidence and a testimony.

The characters include Maya Fey, Dr. Turner Grey, Ini Miney, and others. The evidence includes autopsy reports, weapons, photos, and various other items. The testimonies are from Ini Miney, mainly talking about her experience during the channeling.

Looking at the testimonies, Testimony 2 from Ini states, "It was, like, oh my gawd, totally my sister!" She claims that the person who entered the room was her sister, Mimi Miney. However, according to Evidence 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2), Mimi Miney died a year ago in a car accident. If Mimi is dead, she couldn't have entered the room unless it was a channeling. But the channeling chamber's state and other evidence might contradict this. 

Wait, but the autopsy report for Dr. Grey (Evidence 8) says he was stabbed and then shot. The pistol (Evidence 9) has Maya's and Grey's prints. Also, the Sacred Urn (Evidence 14) was broken and under repair, which might affect channeling. 

Ini's Testimony 2 claims she saw her sister, who is deceased. However, channeling requires the urn to be intact, which it wasn't at the time. The Sacred Urn was broken and under repair, so channeling Mimi's spirit wouldn't have been possible. Therefore, Ini couldn't have seen her sister's spirit, making her testimony contradict the evidence about the urn's condition.

Let's think step by step:
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 2 states, "It was, like, oh my gawd, totally my sister!" However, Evidence 6, which is "Newspaper Clipping 2," states that Mimi Miney died in a car accident one year prior. Since channeling requires the Sacred Urn (Evidence 14), which was broken and under repair at the time, channeling Mimi's spirit would be impossible, contradicting Ini's claim of seeing her sister.
{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 2}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to identify which evidence and testimony contradict each other based on the provided information. Let's start by reviewing the characters, evidences, and testimonies.

The characters include various individuals like Maya Fey, Dr. Turner Grey, Ini Miney, and others. The key evidence here seems to relate to the car accident involving Ini and her sister Mimi, as well as the murder of Dr. Grey. 

Looking at the testimonies, Ini Miney gives several statements (Testimonies 0 to 6) about the car accident. Let me focus on these. 

In Testimony 6, Ini states, "I, like, didn't have my license, so, like, I couldn't take over driving for her." This implies that Ini wasn't driving because she didn't have a license, so her sister Mimi was driving instead. 

Now, looking at the evidence, Evidence 6 is a newspaper clipping that describes the car accident. The clipping mentions that Mimi Miney was the driver and died in the crash. However, there's also Evidence 18: the License Photo, which is Ini's driver's license photo described as "Ini's photo for her driver's license. Director Hotti's treasured possession." 

Wait, if Evidence 18 shows that Ini had a driver's license (as it's her license photo), then her Testimony 6 where she claims she didn't have a license and thus couldn't drive contradicts this evidence. If she had a license, she could have taken over driving, which would mean her testimony is false. 

So the contradiction here is between Testimony 6 (Ini saying she didn't have a license) and Evidence 18 (her having a driver's license photo). This suggests that Ini is lying about not having a license, which could imply she was actually the one driving, leading to the accident where her sister died.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 6}
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The answer should be one pair in JSON format. Let's start by going through the characters, evidences, and testimonies provided.

First, the characters. There are several, but the main ones involved here seem to be Ini Miney (Character 6) and Mimi Miney (Character 7), who is deceased. The key evidence and testimonies might revolve around the car accident involving Mimi. 

Looking at the evidences, Evidence 6 is a newspaper clipping about the car accident where Mimi died. The description says that according to the article, Mimi was driving, and she fell asleep at the wheel, leading to the crash where she died. Ini was the passenger and survived. However, the testimony from Ini (Testimony 4) states, "She, like, would say things like, 'No way am I letting a newb drive my car!'" followed by Testimony 5 where Ini says she ended up in the passenger seat. 

But wait, if Mimi was the one who wouldn't let Ini drive, implying Mimi was driving, that's what the newspaper says. But another piece of evidence might contradict this. Let me check other evidences. Evidence 18 is a License Photo of Ini's driver's license. If Ini had a license around the time of the accident, which was a year ago, but Testimony 0 from Ini says, "Like, around that time, I was, like, really close to getting my license." So if the accident happened a year ago and she was still getting her license then, but Evidence 18 shows she has a license photo now. However, this might not directly contradict unless there's something else.

Wait, looking at Evidence 6's detailed description: The newspaper article says that according to Ini's interview, Mimi was driving. But if Ini had her license around that time (as per Testimony 0), which was a year ago, but Testimony 4 and 5 imply that Mimi was driving because she wouldn't let Ini drive. But if Ini was getting her license at the time, maybe she didn't have it yet. However, the contradiction could be that the newspaper says Mimi was driving, but perhaps there's evidence that Ini was actually the driver. Let me check Evidence 18 again. Evidence 18 is a driver's license photo of Ini, which is Director Hotti's treasured possession. If Ini had a license, that might mean she could drive, but according to her testimony, she was a newb (newbie) and Mimi wouldn't let her drive. However, the key contradiction might be elsewhere.

Wait, let me think again. The newspaper clipping (Evidence 6) states that the accident was caused by Mimi falling asleep at the wheel, leading to her death. However, Ini's testimonies (Testimony 0 to 5) suggest that Mimi was the driver. But if there's evidence that Ini was actually the driver, that would contradict. Alternatively, maybe the autopsy or another evidence shows something different. Wait, looking at Evidence 6's description again: The article mentions that Ini said she was the passenger and Mimi was driving, but then there's a question about it being a coincidence since Mimi was involved in the clinic malpractice. However, if there's evidence that Ini was the driver, that would contradict her testimony. 

Wait, the newspaper clipping (Evidence 6) says, "If Ms. Ini Miney is to be believed, the one driving the car was her sister, Mimi Miney." So Ini's testimony in the article claims Mimi was driving, but perhaps there's evidence that Ini was actually driving. Let me check other evidences. Evidence 15 is a Cloth Scrap with blood found in the incinerator. Maybe that's related to the car accident, but not directly. Evidence 18 is Ini's license photo. If the accident happened a year ago, and Testimony 0 says "around that time" (the time of the accident) she was close to getting her license, meaning she didn't have it yet. But if she now has a license (Evidence 18), that's not a contradiction. Wait, but the problem is that the newspaper article says Mimi was driving, but perhaps there's evidence that Ini was actually driving. Let me think again. If Ini was driving but lied about it, that would contradict evidence. How?

Wait, in the accident, if the driver died, but Ini survived, but if the driver was actually Ini, that would be a contradiction. But the article says Mimi died because she was driving. However, if there's evidence that the car was a right-hand drive (as in the UK, since Testimony 3 says the car was a special model from England). In right-hand drive cars, the driver's seat is on the right. If the accident happened and Ini escaped from the right door (as per the article), but if the car is right-hand drive, the driver's door would be on the right. So if Ini got out from the right door, that would mean she was the driver. But the article says Mimi was driving. That would be a contradiction. 

Wait, let me check the Evidence 6 description again: The article says, "I was like, still half-asleep, but I opened the right door and like, got out." If the car is a right-hand drive (from England), then the right door is the driver's side. So if Ini opened the right door to escape, that would mean she was in the driver's seat, implying she was driving. But the article says Mimi was driving. Therefore, the testimony in the article (as part of Evidence 6) contradicts Ini's claim in Testimony 5 that she was in the passenger seat. Therefore, the contradiction would be between Evidence 6 (newspaper clipping) and Ini's Testimony 5, where she says she was in the passenger seat, but the car's design suggests she was the driver. However, the problem is that the testimonies listed here are from Ini (Testimony 0-5), where Testimony 5 is her saying she ended up in the passenger seat. But according to the car's right-hand drive (from England, Testimony 3 says the car was a special model from England), the driver's seat is on the right. So if Ini opened the right door (driver's side) to escape, that implies she was driving, which contradicts her testimony that she was the passenger. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Ini saying she was in the passenger seat) and Evidence 6 (the newspaper article's implication based on the car's design that she was driving). 

But the user's answer needs to be a specific evidence and testimony pair. So the evidence would be 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2) and testimony 5 (Ini's Testimony 5). However, I need to verify the exact wording. Testimony 5 says, "So, like, that's why I ended up in the passenger's seat that night too." If the evidence (6) shows that the car was right-hand drive and she exited the right door (driver's side), then her being in the passenger seat (left side) would mean she exited the left door, but the article says she opened the right door. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Hence, the evidence 6 contradicts testimony 5.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 5 states, "So, like, that's why I ended up in the passenger's seat that night too." However, Evidence 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2) describes Ini escaping through the car's right door. If the car was a right-hand drive model (from England, per Testimony 3), the right door would be the driver’s side. This implies Ini was driving, contradicting her claim of being in the passenger seat.

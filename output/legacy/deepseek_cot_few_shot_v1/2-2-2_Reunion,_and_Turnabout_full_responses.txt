Okay, let's tackle this question. So, we have a bunch of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The answer needs to be in a JSON format at the end, but first, I need to figure out the contradiction.

First, I'll go through each testimony and see if any of them clash with the evidence provided. Let me start by listing out the testimonies and then cross-reference with the evidence.

Testimony 0: Gumshoe says there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence. That's vague, not sure yet.

Testimony 1: Gumshoe presents the costume Maya was wearing, which is covered in blood (Testimony 1 and 2). The evidence for that is Maya's Costume (Evidence 11) which mentions blood splatters and a bullet hole in the sleeve. So that lines up.

Testimony 3: Gumshoe states that the defendant (Maya) attacked and killed someone who wasn't fighting back. Now, looking at the evidence, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 8) says Dr. Grey was stabbed in the chest and then shot in the forehead at point-blank. The Pistol (Evidence 9) has two shots fired and has Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. The Knife (Evidence 10) has Maya's prints. However, if Maya attacked someone who wasn't fighting back, but the autopsy shows two different wounds (stab and gunshot), maybe there's a contradiction here. Wait, but both the knife and pistol have Maya's prints, which could imply she used both. But let me check more.

Wait, the Autopsy Report says he was stabbed first, then shot. The Pistol had two shots fired. But the testimony claims the victim wasn't fighting back. However, if he was stabbed and then shot, maybe there's a contradiction in the sequence. Alternatively, perhaps the key contradiction is elsewhere.

Looking at the testimonies again: Testimony 3 says Maya attacked someone not fighting back. But the autopsy shows he was stabbed and shot. If the victim was already stabbed, maybe he couldn't fight back, but the shooting would be after. But the presence of gunpowder residue (Evidence 8) suggests the shot was at point-blank, which could align with the testimony.

Hmm, maybe another angle. Let's check the other evidence. Evidence 11 (Maya's Costume) has a bullet hole in the sleeve and blood. If Maya was the one who shot Grey, how does that align with the testimony? Wait, the Pistol (Evidence 9) has Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. If Grey was shot with his own gun, maybe he was holding it, but the prints could be from handling. However, the testimony says the victim wasn't fighting back. If Grey had a gun, perhaps he was trying to defend himself, contradicting the testimony. But the Autopsy Report says he was stabbed first, then shot. So maybe after being stabbed, he was incapacitated, hence not fighting back when shot. That might not be a contradiction.

Wait, another angle: The bullet hole in Maya's costume (Evidence 11). If there's a bullet hole in her sleeve, that suggests she was shot at. But according to the Autopsy Report, Grey was shot in the forehead. So if Maya was wearing the costume with a bullet hole, maybe she was the one shot at. But the Pistol (Evidence 9) has two shots fired. If one shot was at Grey (killing him), and another shot went into Maya's sleeve, that would mean two shots. But the testimony from Gumshoe (Testimony 3) says the victim wasn't fighting back. If Grey was shot after being stabbed, maybe he couldn't fight back, so that aligns. But the presence of the bullet hole in Maya's sleeve might indicate a struggle, contradicting the idea that the victim wasn't fighting back. Wait, but if Grey was already stabbed, maybe he couldn't fight back. Alternatively, if the gun was fired twice, once hitting Grey and once hitting Maya's sleeve, but the testimony says the victim (Grey) wasn't fighting back. So the contradiction might be between the Autopsy Report's gunpowder residue (indicating point-blank shot) and the fact that Maya's sleeve has a bullet hole. If Grey was shot at point-blank, how did the bullet hole end up in Maya's sleeve? Unless the shot that hit her sleeve was from a different angle, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the key contradiction is between Testimony 3 and the Autopsy Report. Testimony 3 says the victim wasn't fighting back, but the Autopsy Report shows he was both stabbed and shot. If the stabbing came first, rendering him unable to fight back, then the shooting would align with the testimony. But perhaps the presence of gunpowder residue suggests he was shot at very close range, which would mean Maya had to be right next to him, which might contradict if he was already incapacitated. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's look at Evidence 12 and 13: Lotta's Photos. Photo 1 shows Maya in the chamber with Grey dead on the floor. Photo 2 shows Grey dead behind her. The fact that the photos were taken right after the gunshot suggests that Maya was present when he was shot. But if Grey was already stabbed, perhaps he was already down when shot. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Another angle: The folding screen (Evidence 4) has a bullet hole 8 inches off the ground, and the Clothing Box (Evidence 17) also has a bullet hole. Maybe the bullet trajectory is conflicting with something. If the gun was fired from a certain position, but the testimony says Maya shot him when he wasn't fighting back. Alternatively, the bullet in the screen and clothing box might indicate shots that missed, but the Pistol only had two shots fired. If two shots were fired, one hit Grey, and one hit Maya's sleeve, but the screen and clothing box also have bullet holes, that's a contradiction. But the Pistol (Evidence 9) says two shots were fired. So if there are three bullet holes (Grey's head, Maya's sleeve, and the screen/clothing box), that's a problem. But the screen and clothing box might be from a different incident or not related. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 states Maya attacked someone not fighting back, but if the victim was stabbed first, then shot, maybe the stabbing was the attack, and the shooting was when he was already down. So the contradiction might not be there.

Wait, maybe the key contradiction is between the Autopsy Report (stabbed then shot) and the Pistol evidence. The Pistol has two shots fired. If Grey was shot once (as per the Autopsy), then the second shot could be the one in Maya's sleeve. But the Autopsy Report says "shot in the forehead at point-blank. Gunpowder residue around bullet hole." So one shot to the forehead. The Pistol (Evidence 9) says two shots fired. So where's the second shot? If the second shot is the one in Maya's sleeve, then that's accounted for. But the presence of two shots would mean two bullets fired. The Autopsy Report only mentions one bullet wound (forehead). So if the second shot hit Maya's sleeve, then that's consistent. But the testimony says Maya attacked the victim who wasn't fighting back. If she shot him while he was already stabbed and incapacitated, that fits. So maybe no contradiction there.

Another possibility: The Knife (Evidence 10) has Maya's fingerprints. If Maya used the knife to stab Grey, then Testimony 3 says she attacked him when he wasn't fighting back. But the stab wound would be the initial attack. If Grey was not fighting back during the stabbing, that's possible. But maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Wait, looking back at the testimonies, Testimony 3 says "the defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back." The Autopsy Report states the cause of death is the bullet to the forehead. So the killing blow was the gunshot. If Grey was already stabbed, perhaps he was incapacitated, so when Maya shot him, he wasn't fighting back. That aligns. So maybe the contradiction is not here.

Looking elsewhere: Evidence 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2) says Mimi Miney died in a car crash, but the article quotes Ini Miney as saying she was the one driving. Wait, no: The article says, "If Ms. Ini Miney is to be believed, the one driving the car was her sister, Mimi Miney." But Mimi was the nurse who died. So Ini survived, but the driver was Mimi. However, in the driver's license photo (Evidence 18), it's Ini's photo. Maybe a contradiction here? But Ini's license would be hers, but she claims Mimi was driving. If Mimi was driving, but the license is Ini's, perhaps there's a contradiction. But how does that relate to the testimonies? The testimonies in question are from Gumshoe, not related to Ini or Mimi directly. So maybe that's not the contradiction we're looking for.

Wait, the key is to find a testimony (from the given list) that contradicts an evidence. The testimonies are all from Gumshoe. Let's focus on Testimony 3 again. The Autopsy Report says the victim was stabbed then shot. If the killing blow was the gunshot, then Testimony 3 claims Maya killed him when he wasn't fighting back. That could align if after the stabbing, he couldn't fight back. But the evidence (Pistol) has Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. If Grey's prints are on the gun, maybe he was holding it, implying he was trying to defend himself, which would contradict Testimony 3's claim that he wasn't fighting back. So if Grey's fingerprints are on the gun, he might have been holding it, suggesting a struggle. Therefore, Testimony 3 says he wasn't fighting back, but the presence of his prints on the gun suggests he was. That would be a contradiction.

So Evidence 9 (Pistol) has Grey's fingerprints, implying he handled the gun, possibly in self-defense, contradicting Testimony 3 which says he wasn't fighting back. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 9 and Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies. Let me start by going through all the testimonies and then check the evidence to see where there's a conflict.

Looking at the testimonies provided by Gumshoe (Testimony 0 to 4):

Testimony 0: During the channeling, the defendant (Maya) saw her chance to stab the victim (Dr. Grey) in the chest.
Testimony 1: The victim fought back with his last strength.
Testimony 2: The victim took out his gun during the fight.
Testimony 3: The victim fired a shot but missed because they were too close.
Testimony 4: The defendant took the gun and shot him.

Now, checking the evidence related to the murder. Let's look at the autopsy report (Evidence 8): Dr. Grey was stabbed in the chest first, then shot in the forehead at point-blank range with gunpowder residue, indicating a close-range shot. The pistol (Evidence 9) has two shots fired, with Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. The knife (Evidence 10) has Maya's prints. Maya's costume (Evidence 11) has blood splatter and a bullet hole in the sleeve. 

Testimony 3 says the victim shot but missed because they were too close. But the autopsy report says the victim was shot in the forehead at point-blank, which would mean the shot didn't miss. Also, if the shot was fired from very close (point-blank), it's unlikely he missed. Additionally, the gun has two shots fired. If Grey fired once and missed (as per Testimony 3), then Maya would have fired the second shot. But the autopsy says the fatal shot was to the forehead, which would be the second shot. However, the testimony says Grey fired once, missed, and then Maya took the gun and shot him. But the autopsy indicates that after being stabbed, he was shot, so the order is stab then shot. The contradiction here is that the testimony claims Grey missed his shot, but the autopsy shows he was shot point-blank, which would not be a miss. Alternatively, the bullet hole in Maya's sleeve (Evidence 11) suggests she was shot at, which would align with Testimony 3's claim that Grey fired and missed. However, the autopsy report states the victim was shot after being stabbed, which would mean the shot that killed him was from Maya. But the gunpowder residue on Grey's forehead suggests the shot was very close, which might conflict with the idea that Maya took the gun and shot him. Wait, but if Maya took the gun and shot him at point-blank, that's possible. Hmm.

Wait, the key contradiction might be in Testimony 3: "The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed." However, the autopsy report (Evidence 8) says the victim was shot in the forehead at point-blank. If Grey fired the gun and missed, but then Maya took the gun and shot him, then the bullet that hit him would be from Maya, but the autopsy says the bullet was fired at point-blank, which would match Maya shooting him. But the testimony says Grey missed his shot, but the gun has two shots fired. So perhaps the first shot was Grey's miss, and the second was Maya's kill. The bullet hole in Maya's sleeve (Evidence 11) would be from Grey's shot that missed. That could be consistent. But wait, the autopsy report says "stabbed in chest then shot at point-blank". So the order is stab first, then shot. If Grey was stabbed first, how could he then take out the gun and fire? That seems contradictory. Because if Maya stabbed him in the chest, he might not have the strength to fight back, take out the gun, and fire. But according to Testimony 0-4, the sequence is: Maya stabs Grey, Grey fights back, takes out the gun, fires and misses, then Maya takes the gun and shoots him. But the autopsy report states that the cause of death is a gunshot to the forehead after being stabbed. The problem here is that the order of events in the testimony suggests that the stabbing happened first, then the shooting. The autopsy confirms this order. However, the contradiction might be in the fact that the autopsy mentions gunpowder residue around the bullet hole, which indicates a very close shot. If Grey was the one who fired the first shot (missed), and then Maya took the gun and shot him, the fatal shot would be from Maya at close range, which matches the autopsy. So where's the contradiction?

Wait, maybe the contradiction is in Testimony 4: "The defendant then picked up on the opening and took the victim's gun, and ended it..." which implies that Maya took the gun and shot Grey. However, the Pistol (Evidence 9) has two shots fired and bears both Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. If Grey fired one shot (Testimony 3's missed shot), and Maya fired the second (killing him), that would align. But the problem arises with the gunpowder residue. If Grey was shot at point-blank, that would mean the gun was pressed against his forehead when fired. But if Maya shot him, she would have to be close enough to do that, which is possible. However, the testimony says Grey was shot after being stabbed. If he was already stabbed in the chest, would he be able to then take out the gun and fire? The autopsy report says he was stabbed first, then shot. So the order is correct. Maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Looking at the knife (Evidence 10): it's a small fruit knife belonging to the Feys, with Maya's prints. Testimony 0 says Maya stabbed him during the channeling. But if the channeling was happening, maybe there's a contradiction with the location. Let me check other evidence. The Folding Screen (Evidence 4) has a bullet hole 8 inches off the ground, which might relate to a missed shot. If the victim fired and missed, the bullet hole in the screen would be from that shot. Then Maya's sleeve has a bullet hole (Evidence 11), which could be from the same shot. So if the victim fired and missed, hitting the screen and Maya's sleeve, then Maya took the gun and shot him. That seems plausible. But the autopsy report's gunpowder residue would indicate the fatal shot was at point-blank, which is possible if Maya shot him after taking the gun. 

Wait, maybe the contradiction is in Testimony 3 stating that the victim missed because they were too close, but the presence of gunpowder residue on the victim's forehead (from Evidence 8) suggests that the fatal shot was fired at point-blank range, which wouldn't be a miss. But Testimony 3 is about the victim's shot missing, not the fatal shot. The fatal shot is Maya's, which is at point-blank. So perhaps there's no contradiction here. 

Alternatively, let's check the number of shots. The Pistol (Evidence 9) has two shots fired. Testimony 3 says the victim fired once and missed. Then Testimony 4 says Maya fired the second shot. That's two shots, which matches. So maybe no contradiction there. 

Wait, maybe the contradiction is in the order of injuries. The autopsy report says Dr. Grey was first stabbed, then shot. But the testimonies suggest that after the stabbing, Grey fought back, took out the gun, fired a shot (missed), and then Maya took the gun and shot him. That aligns with the autopsy. Hmm.

Looking elsewhere, maybe Testimony 0 says Maya stabbed him during the channeling. The Channeling Chamber's floor plan (Evidence 7) shows a four-sectioned mat. If the channeling was happening there, perhaps there's an alibi or location issue, but I don't see evidence contradicting that. 

Wait, Evidence 12 and 13 are Lotta's photos. Photo 1 shows Maya after the gunshot with Grey dead. Photo 2 shows Grey dead behind her. Maybe the positions, but not sure. 

Another angle: the knife (Evidence 10) has Maya's prints, which matches Testimony 0. The gun has both their prints, which makes sense if they both handled it. The blood on Maya's costume (Evidence 11) would be from the stabbing. The bullet hole in her sleeve could be from Grey's missed shot. 

Wait, but the autopsy says the victim was shot in the forehead. If Maya shot him after taking the gun, that's possible. The gunpowder residue indicates the shot was very close, which could be Maya shooting him. So where's the contradiction? 

Wait, maybe Testimony 3 says the victim fired a shot but missed because they were too close. However, firing a gun at point-blank range (which is what the autopsy suggests for the fatal shot) would not miss. But Testimony 3 is about the victim's shot missing, not the fatal one. So the victim's shot missed, hitting the folding screen or Maya's sleeve, and then Maya's shot was the fatal one. That seems consistent. 

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's check other evidence. Evidence 4 (Folding Screen) has a bullet hole 8 inches off the ground. If the victim was standing and fired downwards, maybe that's where the bullet hit. But the missed shot would have gone into the screen. The bullet in the screen would be the first shot (Grey's miss), and the second shot (Maya's) killed him. 

Wait, but the autopsy report says the victim was shot in the forehead. If Maya shot him, that's possible. So maybe there's no contradiction here. 

Let me look again. The key is to find a testimony that directly conflicts with an evidence. 

Wait, Testimony 4 says that Maya took the gun and "ended it", implying she shot him. The gun (Evidence 9) has two shots fired. If Grey fired once (missed), and Maya fired once (killing him), that's two shots. The autopsy confirms he was shot once. So that's consistent. 

Perhaps the contradiction is elsewhere. Let me check other testimonies. 

Testimony 0 says Maya stabbed him during the channeling. The Sacred Urn (Evidence 14) was broken by Pearl before the murder. If the channeling requires the urn, maybe that's an issue, but the urn was under repair. Not sure if that's relevant. 

Alternatively, the cloth scrap (Evidence 15) found in the incinerator with blood. Maybe relates to another person, but not sure. 

Wait, the Pistol (Evidence 9) has Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. If Grey was stabbed first, how did his fingerprints get on the gun? Because after being stabbed, he took out the gun, which would leave his prints. Then Maya took it, adding hers. That makes sense. 

The Knife (Evidence 10) has Maya's prints, which aligns with her stabbing him. 

Hmm. I'm struggling to find a contradiction here. Let me re-examine the question. The previous examples had direct contradictions, like the witness saying the bullet hit the forehead, but the autopsy says the temple. 

In this case, Testimony 4 says that Maya took the gun and "ended it," which would be the shot to the forehead. The autopsy report (Evidence 8) confirms the cause of death is a gunshot to the forehead. So that matches. Testimony 3 says Grey fired and missed. The folding screen's bullet hole (Evidence 4) and the bullet hole in Maya's sleeve (Evidence 11) could be from that missed shot. Then the second shot is the fatal one. 

Wait, but the autopsy report says the victim was first stabbed, then shot. The testimonies say Maya stabbed him, then during the struggle, Grey took out the gun, fired (missed), then Maya took the gun and shot him. That matches the autopsy's order of events. 

Is there another contradiction? Let me look at the number of shots. The Pistol (Evidence 9) had two shots fired. Testimony 3 and 4 account for two shots (Grey's miss and Maya's hit), which matches. 

Hmm. Maybe the contradiction is in the fact that the autopsy report says the victim was shot at point-blank, implying the shooter was very close, but if Maya took the gun from Grey, she would have had to be close, so that's possible. 

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is in Testimony 3: the victim fired a shot but missed because they were too close. But if they were too close, missing is less likely. However, the bullet hole in the folding screen 8 inches off the ground might suggest that the shot went low, which could happen if the gun was fired downwards or the victim was falling. 

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and the evidence. Testimony 0 says Maya stabbed him during the channeling. If the channeling requires the Sacred Urn, which was broken (Evidence 14), then channeling couldn't have happened. But the urn was under repair, so maybe channeling was still possible. 

Alternatively, the black key (Evidence 5) is mentioned but not tied to any testimony. 

Wait, the floor plans (Evidence 7) show the channeling chamber's layout. If the testimonies about the positions during the stabbing and shooting don't align with the floor plan, but I don't see explicit contradictions. 

Alternatively, maybe the time of death. The autopsy report doesn't mention the time conflicting with any testimony. 

Wait, the newspaper clipping (Evidence 6) mentions that Mimi Miney died in a car accident a year ago, but Ini Miney is alive and testifying. But the testimonies here are from Gumshoe about the murder, not related to the accident. 

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the evidence numbers again. 

The key contradiction might be between Testimony 3 (Grey's missed shot) and the Folding Screen's bullet hole (Evidence 4). If the bullet hole in the screen is 8 inches off the ground, and the victim was shot at point-blank in the forehead, maybe the trajectory doesn't match. But if Grey was lying down or something, it's possible. 

Alternatively, the bullet hole in Maya's costume (Evidence 11) is in the sleeve. If Grey fired and missed, hitting her sleeve, that would explain the hole. Then Maya shot him. The autopsy's gunpowder residue would be from her shot. 

I'm not seeing a clear contradiction here. Maybe I need to look again. 

Wait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 8) says the victim was stabbed in the chest, then shot in the forehead. The order is important. The testimonies from Gumshoe suggest that after the stabbing, Grey fought back, took out the gun, fired (missed), and then Maya shot him. This aligns with the autopsy's order. 

Wait, but the knife (Evidence 10) is a small fruit knife. If Maya stabbed him in the chest with a small knife, would that be sufficient to cause the injury described in the autopsy? The autopsy says "stabbed in the chest", which a fruit knife could do. 

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and the Pistol's evidence. Testimony 4 says Maya took the gun and ended it, which would mean she fired the fatal shot. The Pistol (Evidence 9) has two shots fired. If Grey fired once and Maya once, that's two. But the autopsy only mentions one gunshot wound. Wait, the autopsy says "stabbed in the chest then shot in the forehead". So only one gunshot. But the Pistol had two shots fired. So that's a contradiction. Because if two shots were fired, but the victim was only shot once, that suggests one shot hit (the fatal one) and one missed. But the autopsy only mentions the one fatal shot. So where is the second shot? The folding screen's bullet hole (Evidence 4) and the bullet hole in Maya's sleeve (Evidence 11) would account for the second shot. But the autopsy report doesn't mention a second bullet wound. So maybe that's the contradiction. 

Wait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 8) says "shot in the forehead at point-blank". It doesn't mention any other bullet wounds. So if the gun was fired twice, once missed (hitting the screen or sleeve) and once hit (the forehead), that's possible. The autopsy would only mention the fatal wound. So that's okay. 

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me try a different approach. The previous examples had a direct contradiction between a testimony's claim and an evidence's fact. For example, testimony says bullet hit forehead, evidence says right temple. 

Looking for a similar direct contradiction here. 

Testimony 3: "The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed." The missed shot is the first shot. Then the second shot is the fatal one. 

The Folding Screen (Evidence 4) has a bullet hole 8 inches off the ground. That could be the missed shot. 

Maya's Costume (Evidence 11) has a bullet hole in the sleeve. That could also be from the missed shot. But how can one shot create two holes? Unless the bullet passed through the sleeve and then hit the screen. But that's possible. 

Alternatively, the two shots fired (Evidence 9) would be the missed shot and the fatal shot. The autopsy only notes the fatal shot. 

I'm not seeing a direct contradiction here. 

Wait, maybe the Autopsy Report (Evidence 8) says the victim was shot after being stabbed. Testimony 0 says Maya stabbed him during the channeling. But if the channeling was happening, maybe there's an alibi. However, I don't see evidence that contradicts the channeling's timing. 

Wait, the Sacred Urn (Evidence 14) was broken by Pearl right before the murder and was under repair. If channeling requires the urn, and it's broken, then Maya couldn't have been channeling, contradicting Testimony 0. But Testimony 0 says "during the channeling", but if the urn was broken, channeling might not be possible. That could be a contradiction. 

Yes! The Sacred Urn (Evidence 14) was broken before the murder and under repair. If the urn is necessary for channeling, then Maya couldn't have been channeling at the time of the murder, which contradicts Testimony 0's claim that the stabbing happened during the channeling. 

So the contradiction is between Testimony 0 (stabbing during channeling) and Evidence 14 (Sacred Urn broken, making channeling impossible). 

Therefore, the correct answer is Evidence 14 and Testimony 0.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 0 claims the stabbing occurred "during the channeling." However, Evidence 14 (Sacred Urn) states it was broken by Pearl right before the murder and under repair, implying channeling was impossible. This contradicts the testimony's assertion that the stabbing happened during a channeling session.
{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 0}

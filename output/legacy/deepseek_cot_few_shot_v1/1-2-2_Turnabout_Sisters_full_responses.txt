Okay, let's take a look at the problem here. We have a bunch of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and we need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The answer should be in a JSON format with the evidence and testimony numbers.

First, let's list out the relevant information. The characters include Mia Fey, Maya Fey, Detective Gumshoe, and others. The evidences range from the murder weapon (The Thinker statue) to autopsy reports, memos, and a receipt. The testimonies are all from Gumshoe, talking about finding a memo with "Maya" written in blood, which he claims the victim wrote before dying.

Looking at the testimonies, specifically Testimony 5: "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!" If the victim wrote "Maya" in her own blood, that would point to Maya as the killer. But checking the evidence, let's see Evidence 5 is Mia's Autopsy Report. Wait, the autopsy report says the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, and death was instantaneous. However, there's another part in the description: "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Hmm, that's a bit conflicting. Wait, no, the description of Evidence 5 is a bit conflicting within itself. Wait, the actual Evidence 5 description says: "Time of death: 9/5 at 9:00PM. Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous. Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Wait, that seems contradictory. It says death was instantaneous, but also may have lived a few minutes. That's odd. But maybe that's a red herring. 

Wait, the key contradiction might be elsewhere. Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name (Maya) in blood. But if the victim died instantly, she couldn't have written anything after being hit. So, the autopsy report's initial statement that death was instantaneous would contradict the idea that she wrote the name. However, the autopsy report also mentions she may have lived a few minutes. Wait, the Evidence 5 description is conflicting. Let me check again:

Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report): "Time of death: 9/5 at 9:00PM. Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous. Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit."

Wait, so the report itself has conflicting info? Or maybe it's a typo. But in the context of the game, perhaps the initial conclusion was death was instantaneous, but the detailed analysis shows she might have lived a few minutes. If Testimony 5 says she wrote the name, but the autopsy says death was instantaneous, then that's a contradiction. However, the second part says "May have lived for a few minutes," which would allow her to write the name. But maybe that's a trick. Alternatively, looking at other evidence.

Wait, there's Evidence 3: Receipt. It's a receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder. But the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken glass light stand. Maybe the receipt shows when it was bought, but how does that relate to testimonies?

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 2 and 3 from Gumshoe: he found a memo with "Maya" written in the victim's blood. If the victim's death was instantaneous, she couldn't have written that. But the autopsy says "may have lived a few minutes," so maybe that's possible. Wait, but the key contradiction here is between the testimony that she wrote the name and the autopsy report's initial statement. Wait, but the autopsy report's first line says "Death was instantaneous," but then later contradicts itself by saying "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." That's a conflict within the evidence itself, but how does that relate to the testimony?

Alternatively, maybe the blood on the victim's finger (Testimony 4) and the memo written in blood. If the victim wrote the name, her finger would have blood, but the autopsy might show something else. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the memo isn't actually written by the victim. For instance, if someone else wrote it to frame Maya. But how does that tie into evidence?

Wait, Evidence 3 is the Receipt, which is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from that stand. If the murder weapon was The Thinker statue (Evidence 1), which is a clock with gears removed. So the actual murder weapon is The Thinker, not the glass stand. So perhaps the broken glass is a separate event. The receipt shows the purchase date, but maybe the glass was broken after the murder. But how does that contradict any testimony?

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the name, but the autopsy report's initial conclusion of instantaneous death would mean she couldn't have written it. However, the autopsy report's contradictory note about possibly living a few minutes complicates that. But in legal terms, if the prosecution claims she wrote it, but the autopsy suggests she died instantly, that's a contradiction. Alternatively, if the autopsy report's details (may have lived a few minutes) support the possibility, then no contradiction. But perhaps in the game's context, the initial statement in the autopsy is incorrect, and the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (she wrote it) and the fact that she couldn't have because of the instantaneous death. However, since the autopsy report itself has conflicting information, maybe the key contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 5's first part (instantaneous death), which would mean she couldn't write anything after being hit.

So, Testimony 5 (Gumshoe's Testimony 5) claims the victim wrote the name, but Evidence 5 (autopsy report) states death was instantaneous, thus she couldn't have written it. Therefore, they contradict each other.

Let's think step by step:
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states, "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!" However, Evidence 5, the "Mia's Autopsy Report," initially states that death was instantaneous from a blunt force trauma. If the victim died instantly, she could not have written anything post-injury, contradicting the testimony's claim.
{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a bunch of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The goal is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through each testimony and see if any of them clash with the provided evidence.

First, looking at the testimonies by April May. Testimony 1 says that the victim (Mia) dodged the first attack and ran to the right. Then, Testimony 3 claims that Maya hit her with the weapon. But let's check the autopsy report. Evidence 5, Mia's Autopsy Report, states that the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma and that death was instantaneous. However, the testimony from April (Testimony 1) mentions Mia dodging and running, which might imply she was alive for a bit longer. Wait, but the autopsy report also mentions that Mia "may have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Hmm, that seems conflicting. Wait, the autopsy report has a discrepancy in its own description. The first part says death was instantaneous, but then the additional info says she might have lived a few minutes. That's confusing. Maybe that's an error? Or perhaps the testimony contradicts this because Testimony 1 suggests Mia was moving after the initial attack, but according to the autopsy, the death was from a single blow. Wait, the autopsy says "single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous." Then the additional note says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." That's contradictory within the evidence itself. But the user is asking for a contradiction between a testimony and an evidence. Let me check again.

April's Testimony 1 says Mia dodged an attack and ran to the right, implying that there was an initial attack that missed, then Mia was chased and hit. But according to the autopsy, the cause was a single blow. If the attack that killed her was the second one, then that would mean two blows: the first missed, the second hit. But the autopsy says a single blow caused death. So Testimony 1 and 3 (two attacks) would contradict the autopsy report stating a single blow. But Testimony 4 also mentions "The Thinker" as the weapon, which is Evidence 1. The Thinker is the murder weapon, a clock statue. The autopsy says blunt force trauma. That part matches. So the contradiction is between April's testimony describing two attacks (dodged first, then hit) and the autopsy stating a single blow leading to death. Wait, but the testimony says that the first attack was dodged, then the second one hit. So the actual lethal blow was the second one. The autopsy says death was caused by a single blow, so that's consistent. But the autopsy also has conflicting information: "Death was instantaneous" vs "May have lived for a few minutes." Maybe the problem is with Testimony 1 and the Autopsy's time? Or perhaps another angle.

Wait, looking at Testimony 4 where April identifies the weapon as "The Thinker" (Evidence 1). The Thinker's description mentions that the clock's gears have been removed. If the gears were removed, maybe the statue was lighter or couldn't function as a clock, but does that affect the murder? Not sure. Let's check other evidences. Evidence 3 is a receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder. The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken light stand. Maybe the real murder weapon was the glass light stand, not The Thinker. If April Testimony 4 says the weapon was The Thinker, but the actual murder weapon was the glass light stand (as per Evidence 2 and 3), that would be a contradiction. But how does the autopsy report tie in? The autopsy says the cause was a blunt object, which both could be. The Thinker is a statue (blunt), and the glass stand, when broken, might have sharp edges, but the autopsy says blunt force. Hmm. Alternatively, the receipt shows that the glass stand was purchased the day before, and the glass shards are from that. If the murder weapon was the glass stand, then Testimony 4 is wrong, claiming it's The Thinker. So Evidence 3 (the receipt) and Testimony 4 (The Thinker as weapon) would contradict. But Evidence 1 (The Thinker) is the murder weapon according to the evidence list. Wait, the description of Evidence 1 says "the murder weapon. Looks like a statue, but it's actually a clock. Made by Larry Butz. Clock in the form of a statue. The clock's gears have been removed." So the game is saying that The Thinker is the murder weapon. But if the receipt and glass shards are from a glass light stand that was broken, perhaps that's the real weapon. But the game's evidence list says The Thinker is the murder weapon. So perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (identifying The Thinker) and Evidence 2 and 3 (glass shards and receipt). Wait, but the user is to pick one pair. Alternatively, the autopsy report says the death was instantaneous, but Testimony 1 says Mia dodged and ran, implying she was alive after the first attack. But if the lethal blow was the second one, and the autopsy says single blow, that's a contradiction. So Testimony 1 and 3 (two attacks) vs Evidence 5 (single blow). So the testimony claims there were two attacks (first dodged, second lethal), but the autopsy says death was from a single blow. Therefore, Testimony 1 (and 3) contradict Evidence 5. But which testimony specifically? Testimony 1 says victim dodged first attack and ran, then Testimony 3 says she was hit. So the testimonies together suggest two blows: one missed, one hit. The autopsy says single blow. So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (hit with the weapon) and the autopsy. Wait, no. If the first attack was dodged, then the second was the lethal one. So only one blow connected. But the testimony might imply two blows, but the autopsy says one. So maybe Testimony 1's description of the victim dodging and running suggests she was alive after the first attack, but the autopsy says death was instantaneous upon being hit. Wait, but the autopsy also says "may have lived for a few minutes after being hit." That's conflicting within the evidence. Hmm. Maybe the key contradiction is that the autopsy report says the cause was a single blow, but Testimony 1 and 3 imply that there were two separate attacks (the first dodged, the second hit). However, the single blow could be the one that hit, so maybe that's not contradictory. Alternatively, looking at Testimony 4 where April identifies the weapon as The Thinker statue. But if the real murder weapon was the glass light stand (Evidence 2 and 3), then Testimony 4 is wrong. But according to the evidence list, The Thinker is listed as the murder weapon. So perhaps the contradiction is elsewhere. Let me check all evidence and testimonies again.

Wait, Testimony 4: April says the weapon was The Thinker. Evidence 1 confirms that The Thinker is the murder weapon. So that's consistent. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a light stand, which was broken. The receipt (Evidence 3) is for the light stand bought the day before. Maybe the broken light stand is unrelated, or perhaps the real weapon was The Thinker, and the glass is a red herring. Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 1 and the autopsy's time of death. Testimony 1 says the victim ran to the right after dodging, implying movement after the first attack. But the autopsy says death was instantaneous, so she couldn't have moved after the lethal blow. However, if the lethal blow was the second one, then the movement happened before the lethal blow. Wait, but the autopsy says the cause was a single blow. So if the lethal blow was the second attack, that's a single blow. So Testimony 1's description of Mia dodging and running would be before the lethal blow. So that's possible. But then the autopsy's note that she may have lived a few minutes after being hit could mean that after the lethal blow, she survived briefly, which contradicts the "instantaneous" part. That's a contradiction within the evidence itself, but the user wants a contradiction between evidence and testimony. Alternatively, the key contradiction is in the Autopsy Report's time of death versus the testimony. The autopsy says time of death is 9:00 PM. If the testimonies about the events happening at a certain time contradict that, but there's no time mentioned in the testimonies. Alternatively, looking at Testimony 9 (May Testimony), which is listed as Evidence 9: "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." Wait, Evidence 9 is named "May Testimony" and its description is a quote. But in the testimonies section, Testimony 0 to 4 are April's. So Evidence 9 is a separate testimony by May? Wait, the user might have a typo. Wait, in the Testimonies section, Testimony 0 to 4 are all by April. Evidence 9 is "May Testimony" which is a separate testimony, but not listed in the testimonies section. Maybe that's a mistake in the input. Alternatively, perhaps Evidence 9 is part of the evidence, not a testimony. The user might have mixed up the sections. In any case, according to the given data, the Testimonies are 0-4 by April, and the Evidences include "May Testimony" as Evidence 9. So Evidence 9's description is "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." This is similar to April's Testimony 1 and 2. But if Evidence 9 (May Testimony) says the victim was struck after running, and the autopsy says death was instantaneous, that could contradict. But I'm getting confused. Let me focus on the given testimonies and evidences.

The key point is to find a testimony (from the Testimonies list) that contradicts an evidence. The previous examples had contradictions like testimony claiming not touching the murder weapon vs evidence showing fingerprints, or testimony stating the bullet hit the forehead vs autopsy showing temple wound.

In this case, looking at Testimony 1 by April: "The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right." Then Testimony 3: "And she hit her with that weapon!" So April is saying there were two actions: a dodged attack, then a successful hit. The autopsy report (Evidence 5) states that the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, and death was instantaneous. However, the additional note in Evidence 5 says, "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Wait, that's conflicting. The main description says death was instantaneous, but the note suggests she survived a few minutes. That's an internal contradiction in the evidence. But the user is looking for a contradiction between a testimony and an evidence. So perhaps April's Testimony 1 and 3 together imply that there were two separate attacks (first dodged, second lethal), which would mean the victim was hit once. The autopsy says single blow, which matches. But the issue might be the time between the attack and death. If the testimony says Mia ran after dodging, then was hit and died instantly, but the autopsy's note says she may have lived a few minutes, that would contradict. However, the testimony doesn't specify the time between the hit and death. Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is that the murder weapon in Testimony 4 (The Thinker) is supposed to have had its gears removed (Evidence 1), making it lighter or different, but the autopsy report's description of the injury might require a heavier object. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 3: the receipt for the glass light stand purchased the day before. Evidence 2 is the glass shards from a broken light stand. If the murder weapon was actually the glass light stand, then Testimony 4's claim that it was The Thinker would be false. So Evidence 2 and 3 (glass shards and receipt) would contradict Testimony 4. But according to the evidence list, Evidence 1 is explicitly the murder weapon. So maybe the game is indicating that The Thinker is the murder weapon, but the glass shards are a red herring. So perhaps the real contradiction is between Testimony 4 (identifying The Thinker) and the glass shards being the actual weapon, but since the evidence list says The Thinker is the murder weapon, that's not the case. Therefore, the contradiction must be elsewhere.

Wait, let's check the autopsy report again. The main description says "Death caused by a single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous." But the additional note says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." This is a conflict within the evidence itself. But the user wants a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony. So perhaps Testimony 1 and 3, which imply that Mia was moving after an initial attack (dodging and running), and then was struck, which would mean she was alive after the first attack and then died from the second. But the autopsy says single blow. So if the lethal blow was the second one, that's one blow. So the number of blows matches. However, the note in the autopsy says she may have lived a few minutes after being hit, which would mean that after the lethal blow, she survived briefly. But the testimony says she was hit and then presumably died immediately (since Testimony 3 says "she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!"). If the autopsy note says she lived a few minutes, that contradicts Testimony 3's implication of immediate death. Alternatively, the testimony doesn't specify the time between the hit and death. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, Testimony 4 by April says the weapon was The Thinker, which is Evidence 1. Evidence 1's description mentions that the clock's gears have been removed. If the gears were removed, perhaps the statue was lighter and couldn't cause the blunt force trauma described. But that's a stretch. The game's logic might be that the statue is heavy enough even without gears.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 1 says the victim dodged the first attack and ran to the right. If the autopsy report says death was instantaneous upon being hit, then after being hit, she couldn't have run. But Testimony 1 describes her dodging (so the first attack missed), then running, then being hit. The hit would be the lethal blow. So the running happens before the lethal blow. The autopsy's note about living a few minutes after being hit would mean that after the lethal blow, she survived a few minutes. But the testimony doesn't mention her moving after being hit. So maybe there's no contradiction there.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (identifying The Thinker as the weapon) and Evidence 1's description that the clock's gears were removed. If the gears were removed, maybe the statue was not functional as a clock, but that doesn't affect it being a weapon. So no contradiction there.

Wait, let's check Evidence 5's time of death: 9/5 at 9:00 PM. Are there any testimonies about the time? The testimonies don't mention specific times, so that's not it.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 0: April says "I did see everything! I did!" But Evidence 7 is a wiretap found in her hotel room. If she was being wiretapped, maybe she's lying about witnessing the events. But that's more of a credibility issue, not a direct contradiction between testimony and evidence.

Wait, Evidence 12 is the Bellboy's Affidavit describing the man who stayed with Miss May in the hotel. If April was with someone else, maybe she wasn't at the scene. But that's not a direct contradiction with her testimony.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 1's description of the victim running to the right after dodging, and the Floor Plans (Evidence 8). If the floor plan shows that running to the right was impossible, then that's a contradiction. But without seeing the floor plan details, we can't confirm. The user hasn't provided the details for Evidence 8, just the name.

Hmm. This is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to summarize:

Possible contradictions:

1. Testimony 1 (dodged first attack, ran) and Testimony 3 (hit) imply two attacks, but the autopsy (Evidence 5) says single blow. But if the first attack missed and the second was the only hit, then the single blow is accounted for. So no contradiction here.

2. Testimony 4 (The Thinker as weapon) vs glass shards (Evidence 2) and receipt (Evidence 3) suggesting the light stand was the weapon. But Evidence 1 explicitly states The Thinker is the murder weapon, so this is not a contradiction.

3. Autopsy report's note about surviving a few minutes vs Testimony 3 implying immediate death. But the testimony doesn't specify the time after the hit.

4. The wiretap (Evidence 7) in April's room suggesting she might be lying, but that's not a direct contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 9 is May Testimony, which is described as "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." This is similar to April's testimony. If the autopsy says single blow, then this is consistent if the strike was once. But the problem arises if the autopsy says death was instantaneous, but the victim was struck after running, implying she was alive long enough to be chased. However, the autopsy's note says she may have lived a few minutes after being hit. If the lethal blow was the strike that killed her, then her running before that doesn't contradict the autopsy. The time after the hit is the issue. But the testimony doesn't mention how long she lived after being hit. So maybe no contradiction there.

Wait, another angle: The Thinker (Evidence 1) is described as a clock statue with gears removed. If the murder weapon had to have gears to be heavy enough, but they were removed, making it lighter, but the autopsy requires a heavy blunt object. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, looking back at previous examples, the contradiction was between the location of the wound (forehead vs temple) or the murder weapon's ownership (prints on it vs denial). Here, the key contradiction might be the number of blows. April's testimony implies two attacks (first dodged, second lethal), but the autopsy says single blow. Wait, but the single blow is the lethal one. The first attack missed. So the total blows are two, but only one connected. The autopsy says cause of death is a single blow. So that's consistent. Therefore, no contradiction.

Alternatively, the time of death. The autopsy says 9:00 PM. If the testimonies suggest the murder happened at a different time, but the testimonies don't mention time.

Hmm. I'm not finding a clear contradiction here. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's check the evidence and testimonies again.

Evidence 5: Mia's Autopsy Report: Time of death 9/5 at 9:00 PM. Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous. Note: May have lived for a few minutes.

Testimony 1: Victim dodged first attack, ran to the right.

Testimony 3: Hit with the weapon.

So the sequence is: Attack 1 (missed), victim runs, Attack 2 (hit, lethal). Autopsy says single blow (the lethal one), which matches. The note in the autopsy about living a few minutes after the hit could mean she didn't die instantly, contradicting the main part of the autopsy. But that's internal to the evidence. The user is to find a testimony and evidence that contradict.

Wait, the main part of Evidence 5 says "death was instantaneous," but the note says "may have lived a few minutes." This is a contradiction within the evidence. But the user is looking for a contradiction between testimony and evidence. So perhaps the testimony that the victim ran after the first attack (Testimony 1) and the autopsy's note that she lived a few minutes after being hit. But Testimony 1 is about events before the lethal blow. The lethal blow is the second attack. The note in the autopsy refers to after the lethal blow. So if the lethal blow was at 9:00 PM, and she lived a few minutes, then the time of death would be around 9:03 PM. But the autopsy says 9:00 PM. That's a contradiction. So the testimony's implication that she was alive after the hit (if the note is true) contradicts the time of death being 9:00 PM. But this is getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (The Thinker as the weapon) and the Glass Shards (Evidence 2). If the murder weapon was the glass light stand, then Testimony 4 is wrong. But Evidence 1 says The Thinker is the murder weapon. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 4 and Evidence 2 and 3. But since the user wants one pair, maybe Evidence 2 and Testimony 4. However, the evidence list explicitly states The Thinker is the murder weapon, so that's not the case. Hmm.

Wait, the user in previous answers picked pairs where the testimony directly contradicted the evidence. For example, testimony saying "I never touched the murder weapon" vs evidence showing fingerprints. Or testimony saying bullet hit forehead vs autopsy saying temple.

In this case, what's a clear contradiction? Let's think: Testimony 4 says the weapon was The Thinker. Evidence 1 confirms that. So that's consistent. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a light stand, which might be unrelated. The receipt (Evidence 3) shows purchase of a light stand. Maybe the real weapon was the light stand, making Testimony 4 wrong. But according to the evidence list, The Thinker is the murder weapon. So perhaps the contradiction is elsewhere.

Wait, looking at Evidence 9: "May Testimony" which is described as "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." This is similar to April's Testimony 1 and 3. If May's testimony is evidence, but the testimonies given are from April, perhaps there's a contradiction between May's testimony (Evidence 9) and April's testimonies. But the user hasn't listed May's testimonies in the Testimonies section; Evidence 9 is part of the evidence. So that's a separate point. However, the user is asking for a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony (from the Testimonies list).

Given all this, perhaps the intended contradiction is between Testimony 4 (weapon is The Thinker) and Evidence 2 (Glass Shards). But Evidence 1 says The Thinker is the murder weapon, so that's not it. Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between the Autopsy Report's cause of death (single blow) and Testimony 1 and 3 implying two blows (one missed, one hit). But since only one blow connected, that's consistent with the autopsy. So no.

Wait, another angle: The Thinker is described as a clock statue with gears removed. If the gears were removed, maybe the time of death in the autopsy (9:00 PM) is contradicted by the clock's stopped time. For example, if The Thinker's clock hands show a different time. But there's no mention of that in the evidence. So that's speculative.

Alternatively, the receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from that stand. If the stand was broken, perhaps it was used as a weapon, making Testimony 4 (The Thinker as weapon) incorrect. But again, Evidence 1 explicitly states The Thinker is the murder weapon. So maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 1's description that the gears were removed. For example, if Testimony 4 says it's a clock (with gears), but the gears were removed, making it not a functional clock, but that doesn't affect its use as a weapon. Not a strong contradiction.

Hmm. I might be overcomplicating this. The most straightforward contradiction, following previous examples, would be between Testimony 4 (The Thinker as weapon) and Evidence 2/3 (glass shards and receipt). But since the evidence list says The Thinker is the murder weapon, that's not the case. Alternatively, the contradiction is between the Autopsy Report's instantaneous death and the testimony implying Mia was alive after the first attack. But that's not direct. Alternatively, maybe the wiretap (Evidence 7) in April's room shows she's lying, but that's not a direct contradiction with her testimony.

Wait, looking back at the initial examples, the key was direct contradiction in details (prints on weapon vs denial, location of wound). So maybe here, the contradiction is between the autopsy's cause of death (blunt force) and the glass shards (sharp object). But the autopsy says blunt force, so if the murder weapon was a glass shard (sharp), that would contradict. But Evidence 1 says The Thinker (blunt) was the weapon. So that's not it. 

Wait, the Glass Shards are from a light stand, which is glass. If the murder weapon was glass, the injury would be sharp force trauma, not blunt. But the autopsy says blunt force. Therefore, the real murder weapon must be The Thinker (blunt), and the glass shards are unrelated. So Testimony 4 correctly identifies The Thinker, consistent with Evidence 1. So no contradiction.

In that case, where is the contradiction? 

Another possibility: Testimony 1 says Mia dodged and ran to the right. The Floor Plans (Evidence 8) might show that the right side leads to a dead end or no exit, making it impossible for her to run there. But without details on the floor plans, we can't confirm.

Alternatively, the receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand bought the day before. If the murder happened on 9/5, and the receipt is dated the day before (9/4), that's consistent. Not a contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 9 is May Testimony, which is a separate testimony not listed in the Testimonies section. It's part of the evidence. If May's testimony (Evidence 9) says the victim was struck after running, and the autopsy says death was instantaneous, then that's a contradiction. But the user is to pick a testimony from the Testimonies list (0-4 by April) and an evidence. So Evidence 9 is part of the evidence, not testimony. Therefore, the contradiction could be between May's testimony (Evidence 9) and the autopsy's instantaneous death note. But that's not the question's requirement.

Given all this, perhaps the intended answer is that Testimony 4 (The Thinker as weapon) is contradicted by Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and 3 (Receipt), indicating the real weapon was the glass stand. But since Evidence 1 says The Thinker is the weapon, this would be a contradiction between Testimony 4 and Evidence 1. Wait, no, Evidence 1 confirms The Thinker is the weapon. So that's not it.

Alternatively, the contradiction is within the autopsy report itself, but the user wants a testimony and evidence pair.

I'm stuck. Based on the previous pattern, the answer likely involves the autopsy report's cause of death contradicting a testimony about the method. For example, Testimony 4 says the weapon was The Thinker (a statue), which is consistent with blunt force. The autopsy confirms blunt force. So no contradiction.

Wait, let's look at Testimony 3: "And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!" If the weapon was The Thinker, and the autopsy says blunt force, that's consistent. The only possible contradiction I can think of is between Testimony 1's description of Mia running after dodging and the autopsy's note that she may have lived a few minutes after being hit. But how does that contradict? If she was hit and then lived a few minutes, she could have run after being hit. But Testimony 1 says she ran before being hit. So no direct contradiction.

Given that I'm time-constrained and need to provide an answer, I'll go with the most plausible option based on previous examples: the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (identifying The Thinker as the weapon) and Evidence 2 (Glass Shards), but since Evidence 1 states The Thinker is the weapon, this might not be correct. Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 1 and the autopsy's note about surviving a few minutes. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The autopsy report's time of death is 9:00 PM. Testimony 0-4 by April don't mention time, but Evidence 12 (Bellboy's Affidavit) describes the man with April at the hotel. If the Bellboy's Affidavit shows April was elsewhere at 9:00 PM, that contradicts her testimony. But Evidence 12's description is vague. It says "Describes the man who stayed with Miss May in the hotel on the night of the murder." If this implies April was with someone else at the hotel during the murder, then her testimony about witnessing the murder is false. So Testimony 0 ("I did see everything!") would contradict Evidence 12. But the user needs a pair of evidence and testimony. So Evidence 12 and Testimony 0. But in the previous examples, the answer was like evidence 3 and testimony 4. So maybe here it's Evidence 12 (Bellboy's Affidavit) and Testimony 0 (April claiming she saw everything). The affidavit suggests she was with someone else at the hotel, meaning she couldn't have witnessed the murder. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 12.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 0 by April May states, "I did see everything! I did!" However, Evidence 12, the Bellboy's Affidavit, describes a man who stayed with April in her hotel room on the night of the murder. If April was in her hotel room with someone else during the murder, she couldn't have witnessed the events at the crime scene, contradicting her testimony.
{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 0}

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the task is to find a contradiction between one piece of evidence and one testimony. Let's start by going through the provided information step by step.

First, the characters: There's Phoenix Wright, Mia Fey, Maya, Pearl, Adrian Andrews, Detective Gumshoe, Mask DeMasque (the thief), Luke Atmey (the detective), Ron DeLite who turned himself in as the thief, his wife Desiree, Larry Butz, Godot the prosecutor, and Kane Bullard, the CEO whose body was found in his safe.

The evidences are quite extensive. Let me list the key ones. Evidence 5 is DeMasque's Calling Card, which mentions stealing the "speckled urn" from the Treasures of Kurain exhibit. Evidence 4 is the Sacred Urn, described as looking like a plain pot and having no monetary value. Evidence 21 is the Urn Box with pink paint stains, and Evidence 22 explains that the paint stains came from an incident two weeks prior when Adrian dropped the box and knocked over paint. Evidence 15 is the autopsy report stating Kane died at 1 AM on 10/12 from blunt trauma. Evidence 10 is the Blackmail Letter found in Ron's room, telling him to come to KB Security at 1 AM on October 12 with $50,000. Evidence 12 is the Key Card to the CEO's office found in Ron's wallet, which leaves a record when used. Evidence 19 is the Buzzer Record indicating the CEO office buzzer went off at 1:02 AM. Evidence 16 is a newspaper clipping about Mask DeMasque's first heist, showing a guard who is Ron DeLite. Evidence 6 is the Shichishito, a ceremonial sword used by DeMasque to knock out Atmey during the crime. Evidence 3 is Ami Fey's Golden Statue which moved the night of the crime. Evidence 20 states that from the second heist onward, Ron was stealing due to blackmail letters.

Now, the testimonies are from Atmey. Testimony 0: He received the request from Lordly Tailor 20 days ago. Testimony 1: The urn was boxed and sent to the warehouse. Testimony 2: He couldn't see the urn until the day of the crime. Testimony 3: He sent his calling card 10 days before. Testimony 4: Handled security alone to ensure the crime goes smoothly. Testimony 5: He held the urn at 1 AM on October 12th.

Looking for contradictions. Let's cross-reference testimonies with evidence. 

Testimony 5 says Atmey held the urn at 1 AM. But the Sacred Urn (Evidence 4) is described as having no monetary value, just a plain pot. The calling card (Evidence 5) mentions stealing the "speckled urn" as the most priceless work. However, the Sacred Urn isn't speckled and isn't valuable. The Urn Box (Evidence 21) has pink paint stains, which came from Adrian's accident (Evidence 22). So maybe the urn in the box isn't the real treasure? Wait, but the calling card refers to the "speckled urn," which could be the Sacred Urn. However, the Sacred Urn is plain. That might be a contradiction. If Atmey says he stole the priceless urn, but the real urn isn't valuable, then he's lying.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 5 where Atmey claims to have held the urn at 1 AM. But the autopsy report (Evidence 15) states that Kane died at 1 AM from blunt trauma. If Atmey was holding the urn at the same time, but the murder happened at the same time, maybe there's a contradiction. But that's not directly conflicting unless there's a location issue.

Wait, perhaps another angle. The Urn Box (Evidence 21) has pink paint stains from two weeks prior. The calling card mentions the "speckled urn," which could refer to the paint-stained box. But the Sacred Urn inside is plain. If Atmey sent the calling card (Testimony 3) 10 days before the crime, referring to the speckled urn, but the urn isn't speckled, then the contradiction is that the calling card's description doesn't match the actual urn. However, the box might be speckled due to paint, but the urn itself isn't. So Atmey, as the thief, would have known the urn wasn't valuable or speckled, meaning his calling card was a fake, which would be a contradiction. But how does that tie into the testimonies?

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says Atmey held the urn at 1 AM. However, the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) shows the CEO office buzzer went off at 1:02 AM. If Ron used the key card (Evidence 12) to access the CEO office around that time, maybe Atmey couldn't be in two places at once. But that's more of a timeline issue, not a direct contradiction between evidence and testimony.

Wait, another angle. The Sacred Urn (Evidence 4) is stated to have no monetary value. The calling card (Evidence 5) says it's the "most priceless work of art." But the real urn isn't valuable. So the contradiction is that the calling card refers to a valuable urn, but the actual urn isn't. Therefore, Atmey's Testimony 3 (sending the card 10 days prior) and Testimony 5 (holding the urn) are based on a false premise. But how does that directly contradict evidence?

Alternatively, the Shichishito (Evidence 6) was used by DeMasque to knock out Atmey. If Atmey is the one who sent the calling card and committed the theft, but was knocked out, then there's a contradiction. But that's more about the sequence of events.

Wait, perhaps the key contradiction is in Testimony 5 where Atmey claims he held the urn at 1 AM on October 12th. However, the Sacred Urn's box (Evidence 21) was in the warehouse, which according to Testimony 1, was sent there. But the Urn Box has pink paint stains from two weeks prior (Evidence 22), which Adrian caused. If the urn was in the warehouse, but the box with paint was there, then maybe the urn was moved. However, the statue (Evidence 3) moved the night of the crime. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at the Blackmail Letter (Evidence 10) which tells Ron to come to KB Security at 1 AM. The Key Card (Evidence 12) was used, and the Buzzer went off at 1:02 AM (Evidence 19). If Ron was there, then Atmey's Testimony 5 about holding the urn at 1 AM might conflict if he was supposed to be in two places. But that's a timeline conflict, not a direct evidence vs testimony contradiction.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and the Sacred Urn's actual appearance. Atmey says he held the urn (assuming it's the Sacred Urn), but the Sacred Urn is described as plain with no value. If the calling card refers to it as the most priceless, that's a contradiction. But the testimony itself is about holding the urn, not its value. So maybe not.

Alternatively, Testimony 4 says Atmey handled security alone. But Evidence 16 (newspaper clipping) shows that Ron was the guard in the first heist. If Atmey handled security alone, but Ron was involved as a guard, perhaps there's a contradiction. But the testimony is about the current heist, not the first one.

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 5 (Atmey holding the urn at 1 AM) and the autopsy report (Evidence 15) stating that Kane died at 1 AM from blunt trauma. If Atmey was holding the urn at the same time the murder occurred, but the murder was in the CEO's office, perhaps he couldn't be in two places. But that's a timeline issue. However, without explicit evidence about locations, it's hard to pin that as a direct contradiction.

Another angle: The Urn Box (Evidence 21) has pink paint stains, which fit perfectly in the gap (Evidence 22). If the box was in the warehouse, but the paint incident happened two weeks prior, then the box should have been in the warehouse with the stains. Atmey's Testimony 1 says the urn was sent to the warehouse in a box. If the box in the warehouse had the paint stains, then Atmey should have known the urn's box was stained. But his calling card refers to the "speckled urn," which might allude to the paint-speckled box. However, the Sacred Urn inside is plain. If he stole the urn, expecting it to be speckled, but it's not, that's a contradiction. But the testimony is about holding the urn, not its appearance.

Wait, perhaps the main contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 5. Testimony 3 says Atmey sent the calling card 10 days before the crime. The calling card (Evidence 5) mentions stealing the "speckled urn." However, the Sacred Urn (Evidence 4) is not speckled. The box (Evidence 21) has paint stains, which might make it speckled. So if the calling card refers to the box as the speckled urn, but the actual urn is plain, then there's a contradiction. But the testimony is about sending the card, not the description. Alternatively, the contradiction is that the urn isn't speckled, so the calling card is false. But Atmey's testimony claims he sent the card, which refers to a non-existent speckled urn. Therefore, the testimony about sending the card (Testimony 3) contradicts the evidence about the urn's appearance (Evidence 4).

But wait, the Sacred Urn is in a box with pink paint stains (Evidence 21 and 22). The calling card says "speckled urn," which could refer to the paint-speckled box. However, the urn itself is plain. So the calling card is referring to the box's appearance, not the urn. If Atmey sent the card referring to the "speckled urn" (the box), but the actual urn inside is plain, then there's a contradiction. But the testimony is about sending the card, not the urn's appearance. Unless Atmey claims the urn is speckled, which he doesn't. His testimonies don't mention the urn's appearance, just that he held it. The contradiction might instead be that he sent the card to steal the urn, but the urn has no value, making the theft pointless. But that's more of a motive issue, not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, Evidence 20 states that from the second heist onward, Ron was stealing due to blackmail. The current heist might be one of those, implying that Ron, not Atmey, is the real thief. If Atmey is claiming to have committed the theft, but Evidence 20 and the key card (Evidence 12) point to Ron, then there's a contradiction. But that's between testimonies and other evidence, not directly one testimony and one evidence.

Wait, another possibility: Testimony 5 says Atmey held the urn at 1 AM. But the Security Camera Photo (Evidence 9) from the warehouse camera went off at 1 AM (Evidence 7). If the camera was triggered at 1 AM, and Atmey was in the warehouse stealing the urn, but the murder happened at the same time, maybe that's conflicting. But again, timeline issues aren't direct contradictions unless explicitly stated.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for a direct contradiction. The key one I recall from previous games is that the Sacred Urn is actually worthless, but the calling card claims it's the most priceless. So Atmey's testimony about sending the card (Testimony 3) to steal the urn contradicts Evidence 4 (Sacred Urn's description). So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 4. Because the calling card (Evidence 5) refers to the urn as priceless, but Evidence 4 says it's not. Therefore, Atmey's claim (Testimony 3) that he sent the card to steal the priceless urn is contradicted by Evidence 4 stating the urn has no monetary value.

Yes, that makes sense. The testimony says he sent the card 10 days prior to steal the priceless urn, but the evidence shows the urn isn't valuable. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 4.

Let's think step by step:
Atmey's Testimony 3 states he sent a calling card 10 days prior to steal the "most priceless work of art" (the Sacred Urn). However, Evidence 4 (Sacred Urn) describes it as having "no monetary value," contradicting the notion that it's a priceless target.
{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies here. Let me start by going through each testimony and checking against the evidence provided.

First, the testimonies are all from Luke Atmey. Testimony 0 says he had no contact with the victim. Let me check if any evidence connects Atmey to Bullard. Evidence 15 is the autopsy report, which states the cause of death is blunt trauma. Evidence 6 mentions that DeMasque (who is Ron DeLite) knocked Atmey out with a blow to the head using the Shichishito. Wait, that might be relevant. If Atmey was knocked out by the Shichishito during the crime, maybe there's a connection. But Testimony 0 says Atmey had no contact with the victim. But the victim is Kane Bullard. Wait, the Shichishito was used by DeMasque (Ron) to knock out Atmey, not Bullard. So maybe that's not directly related.

Looking at Testimony 5: Atmey claims that DeLite killed Bullard because Bullard's mistake led to the blackmail. But according to Evidence 10, the blackmail letter was written by Bullard to Ron, demanding money. Evidence 20 says Ron's testimony states that from the second heist onward, he was stealing due to blackmail letters. So Bullard was blackmailing Ron, which led Ron to act. But how does this tie into the murder?

Evidence 15 says the time of death was 1 AM, and cause was blunt trauma. Evidence 6 says the Shichishito was used to knock out Atmey, but that's during the crime. Wait, the murder weapon for Bullard was blunt trauma (maybe the Shichishito?), but Evidence 6 says DeMasque used it to hit Atmey, not Bullard. However, the autopsy says Bullard died from blunt trauma. So if the murder weapon was the Shichishito, but DeMasque (Ron) used it on Atmey, then who used it on Bullard? Maybe there's a contradiction here.

Wait, Testimony 5 says Ron killed Bullard. But if Ron was using the Shichishito to knock out Atmey, then maybe Ron wasn't the one who hit Bullard. Alternatively, maybe the Shichishito is the murder weapon for both? But the autopsy says Bullard died from blunt trauma, which could match the Shichishito if it was used as a blunt object. But Evidence 6 says the Shichishito wasn't bent before the crime but was used to hit Atmey. If Ron used it on Atmey, then maybe he also used it on Bullard. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Wait, the testimonies from Atmey say that Ron killed Bullard. If Evidence 15 says the cause is blunt trauma, and Evidence 6 says the Shichishito was used on Atmey, then perhaps the real murder weapon is something else. But I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 2: Atmey says Bullard wrote the blackmail letter. Evidence 10 confirms that the blackmail letter was indeed written by Bullard. So that's consistent. Testimony 5 says Ron killed Bullard because of the blackmail. But if the murder was committed at 1 AM (Evidence 15) and the camera data (Evidence 7) shows the warehouse camera went off around 1 AM. Also, Evidence 19 (Buzzer Record) shows the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM in the CEO's office. The key card (Evidence 12) was found in Ron's wallet and used to access the CEO's office, which would leave a record. If Ron used the key card to enter the office, that would place him there around the time of death. But does this contradict any testimony?

Wait, Testimony 5 says Ron killed Bullard because of the blackmail. But according to Evidence 10, Bullard was the one blackmailing Ron, so Ron's motive makes sense. The key card evidence supports Ron being at the scene. So maybe this is all consistent. Where's the contradiction?

Wait, looking back at Testimony 0: Atmey claims he had no contact with the victim. But if Atmey was involved in the crime, maybe there's evidence linking him. Evidence 14 is DeMasque's Broach found near the statue. If Atmey was impersonating DeMasque, maybe that's his broach. But the testimony in question is Testimony 0, which is about Atmey having no contact with the victim. But the victim's cause of death is blunt trauma. If Atmey was knocked out by the Shichishito (Evidence 6), which was used by DeMasque (Ron), perhaps Atmey wasn't involved with the victim. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Testimony 1: Atmey says Bullard mistook who Mask DeMasque was. But Evidence 16 (Newspaper Clipping) mentions that the guard in the photo from the first heist is Ron DeLite. So Bullard might have known Ron was the original DeMasque. But if Testimony 1 says Bullard mistook the identity, but Evidence 16 shows Ron was involved, that could be a contradiction. However, I'm not sure if that's directly related.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says Ron killed Bullard. But if the key card (Evidence 12) was used by Ron to enter the CEO's office, which is where the body was found (Evidence 12 description says the key card opens the CEO's office, and Evidence 12 was found in Ron's wallet). The Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) shows the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM, which would be when Ron used the key card. So Ron was at the scene around the time of death. This supports Testimony 5, so no contradiction here.

Wait, maybe Testimony 5 says Ron killed Bullard, but the murder weapon was the Shichishito (Evidence 6), which was used to knock out Atmey. If Ron used it on Atmey, then he would have it, but the autopsy says Bullard was killed with blunt trauma. So maybe the same weapon, but that's not a contradiction. Unless there's evidence that the Shichishito wasn't the murder weapon. Wait, the Shichishito is a ceremonial sword. If it's used as a blunt object, but Evidence 6 says it was used to knock out Atmey, then maybe the murder weapon is different. But the autopsy says the cause was blunt trauma, which could be from the Shichishito. Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 4: Atmey claims Ron truly believes he is Mask DeMasque. But Evidence 20 (Ron's Testimony) says that from the second heist onward, he was stealing due to blackmail. So Ron was acting under blackmail, not because he believed he was DeMasque. That could contradict Testimony 4. But Testimony 4 is from Atmey, saying Ron believes he is DeMasque, but Evidence 20 suggests Ron was forced by blackmail. So that's a contradiction. But is there evidence that directly contradicts this?

Evidence 20: Ron's Testimony says from the second heist on, he was stealing as directed by blackmail letters. So he was coerced, not believing he's DeMasque. Therefore, Testimony 4, which says Ron truly believes he's DeMasque, would be contradicted by Evidence 20. But Evidence 20 is Ron's own testimony, so if he's telling the truth, then Atmey's Testimony 4 is false. So that's a possible contradiction: Evidence 20 vs Testimony 4.

But the question asks for one pair. Let me check if that's the case. Evidence 20 is Ron's Testimony (description says "From DeMasque's 2nd heist on, he was stealing as directed by blackmail letters."), which directly contradicts Testimony 4 where Atmey claims Ron believes he is DeMasque. So if Ron was acting under blackmail, not belief, then Testimony 4 is contradicted by Evidence 20. Therefore, the answer would be {"evidence": 20, "testimony": 4}.

Wait, but the evidence numbers go up to 22. Let me double-check the evidence list. Evidence 20 is "Ron's Testimony" and Testimony 4 is "Mr. Bullard's mistake is quite excusable. The defendant truly believes he is Mask DeMasque." So yes, Evidence 20 (Ron's Testimony) contradicts Testimony 4 (Atmey's claim that Ron believes he is DeMasque). So the correct pair is evidence 20 and testimony 4.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 4 states that Ron DeLite "truly believes he is Mask DeMasque." However, Evidence 20, "Ron's Testimony," indicates that from the second heist onward, Ron was stealing due to blackmail, not personal belief. This directly contradicts Atmey's claim that Ron acted out of delusion rather than coercion.
{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 4}

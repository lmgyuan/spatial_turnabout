Okay, let's see. I need to find a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies provided. Let me start by listing out the key points from each.

First, looking at the testimonies from Redd White (Testimony 8): He says the victim ran to the left, and the defendant (spiky-haired man) gave chase. But then in Evidence 9, which is May's Testimony, it says "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." Wait, that's a direct contradiction. Testimony 8 says left, Evidence 9 says right. That's a clear conflict. 

Also, checking the other evidence: The Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) mentions cause of death as single blunt force trauma from a blunt object, which is The Thinker statue (Evidence 1). But does that relate to any testimony? Maybe, but the main contradiction here seems to be the direction the victim ran. Testimony 8 and Evidence 9 directly contradict each other on left vs. right. So the evidence here is 9 and testimony 8.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 8 states, "The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!" However, Evidence 9, "May Testimony," states that "the victim dodged an attack then ran to the right," directly contradicting the direction of movement.
{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 8}
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all listed here. Let me start by going through each testimony and see if any of them clash with the evidence provided.

First, looking at the Testimonies by Redd White (Testimony 0 to 6). Testimony 1 says, "When you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left." Testimony 3 states, "Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right." Then Testimony 4 says, "You chased her, and delivered the final blow." Testimony 6 claims, "You see? You hit her twice!" So according to White, the victim was hit twice, once when she ran left and then again after she ran right. 

Now, checking the Evidences. Evidence 5 is Mia's Autopsy Report. The description says, "Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous. Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Wait, the autopsy report mentions a single blow causing death, but the testimony from White says she was hit twice. That's a contradiction. The autopsy says one hit, but White's testimony says two hits. 

So, the contradiction here is between Testimony 6 (which claims two blows) and Evidence 5 (which states a single blunt force trauma). That seems like the direct conflict. I should make sure there's no other possible contradictions, but this one stands out. Other testimonies from White might support the two hits, but Testimony 6 explicitly states "You hit her twice!" which directly opposes the autopsy report's single blow. 

Yes, that's the key contradiction. So the answer should pair Evidence 5 with Testimony 6.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 6 states, "You see? You hit her twice!" However, Evidence 5, "Mia's Autopsy Report," states that the cause of death was a "single blunt force trauma," indicating only one fatal blow. This directly contradicts the claim of two strikes.
{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 6}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. Let me start by going through the testimonies and evidences one by one.

First, the characters: Mia Fey is the victim, Maya is the suspect, and Redd White is an eyewitness. The key testimonies are from Redd White (Testimonies 0 to 5). The evidences include things like the autopsy report, the murder weapon (The Thinker), Glass Shards, Receipt, etc.

Looking at the testimonies by Redd White. Testimony 2 says: "Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!" Testimony 3: "The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged." Testimony 4: "She turned, and ran for the door!" Testimony 5: "Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!"

Now, cross-referencing with the evidence. Let's check the Autopsy Report (Evidence 5). The autopsy says Mia died from a single blunt force trauma, and death was instantaneous. However, the autopsy also mentions that she "may have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Wait, that seems conflicting. But how does that tie into the testimonies?

Another point is Testimony 5 where Redd White claims that Maya struck Mia with a single blow. But the autopsy report says the cause was a single blow. That seems consistent. Hmm.

Wait, look at Testimony 2: Mia runs to the left. But in Testimony 3, the killer attacks, she dodges, then runs to the door. However, the Floor Plans (Evidence 8) mention that "the stand is blocked from view looking from the office." If the stand (The Thinker) was the murder weapon, maybe the view is obstructed, contradicting the testimony's claim of seeing the attack?

Alternatively, looking at the Receipt (Evidence 3): It's a receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are broken remains of a glass light stand. The Receipt has letters in blood. Maybe that's connected, but how does that contradict a testimony?

Wait, Testimony 0 and 1 by White: He says he heard something fall, looked at the other window, and saw a light stand on the floor. But if the Receipt is for a glass light stand bought the day before, perhaps the light stand was broken during the murder. But the murder weapon was The Thinker, not the light stand. So maybe the broken glass is from a different event. But how does that contradict?

Wait, the May Testimony (Evidence 9) says: "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." But in Redd White's Testimony 2, he says Mia ran to the left. That seems like a direct contradiction. So May Testimony (Evidence 9) says she ran to the right, but White's Testimony 2 says left. So Evidence 9 (May Testimony) contradicts Testimony 2.

Wait, but in the list, Testimony 2 is part of Redd White's testimonies. Evidence 9 is labeled as "May Testimony" which is presumably April May's testimony. Wait, the testimonies are numbered, and in the Testimonies section, Testimony 0 to 5 are all from Redd White. April May is a separate character (Character 4) who also testifies. Wait, looking back: Testimonies 0-5 are all from "Person: White". So the May Testimony (Evidence 9) is separate. So the contradiction is between White's Testimony 2 (Mia ran left) and Evidence 9 (May Testimony: victim ran to the right). But the question asks for a pair of evidence and testimony. So if May Testimony is Evidence 9, and White's Testimony 2 is Testimony 2, then these contradict each other. But in the problem statement, we are to find a single pair where evidence and testimony contradict. So in that case, Evidence 9 (May Testimony) contradicts Testimony 2 (White's statement about direction). Therefore, {"evidence": 9, "testimony": 2}.

Alternatively, another angle: The autopsy report (Evidence 5) says "Death was instantaneous. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." That seems contradictory in itself, but perhaps that's not the main point. The testimony says Mia was struck once, which matches the autopsy. But the direction she ran (left vs right) could be a contradiction. Since May Testimony (Evidence 9) says she ran right, and White's Testimony 2 says left. So those two contradict. Therefore, the evidence is 9 and the testimony is 2.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 2 by Redd White states, "Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!" However, Evidence 9 ("May Testimony") describes that "the victim dodged an attack then ran to the right," directly contradicting the direction of Mia's movement. This inconsistency suggests a contradiction between the testimony and evidence.
{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 2}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to look through the provided characters, evidences, and testimonies to find contradictions between any evidence and testimony.

Starting with the characters, the key ones here are Mia Fey (victim), Maya Fey (found at the scene), April May (witness who says Maya did it), and Redd White (another witness). The evidences include things like the murder weapon (The Thinker statue/clock), autopsy report, glass shards, receipt for a glass light stand, wiretap, and various testimonies.

Looking at the testimonies, Redd White has several. Testimony 2 states: "Of course, I had done so to place the wiretap." This implies that Redd White placed a wiretap in the Fey & Co. Law Offices. However, Evidence 7 is the "Wiretap: Found in Miss May's hotel room." If the wiretap was placed in the law offices according to White's testimony, but the evidence shows it was found in April May's hotel room, that's a contradiction. 

Wait, but maybe the wiretap mentioned in the testimony is the same one found in the hotel. Let me check again. Testimony 2 by White says he entered the law offices to place the wiretap. But the evidence says the wiretap was found in Miss May's hotel room. That doesn't align. If he placed it in the offices, why was it found in the hotel? Unless he's lying about where he placed it. That would mean his testimony about placing it in the law offices is contradicted by the evidence showing it was in the hotel.

Additionally, Testimony 3 by White says: "That is when I saw this glass light stand." The evidence includes Glass Shards (Evidence 2) which are from a broken glass light stand, and a Receipt (Evidence 3) for a glass light stand purchased the day before. If White claims to have seen the glass light stand in the law offices when placing the wiretap, but the receipt shows it was purchased the day before, maybe there's a timeline issue. Wait, the receipt's date is the day before the murder, which is 9/5. The murder happened on 9/5 at 9 PM. So the purchase was the day before (9/4). If White placed the wiretap a week before (Testimony 0 says "the week before the murder"), then the glass stand wasn't there yet. But he saw it when placing the wiretap. However, the receipt is for a purchase on 9/4, which is the day before the murder. So if he placed the wiretap a week before (say, around 8/29), he couldn't have seen the glass stand purchased on 9/4. That's a contradiction.

So Testimony 3 by White claims he saw the glass light stand when he placed the wiretap (which he says was a week before the murder), but the receipt shows the stand was bought the day before the murder. Therefore, he couldn't have seen it there when he placed the wiretap. Therefore, Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 3.

Alternatively, another angle: The autopsy report (Evidence 5) says Mia died from a single blunt force trauma, but the May Testimony (Evidence 9) says the victim dodged an attack, ran right, then was caught and struck. However, the autopsy says death was instantaneous, but also mentions she may have lived a few minutes. That might be a contradiction with the testimony about her running after being hit. But that's between two evidences, not evidence and testimony.

Focusing back on White's testimonies. Testimony 3 (seeing the glass light stand when placing the wiretap a week prior) vs. Evidence 3 (receipt shows it was bought the day before the murder). Therefore, White couldn't have seen the stand a week before it was purchased. So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 3.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 3 by Redd White states, "That is when I saw this glass light stand," implying he saw it when he placed the wiretap a week before the murder. However, Evidence 3 (the receipt) shows the glass light stand was purchased the day before the murder, meaning it wasn't present when White claimed to have seen it. This contradiction exposes a lie in White's testimony.
{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 3}

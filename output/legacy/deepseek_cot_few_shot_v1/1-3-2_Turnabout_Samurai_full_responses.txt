Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair, and the answer must be in JSON format at the end. 

First, I need to go through all the evidence and testimonies provided. Let's start by listing out the key points from the evidence and the testimonies.

Looking at the testimonies, the Security Lady (Oldbag) has several statements. Testimony 4 says, "I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!" Then Testimony 7 states, "It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!" at 2:00 PM. So she claims she saw Powers heading to the studio at 2:00 PM and was at the gate the whole time.

Now, looking at the evidence. Evidence 5 is "Powers'(?) Photo" which was taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios at 2:00 PM, showing the Steel Samurai dragging one leg. If the photo was taken at 2:00 PM and shows the Steel Samurai (who is Powers), but Oldbag claims she saw Powers in person at the same time, that might be a contradiction. Because if the photo shows Powers in costume at the gate at 2:00 PM, but Oldbag says she saw him walking by her at the same time, that's conflicting. Unless the photo is from a different time or someone else is in the costume.

Wait, but the time of the photo is explicitly 2:00 PM. So if the Security Lady was at the main gate from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM (Testimony 4), and she saw Powers at 2:00 PM, but the photo taken at the same time shows Powers in costume at a different location (the gate between entrance and Studios), that might be impossible. Therefore, the testimony that she saw Powers heading to the studio at 2:00 PM contradicts the photo showing him already there in costume at that exact time. So the evidence (Photo) would contradict Testimony 7.

Let's think step by step:
The Security Lady (Oldbag) claims in Testimony 7 that she saw Will Powers heading toward the studio at 2:00 PM. However, Evidence 5, "Powers'(?) Photo," shows the Steel Samurai (Powers in costume) captured at the gate at 2:00 PM, implying he was already in costume and present there. This contradicts her testimony that she saw him approaching the studio at that exact time.
{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 7}
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to go through the given characters, evidence, and testimonies to find contradictions. 

The characters include Maya Fey, Miles Edgeworth, Dick Gumshoe, Will Powers (the defendant), Security Lady (Oldbag), Jack Hammer (victim), and others. The evidence includes an autopsy report, a photo of Powers as the Steel Samurai, a spear as the murder weapon, and various other items. The testimonies are from Oldbag, the Security Lady.

Looking at the testimonies first. Testimony 0 states the time of death as 2:30 PM, which matches Evidence 3 (Jack's Autopsy Report), so that's consistent. Testimonies 1 and 2 claim that Oldbag saw only Will Powers go to the studio before 2:30 PM, and no one else. Testimony 3 adds that she would have seen anyone else who went there.

Now, looking at the evidence: Evidence 5 is a photo labeled "Powers'(?) Photo" taken at 2:00 PM showing the Steel Samurai dragging one leg. However, Evidence 11 is "Mr. Monkey's Head" which blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. If the path was blocked starting at 2:15 PM, then how did Powers (assuming he's the Steel Samurai in the photo) get to the studio after 2:15 PM? The photo was taken at 2:00 PM, which is before the path was blocked. But the murder occurred at 2:30 PM. If the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, then the Steel Samurai (Powers) would have had to leave the area before 2:15 PM, but the murder happened at 2:30 PM. Wait, maybe the contradiction is that Oldbag claims she saw Powers go to the studio before 2:30 PM, but if the path was blocked from 2:15 PM onward, then Powers couldn't have been there at 2:30 PM. Alternatively, the photo shows Powers at 2:00 PM entering, but the path was blocked after 2:15 PM. So if the murder happened at 2:30 PM, and the path was blocked, how did the murderer get there? Unless Powers was already there before 2:15 PM. But Oldbag's testimony says she saw Powers go there before 2:30 PM, but the blocked path might mean he couldn't have left after 2:15 PM. Wait, maybe the contradiction is that the photo shows Powers entering before 2:15 PM, but the murder weapon was the spear which was found in the victim. If the path was blocked after 2:15 PM, then the real murderer couldn't have entered after that time. However, Oldbag claims that no one else entered, but maybe the real killer used another route. Hmm.

Alternatively, Evidence 5 shows the Steel Samurai (Powers) dragging one leg in the photo taken at 2:00 PM. The murder weapon, Evidence 6, is the Samurai Spear with a mended shaft. If the spear was broken and repaired, maybe Powers had an injury (dragging leg) that contradicts the ability to commit the murder. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the key contradiction is between Oldbag's testimony that only Powers went to the studio before 2:30 PM and no one else, but Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head blocking the path from 2:15 PM) implies that if Powers entered before 2:15 PM, he couldn't have left after that time. But the murder happened at 2:30 PM. So if the path was blocked, how did he get there? Wait, maybe the photo at 2:00 PM shows Powers entering, but after 2:15 PM, the path is blocked. So if the murder happened at 2:30 PM, Powers would have been stuck there, but Oldbag's testimony says she saw him go there before 2:30 PM, which would be before the path was blocked. Hmm. Maybe the contradiction is that the photo at 2:00 PM shows Powers entering, but the blocked path from 2:15 PM onwards would prevent anyone else from entering, but Oldbag says she saw no one else. However, if the real murderer was already inside before 2:15 PM, they could have stayed. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, Evidence 5's photo shows the Steel Samurai (Powers) at 2:00 PM, but the murder occurred at 2:30 PM. If the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, then the murderer had to be in the studio before that time. But Oldbag claims she only saw Powers, which would mean he's the only one there. However, maybe the real murderer used another entrance. But according to Oldbag, she would have seen anyone else (Testimony 3). So the contradiction could be between Testimony 1/2/3 (only Powers entered, no one else) and Evidence 11 (the path was blocked from 2:15 PM). If the path was blocked, then Powers would have had to enter before 2:15 PM, but the murder happened at 2:30 PM. If the path was blocked, then the murderer couldn't have left after 2:15 PM. Wait, maybe the blocked path means that after 2:15 PM, no one could enter or exit via that path. So if the murder happened at 2:30 PM, the killer had to have been there before 2:15 PM. But Oldbag claims she saw only Powers enter before 2:30 PM. But if the path was blocked, how did Powers enter? Wait, the photo shows him entering at 2:00 PM, which is before the path was blocked. So he could have entered before 2:15 PM. The contradiction might not be here. 

Wait, maybe the key point is that the murder weapon, the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6), was mended with duct tape. If Powers was in the photo at 2:00 PM dragging his leg, maybe he couldn't have used the spear effectively if he had a leg injury. But that's speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the Security Lady's testimony that she saw Powers entering is contradicted by the blocked path, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's look at the autopsy report (Evidence 3): cause of death is a spear through the chest. The spear (Evidence 6) has a mended break. If the spear was broken and mended, maybe it couldn't have been used to stab someone unless it was repaired. But that's not necessarily a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 1 and 2 (Oldbag saw only Powers go to the studio before 2:30 PM) and Evidence 5 (the photo taken at 2:00 PM showing Powers as Steel Samurai). However, if the Steel Samurai in the photo is actually someone else, then Oldbag's testimony is wrong. But the photo's label says "Powers'(?) Photo" with a question mark, implying uncertainty. If the photo actually shows someone else disguised as Powers, then Oldbag's testimony that only Powers entered would be contradicted. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, the photo's timestamp is 2:00 PM, and the path was blocked from 2:15 PM. If the murder happened at 2:30 PM, the killer had to be there before 2:15 PM. Oldbag claims only Powers entered, but perhaps the real killer was already inside. However, that's not a direct contradiction with evidence. 

Wait, another angle: Evidence 11 says the path was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM by Mr. Monkey's Head. So between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, no one could enter or exit via that path. The murder happened at 2:30 PM. So the killer must have been in the studio before 2:15 PM. If Oldbag testifies that only Powers entered before 2:30 PM, but the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, then Powers must have entered before 2:15 PM, and no one else could have entered after. However, Oldbag says she saw Powers enter before 2:30 PM (which includes 2:00 PM), which is possible. But if the photo shows Powers entering at 2:00 PM, then he was there before the path was blocked. But then how does that contradict the testimony? Maybe the contradiction is that the Security Lady (Oldbag) claims she saw Powers entering before 2:30 PM, but the blocked path after 2:15 PM means that if Powers entered before 2:15 PM, he couldn't have left, so he'd still be there. But that doesn't contradict the testimony. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 1 ("The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!") and Evidence 5 (the photo at 2:00 PM showing the Steel Samurai, which is Powers, but dragging a leg). If the leg injury was such that Powers couldn't have committed the murder, but that's not evidence. Alternatively, if the photo shows Powers entering at 2:00 PM, but the murder happened at 2:30 PM, and the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, then Powers would have been stuck in the studio. But Oldbag's testimony is that she saw him go there, which is consistent. 

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 1 and Evidence 18 (the van). Evidence 18 is the van used by Manella to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting. If Vasquez was driven to Studio One after the meeting, but Oldbag says she only saw Powers, then Vasquez's presence would contradict the testimony. But the testimonies are from Oldbag, and the van's evidence is about Vasquez being driven there. If Vasquez was there, then Oldbag's testimony that she saw only Powers is contradicted. But how does that connect to the evidence? The van (Evidence 18) states that Manella used it to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer. If this happened before the murder, then Vasquez was at Studio One, but Oldbag claims she only saw Powers. That would be a contradiction. But the testimonies are from Oldbag, and Evidence 18 would imply Vasquez was there. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 1 (only Powers) and Evidence 18 (Vasquez was driven there). However, the timing is important. If the meeting in the trailer happened before the murder, and the van was used afterward, but the murder was at 2:30 PM, then perhaps Vasquez was there, contradicting Oldbag's testimony. So the contradiction would be Testimony 1 (only Powers) vs Evidence 18 (Vasquez was driven there by Manella). But I need to check the timing. The autopsy report says time of death is 2:30 PM. The van's evidence says "after the meeting in the trailer." If the meeting was before 2:30 PM, then Vasquez was at Studio One, but Oldbag didn't see her. That would contradict Testimony 1 and 2. But the question is which evidence and testimony contradict. 

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (Oldbag saw only Powers) and Evidence 5 (the photo at 2:00 PM showing the Steel Samurai, which may not be Powers). If the photo actually shows someone else in the Steel Samurai costume, then Oldbag's testimony is wrong. However, the photo's label is "Powers'(?) Photo" with a question mark, indicating uncertainty. So if the Steel Samurai in the photo is not Powers, then Oldbag's testimony is contradicted by the photo showing someone else. But the evidence's description says "Steel Samurai is seen walking. [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2] He's dragging one leg." If Powers was injured and dragged a leg, but the real Powers doesn't have such an injury, then the photo might be of an imposter. However, without more info, it's hard to say. 

Wait, another angle: Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head) blocked the path from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. If the murder happened at 2:30 PM, the killer had to be present in the studio before 2:15 PM, as they couldn't enter after. Oldbag's testimony says she only saw Powers enter before 2:30 PM, implying he was the only one there. However, if the real killer was already inside (like Vasquez or someone else), then Oldbag's testimony is incorrect. But how does that contradict evidence? Maybe the van (Evidence 18) shows that Vasquez was driven to Studio One after the meeting, meaning she was there, contradicting Oldbag's testimony. But I need to link evidence and testimony.

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between Testimony 4 (which isn't present here; the last testimony is Testimony 3 from Oldbag) and some evidence. Wait, the testimonies given are Testimony 0-3 from Oldbag. Testimony 3 says "If they had, I would have seen them!" referring to anyone else going to the studio. But if Evidence 18 shows that Vasquez was driven there, then Oldbag should have seen her, but she didn't, which contradicts. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 1/2/3 and Evidence 18. But the user's instructions say to output one pair of evidence and testimony.

Alternatively, Evidence 5 (the photo) shows the Steel Samurai at 2:00 PM, but the murder weapon (Evidence 6) has a mended spear. If the photo shows the spear unbroken, but the murder weapon is broken and mended, that's a contradiction. But the photo's description doesn't mention the spear's condition. The spear's description says it was mended with duct tape. If the photo shows the spear intact, but the murder weapon is broken, that could imply the spear was broken after the photo was taken. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, the autopsy report (Evidence 3) states the cause of death as a spear through the chest, but the Security Lady's testimonies don't mention seeing the spear. But that's not a contradiction. 

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (Oldbag saw only Powers enter) and Evidence 5 (the photo at 2:00 PM showing the Steel Samurai dragging a leg). If Powers had an injury that made him drag his leg, but in reality, he doesn't have such an injury, then the person in the photo isn't Powers, contradicting Oldbag's testimony. But how do we know Powers doesn't have a leg injury? The character description for Will Powers says he's an action star who plays the Steel Samurai. If the real Powers doesn't have a leg injury, then the person in the photo is an imposter, meaning Oldbag's testimony that she saw Powers is wrong. But the evidence (photo) has a question mark on Powers' name, indicating uncertainty. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 1 (Oldbag saw Powers) and Evidence 5 (photo shows someone else). However, the photo's label is "Powers'(?) Photo," so it's possible it's not him. Therefore, Oldbag's testimony that she saw Powers is contradicted by the photo suggesting it might not be him. But I need to ensure this is the strongest contradiction.

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between Testimony 3 ("If they had, I would have seen them!") and Evidence 18, which implies Vasquez was driven to the studio, meaning Oldbag should have seen her but didn't. So the contradiction would be Testimony 3 (Oldbag claims she would have seen anyone else) and Evidence 18 (Vasquez was there via the van). But how does Evidence 18 prove Vasquez was there? The van's description says Manella used it to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer. If the meeting was before the murder, then Vasquez was at Studio One, but Oldbag didn't report seeing her. Therefore, Testimony 1 and 2 (only Powers) and Testimony 3 (would have seen others) are contradicted by Evidence 18 (Vasquez was there). But the user's answer requires one pair. So {"evidence": 18, "testimony": 1} or 2 or 3.

Alternatively, looking back, the Security Lady's testimony claims that only Powers entered, but if the van (Evidence 18) was used to drive Vasquez there, then she must have entered, contradicting the testimony. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (only Powers) and Evidence 18 (Vasquez was there). But the user might expect a different answer.

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between Testimony 1 (Oldbag saw Powers enter) and Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head blocking the path from 2:15 PM). If the murder happened at 2:30 PM, and the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, then Powers entered before 2:15 PM and couldn't leave. But the photo shows him entering at 2:00 PM. However, if the blocked path means that after 2:15 PM, no one could enter or exit, then Powers was already inside. But Oldbag's testimony is that she saw him enter before 2:30 PM, which could be before 2:15 PM. No contradiction there.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (Oldbag saw Powers enter before 2:30 PM) and Evidence 11 (the path was blocked from 2:15 PM). If Powers entered after 2:15 PM, that's impossible because the path was blocked. But the photo shows him entering at 2:00 PM, which is before the block. So no contradiction. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me re-express the key points:

- Murder at 2:30 PM.
- Oldbag's testimonies: Only Powers entered before 2:30 PM, no one else.
- Evidence 11: Path blocked from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM.
- Evidence 5: Photo at 2:00 PM of Steel Samurai (possibly Powers) entering.
- Evidence 18: Van used to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting.

If Vasquez was driven there after the meeting (which presumably was before the murder), then she was at the studio, contradicting Oldbag's testimony that she saw no one else. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 1/2/3 and Evidence 18. But which testimony number? Testimony 1: "The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!" Testimony 2: "No one else went there!" Testimony 3: "If they had, I would have seen them!" So if Evidence 18 shows Vasquez was there, then Testimony 1/2/3 are contradicted. But which evidence number? Evidence 18 is the van.

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (only Powers entered) and Evidence 5 (photo showing Steel Samurai entering at 2:00 PM, which might be someone else). But unless there's proof it's someone else, this is speculative.

Wait, another angle: Evidence 5 is a photo taken at 2:00 PM showing the Steel Samurai dragging one leg. The murder weapon, the spear, was found mended with duct tape (Evidence 6). If the spear was broken, maybe the injury in the photo (dragging leg) is related. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the autopsy report (Evidence 3) says cause of death is a spear through the chest, but the photo (Evidence 5) shows the Steel Samurai with a spear. If the spear in the photo is unbroken, but the murder weapon is broken and mended, that suggests the spear was broken after the photo was taken. But that's not a contradiction unless the photo shows the broken spear.

This is getting too convoluted. Let me try to pick the most straightforward contradiction. 

Oldbag says she only saw Powers enter before 2:30 PM and no one else. But Evidence 18 says Vasquez was driven to Studio One after the meeting. If Vasquez was there, then Oldbag's testimony is false. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (or 2/3) and Evidence 18. So the answer would be {"evidence": 18, "testimony": 1} or 2 or 3. But the user might expect a different pair.

Wait, but in previous examples, the contradiction was between a testimony about the murder weapon and evidence showing prints. In this case, the previous example had the testimony saying "I never touched the murder weapon" conflicting with evidence showing prints. Similarly, here, maybe there's a testimony that someone didn't have access, but evidence shows they did. 

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (Oldbag saw Powers enter) and Evidence 11 (the path was blocked after 2:15 PM). If Powers entered before 2:15 PM, then he couldn't have left after the path was blocked, implying he was there during the murder. But that's consistent with him being the killer. No contradiction there.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the photo (Evidence 5) shows the Steel Samurai dragging a leg, which could indicate an injury. But if the real Powers doesn't have such an injury, then the person in the photo isn't him, contradicting Oldbag's testimony. But how do we know Powers doesn't have a leg injury? The character description for Will Powers says he's an action star, but nothing about an injury. The photo's description mentions dragging a leg, which might be part of the Steel Samurai character's portrayal, not an actual injury. So that's not necessarily a contradiction.

Alternatively, the autopsy report says death was at 2:30 PM. Testimony 0 by Oldbag confirms the time, which matches Evidence 3, so no contradiction there.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. The most likely contradiction is between Oldbag's testimony that she only saw Powers enter and Evidence 18 showing Vasquez was driven there, implying she was present. Therefore, Testimony 1 or 2 is contradicted by Evidence 18. But the user's answer expects one pair. Let's check the numbering:

Testimony 0: Time of death 2:30 PM (matches Evidence 3)
Testimony 1: Only Powers entered before then
Testimony 2: No one else went there
Testimony 3: She would have seen them if they did

Evidence 18: Van used to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting. If this happened before the murder, then Vasquez was there, contradicting Testimony 1/2/3.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (only Powers) and Evidence 18 (Vasquez was there). But which testimony number? Testimony 1 is "The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!" So Evidence 18 contradicts Testimony 1, 2, and 3. The strongest contradiction is with Testimony 1. But the user's answer must be one pair. So {"evidence": 18, "testimony": 1}.

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 ("If they had, I would have seen them!") and Evidence 18 (Vasquez was there, so Oldbag should have seen her). Therefore, {"evidence": 18, "testimony": 3}.

But I need to make sure. The van's evidence is about driving Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting. If the meeting was in the trailer (Evidence 8: Trailer Key for Studio Two Trailer), then maybe the meeting was in Studio Two's trailer, and then they drove to Studio One. If Studio One is where the murder happened, then Vasquez was present there, but Oldbag claims she didn't see anyone else. Thus, Testimony 3 ("If they had, I would have seen them!") is contradicted by Evidence 18, implying Vasquez was there but Oldbag didn't see her. Therefore, {"evidence": 18, "testimony": 3}.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another possible contradiction is between Testimony 1 and Evidence 5. If the photo at 2:00 PM shows the Steel Samurai (who is supposed to be Powers), but the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, then Powers was inside before the block. But Oldbag's testimony is that she saw him enter, which aligns. However, the photo's description says the Steel Samurai is dragging one leg, which might indicate an injury. If Powers doesn't have such an injury, then the person in the photo isn't him, contradicting Testimony 1. But there's no evidence that Powers has or doesn't have a leg injury. The character description for Powers says he's an action star; maybe the dragging leg is part of the character's costume. 

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between Testimony 1/2/3 and Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head blocking the path). If the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, then anyone entering after that time couldn't have gotten through. But the murder was at 2:30 PM. If Oldbag claims she saw only Powers enter before 2:30 PM, but the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, then Powers must have entered before 2:15 PM. But the photo shows him entering at 2:00 PM, which is consistent. No contradiction here.

I'm going in circles. Based on previous examples, the contradiction is usually between a testimony denying something and evidence proving it. Here, Oldbag's testimony says only Powers entered, but Evidence 18 shows Vasquez was driven there. So the contradiction is between Testimony 1/2/3 and Evidence 18. The strongest is Testimony 1 and 2, which state only Powers entered. So the answer would be {"evidence": 18, "testimony": 1} or 2. But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the blocked path (Evidence 11) and the photo (Evidence 5) show that Powers entered before 2:15 PM, but the murder happened at 2:30 PM, so he was there. But that's not a contradiction. 

Wait, another angle: Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head) blocked the path from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. The murder occurred at 2:30 PM. So the killer had to be in the studio before 2:15 PM. Oldbag's testimony says only Powers entered before 2:30 PM, implying he was the only one there. But if the real killer was already present (like Vasquez), then Oldbag's testimony is incorrect. But how does the evidence show that? Evidence 18's van implies Vasquez was driven there, but if that happened after the path was blocked, she couldn't have entered. However, the van's description says "after the meeting in the trailer," which might have been before the path was blocked. If the meeting was before 2:15 PM, then Vasquez could have been driven there before the path was blocked, meaning Oldbag should have seen her. Therefore, Testimony 1/2/3 are contradicted by Evidence 18. So the answer is {"evidence": 18, "testimony": 1} or similar. However, I'm not entirely certain. 

Given the time I've spent and the previous examples, I think the intended contradiction is between the Security Lady's testimony that only Powers entered and the van evidence showing Vasquez was there. Therefore, {"evidence": 18, "testimony": 1}.

Let's think step by step:
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 1 states, "The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!" However, Evidence 18, which is "Van," states that "Manella used this van to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer," implying that Vasquez was present at the studio, contradicting Oldbag's testimony that she saw only Powers.
{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 1}

Okay, let's see. The task is to find a contradiction between one piece of evidence and one testimony from the given list.

First, I'll go through the testimonies provided. The testimonies are all from Armstrong (Jean Armstrong), and they mention a mirror in the restaurant. Testimony 0 says there was a mirror dividing the two halves of the restaurant. Testimony 1 states there's only one seat from which you could have seen the victim's image, which was the seat next to the victim's table where the old man was sitting (Testimony 2). Testimony 3 mentions that after the incident, Armstrong moved the mirror so it wasn't in the way, but he claims he didn't touch anything else (Testimony 4).

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 12 is the Crime Photo, which describes the scene as having two dining tables separated by a folding screen. The photo shows that from the kitchen's perspective, the view is obstructed and only the patio is visible. The photo also mentions that there's a vase on each table, and the victim collapsed on one table. Importantly, the photo doesn't mention a mirror but refers to a folding screen. 

So, the contradiction here is that Armstrong's testimonies refer to a mirror being present and moved, but the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) describes a folding screen instead. If the photo shows a folding screen separating the tables, but the testimony talks about a mirror, that's a direct contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 0's claim about a mirror being in the middle contradicts Evidence 12's description of a folding screen.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 0 states, "La mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves." However, Evidence 12, which is "Crime Photo," describes the crime scene as having "two dining tables separated by a folding screen," not a mirror. This contradiction suggests the mirror was not present as described.
{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 0}
Okay, let's tackle this question. So, we have a bunch of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The answer should be in the form of a JSON object at the end, but first, I need to figure out the contradiction.

First, I'll look through the testimonies. The testimonies here are from Armstrong (Jean Armstrong). Let's list them out:

Testimony 0: The victim, Glen Elg, came to the restaurant alone.
Testimony 1: The old man arrived not long after him.
Testimony 2: The old man arrived just after 2 PM.
Testimony 3: There were no other customers.
Testimony 4: When Elg found out he won the lottery, he got excited.
Testimony 5: The poisoning happened about 5 minutes later.
Testimony 6: No, there was no time for a phony to do the acting.

Now, looking at the evidence. The key ones related to time and presence of people might be relevant here. Let's check the evidence related to the time of death and other timings.

Evidence 10: Glen's Autopsy Report says time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM.
Evidence 19: Millionaire Radio Flyer mentions an event every Monday at 1:30 PM.
Evidence 20: Glen's Calendar has a note to meet with The Tiger on Dec 3rd (day of incident).
Testimony 2 from Armstrong says the old man arrived just after 2 PM. But the autopsy report says death could have been as early as 1:30 PM. Wait, but the testimony says Elg arrived first, then the old man arrived after 2 PM. Then the poisoning happened 5 minutes after Elg found out he won the lottery. If the time of death is between 1:30 and 2:30 PM, but the old man arrived after 2 PM, and the poisoning happened 5 minutes after Elg's excitement (which would be after 2 PM), but the time of death window starts at 1:30 PM. That could be a contradiction if the actual death was earlier than 2 PM. But maybe not directly.

Wait, Testimony 2 says the old man arrived "just after 2 PM". If the autopsy allows for death as early as 1:30 PM, but according to the testimonies, the poisoning happened after 2 PM (since old man arrived after 2, then Elg found out about the lottery, then 5 minutes later he was poisoned). So if the time of death is up to 2:30 PM, but the actual event according to testimony happened after 2 PM, that's within the window. Maybe not the contradiction here.

Another angle: Testimony 3 says there were no other customers. But maybe some evidence suggests otherwise. Let's check. Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony: "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." If Victor was present and broke a vase, that contradicts Testimony 3 which says no other customers. So Victor would be a customer, but Armstrong says there were no others. So that's a contradiction between Testimony 3 (Armstrong) and Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony). But Evidence 18 is Victor's own testimony, so if he was there, then Armstrong's Testimony 3 is false.

So the contradiction would be between Testimony 3 (Armstrong saying no other customers) and Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony stating he was there and broke a vase). Therefore, Evidence 18 contradicts Testimony 3.

But wait, let me check. Evidence 18's description is "Victor's Testimony: 'When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry.'" So if Victor was present, that contradicts Armstrong's statement that there were no other customers (Testimony 3). So that's the contradiction. Therefore, the answer would be Evidence 18 and Testimony 3.

Looking back, in the previous examples, the answer was in the form of {"evidence": X, "testimony": Y}, where X is the evidence number and Y is the testimony number. So in this case, Evidence 18 is the Victor's Testimony, and Testimony 3 is Armstrong's statement that there were no other customers. So the pair is evidence 18 and testimony 3.

Let's think step by step:
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 3 states, "Z'ere were no other customers." However, Evidence 18, which is "Victor's Testimony," states that Victor was present at the time of the incident and broke a vase, which implies there was another customer present, contradicting the testimony.
{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other, and output just one pair in JSON.

First, I'll need to go through all the provided characters, evidences, and testimonies carefully. Let's start by understanding the context.

Characters involved include Maya Fey, Mia Fey (deceased), Godot, Detective Gumshoe, Maggey Byrde (the defendant?), Jean Armstrong, Glen Elg (victim), Victor Kudo, Lisa Basil, Violetta/Viola Cadaverini, Furio Tigre, and Bruto Cadaverini. The main focus seems to be on the murder of Glen Elg, who was poisoned with potassium cyanide between 1:30 and 2:30 PM on December 3rd. The defendant here might be Maggey Byrde, as Evidence 16 mentions her fingerprints on the potassium cyanide found in her apron.

Looking at the evidences, there's a lot here. Key points:

- Glen's Autopsy Report (Evidence 10): Death by potassium cyanide between 1:30-2:30 PM.
- Coffee Cup (13): Contains the poison, with victim and Maggey's prints.
- Potassium Cyanide (16): In Maggey's apron with her prints.
- Victim's Lottery Ticket (14): Found on Maggey, which is a winning ticket for $500k.
- Glen's Calendar (20): Note to meet "The Tiger" (Furio Tigre) on Dec 3.
- Paper Badge (26): Found at Tender Lender, which is Tigre's company.
- Repair Bill (25): Paid by Tigre to Cadaverini Family for $15k.
- Tres Bien Matches (24): Found at Tender Lender.
- MC Bomber (23): A virus disc at Tender Lender.
- Jean's Loan Contract (8): Owes $500k to Tender Lender.
- Glen's losing horse tickets (21): Over 500, indicating possible debt.
- Victim's Prescription Bag (17): Empty, and a small bottle (6) with unknown contents but with fingerprints.

Testimonies from Tigre (Testimonies 0-4):

- Testimony 1: Tigre claims he was in his office all of December last year, including the day of the incident (Dec 3).
- Testimony 2: On that day, he was in the office and never saw "that kid" (possibly Glen?).
- Testimony 4: Alibi can be checked with Violetta.

Now, looking for contradictions between Tigre's testimonies and evidence.

Evidence 20: Glen's calendar says he was to meet "The Tiger" (Tigre) on Dec 3. If Tigre claims he was in his office all day and never saw Glen, but the victim had a meeting scheduled with him, that's a contradiction. Also, Evidence 24 (Tres Bien matches found at Tender Lender) might link Tigre to the scene. Additionally, the Paper Badge (26) found at Tender Lender could be connected to someone impersonating an attorney, maybe Tigre's involvement.

But the strongest contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 1 (he was in his office all day Dec 3) and Evidence 20 (Glen had a meeting with "The Tiger" that day). If Tigre was supposed to meet Glen, but claims he was in the office and didn't see him, that's conflicting. Unless the meeting didn't happen, but the presence of the calendar note suggests it was planned. Alternatively, maybe Glen went to meet Tigre at Tender Lender, but Tigre denies seeing him.

Another angle: Evidence 23 (MC Bomber disc at Tender Lender) connects to the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) which has "MC Bomber" written. The Sports Paper was left at Tres Bien on Dec 3rd. If Tigre's company has the MC Bomber disc, perhaps Tigre was involved in some scheme related to that. But how does this contradict his testimony?

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 4 where Tigre says to check his alibi with Violetta. If Violetta's medical papers (Evidence 27) show a $1M bill due last year, maybe she had a motive, but that's not directly contradicting Tigre's testimony.

Wait, the Repair Bill (25) shows Tigre paid $15k to the Cadaverini Family. If Tigre was in debt or had dealings with them, maybe he had a motive. But how does that contradict his testimony?

Alternatively, the Paper Badge (26) found at Tender Lender: if someone impersonated Phoenix (since there's a phony mentioned in Maggey's case), perhaps Tigre was involved in framing someone. But again, how does this contradict his testimony?

The key contradiction seems to be between Tigre's Testimony 1 (in office all day Dec 3) and the victim's calendar note (Evidence 20) indicating a meeting with "The Tiger" (Tigre) on that day. If the meeting was supposed to happen but Tigre denies it, that's a contradiction. Additionally, if the meeting did take place, Tigre's alibi is false.

But the problem is that the evidence (Glen's calendar) only notes the meeting, but doesn't confirm it happened. However, if Glen was at Tres Bien (the crime scene) and died there, how would that connect to Tigre? Unless the meeting was at Tender Lender, but the crime was at Tres Bien.

Wait, the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) was left by a customer at Tres Bien on Dec 3rd, which has the doodle mentioning MC Bomber. The MC Bomber disc (Evidence 23) is at Tender Lender, Tigre's company. Maybe Tigre was involved in some scheme related to that, but his testimony says he was in the office. However, the presence of Tres Bien Matches (24) at Tender Lender could imply someone from Tender Lender was at Tres Bien, contradicting Tigre's claim of being in the office.

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between Testimony 1 (Tigre in office all day) and the fact that Glen had a meeting scheduled with him. But unless there's evidence that the meeting actually occurred, maybe that's not enough. Alternatively, if there's evidence that Tigre was elsewhere, like the Repair Bill paid to Cadaverini, but that's not time-specific.

Wait, another angle: The victim's prescription bag (17) is empty, and the Small Bottle (6) in the kitchen has unknown contents but with fingerprints. If Tigre's prints are on that bottle, but he claims he wasn't there. But the evidence says the fingerprints are "unidentified", so that's not helpful.

Looking back at Testimony 1: Tigre says he was in his office all of December last year, including the day of the incident (Dec 3). But Evidence 20 is Glen's calendar note to meet The Tiger (Tigre) on Dec 3. If Glen intended to meet Tigre, but Tigre claims he was in the office and never saw Glen, that's a contradiction. However, the meeting might not have happened. But maybe there's evidence that the meeting did occur.

Alternatively, the victim's lottery ticket (14) worth $500k found on Maggey. Jean Armstrong's loan (8) is also $500k to Tender Lender. If Glen had the winning ticket, maybe Tigre wanted it to pay off Jean's debt, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 1 (in office all day) and Evidence 24 (Tres Bien matches found at Tender Lender). If the matches are from Tres Bien but found at Tigre's office, that suggests someone from Tender Lender was at Tres Bien, possibly Tigre, contradicting his alibi. But how does that directly contradict? Unless the matches were used at Tender Lender, but they're from Tres Bien, implying someone brought them over. Maybe Tigre was at Tres Bien, hence the matches at his place, but he claims he was in the office all day.

Alternatively, the Paper Badge (26) is at Tender Lender. If someone impersonated Phoenix using the badge, and Tigre was involved, but again, not directly contradicting his testimony.

Hmm. Another angle: The victim died of poisoning in his coffee. The potassium cyanide was in Maggey's apron, but maybe Tigre was the one who planted it. However, his testimony says he was in the office. If there's evidence linking him to being at Tres Bien, that would contradict.

Wait, the Tres Bien Matches (24) found at Tender Lender. If Tigre was at Tres Bien, he might have taken the matches there, but he claims he was in his office. However, the presence of the matches at his office doesn't necessarily mean he was at Tres Bien; someone else could have brought them.

Alternatively, the MC Bomber disc (23) at Tender Lender connects to the Sports Paper (3) at Tres Bien. If the disc is a virus, and the doodle on the Sports Paper mentions MC Bomber and 100k crossed out, maybe Tigre was involved in some scheme related to that, but how does that contradict his testimony?

Wait, the victim's calendar (20) says he was to meet The Tiger (Tigre) on Dec 3. If the meeting happened at Tender Lender, but the crime occurred at Tres Bien, maybe the victim was lured there. But if Tigre claims he was in the office and didn't see the victim, but the victim was supposed to meet him, that's a contradiction. Unless the meeting was at Tres Bien, but that's not indicated.

Alternatively, the Repair Bill (25) paid by Tigre to Cadaverini on Dec 3. If he paid that bill on that day, but claims to be in the office, maybe he had to go out to pay it. But the bill doesn't specify the date of payment, just that it was paid by Tigre.

I think the strongest contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 1 (he was in his office all day on Dec 3) and the victim's calendar note (Evidence 20) indicating a meeting with Tigre that day. If the meeting was supposed to happen, Tigre's alibi of being in the office is suspicious. Additionally, the MC Bomber disc (23) and the Sports Paper (3) link Tigre's company to the crime scene. The Paper Badge (26) could imply impersonation, which might be part of a setup.

Wait, the Sports Paper's date is December 3rd, the day of the incident, left at Tres Bien. The doodle mentions MC Bomber and 100k, which connects to the disc at Tender Lender. If Tigre was involved in creating the virus (MC Bomber), and the victim had a meeting with him, that could be a motive. But the contradiction would be Tigre denying any involvement or presence.

Alternatively, the victim's Lottery Ticket (14) worth $500k matches Jean's Loan Contract (8) amount. If Tigre wanted the lottery ticket to cover Jean's debt, he might have killed Glen. But that's motive, not contradiction in testimony.

Back to testimonies: Testimony 1 by Tigre says he was in his office all day on Dec 3. Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) notes a meeting with The Tiger (Tigre) that day. If the meeting was at Tigre's office, then Glen would have gone there, but he was killed at Tres Bien. However, the autopsy says time of death between 1:30-2:30 PM. If Glen was at Tres Bien during that time, he couldn't have been at Tigre's office. So maybe the meeting didn't happen, and the calendar note is just a plan. But how does that contradict Tigre's testimony?

Alternatively, if there's evidence that Tigre was at Tres Bien, contradicting his alibi. The Tres Bien Matches (24) at Tender Lender might indicate someone from Tender Lender was there, but not necessarily Tigre.

Wait, the victim's Prescription Bag (17) is empty, and the Small Bottle (6) in the kitchen has unknown contents. If the bottle is the victim's ear medicine, but it's in the kitchen with unidentified prints, maybe Tigre's prints are there. But the evidence says the prints are unidentified, so we can't confirm.

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 1 (in office all day) and Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender). If the matches are from Tres Bien and found at Tigre's office, it implies someone from his office was there, contradicting his claim of being in the office. But that's circumstantial.

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between Testimony 4 where Tigre says to ask Violetta for his alibi, and Viola's Medical Papers (27) showing a $1M bill. If Violetta needed money and was involved, maybe she lied for Tigre. But that's more about alibi reliability, not direct contradiction with evidence.

Another angle: The victim's autopsy (10) says death by potassium cyanide in the coffee cup (13) which has Maggey's prints. However, the potassium cyanide (16) is in her apron. But if Tigre was the one who planted it, his alibi is important. But where's the contradiction?

Wait, the Millionaire Radio Flyer (19) mentions a show every Monday at 1:30 PM. The murder happened on Dec 3, which was a Monday (assuming Dec 3 is a Monday). If Tigre was at the radio show, but claims he was in the office, that's a contradiction. But I don't have info on the date's day of the week. Assuming the Flyer is relevant, maybe Tigre was there, but again, not sure.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for the most direct contradiction between testimony and evidence.

Testimony 1 by Tigre: "I was tied up with business in December last year. Spent all'a my time in my office." Specifically on Dec 3.

Evidence 20: Glen's calendar note to meet The Tiger on Dec 3. If Tigre claims he was in the office all day, but the victim intended to meet him, perhaps the meeting happened, which would mean Tigre left the office, contradicting his testimony. But without evidence that the meeting occurred, this is circumstantial.

Alternatively, the victim's note in Evidence 20 is a plan, but not proof of the meeting. However, the victim was killed at Tres Bien. If the meeting was supposed to be there, then Tigre would have been present, contradicting his alibi. But where is the meeting supposed to take place? The calendar note doesn't specify. The crime photo (12) shows the scene at Tres Bien, where the victim collapsed. If the meeting was at Tres Bien, then Tigre's presence there would contradict his testimony. But there's no direct evidence placing him there, except perhaps the matches (24) from Tres Bien found at his office.

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between Testimony 1 (Tigre in office) and Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches at Tender Lender). If the matches are from Tres Bien and found at Tigre's office, it suggests someone from Tigre's office was at Tres Bien, possibly Tigre himself, which contradicts his alibi. But the matches could have been brought by someone else.

Alternatively, the Paper Badge (26) at Tender Lender suggests someone impersonated an attorney. If Tigre was involved in creating a fake badge to frame Phoenix, but this doesn't directly contradict his testimony.

Wait, another thought: The victim's time of death is between 1:30-2:30 PM (Evidence 10). The Millionaire Radio Flyer (19) is every Monday at 1:30 PM. If Dec 3 was a Monday, and the show is at 1:30 PM, maybe Tigre attended that, contradicting his being in the office. But the Flyer is just an advertisement, not proof he went.

Alternatively, the victim had a meeting with Tigre at 1:30 PM at Tres Bien, but Tigre claims he was in the office. If the murder happened during that time, Tigre's alibi is false. But without evidence placing him at the scene, this is speculative.

Wait, looking at Testimony 2 by Tigre: "The day youse talkin' about, I was in de office, too. I never saw that kid before." "That kid" likely refers to Glen Elg. If Glen had a meeting with Tigre, Tigre's denial of seeing him is a lie.

So, the contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 2 (never saw Glen) and Evidence 20 (Glen's calendar note to meet Tigre). If the meeting occurred as per the calendar, Tigre is lying. But how do we know the meeting happened? Unless there's evidence that the meeting took place.

Alternatively, the victim's lottery ticket (14) worth $500k matches Jean's loan amount (8), suggesting a connection. If Tigre wanted the lottery ticket to pay off Jean's debt, he might have met Glen to get it. If he did meet Glen, his testimony is false.

But again, the key is hard evidence contradicting testimony. The most direct would be if the evidence shows Tigre was at the crime scene or met the victim when he claims he didn't.

Another angle: The victim's Prescription Bag (17) is empty, but the Small Bottle (6) in the kitchen has the victim's ear medicine. If Tigre's prints are on the bottle, but he claims he wasn't there. However, the evidence states the fingerprints are "unidentified", so we can't use that.

Wait, Evidence 6: "Found in the kitchen. Shape is different from the others bottles. Contents unknown. The victim's ear medicine. Found covered in unidentified fingerprints in the kitchen." So, the bottle is the victim's, but with unknown prints. If those prints belong to Tigre, it would contradict his testimony. But since the prints are unidentified, we can't confirm.

Thus, the strongest contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 1 (in office all day Dec 3) and Evidence 20 (victim's calendar note to meet him that day). If the meeting occurred, Tigre is lying. But we need to confirm the meeting happened. However, the autopsy report places the victim's death at Tres Bien, implying he was there during the time of the meeting. So if the meeting was supposed to be elsewhere, like Tigre's office, but the victim died at Tres Bien, maybe the meeting didn't happen. But Tigre's denial of ever seeing the victim could still be a contradiction if the meeting was supposed to happen.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 where Tigre says to check his alibi with Violetta, and Evidence 27 (Viola's Medical Papers showing a $1M bill). If Violetta needed money and was coerced to lie for Tigre, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 1 (Tigre in office all day) and Evidence 25 (Repair Bill paid to Cadaverini). If paying the bill required him to be elsewhere, but the bill doesn't specify when it was paid.

Alternatively, the key is Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches at Tender Lender). If Tigre's office has matches from Tres Bien, it implies someone from Tender Lender was there. If Tigre claims he was in the office, but the matches suggest someone from his office went to Tres Bien, maybe Tigre himself. But that's indirect.

I think the most direct contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 1 (in office all day Dec 3) and the victim's calendar note (Evidence 20) to meet him that day. If the victim intended to meet Tigre, but Tigre claims he was in the office and never saw him, it's a contradiction. However, without evidence that the meeting actually took place, this might be circumstantial. But in legal terms, the prosecution could argue that the victim's note indicates the meeting was planned, and Tigre's denial of seeing him suggests he's lying.

Alternatively, the victim's calendar note could be a red herring. But given the options, this seems like the intended contradiction.

Let's think step by step:
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 1 states, "I was tied up with business in December last year. Spent all'a my time in my office." However, Evidence 20, which is "Glen's Calendar," notes a meeting scheduled with "The Tiger" (Tigre) on December 3rd, the day of the incident. This implies Tigre should have met the victim, contradicting his claim of being confined to his office all day.
{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 1}
Okay, let's tackle this. So, we need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair, and the answer has to be in a JSON format at the end. Let's start by going through the provided information step by step.

First, the characters. There are several, but maybe the key ones here are Furio Tigre (Character 10), Glen Elg (victim, Character 6), and others. The evidence list is quite long, so I'll need to check each one for possible contradictions with the testimonies.

Looking at the testimonies, Testimony 0 to 4 are all from Tigre. Let me summarize them:

- Testimony 0: Tigre claims he never met Glen Elg.
- Testimony 1: He says there was a "lame guy" (Glen) who wanted to borrow cash.
- Testimony 2: He set up a meeting at his office, Tender Lender.
- Testimony 3: He waited, but Glen never showed up.
- Testimony 4: He claims he's never been to Tres Bien.

Now, looking at the evidence. Let's check each one for any mention that contradicts Tigre's statements.

Evidence 20 is Glen's Calendar, which notes a meeting with "The Tiger" (Tigre's nickname) on the day of the incident. That directly contradicts Testimony 0 where Tigre says he never met Glen. Because if the calendar says they were supposed to meet, then Tigre's claim of never meeting Glen is a lie.

Wait, but in Testimony 2, Tigre says he set up a meeting at Tender Lender but Glen didn't show. However, Evidence 20 says the meeting was scheduled. So maybe Tigre is lying about Glen not showing up. Alternatively, if there's evidence that the meeting actually happened, that would contradict Tigre's statement.

Wait, but let's check other evidence. Evidence 23 is the MC Bomber disc found at Tender Lender, which is linked to Glen's note in Evidence 3 (Sports Paper doodle mentioning MC Bomber). So maybe Glen did go to Tender Lender. But according to Tigre's Testimony 3, Glen didn't show up.

Alternatively, Evidence 24: Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender. If Tigre says he never went to Tres Bien (Testimony 4), but there's matches from Tres Bien at his office, that suggests he might have been there. But the matches are advertising items, so maybe they could have been brought by someone else. Not sure.

Another angle: Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) says "Meet with The Tiger" on Dec 3rd. If Tigre says he set up a meeting at Tender Lender (Testimony 2) but Glen didn't come (Testimony 3), but perhaps there's evidence that Glen was at Tender Lender. Wait, the crime happened at Tres Bien, though. The victim died there. The autopsy report (Evidence 10) says time of death between 1:30-2:30 PM on Dec 3rd. So if Glen was supposed to meet Tigre at Tender Lender, but he was at Tres Bien during that time and died there, then maybe he didn't go to Tender Lender. But the calendar note indicates he planned to meet Tigre, but perhaps he went to Tres Bien instead. However, Testimony 4 from Tigre says he's never been to Tres Bien. If there's evidence placing him there, that would contradict.

Wait, Evidence 24: Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender. That's Tigre's place. Maybe that's not directly linking him to Tres Bien. But Evidence 26: Paper Badge found at Tender Lender, which is a fake badge, perhaps used by someone impersonating Phoenix. Maybe Tigre was involved in that.

But the key contradiction might be between Tigre's Testimony 0 ("never met Glen") and Evidence 20 (Glen's calendar note about meeting The Tiger). Because if Glen had a meeting scheduled with Tigre, that suggests they did have a connection, contradicting Tigre's claim of never meeting him.

Wait, but Testimony 1 says Tigre acknowledges that there was a guy (Glen) who wanted to borrow money. So Testimony 0 is "never met Glen", but Testimony 1 says he knew of him. That's a contradiction in his own testimonies, but the question asks for a contradiction between evidence and testimony. So maybe Evidence 20 contradicts Testimony 0. Because the calendar shows that Glen had a meeting with "The Tiger", which is Tigre. So Tigre's claim that he never met Glen (Testimony 0) is contradicted by the calendar entry (Evidence 20) indicating a planned meeting. Even if the meeting didn't happen, the fact that it was scheduled suggests that they had at least arranged to meet, which would mean they had some form of contact, contradicting Tigre's claim of never meeting him.

Alternatively, maybe another evidence. Let's check Evidence 14: Victim's Lottery Ticket found on Maggey. Maybe that's linked to Tigre's loan business, but not directly a contradiction.

Evidence 8: Jean's Loan Contract with Tender Lender. That ties Jean to Tigre's company, but not directly related to Tigre's testimonies.

Evidence 20 seems to be the key here. So the contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 0 ("never met Glen") and Evidence 20 (Glen's calendar notes a meeting with The Tiger). Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 20 and Testimony 0.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 0 states, "I ain't no liar. I never met Glen Elg." However, Evidence 20, "Glen's Calendar," notes a meeting with "The Tiger" (Furio Tigre's nickname) on the day of the incident, indicating prior contact. This contradicts Tigre's claim of never meeting Glen.
{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 0}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The question provides a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. My job is to find one pair where the evidence and testimony don't match up.

Looking at the testimonies first, the ones given are all from Tigre (Testimony 0 to 4). Let's go through each testimony and check against the evidence.

Testimony 0: "I was supposed to meet wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon." The kid here might be Glen Elg, the victim. But I need to check if there's evidence supporting or contradicting this. Evidence 20 is Glen's Calendar, which has a note on Dec 3rd saying "Meet with The Tiger". "The Tiger" is Furio Tigre's nickname, so this actually supports the testimony. So no contradiction here.

Testimony 1: "When I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene." This is Tigre's account of entering the restaurant. The evidence about the crime scene might relate here. Let's check the Crime Photo (Evidence 12). The photo shows the victim collapsed on a table with coffee cup, etc. But does this contradict Tigre's testimony? Not directly. He says he saw the scene when he opened the door. But maybe the layout of Tres Bien is important. Evidence 11 is Tres Bien Floor Plans, which says the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. If the crime scene was in an area not visible from the entrance, then Tigre couldn't have seen the victim when he opened the door. So if the floor plans show that the entrance view is blocked, then Testimony 1 would be contradicted by Evidence 11. That's a possible contradiction.

Testimony 2: "The guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete." This matches the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) description, so no issue here.

Testimony 3: "I figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split." He left the scene. Not sure what evidence would contradict that. Maybe Evidence 26 is a Paper Badge found at Tender Lender, but not directly related. Or maybe the Scooter (Evidence 7) ridden by the phony, but that's about the impersonator. Not sure yet.

Testimony 4: "I heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office." The timing here might relate to the Autopsy Report (Evidence 10), which says time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. If Tigre left after the murder and heard sirens, but the timeline might conflict. But not sure if that's direct contradiction.

Focusing back on Testimony 1 and Evidence 11. The floor plans (Evidence 11) state that the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. The Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows the victim's table was behind a folding screen. So when Tigre opened the door, according to the floor plan, he wouldn't have been able to see the victim's table. Thus, Testimony 1 says he saw the scene upon opening the door, but the evidence says the view was obstructed. That's a contradiction.

Another possible angle: Testimony 3 says he split because the place was going to be hot. Maybe Evidence 14 (Victim's Lottery Ticket found on Maggey) contradicts something, but not directly. Alternatively, Evidence 16 (Potassium Cyanide in Maggey's apron) could tie into the murder method, but that's about Maggey's guilt, not Tigre's testimony.

So the key contradiction is between Testimony 1 (Tigre seeing the scene upon entering) and Evidence 11 (Tres Bien Floor Plans showing the view was obstructed). Therefore, {"evidence": 11, "testimony": 1} would be the answer.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 1 states, "When I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene." However, Evidence 11, the Tres Bien Floor Plans, indicates the view from the entrance was obstructed and could only see the patio. The actual crime scene, as per Evidence 12, was behind a folding screen, which contradicts Tigre's claim of immediately seeing the victim upon entering.
{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 1}
Alright, let's tackle this problem. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by going through the characters, evidences, and testimonies step by step.

First, the characters: there's a mix of people involved, including Maya Fey, Mia Fey, Godot, Detective Gumshoe, Maggey Byrde (the defendant), Jean Armstrong, Glen Elg (the victim), and others. The key here is to focus on the testimonies and see if any of them conflict with the evidence provided.

Looking at the testimonies, all of them (Testimony 0 to 7) are given by Furio Tigre. He's talking about his interactions with Glen Elg. Let's break down his statements:

- Testimony 0: He loaned Elg $100,000.
- Testimony 1: They were supposed to meet on the day because Elg's payment was due.
- Testimony 2: Elg said he couldn't pay.
- Testimony 3: Tigre was about to "flatten" him when Elg started screaming.
- Testimony 4: Elg won half a million dollars (lottery), which would have solved his debt.
- Testimony 5: If the waitress (Maggey) hadn't done what she did, everything would have been over (implying she interfered).
- Testimony 6: Because of her actions, his business with Elg was over.
- Testimony 7: He was after the $100k and had no other reason to kill Elg.

Now, looking at the evidence. Let's check the relevant ones:

- Evidence 20: Glen's Calendar mentions a meeting with "The Tiger" (Tigre) on Dec 3rd, the day of the incident. This supports Testimony 1 about their meeting.
- Evidence 14: Victim's Lottery Ticket for half a million found on Maggey. This matches Testimony 4 where Elg wins the lottery.
- Evidence 20 and 14 seem to align with Tigre's statements. However, let's look for contradictions.

Testimony 5 and 6 suggest that Maggey's actions (presumably killing Elg) ended Tigre's business with him. But if Elg had the winning ticket (Evidence 14), he could have paid back the loan. So why would Tigre kill him? Tigre claims he didn't have another reason (Testimony 7), but Evidence 14 shows Elg had the means to pay. Wait, but Tigre says in Testimony 4 that Elg won, which would let him pay, but in Testimony 5, he implies Maggey's action (maybe killing him) ended the business. However, if Elg was dead, Tigre wouldn't get the money. That's a point to consider.

Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 10) says Glen died of potassium cyanide poisoning between 1:30-2:30 PM. The lottery ticket was found on Maggey (Evidence 14). If Elg had the winning ticket, why was it on Maggey? Maybe she took it. But according to Tigre's Testimony 4, Elg won, which would mean he had the ticket. If Maggey took it, maybe she stole it, but that's not directly conflicting.

Looking at Evidence 20: Glen's Calendar note about meeting "The Tiger" on Dec 3. This aligns with Testimony 1. So no conflict there.

Now, Evidence 23: MC Bomber, a disc with a virus found at Tender Lender (Tigre's company). The Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2) mentions "MC Bomber" with a crossed-out 100,000 and "Ahahahaha". This might connect to Tigre's loan of $100k (Testimony 0). The virus could be part of a plan, but how does this relate?

Wait, Testimony 7 says Tigre was after the $100k and had no other motive. But Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) shows a meeting with "The Tiger", and Evidence 21 (Losing Horse Racing Tickets) indicates Glen was in debt from gambling. If Elg had a winning lottery ticket (Evidence 14), he could pay back Tigre. However, the autopsy says he was poisoned. If Tigre knew Elg had the ticket, he wouldn't need to kill him. But if Maggey killed Elg and took the ticket, Tigre would lose the debt. But according to Tigre's Testimony 6, Maggey's action ended his business, implying he didn't get the money. However, if Elg was dead, Tigre couldn't collect, so why would Tigre be okay with that? Unless he had another motive.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let's check the other evidence. Evidence 16: Potassium Cyanide in Maggey's apron with her prints. Testimony 5 and 6 imply Maggey did something (poisoned Elg?), which is supported by Evidence 13 (coffee cup with her prints and the poison). But Tigre's Testimony 7 claims he had no other reason to kill, but if Maggey is the one who did it, maybe Tigre is lying.

Wait, but the question is about evidence contradicting testimony. So, looking for a direct contradiction between one testimony and one piece of evidence.

Wait, Testimony 4 by Tigre: "He got lucky, you know. Real lucky." Referring to Elg winning the lottery. Evidence 14 shows the winning ticket was found on Maggey. So if Elg had the ticket, why was it on Maggey? That might suggest she took it after his death, which could be a motive for her. But does that contradict Tigre's testimony? Not directly. Tigre says Elg won, which is true, but the ticket being on Maggey is another matter.

Alternatively, Evidence 20: Glen's Calendar note about meeting "The Tiger" (Tigre) on Dec 3. But in Testimony 1, Tigre says they were due to have a chat that day. So that's consistent.

Wait, let's look at Testimony 4 again. Tigre says Elg won half a million, which matches Evidence 14. But Evidence 14 says the ticket was found on Maggey. So maybe Tigre is lying about Elg having the ticket, but the evidence shows Maggey had it. However, Testimony 4 is about Elg winning, not about who had the ticket. So maybe no direct contradiction there.

Another angle: Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) says he was to meet "The Tiger" (Tigre), but Testimony 1 says Tigre was meeting Elg that day. That's consistent.

Wait, Evidence 17: Victim's Prescription Bag, empty. Evidence 6: Small Bottle found in the kitchen with victim's ear medicine and unknown prints. Maybe this relates to how the poison was administered, but not directly conflicting with testimonies.

Wait, Testimony 7: "I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!" But if Tigre knew Elg had the winning ticket (half a million), maybe he had a motive to kill him to take the ticket. However, the ticket was found on Maggey. But this is more about motive rather than direct contradiction.

Alternatively, the contradiction could be between Tigre's Testimony 4 and Evidence 20. Testimony 4 says Elg won the lottery, which is supported by Evidence 14. But Evidence 20 is about the meeting with The Tiger. Not a contradiction.

Wait, let's check the timeline. The autopsy (Evidence 10) says time of death between 1:30-2:30 PM. The Millionaire Radio Flyer (Evidence 19) mentions a show every Monday at 1:30 PM. If the incident was on Dec 3rd, which was a Monday (from Evidence 3: Sports Paper from Dec 3rd), then the radio show was at 1:30 PM. Maybe this is relevant, but not directly conflicting.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 3: Sports Paper from Dec 3rd with 'MC Bomber' and crossed-out 100,000. Testimony 0: Tigre loaned Elg $100k. The crossed-out 100k might imply that the debt was settled or something, but Testimony 4 says Elg won 500k. If the 100k was crossed out, maybe the debt was forgiven, but Tigre's testimony says he was after the 100k. However, this could be a contradiction. If the note crossed out 100k and wrote 'Ahahaha', maybe indicating that the 100k was no longer needed, but Tigre still claims he was after it. That could be a contradiction between Evidence 3 and Testimony 7 where Tigre says he was after the 100k. But I need to check the exact wording.

Evidence 3's description: "a doodle that said 'MC Bomber' with an arrow pointing to '100,000' that was crossed out. 'Ahahahaha' and a laughing face are written next to it." This might indicate that the 100k was canceled or mocked, perhaps implying that the debt was no longer relevant because Elg had the lottery ticket. If so, Tigre's insistence in Testimony 7 that he was after the 100k contradicts this, as the crossed-out 100k suggests the debt was resolved or not needed anymore. Therefore, Evidence 3 contradicts Testimony 7 because Tigre claims he was after the $100k, but the crossed-out note implies that the $100k was no longer the issue, possibly because Elg had the lottery ticket.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 7 states, "I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!" However, Evidence 3, the "Sports Paper," includes a crossed-out "100,000" with a laughing face, suggesting the $100k debt was no longer relevant, contradicting Tigre's claim that he was solely motivated by recovering the $100k. This implies Tigre had another motive, conflicting with his testimony.

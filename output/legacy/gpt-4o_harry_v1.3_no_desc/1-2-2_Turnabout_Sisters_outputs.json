    "response": "The contradiction lies between Gumshoe's testimony where he claims the victim wrote the killer's name before dying, and the evidence of the autopsy report which may contain details about the death that contradict the possibility of writing. Typically, in cases like this, an autopsy report would provide insights into the time of death or potential incapacitation that makes writing a name improbable. Therefore, the relevant evidence that could contradict Gumshoe's testimony (that the victim wrote the killer's name before dying) would consider Mia's Autopsy Report.\n\nIn the provided list, Mia's Autopsy Report is not detailed here, but the logic follows standard procedure from typical crime investigations where such reports may indicate immediate death or incapacitation, conflicting with writing a coherent message.\n\nHere is the contradiction given the available information:\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 5}",

I did!\" contradicts with the fact that \"The Thinker\" was not just a regular weapon, but a clock shaped like a statue. This is known in the lore and matches up with Evidence 1, The Thinker.

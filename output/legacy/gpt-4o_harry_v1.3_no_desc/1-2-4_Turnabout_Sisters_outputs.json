This suggests that the attack occurred in the same place where Mia was initially.

Since in testimony 1, White mentions a light stand was already lying on the floor when he looked, it raises a contradiction. If the attack was unexpected or occurred without movement, the dodge mentioned contradicts the suggestion that the light stand had already fallen beforehand due to the attack.\n\nThus, testimony 3, which involves the attacker swinging at Mia first (implying no significant movement yet), contradicts the presence of \"Glass Shards,\" which implies movement affecting the environment.\n\n{\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}",

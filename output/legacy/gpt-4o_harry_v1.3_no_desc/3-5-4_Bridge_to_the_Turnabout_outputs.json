    "response": "To determine a contradiction, we must look for inconsistencies between the testimonies and the evidence. In this situation, Iris's testimonies suggest that Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise, especially mentioned in Testimony 3. However, reviewing the evidence can reveal whether this statement contradicts any established facts, specifically if we find evidence showing a different weapon or method was used.\n\nExamining the evidence, Elise's Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) might contain details at odds with the claim of being stabbed, such as stating a different cause of death or method of assault. Typically, an autopsy report would clarify the nature of wounds and how the victim died. If it states something like a death by blunt force, suffocation, or something other than stabbing, it would directly contradict Iris's claim of a stabbing in Testimony 3.\n\nTherefore, considering the context where a typical Phoenix Wright scenario revolves around unraveling misleading testimonies and using autopsy reports to reveal truth, let's hypothesize that the Autopsy Report contradicts the claim of stabbing by Maya in Iris's Testimony 3.\n\n{\"evidence\": 11, \"testimony\": 3}",

Let's focus on Testimony 3: Armstrong states that after the incident, he moved the mirror so it would not be in the way. Armstrong's testimonies generally revolve around the position and movement of the mirror. \n\nIf we look at the Crime Photo, which often captures the state of a crime scene immediately following an incident, we will likely see the original positioning of objects at the time of the crime, including the mirror. If there is a discrepancy in the mirror's position between what it's supposed to show in the crime scene (as in the Crime Photo) and Armstrong's statement about moving it afterward, it would create a contradiction. Since movement of objects after a crime can suggest tampering or concealing actions, this contradiction could be pertinent.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Armstrong's Testimony 3 regarding moving the mirror post-incident, and the Crime Photo which would depict the immediate state of the crime scene, indicating whether the mirror was moved before or after the photo was taken.\n\n{\"evidence\": 12, \"testimony\": 3}",

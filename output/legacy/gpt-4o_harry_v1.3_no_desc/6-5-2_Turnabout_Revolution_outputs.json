The key evidence here is \"Photo of My Father\", which is Evidence 2. If this evidence showcases Dr. Buff in a situation that contradicts the testimony that he was \"absorbed in a book\", such as being engaged in an activity or situation different from merely reading, this would present a contradiction.\n\nAfter careful consideration, it seems that there should be a distinction between the activities depicted in the evidence and what is being testified.

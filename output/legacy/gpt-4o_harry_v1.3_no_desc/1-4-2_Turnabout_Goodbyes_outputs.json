From the given evidence, we find:\n\nEvidence 4:\nName: Lake Photo\n\nTypically, photographs are used to provide visual confirmation of events or identities. The Lake Photo is a critical piece of evidence that could potentially show who was actually on the boat, thereby contradicting Lotta's claim if it shows otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the likely contradiction is between Lotta's testimony claiming she saw Edgeworth on the boat and the Lake Photo, which might reveal a different truth.\n\n{\"evidence\": 4, \"testimony\": 0}",

    "response": "Lotta Hart's testimony states: \"That's why I was camping out by the lake,\" as if she was there for the sole purpose of taking pictures of the lake monster, Gourdy. However, we have evidence in the form of Lotta's Camera (Evidence 2), which contradicts her testimony. Lotta's camera, in this case, was set to photograph loud noises automatically, indicating that she wasn't just taking photographs for the monster but rather attempting to catch something else, implying that her stated purpose for being there might not be entirely true.

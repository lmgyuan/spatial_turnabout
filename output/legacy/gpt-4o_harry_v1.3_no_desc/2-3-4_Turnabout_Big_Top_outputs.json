    "response": "To find the contradiction, we need to match the testimonies related directly to the act of lifting and positioning the Max G. Bust with the corresponding evidence. Acro's testimonies mainly focus on his physical capability and the act's feasibility.\n\nAcro Testimony 3: \"There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body,\" suggests his inability to compensate with lower body strength due to his condition from the waist down.\n\nWe need to find an evidence piece about lifting or positioning that contradicts this assertion. Evidence 15, \"Max G. Bust,\" is a plausible candidate since Acro could not lower it due to the strength limitations he describes in his testimony.\n\nThe contradiction arises from Acro's particular statement of inability combined with the physical lifting of the Max G. Bust, necessary for the crime in question. Hence, Acro testifying that he could not exert such force contradictions with the evidence of the bust being moved, which would have required such effort.\n\n{\"evidence\": 15, \"testimony\": 3}",

    "response": "Testimony 6 states that after having one sip of coffee, the next moment Drew Misham was on the floor, suggesting he died immediately after drinking the coffee. However, Testimony 5 states that Brushel drank the same coffee and did not die, which suggests that the coffee itself was not inherently poisonous to everyone. The contradiction lies in the claim about the immediate effects of the coffee.\n\nThis can potentially be contradicted by Evidence 27, the Nail Polish, which might reveal that the poison was not in the coffee but in contact with something else, such as nail polish. This could explain why the coffee did not affect Brushel; it was not the source of the poison.\n\nTherefore, the evidence that contradicts the statement about the coffee is the Nail Polish, which might have been the actual source of poison leading to Drew Misham's death through contact rather than ingestion.\n\n{\"evidence\": 27, \"testimony\": 6}",

    "response": "To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies, we need to examine the details within each. Testimony 2 mentions a \"yellow envelope,\" and it is stated that it was left at the crime scene. We should check if there is an evidence that corresponds to this description.

However, Evidence 5 (\"Powers'(?) Photo\") depicts a photo that suggests otherwise. Typically in the case, it is revealed that the photo shows someone in the Steel Samurai costume, which is part of the disguise used by the true perpetrator. It would not have been Powers as Oldbag claims because the costume obscures who is wearing it.\n\nSince Testimony 7 claims it was Powers she saw, but the evidence photo would suggest it's uncertain who was in the costume, there lies the contradiction.\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 7}",

    "response": "To find a contradiction between evidence and testimony, let's examine the given details.\n\nIn the testimonies provided, Oldbag claims several things:\n\n1. The time of Hammer's death was 2:30 PM.\n2. The only person she saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers.\n3. No one else went there.\n4. If they had, she would have seen them.\n\nNow, let's consider the evidence:\n\nEvidence 5, Powers'(?) Photo, is crucial here. It is a photo that presumably shows someone with a Steel Samurai costume at the studio at a specific time. This evidence suggests that perhaps someone other than Will Powers could have been at the studio.\n\nSince Oldbag is adamant that she did not see anyone else go into the studio and that she would have seen them if they had, the photo casts doubt on her testimony. If the photo shows someone else entering or at a different time and is mistaken for Powers, it directly contradicts this testimony.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 5, Powers'(?) Photo, and Testimony 3, where Oldbag claims if someone else had gone, she would have seen them.\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 3}",

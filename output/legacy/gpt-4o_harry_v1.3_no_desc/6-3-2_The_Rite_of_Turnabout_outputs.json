    "response": "To find contradictions between the testimonies and the evidence, we need to analyze the details given. The testimonies describe the circumstances during the event when \"shadowy silhouettes\" were seen, supposedly created by a full moon. \n\nLet's break down the testimonies:\n1. Testimony 0 and 1 describe \"shadowy silhouettes\" created by the light of the full moon.\n2. Testimony 2 claims these shadows allowed identification, specifically seeing the accused holding a dagger in reverse.\n\nWe will need to identify evidence that could invalidate these testimonies. One possibility could be evidence that challenges the condition of a clear night with a full moon, which is central to the claims of seeing silhouettes.\n\nPossible evidences include (but are not limited to):\n- Evidence 2 (May 9th Newspaper) may contain information about weather conditions.\n- Evidence 7 (Inner Sanctum Photo) might contain visual contradiction.\n- Evidence 8 (Maya's Statement) might state something else about that night.\n- Evidence 16 (Crime Photo) might confront the nature of the dagger hold.\n\nNow, given the testimonies rely on the condition of a full moon, upon reviewing the evidence, May 9th Newspaper (Evidence 2) could potentially reveal that it was not a full moon on that night or might have had weather conditions contradicting the testimonies about clear visibility.\n\nThus, if the May 9th Newspaper showed a contradiction to the full moon claim, it would be a direct contradiction to Testimony 1, which talks about the full moon creating the shadows.\n\nAssuming this is accurate, this contradiction focuses on Testimony 1:\n- Testimony about the full moon against the May 9th Newspaper proving the conditions incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be:\n\n{\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 1}",

However, that doesn't seem entirely on point.\n\nIf we focus instead on Evidence 8: Maya's Statement, this could be a direct contradiction. If Maya's statement implies or indicates that someone either was at the Inner Sanctum or provides a method to access it, then it would directly contradict Ihmus's statement about the impossibility of accessing the Sanctum.\n\nThus, without further details, matching the premise of Maya being in the Inner Sanctum would work:\n\n{\"evidence\": 8, \"testimony\": 3}",

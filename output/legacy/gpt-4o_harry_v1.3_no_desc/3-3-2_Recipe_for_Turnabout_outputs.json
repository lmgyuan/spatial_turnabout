    "response": "To solve this, we need to find an evidence-testimony pair that doesn't align with the information contained within each. We have the evidence and testimonies from Detective Gumshoe to consider.\n\nFrom Gumshoe's testimonies:\n- Testimony 3: \"But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\"\n\nLooking at the evidences:\n- Evidence 10 (Glen's Autopsy Report): Typically, an autopsy report contains critical information about the deceased person, including identification and other details post-mortem. This should contrast with testimony 2, where Gumshoe said the victim didn't have any identification on him, although the autopsy report could have helped in identifying the victim quickly.\n\nHowever, to satisfy the condition more closely:\n\n- Evidence 14 (Victim's Lottery Ticket): This is particularly relevant because Testimony 4 mentions the lottery ticket being found, but does not imply the investigation went smoothly or quickly—especially when considering the implication of the victim’s quick identification.\n\nGiven these insights:\n- Testimony 2 states \"The victim didn't have any identification on him.\"\n- Evidence 14 is about the Victim's Lottery Ticket, which contrasts with the lack of immediate identification, as possession of the lottery ticket could be considered a form of identification or clue towards the victim's identity.\n\nWhile the lottery ticket itself isn't direct identification, it is a significant lead that contradicts the assertion that the victim didn't have any means of being identified.\n\nSo the correct contradictory pair:\n- Evidence 14 contradicts Testimony 2.\n\n{\"evidence\": 14, \"testimony\": 2}",

We would need to find evidence that makes this claim improbable or impossible.\n\n- The \"Coffee Cup\" (Evidence 13) can be considered. If the coffee cup doesn't support the idea of something spilling over and soaking a cloth (such as it being too small, sealed, or another factor that keeps all liquid inside despite a spill), it may serve as a contradictory piece of evidence.\n\nThis approach finds specific incompatibility between the assertion made in testimony 3 (about the vase related incident) and what we might infer from the coffee cup or the circumstances it describes.\n\nThus, the JSON formation for a contradictory pair could hypothetically be:\n\n```json\n{\"evidence\": 13, \"testimony\": 3}\n```",

The testimony claims Jinxie Tenma stole a staff from the Forbidden Chamber after finding the crime scene, but possession of the key should negate the possibility of her simply stumbling in unless she had access to the key or another method to enter, which is not mentioned.\n\nThe presence of the Forbidden Chamber Key suggests restricted access, implying Jinxie could not have easily entered to steal the staff as Filch claims.\n\n{\"evidence\": 17, \"testimony\": 3}",

    "response": "To identify a contradiction, we look for evidence details that directly oppose or conflict with the statements made in the testimonies. \n\nThe testimony in question is Testimony 5, which mentions a single gunshot. Typically, an autopsy report reveals the number of gunshots or bullets involved in a case. Let's examine Evidence 3, Robert's Autopsy Report, to cross-reference with the statement. \n\nIf Robert's Autopsy Report indicates multiple gunshot wounds, this directly contradicts the testimony that a single gunshot was heard.\n\nUpon reviewing the details, let's assume Robert's Autopsy Report does indeed mention multiple gunshots or bullet wounds, which would contradict Testimony 5 that mentions only one gunshot being heard.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction would be between Evidence 3 and Testimony 5.\n\n{\"evidence\": 3, \"testimony\": 5}",

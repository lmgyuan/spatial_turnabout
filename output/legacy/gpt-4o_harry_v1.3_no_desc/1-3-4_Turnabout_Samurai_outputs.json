    "response": "The contradiction lies between Cody's testimonies, specifically Testimony 5 where Cody claims to have seen the Steel Samurai at the studio, and the evidence provided by \"Powers'(?) Photo\" (Evidence 5). This evidence is a photograph taken at the studios that day and shows a person in the Steel Samurai costume, but not necessarily Will Powers, as it is later revealed that someone else could have been wearing the costume. Cody claiming he saw the Steel Samurai doesn't align with the context provided by the photo which is meant to capture the only person dressed as the Steel Samurai, adding doubt about his claim when his camera would have been the crucial piece to verify his statement. Therefore, his claim without corroborating evidence like a photograph is suspect, especially because he mentions in Testimony 8 he did not have his camera for the potential shot, contrasting with what we can infer from Easy 5.\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 8}",

    "response": "To determine which evidence and testimony contradict each other, let's focus on Cody's testimonies and the pieces of evidence that relate to taking pictures or photographs.\n\nCody has a testimony where he says:\nTestimony 3: \"But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.\"\n\nHowever, if we examine the evidences, we notice:\nEvidence 15: \"Cody's Camera\"\n\nBased on the scenario, \"Cody's Camera\" is evidence to suggest he could and did take pictures. If Cody claims he missed taking a photo because the lens wouldn't open, yet has photos stored or has taken photos before, it contradicts his claim of missing the event due to a camera malfunction.\n\nThus, the contradiction lies between Cody Testimony 3 and Evidence 15:\n\n{\"evidence\": 15, \"testimony\": 3}",

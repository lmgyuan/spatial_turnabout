    "response": "To find the contradiction between the evidence and testimony, we need to look at the context provided by both. Let's examine Testimony 4 and some of the evidences.\n\nTestimony 4 suggests that Scuttlebutt positively identified Juniper because she was wearing a costume that she made. However, there is a piece of evidence, the \"Glowing Costume Photo\" (Evidence 10), which likely depicts the costume in question and might provide a visual clue that contradicts the claim.\n\nLet's think through why Testimony 4 might not make sense: if the costume is the key identification element, but the photograph (Evidence 10) shows a costume that doesn't match Juniper's known creations or can't be clearly attributed to her, this would be a contradiction. If the Glowing Costume Photo shows something that contradicts the certainty expressed in Testimony 4, then we will have a contradiction.\n\nOn further examination, a more notable contradiction is in Testimony 3. Testimony 3 claims that Scuttlebutt was led to Professor Courte's body by Juniper. However, none of the evidence directly refutes this specific path claimed in Testimony 3, rather than Testimony 4, which seems more about identification.\n\nAccording to Testimony 4, Scuttlebutt was sure it was Juniper because of the costume. It's possible that the identification based on the costume — as potentially captured in the Glowing Costume Photo (Evidence 10) — might not hold because the photo could depict a generic or non-specific costume, thereby contradicting Scuttlebutt's certainty based on the costume.\n\nSo the pair is:\n- Evidence 10: Glowing Costume Photo\n- Testimony 4: I'm positive it was Juniper because she was wearing the costume that she had made!

This evidence might suggest that something belonging to or associated with O'Conner was found in a location he claims not to have been—possibly the art room.\n\nTherefore, if the \"Hugh\" Scrap was found in the art room, it would directly contradict O'Conner's testimony claiming he never went there.\n\n{\"evidence\": 16, \"testimony\": 3}",

If he never showed, then the presence of Tres Bien matches at Tender Lender becomes suspicious and contradicts this testimony.\n\nThus, there is a contradiction between Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches) and Testimony 3 from Tigre.\n\n{\"evidence\": 24, \"testimony\": 3}",

    "response": "Let's analyze the testimonies and find the evidence that contradicts them. \n\nTestimony 4, given by Tigre, states that Glen Elg won \"half a million bucks\". This implies Glen Elg had access to a significant amount of money, suggesting he would be able to pay back his debts, including the one to Tigre. However, Testimony 2 states that Elg claimed he had \"no way to pay up\". \n\nThis contradiction can be further supported by Evidence 14, the Victim's Lottery Ticket, which indeed confirms that Glen Elg had a winning ticket for half a million dollars, suggesting he did have the means to pay off his debt. \n\nThus, this piece of evidence directly contradicts Tigre's statement in Testimony 2.\n\n{\"evidence\": 14, \"testimony\": 2}",

JUSTICE!\nPerson: Fulbright\n\nWhich evidence and testimony contradict each other? You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "The contradictions in the evidence and testimony lie in the statements made by Detective Fulbright and the details revealed by the evidence.\n\nFrom Testimony 3, Fulbright says, \"So the very fact that I'm afraid of the moon rock means I'm not him!\" This statement implies that the phantom would have no reason to be afraid of the moon rock, and the fear of it is proof that Fulbright is not the phantom.\n\nHowever, Evidence 4, the \"Hope\" Capsule, contains asteroid samples and was present at both crime scenes. Fulbright's fear related to the moon rock suggests a deeper connection. Evidence shows that the moon rock was stolen seven years ago, which is a potential reason for the phantom to fear it being discovered or connected back to them. It's a tool that could uncover the truth of the past incident.\n\nThis suggests that the testimony given by Fulbright contradicts the implication drawn from the evidence regarding the phantom and the moon rock.\n\n{\"evidence\": 4, \"testimony\": 3}",

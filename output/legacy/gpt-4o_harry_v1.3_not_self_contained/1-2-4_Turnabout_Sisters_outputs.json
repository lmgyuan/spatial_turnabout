    "response": "To identify the contradiction between the provided evidence and testimonies, let's analyze the situation:\n\nRedd White's testimonies claim that:\n- Testimony 2: He saw Miss Mia run to the left.\n- Testimony 3: The killer attacked Mia, but she dodged.\n\nWe can refer to the evidence gathered:\n- Evidence 8: Floor Plans describes that the stand is blocked from view looking from the office. If someone was viewing the scene from a point blocking the view, it indicates inconsistencies in seeing victim movements clearly as claimed in the testimony.\n\nWith these references:\n- Testimony 2 claims the victim ran to the left, but the Floor Plans indicate a blocked view, bringing about inconsistencies with the visibility of such a movement.\n\nThe contradiction is between testifying victim movement and existing or blocked visual sightlines as outlined in Evidence 8:\n\n{\"evidence\": 8, \"testimony\": 2}",

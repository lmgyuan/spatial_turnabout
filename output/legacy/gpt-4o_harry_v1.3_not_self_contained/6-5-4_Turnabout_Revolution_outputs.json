    "response": "The testimony that \"After Queen Amara's passing, Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran is the only spirit medium left\" is contradicting with Evidence 18, which is linked to Amara Sigatar Khura'in. Evidence 18 (Gemstone) suggests that Amara is actually alive and active in some capacity, as it involves a recent event in her tomb with Inga's button found in the ashes. This implies that Amara may still be a capable spirit medium. Therefore, Nayna's claim is incorrect or misleading.\n\n{\"evidence\": 18, \"testimony\": 3}",

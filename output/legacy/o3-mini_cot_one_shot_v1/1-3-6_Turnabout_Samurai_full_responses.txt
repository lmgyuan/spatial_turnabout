Testimony 4 states that at exactly 2:30 PM, Vasquez and his group took a 15‐minute break during their meeting. However, Evidence 3—the autopsy report for Jack Hammer—establishes that the victim died at 2:30 PM from a spear wound. This creates a conflict in the timeline, as Vasquez claims he was occupied with a meeting break at the precise time of the murder.

******************************
The contradiction arises over Will Powers’s whereabouts. Vasquez’s testimony (Testimony 1) explicitly states that “only Powers was absent” when the body was discovered, implying that he wasn’t at the scene at that moment. However, Evidence 5—a photo of Powers taken at the gate (timestamped 2:00 PM)—shows him present at the studio’s entrance at a time that does not match his claimed absence. This discrepancy between his stated absence and the photo evidence suggests a clear contradiction.

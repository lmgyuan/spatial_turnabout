Testimony 3 claims that “The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.” However, Evidence 9—the Pistol—is identified as Dr. Grey’s own weapon yet it bears both Maya’s and Grey’s fingerprints. If the defendant had initiated a surprise attack and used his own weapon, one would not expect the murder weapon to be the victim’s pistol showing his prints. The presence of Grey’s fingerprints on the murder weapon contradicts the narrative that the victim was completely unprepared in an assault by the defendant.

******************************
Testimony 3 claims that “the victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed,” yet Evidence 8 (Dr. Grey’s Autopsy Report) details that he was shot in the forehead at point‐blank distance. In a situation where a shot is “missed” one wouldn’t expect a fatal, point‐blank gunshot wound on the victim’s head. This inconsistency between what the testimony alleges about the victim’s shot and the autopsy’s account makes it a clear contradiction.

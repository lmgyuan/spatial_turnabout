Testimony 5 confidently accuses the bellboy of being the assassin. However, Evidence 15—a knife bearing both the victim’s blood and Engarde’s fingerprints—directly implicates Matt Engarde. These two items are in direct opposition: while Powers claims the bellboy is guilty, the forensic evidence on the knife points to Engarde.

******************************
De Killer’s testimony 5 claims that the “knife” was a planted prop—a fabricated piece meant to mislead investigators. Yet, Evidence 15—the Knife—shows it is not only stained with the victim’s blood but also bears Engarde’s fingerprints, strongly indicating it was used in the fatal stabbing as determined by the autopsy. This discrepancy between the genuine forensic detail on the knife and the claim that it was planted stands out as a direct contradiction.

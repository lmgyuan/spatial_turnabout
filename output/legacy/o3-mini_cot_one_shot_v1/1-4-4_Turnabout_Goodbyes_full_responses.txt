Testimony 5 claims that after hearing a single gunshot, Butz went home, yet Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition) states that Lotta heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. This direct discrepancy about the number of gunshots contradicts each other.

Testimony 3 from Butz says, "But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!" implying a single shot, yet Evidence 11 ("Lotta's Deposition") records hearing two gunshots. This discrepancy between the number of shots heard in the testimony versus the deposition evidence is contradictory.

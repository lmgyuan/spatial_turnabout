Testimony 3 claims that Mask☆DeMasque only targets the most precious art pieces, implying items of great inherent and monetary value. However, Evidence 4 describes the Sacred Urn as “supposedly priceless” yet notably “has no monetary value.” This contradiction between the idea of stealing only highly valuable art and an item that, although called priceless, would not be considered valuable in monetary terms is significant.

Evidence 6 – the Shichishito – notes that Mask☆DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head. However, in Testimony 2, Atmey states, "Just as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!" This implies the attack came while he was turning (likely facing the assailant) rather than being struck from behind. The differing descriptions of the direction and nature of the blow create a contradiction between the evidence and the testimony.

Testimony 5 by Atmey claims, "I put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye," implying the attack struck him at the front of his head even though his back was against the wall. In contrast, Evidence 6 (Shichishito) includes the note that "DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime w/ a blow to the back of the head," indicating the impact was delivered to the back. This clear discrepancy about where the blow landed is our contradiction.

Testimony 5 states that Ron snagged his broach on a door handle where it got torn off, but Evidence 14 (DeMasque's Broach) shows it was found in the shadow of Ami Fey's statue, implying a different scenario of how—and where—it was lost.

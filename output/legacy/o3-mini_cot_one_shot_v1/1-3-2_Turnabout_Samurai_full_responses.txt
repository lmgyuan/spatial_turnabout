The security guard (Oldbag) claimed in Testimony 7 that the man she saw at 2:00 PM—whom she identified as Powers—was confidently heading toward the studio. However, Evidence 5 (Powers’ Photo) shows him walking at that time while dragging one leg. This physical inconsistency between his apparent injury and the guard’s observation of his purposeful stride creates a clear contradiction.

******************************
Testimony 3 asserts, “If they had, I would have seen them!” implying that any additional person entering Studio One would not go unnoticed. However, Evidence 11 – the “Mr. Monkey's Head” – states that a blockage obstructed the path to the scene from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. This obstruction provides a plausible means for someone to slip into the studio without being seen, directly contradicting Oldbag’s claim in Testimony 3.

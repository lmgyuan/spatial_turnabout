Testimony 4 states that during Maggey's search, they found “the bottle of poison,” implying that the poison was contained in a bottle. However, none of the evidence includes a bottle containing poison. Instead, Evidence 13—the Coffee Cup—reveals that the drink contained potassium cyanide, and Evidence 16 shows that a deadly powder (potassium cyanide) with Maggey's fingerprints was found in her apron pocket. Neither of these items describe a bottle of poison, which makes Testimony 4 inconsistent with the actual evidence.

Kudo’s testimony (Testimony 6) claims there was nothing particularly unusual about the serving girl when he saw her – almost as if her presence was entirely unremarkable. However, Evidence 16 (Potassium Cyanide) was found hidden in Maggey’s apron pocket and bears her fingerprints. This physical evidence strongly implicates her in the poisoning, a fact that makes it hard to believe that nothing about her appearance or behavior ever caught anyone’s attention. Such a discrepancy between her unremarkable appearance (as per the testimony) and her secret possession of the deadly powder creates a clear contradiction.

Testimony 4 from Kudo claims that “the little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip,” implying that an unknown, small young person handled the cup. However, Evidence 13 (the Coffee Cup) clearly states that the cup is covered only in the victim's and Maggey's fingerprints, with no indication of anyone else’s touch. This discrepancy suggests a direct contradiction between who actually handled the cup.

Testimony 2 claims that someone knocked a vase over, breaking it, yet Evidence 12—the Crime Photo—shows that an intact vase sits on each table. This contradiction between the state of the vases suggests that the event described in Testimony 2 does not match the physical evidence found at the scene.

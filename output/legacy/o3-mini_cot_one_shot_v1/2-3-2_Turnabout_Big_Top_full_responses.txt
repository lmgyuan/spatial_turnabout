Trilo repeatedly claimed he kept the engagement ring in his pocket that night—especially in his statement, "In the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!" However, Evidence 10—a cheap ring engraved with "From T to R"—was found at the scene. If Trilo truly had the ring in his pocket, it wouldn’t have been left behind. This contradiction between his testimony and the physical evidence suggests that something is amiss.

Moe claims in Testimony 0 that “that shadow could only have belonged to Max,” implying that Max himself was present at the scene. Yet, Evidence 15—a bronze bust of Max taken from the cafeteria before the crime—indicates that an inanimate representation of him (his bust) was the item on display rather than Max himself. If Max’s bust had been removed beforehand, it lessens the likelihood that the actual Max was casting that unmistakable shadow. This inconsistency between Moe’s eyewitness account and the evidence suggesting Max was already absent from the scene marks them as contradictory.

Testimony 3 asserts that "he was wearing [the silk hat] the entire time that he was on the scene," implying that the suspect never removed it. However, Evidence 3—described as a silk hat found at the crime scene—indicates that the hat was abandoned. If the suspect had kept the hat on throughout his time at the scene, it would not have been present as an item left behind. This contradiction between the testimony and the physical evidence clearly points to inconsistency in the observations regarding the hat.

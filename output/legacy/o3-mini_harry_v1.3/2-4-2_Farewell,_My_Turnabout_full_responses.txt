Testimony 5 claims that the defendant “bought the knife for the crime” to commit a premeditated murder. However, Evidence 14 (Juan’s Autopsy Report) states that the victim was first strangled with a scarf and then stabbed with the knife. If the murder had been premeditated and carried out with a purchased knife, one would expect the stabbing to be the sole method rather than preceded by strangulation. This inconsistency between the cause‐of‐death and the supposed premeditated use of a purchased knife makes Evidence 14 and Testimony 5 contradict each other.

Testimony 5 claims that the suspect was wearing a flashy racing jacket, suggesting a modern, perhaps sporty outfit. However, Evidence 2 is a glossy photo of the Nickel Samurai costume—the formal, specific samurai attire associated with the character. These two descriptions of what the suspect was wearing are contradictory, since the Nickel Samurai costume clearly isn’t a racing jacket.

Testimony 3 declares that the Nickel Samurai had to be at the post‐ceremony stage show immediately after the crime, implying he couldn’t have been at the scene to commit the murder. Yet evidence 15, the knife bearing Engarde's (the Nickel Samurai’s) fingerprints, shows that he was in direct contact with the murder weapon. This pair contradicts each other because one suggests he was occupied elsewhere, while the other places him at the scene.

Andrews claims she “poured herself a glass of juice” (Testimony 4), yet the evidence—a wine glass found next to the victim—is full of tomato juice, shows her fingerprints, and notably “no sign it's been drank” (Evidence 8). This contradiction suggests that, despite her claim of using the glass, the forensic evidence indicates it was left untouched.

Andrews claims in Testimony 1 that he opened the guitar case ("I suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over"), yet Evidence 7 shows that the case bears only Corrida's fingerprints. This contradiction implies that Andrews’ statement about handling the guitar case does not match the forensic findings.

Testimony 3 claims that Matt didn’t have an alibi at the time of the murder. However, Evidence 20 is Matt’s own note stating, “Please feed my cat, Shoe. My house is just a little ways down from the hotel,” which suggests he was close to home at that time—a detail that could serve as an alibi. This creates a contradiction between Andrews’s claim in Testimony 3 and the implication from Evidence 20.

Testimony 0 states, "That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself," implying Andrews did not handle or pour the juice. However, Evidence 8, the Wine Glass filled with tomato juice, clearly bears Andrews' fingerprints—indicating that she did handle the glass. This contradiction between her claim and the physical evidence makes this pair stand out.

Testimony 3 claims that Mask☆DeMasque always targets the most precious art pieces, implying high monetary or artistic value. However, Evidence 4—the Sacred Urn—is described as supposedly priceless yet “a plain old pot” with no monetary value. This discrepancy between something "precious" and something that "has no monetary value" makes this pair contradictory.

One interesting conflict is between the poster advertising the Kurain Exhibit (Evidence 2) and Atmey’s recollection of what happened that night (Testimony 3). The poster makes it clear that the Sacred Urn was scheduled to be on display (meaning it was in a carefully planned public show) while Atmey’s testimony insists that after being ambushed—“Darkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.”—the criminal had completely vanished in the chaos. It becomes hard to reconcile how the exhibit could have been arranged and secured for a scheduled public event if a daring, chaotic, and clumsy midnight assault was taking place that allowed the perpetrator to simply vanish without any semblance of a proper scheme. In short, the public, well‐planned nature implied by Evidence 2 seems at odds with Atmey’s account of a fleeting, disorderly assault described in Testimony 3.

Evidence 6 tells us that Mask☆DeMasque struck Atmey with a blow to the back of his head, knocking him out. Yet in Testimony 5, Atmey states that the thief’s blow landed on his third eye. These details about the location of the blow contradict each other.

Ron’s testimony claiming that you can clearly see him as Mask☆DeMasque in a photo conflicts with a newspaper clipping (Evidence 16) which instead identifies the person in the photo as Ron DeLite—the guard. This contradiction casts serious doubt on Ron’s claim of being Mask☆DeMasque.

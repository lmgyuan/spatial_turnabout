Next is the Rite of Water, in which the priestess enters the spring dressed as Lady Kee'ra, and the high priest purifies both Lady Kee'ra and her dagger. The ceremony ends with the Rite of Fire, in which the priestess circles the sacred flames to purify her soul. The two then devote themselves to prayer until the rite comes to a close two days later at noontime.\nEvidence 2\nName: May 9th Newspaper\nDescription: A newspaper from the morning of the Purification Rite.

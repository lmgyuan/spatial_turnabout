One interesting contradiction appears when comparing the state of the victim’s personal effects with Gumshoe’s statement about the integrity of the scene. In Testimony 5 Gumshoe insists, “And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene,” implying that every item was accounted for. However, Evidence 17 – the Victim’s Prescription Bag – is found empty. Since the bag was supposed to contain the victim’s medication, its missing contents indicate that something was indeed absent from the scene. This discrepancy between an “intact” crime scene (according to Gumshoe) and a prescription bag missing its medicine is one clear mismatch.

Victor Kudo claims in his testimony (Testimony 18) that he broke the vase at his seat during the incident. However, the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) clearly shows that each table had an intact vase. This contradiction between his admission and the physical evidence is striking.

Evidence 13—the Coffee Cup—shows that the cup has both the victim’s and Maggey’s fingerprints, indicating it was handled by them during the incident. However, Testimony 4 (by Kudo) claims that "the little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip," suggesting someone else altogether handled and drank from it. This presents a contradiction between the physical evidence (confirming the cup’s handlers) and the account given in the testimony.

******************************
The crime photo (Evidence 12) clearly depicts that each table still has an intact vase, with no sign of one being overturned. However, Testimony 2 from Kudo insists that “the clumsy idiot upset the vase” and knocked it over. This discrepancy—between the photo’s evidence of no broken vases and the testimony claiming that one was knocked over—provides a clear contradiction between the evidence and the testimony.

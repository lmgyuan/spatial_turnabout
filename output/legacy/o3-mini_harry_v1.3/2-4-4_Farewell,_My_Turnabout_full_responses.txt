The contradiction is between testimony 4 and evidence 4. In testimony 4, Powers insists that the bellboy left the guest’s room empty-handed, implying he wasn’t carrying anything significant. However, evidence 4— the Radio Transceiver—shows that an item originally linked to the bellboy (in fact, linked to Maya’s kidnapper, De Killer) was recovered, indicating that the bellboy was in possession of something. This directly contradicts the claim of him being empty-handed.

Testimony 5 claims that the murder weapon—the knife—was manufactured and planted to frame someone. However, Evidence 15 (the Knife) shows the victim’s blood and Engarde’s fingerprints, implying it was the actual murder weapon and not a planted prop. This creates a contradiction between de Killer’s claim and the physical evidence.

******************************
Testimony 0 from de Killer states, “Yes, now I remember. I took that request by mail,” making it sound like his only involvement was accepting a murder‐job order received by mail. However, Evidence 4—the Radio Transceiver—is noted as “Originally from Maya's kidnapper, who goes by the name of ‘De Killer’.” This directly links him to a kidnapping, contradicting the innocuous account he gives in his testimony. In other words, if he were simply a hitman taking orders by mail as he claims, he wouldn’t be connected to equipment that came from his own kidnapper activities.

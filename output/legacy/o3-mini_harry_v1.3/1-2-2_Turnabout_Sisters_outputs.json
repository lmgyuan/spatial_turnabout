    "response": "Gumshoe claims in his fifth testimony that before she died, Mia wrote down the killer’s name. However, Mia’s Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) indicates that she suffered a single blunt force trauma that killed her almost instantly—suggesting she had little time (if any) to take such an action. This inconsistency between the rapid death described by the autopsy and the testimony about her last written word brings these two items into contradiction.\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 5}",

    "response": "April May’s testimony (Testimony 4) insists the murder weapon was “that clock – the kinda statue-y clock,” referring to “The Thinker.” However, Evidence 3 is a department store receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder.

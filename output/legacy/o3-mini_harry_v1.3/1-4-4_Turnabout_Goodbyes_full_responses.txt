Lotta’s Deposition (Evidence 11) indicates that two gunshot sounds were heard just after midnight, while Butz’s testimony (Testimony 3) only mentions hearing a single “bang.” This discrepancy in the number of gunshots represents a clear contradiction.

Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition) states that two sounds like gunshots were heard, while Butz’s testimony—specifically Testimony 3—claims he only heard one gunshot. This inconsistency between the number of gunshots heard is the contradiction.

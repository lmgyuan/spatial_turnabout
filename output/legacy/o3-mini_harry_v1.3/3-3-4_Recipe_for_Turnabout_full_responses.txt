Armstrong’s testimony insists a large mirror partitioned the dining room (“La mirror, it was in z'e middle…”) while the crime photo (Evidence 12) clearly shows that a folding screen—not a mirror—separated the two dining tables. This discrepancy between the physical evidence and his description is a clear contradiction.

Evidence 7, the Scooter, directly conflicts with Testimony 6. The scooter was noted as being ridden by "my phony," implying that there was indeed a phony present acting during the incident. However, Testimony 6 from Armstrong states, "Non, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting," asserting that no such deceptive extra was active. This contradiction between the evidence of a phony's involvement and the denial of one by the witness makes this pair stand out.

Evidence 20, which is Glen's Calendar noting a meeting with “The Tiger” on Dec. 3, implies that Glen was scheduled to meet Tigre that day. However, in Testimony 2 Tigre claims he never saw "that kid" (referring to the victim) that day, thereby contradicting the scheduled meeting on the calendar.

Testimony 0 from Tigre says he "never met Glen Elg," yet Evidence 20, Glen's Calendar, has a note for a meeting with "The Tiger"—a nickname for Tigre. This suggests that Glen had an appointment with Tigre, directly contradicting his claim.

Tigre claims in his first testimony that he was supposed to meet “wid the kid” at the restaurant that afternoon. However, the victim’s calendar (Evidence 20) has a note stating “Meet with The Tiger” on December 3rd—the day of the incident—which indicates that the victim expected a meeting with Tigre, not with “a kid.” This is a clear contradiction between the victim’s schedule and Tigre’s stated plans.

Evidence 12, the Crime Photo, shows that both vases on the dining tables are intact, but Victor’s testimony (recorded as Evidence 18) claims that he broke the vase at his seat during the incident. This clear mismatch between the physical evidence and his statement makes them contradict each other.

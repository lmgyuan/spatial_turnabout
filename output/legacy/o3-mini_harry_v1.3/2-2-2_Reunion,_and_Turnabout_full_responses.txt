Testimony 2 describes the defendant’s costume as “covered in blood,” but Evidence 11 (Maya’s Costume) tells us that while there are blood splatters and a bullet hole, the robe is otherwise clean. This discrepancy in describing the extent of blood on the costume is the contradiction.

Evidence 8 (Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report) states that after being stabbed in the chest, Grey was shot in the forehead at point-blank range. However, Testimony 3 from Gumshoe claims that after the victim took out his gun, he fired a shot that "missed" because he was so close—implying no bullet wound at close range. This is a direct contradiction between the autopsy findings and the eyewitness account.

Testimony 8 states, "If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot," implying that Cody did not have his camera during the event. However, Evidence 15 is Cody's Camera—a new digital camera that he is known to always carry. This creates a contradiction between his testimony and the physical evidence.

******************************
Evidence 5 shows a photo of Will Powers—taken exactly at the time when Cody claims his camera malfunctioned. In testimony 3, Cody states, “But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it,” which implies he couldn’t capture any useful picture. This directly contradicts the existence of the photo in Evidence 5 that clearly documents Powers’s condition at that moment.

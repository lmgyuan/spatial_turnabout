Lotta Hart’s testimony states she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth on the boat, implying that he was the one who committed the crime. However, the note from Evidence 20 reads “Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth,” which indicates that someone had it out for him—a motive more in keeping with him being the target of a setup rather than its perpetrator. These two pieces of information conflict: one accuses Edgeworth of direct criminal action, while the other suggests he was the intended recipient of revenge.

Testimony 3 claims that the camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower, while Evidence 2 shows that Lotta's Camera is actually set to take a picture when a loud noise is detected. This is a contradiction in the purpose of the camera.

The autopsy report (Evidence 3) notes that the victim died from one bullet shot to the heart (fired from about one meter away), which suggests a single, close-range shot was responsible for the death. However, in Testimony 7, Lotta describes hearing another gunshot—“a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot”—implying that more than one shot was fired during the incident. This directly contradicts the autopsy’s indication of just one fatal bullet, making Evidence 3 and Testimony 7 inconsistent with each other.

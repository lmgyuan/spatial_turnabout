Evidence 11 (Maya's Costume) shows that Maya’s outfit was blood-splattered and even had a bullet hole. However, in Testimony 4, Ini states that her costume looked "totally, like, normal." This is a direct contradiction between the physical evidence of damage on the costume and the testimony describing it as normal.

Testimony 6 states that Ini didn't have her driver’s license, which is why she couldn’t take control while her sister was driving. However, Evidence 18 is Ini’s license photo, implying that she does indeed have a driver's license. This is a clear contradiction between Ini’s testimony and the physical evidence.

Testimony 0 has Ini saying she was "really close to getting [her] license," implying she hadn’t fully received it yet. However, Evidence 18 is marked as Ini's License Photo—a completed driver’s license photo that seemingly belongs to someone who’s already attained that milestone. This pair contradicts each other regarding her driving credentials.

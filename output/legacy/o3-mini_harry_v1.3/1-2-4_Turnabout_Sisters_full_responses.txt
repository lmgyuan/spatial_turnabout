Floor Plans (Evidence 8) describe the murder scene at Fey & Co. where the key area (the stand) is blocked from view from inside the office. However, in Testimony 3 “Then I turned to look at the building across the way” the witness claims to have actually seen what was happening from that window. If the stand was indeed blocked from view according to the floor plans, then the witness’s ability to observe the act from that angle contradicts the physical layout. This inconsistency between Evidence 8 and Testimony 3 shows a clear contradiction.

The autopsy report (Evidence 5) states that the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, implying only one violent strike. In contrast, Testimony 6 claims, "You see? You hit her twice!"—a clear contradiction regarding the number of blows delivered.

The testimony from White (Testimony 1) claims that "A light stand was lying on the floor when I looked." However, Evidence 2 describes only the broken remains—glass shards—from a light stand that was shattered beyond recognition. This discrepancy suggests that the witness’s account of an intact light stand directly contradicts the actual evidence, which shows that the light stand had been broken apart.

******************************
Testimony 3 recounts seeing the glass light stand, yet Evidence 2 shows only broken shards of a glass light stand. If the stand had been intact enough for someone to notice, we wouldn’t expect to only find shattered remains at the scene. This direct contradiction between what was reportedly seen and what was actually found makes Evidence 2 and Testimony 3 a conflicting pair.

Evidence 5 (Powers’s Photo) shows the Steel Samurai dragging one leg at 2:00 PM at the gate, suggesting he was impaired, while Testimony 7 from Oldbag claims that “It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!” This implies he was moving confidently toward the studio. These details conflict about Powers’s physical condition and intent at that moment.

******************************
Testimony 3 (by Oldbag) confidently claims that if anyone else had gone to the studio, she would have seen them. However, Evidence 11—the Mr. Monkey's Head—reveals that a physical barrier blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, which could have allowed someone to enter or exit without being seen. This evidence directly contradicts Oldbag’s certainty expressed in Testimony 3.

    "response": "Brushel’s remark that Mr. Misham quickly “sealed the envelope” while at his desk suggests that the letter he was working on was immediately secured—a letter presumed to be his own and left at the scene—whereas the Gramarye Envelope in Evidence 2 comes from Mr. Wright (not Mr. Misham) and is marked with instructions “Do not open until the time is right.” These two items seem to be one and the same if one assumes that the envelope in question was in play at the crime scene. In other words, if the envelope Brushel described was really sealed swiftly by Mr. Misham, then it couldn’t possibly be the carefully preserved Gramarye Envelope from Mr. Wright—revealing a direct contradiction between the testimony and the evidence.\n\n{\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 1}",

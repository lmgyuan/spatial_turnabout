To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Oldbag (Testimony 3) that says she arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. However, this is not the contradictory testimony.

We have another testimony from Oldbag (Testimony 4) that says she was at the main gate from 1:00 PM until 5:00 PM. This implies that she was at the main gate the entire time.

However, we have Evidence 2, which is "Guidemap". This evidence could potentially show the layout of the area, including the location of the guard station and the main gate.

But what if the guidemap shows that the guard station and the main gate are in different locations? In that case, it would be impossible for Oldbag to be at the main gate from 1:00 PM until 5:00 PM if she arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.

However, we don't have any direct information about the guidemap, but we can infer that if the guidemap shows the guard station and the main gate are in different locations, it would contradict Oldbag's testimony.

But we have another evidence that directly contradicts Oldbag's testimony. We have Evidence 18, which is "Van". This evidence could potentially show that Oldbag was not at the main gate the entire time, but was actually driving a van.

So, what evidence contradicts Oldbag's testimony? We have Evidence 18, which is "Van". This evidence implies that Oldbag was not at the main gate the entire time, which would contradict her testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Oldbag (Testimony 2) that says no one else went to the studio before 2:30 PM, except for Will Powers. This implies that she has complete knowledge of who went to the studio before 2:30 PM.

However, we have Evidence 3, which is "Jack's Autopsy Report". This evidence shows that Jack Hammer was killed at 2:30 PM.

But what if someone else was at the studio before 2:30 PM, and they were the one who killed Jack Hammer? In that case, Oldbag's testimony would be incorrect.

However, we have another evidence that directly contradicts Oldbag's testimony. We have Evidence 8, which is "Trailer Key". This evidence could potentially show that someone else had access to the studio before 2:30 PM.

But we have another evidence that directly contradicts Oldbag's testimony. We have Evidence 9, which is "Vasquez's Memo". This evidence could potentially show that someone else was at the studio before 2:30 PM.

However, we have another evidence that directly contradicts Oldbag's testimony. We have Evidence 6, which is "Samurai Spear". This evidence could potentially show that someone else was at the studio before 2:30 PM, and they were the one who killed Jack Hammer.

However, we have another evidence that directly contradicts Oldbag's testimony. We have Evidence 18, which is "Van". This evidence could potentially show that Oldbag was not at the guard station the entire time, and therefore she would not have seen everyone who went to the studio before 2:30 PM.

So, what evidence contradicts Oldbag's testimony? We have Evidence 18, which is "Van". This evidence implies that Oldbag was not at the guard station the entire time, which would contradict her testimony.

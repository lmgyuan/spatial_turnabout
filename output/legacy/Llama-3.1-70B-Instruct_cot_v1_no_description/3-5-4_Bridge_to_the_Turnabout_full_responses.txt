To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Iris (Testimony 3) that says Mystic Elise pulled a dagger from inside her robe. This implies that Mystic Elise had a dagger.

However, we have Evidence 10, which is "Shichishito". This evidence could potentially show that Mystic Elise actually used the Shichishito, not a dagger, which would contradict Iris's testimony.

But what if Mystic Elise actually used a dagger? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Mystic Elise did not use a dagger, it's unlikely that Iris would have said that she did.

We have Testimony 2, which says that Mystic Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike.

However, we have Evidence 11, which is "Elise's Autopsy Report". This evidence could potentially show that the fatal strike was not actually delivered by Mystic Elise, or that the circumstances of the fatal strike were different from what Iris described.

So, what evidence contradicts Iris's testimony? We have Evidence 10, which is "Shichishito". This evidence implies that Mystic Elise actually used the Shichishito, not a dagger, which would contradict Iris's testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Iris (Testimony 3) that says Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise. This implies that Mystic Maya was the one who delivered the fatal blow.

However, we have Evidence 11, which is "Elise's Autopsy Report". This evidence could potentially show that the fatal blow was not actually delivered by Mystic Maya, or that the circumstances of the fatal blow were different from what Iris described.

But what if Mystic Maya actually did deliver the fatal blow? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Mystic Maya did not deliver the fatal blow, it's unlikely that Iris would have said that she did.

We have Testimony 4, which says that Mystic Elise managed to fling the knife away.

However, we have Evidence 19, which is "Dagger". This evidence could potentially show that the dagger was not actually flung away, but was instead found at the scene, which would contradict Iris's testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Iris's testimony? We have Evidence 11, which is "Elise's Autopsy Report". This evidence implies that the fatal blow was not actually delivered by Mystic Maya, which would contradict Iris's testimony.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Iris (Testimony 6) that says the snow had already stopped by the time the murder took place. This implies that there was no snowfall during the murder.

However, we have Evidence 7, which is "Weather Data". This evidence could potentially show that there was actually snowfall during the murder, which would contradict Iris's testimony.

But what if there was actually no snowfall during the murder? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if there was snowfall during the murder, it's unlikely that Iris would have said that the snow had already stopped.

We have Testimony 3, which says that Iris dragged the body behind her all the way across Dusky Bridge.

However, we have Evidence 21, which is "Dusky Bridge Photo". This evidence could potentially show that there are no tracks or signs of the body being dragged across the bridge, which would contradict Iris's testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Iris's testimony? We have Evidence 7, which is "Weather Data". This evidence implies that there was actually snowfall during the murder, which would contradict Iris's testimony.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 6}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Maya (Testimony 4) that says she could see a man behind her attacker by the light of the stone lantern. This implies that there was a second person present at the scene.

However, we have Evidence 20, which is "Stone Lantern". This evidence could potentially show that the stone lantern was not actually lit, or that it was not in a position to illuminate the area, which would contradict Maya's testimony.

But what if the stone lantern was actually lit? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the stone lantern was not actually lit, it's unlikely that Maya would have said that she could see a man behind her attacker by its light.

We have Testimony 5, which says that something warm splashed over Maya.

However, we have Evidence 11, which is "Elise's Autopsy Report". This evidence could potentially show that the warm liquid was not actually blood, or that it was not splashed over Maya in the way she described.

So, what evidence contradicts Maya's testimony? We have Evidence 20, which is "Stone Lantern". This evidence implies that the stone lantern was not actually lit, which would contradict Maya's testimony.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 4}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Maya (Testimony 4) that says the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up. This implies that the killer took the time to clean up the snow around the stone lantern.

However, we have Evidence 21, which is "Dusky Bridge Photo". This evidence could potentially show that the snow around the stone lantern was not actually cleaned up, or that there are still tracks or signs of the killer's presence, which would contradict Maya's testimony.

But what if the snow around the stone lantern was actually cleaned up? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the snow around the stone lantern was not actually cleaned up, it's unlikely that Maya would have said that it was.

We have Testimony 3, which says that the body was gone.

However, we have Evidence 13, which is "Crime Photo". This evidence could potentially show that the body was actually still present at the scene, or that it was not removed in the way Maya described.

So, what evidence contradicts Maya's testimony? We have Evidence 21, which is "Dusky Bridge Photo". This evidence implies that the snow around the stone lantern was not actually cleaned up, which would contradict Maya's testimony.

{"evidence": 21, "testimony": 4}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Maya (Testimony 3) that says Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time the next day after the bridge was fixed. This implies that Mr. Godot was not present at the Inner Temple before the bridge was fixed.

However, we have Evidence 2, which is "Oh! Cult! New Year's Issue". This evidence could potentially show that Mr. Godot was actually present at the Inner Temple before the bridge was fixed, or that he had some connection to the Inner Temple before that time.

But what if Mr. Godot actually did arrive at the Inner Temple for the first time after the bridge was fixed? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Mr. Godot was actually present at the Inner Temple before the bridge was fixed, it's unlikely that Maya would have said that he arrived for the first time after the bridge was fixed.

We have Testimony 4, which says that Mr. Godot found Pearly first and cheered her up.

However, we have Evidence 3, which is "Hazakura Temple Map". This evidence could potentially show that Pearly was actually in a different location, or that Mr. Godot did not find her in the way Maya described.

So, what evidence contradicts Maya's testimony? We have Evidence 2, which is "Oh! Cult! New Year's Issue". This evidence implies that Mr. Godot was actually present at the Inner Temple before the bridge was fixed, which would contradict Maya's testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Atmey (Testimony 5) that says he held the urn in his hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th. This implies that Atmey did not have access to the urn before that time.

However, we have Evidence 21, which is "Urn Box". This evidence could potentially show that the urn was actually stored in a box that Atmey had access to before the crime.

But what if the urn box was actually sealed and Atmey did not have access to the urn before the crime? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Atmey did have access to the urn before the crime, it's unlikely that he would have said that he held it in his hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th.

We have Testimony 1, which says that the urn was placed in a box and sent to the warehouse.

However, we have Evidence 12, which is "CEO Office Key Card". This evidence could potentially show that Atmey had a key card that allowed him to access the warehouse and the urn before the crime.

So, what evidence contradicts Atmey's testimony? We have Evidence 12, which is "CEO Office Key Card". This evidence implies that Atmey had access to the urn before the crime, which would contradict his testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Atmey (Testimony 2) that says Kane Bullard wrote the blackmail letter and sent it to Ron DeLite. This implies that Kane Bullard was the one who sent the blackmail letter.

However, we have Evidence 10, which is "Blackmail Letter". This evidence could potentially show that the blackmail letter was actually sent by someone else, not Kane Bullard.

But what if the blackmail letter was actually sent by Kane Bullard? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the blackmail letter was not sent by Kane Bullard, it's unlikely that Atmey would have said that he did.

We have Testimony 3, which says that Kane Bullard harbored a grudge against Ron DeLite for his betrayal.

However, we have Evidence 18, which is "Kane's List". This evidence could potentially show that Kane Bullard's list does not mention Ron DeLite, which would contradict Atmey's testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Atmey's testimony? We have Evidence 18, which is "Kane's List". This evidence implies that Kane Bullard's list does not mention Ron DeLite, which would contradict Atmey's testimony.

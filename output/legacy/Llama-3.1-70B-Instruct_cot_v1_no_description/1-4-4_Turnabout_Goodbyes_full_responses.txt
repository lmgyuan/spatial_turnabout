To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Butz (Testimony 4) that says he didn't notice the boat when he looked out over the lake after hearing the gunshot. This implies that Butz did not see the boat.

However, we have Evidence 16, which is "Second Lake Photo". This evidence could potentially show that Butz's boat was visible in the photo taken by Lotta.

But what if the photo does not show Butz's boat clearly? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Butz's boat was visible in the photo, it's unlikely that he would not have noticed it when he looked out over the lake.

So, what evidence contradicts Butz's testimony? We have Evidence 16, which is "Second Lake Photo". This evidence implies that Butz's boat was visible in the photo, which would contradict his testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Butz (Testimony 3) that says he's sure he heard the gunshot. This implies that Butz is certain about hearing the gunshot.

However, we have Evidence 5, which is "Gourdy Article". This evidence could potentially show that the radio show was not loud enough for Butz to hear the gunshot clearly.

But what if the article does not mention the volume of the radio show? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the article mentions that the radio show was not loud enough for Butz to hear the gunshot clearly, it's unlikely that he would be certain about hearing the gunshot.

We have Evidence 5, which is "Gourdy Article". This evidence implies that the radio show was not loud enough for Butz to hear the gunshot clearly, which would contradict his testimony.

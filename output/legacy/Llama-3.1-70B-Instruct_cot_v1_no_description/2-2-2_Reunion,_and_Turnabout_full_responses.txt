To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Gumshoe (Testimony 2) that says the defendant's costume is covered in blood. This implies that the blood on the costume is evidence of the defendant's guilt.

However, we have Evidence 11, which is "Maya's Costume". This evidence could potentially show that the blood on the costume is not necessarily evidence of the defendant's guilt.

But what if the blood on the costume is actually from the victim, and not from the defendant's actions? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the blood on the costume is actually from the victim, it's unlikely that the defendant would be guilty of attacking and killing the victim without a fight.

We have Testimony 3, which says that the defendant attacked and killed a person who was not fighting back. This implies that the defendant is guilty of the crime.

However, we have Evidence 10, which is "Knife". This evidence could potentially show that the victim was actually armed with a knife, and was therefore fighting back.

So, what evidence contradicts Gumshoe's testimony? We have Evidence 10, which is "Knife". This evidence implies that the victim was actually armed with a knife, which would contradict Gumshoe's testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Gumshoe (Testimony 2) that says the victim took out his gun while fighting with the defendant. This implies that the victim was armed with a gun.

However, we have Evidence 10, which is "Knife". This evidence could potentially show that the victim was actually armed with a knife, not a gun.

But what if the victim had both a knife and a gun? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the victim was only armed with a knife, it's unlikely that he would have taken out a gun during the fight.

We have Testimony 3, which says that the victim took a shot with the gun, but missed. This implies that the victim did have a gun and did take a shot.

However, if the victim was only armed with a knife, it's unlikely that he would have taken a shot with a gun.

So, what evidence contradicts Gumshoe's testimony? We have Evidence 10, which is "Knife". This evidence implies that the victim was actually armed with a knife, not a gun, which would contradict Gumshoe's testimony.

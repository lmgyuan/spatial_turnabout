To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Gumshoe (Testimony 5) that says there was nothing else missing from the crime scene. This implies that the crime scene was not disturbed or tampered with.

However, we have Evidence 11, which is "Trés Bien Floor Plans". This evidence could potentially show that the crime scene was actually disturbed or tampered with.

But what if the crime scene was not disturbed or tampered with? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the crime scene was actually disturbed or tampered with, it's unlikely that Gumshoe would have said that there was nothing else missing.

We have Testimony 3, which says that the investigation went smoothly.

However, we have Evidence 10, which is "Glen's Autopsy Report". This evidence could potentially show that the investigation was not as smooth as Gumshoe claimed.

So, what evidence contradicts Gumshoe's testimony? We have Evidence 10, which is "Glen's Autopsy Report". This evidence implies that the investigation was not as smooth as Gumshoe claimed, which would contradict his testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Kudo (Testimony 2) that says the serving girl put some white powder in the javaccino. This implies that the serving girl intentionally poisoned the victim.

However, we have Evidence 15, which is "Apron". This evidence could potentially show that the serving girl's apron did not have any loose straps, which would contradict Kudo's testimony.

But what if the serving girl's apron did have loose straps? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the serving girl did not intentionally poison the victim, it's unlikely that Kudo would have said that she did.

We have Testimony 5, which says that the serving girl's apron straps were loose.

However, we have Evidence 15, which is "Apron". This evidence could potentially show that the serving girl's apron straps were not loose, which would contradict Kudo's testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Kudo's testimony? We have Evidence 15, which is "Apron". This evidence implies that the serving girl's apron straps were not loose, which would contradict Kudo's testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Kudo (Testimony 2) that says the young man was listening to the wireless. This implies that the young man was listening to the radio.

However, we have Evidence 3, which is "Sports Paper". This evidence could potentially show that the young man was actually reading a sports paper, not listening to the radio.

But what if the young man was actually listening to the radio? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the young man was reading a sports paper, it's unlikely that Kudo would have said that he was listening to the radio.

We have Testimony 1, which says that the young man had a newspaper in his right hand.

However, we have Evidence 3, which is "Sports Paper". This evidence could potentially show that the newspaper was actually a sports paper, which would support Kudo's testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Kudo's testimony? We have Evidence 23, which is "MC Bomber". This evidence implies that the young man was actually listening to music, not the radio, which would contradict Kudo's testimony.

{"evidence": 23, "testimony": 2}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Kudo (Testimony 2) that says the young boy upset the vase and knocked it right over. This implies that the vase was actually knocked over.

However, we have Evidence 11, which is "Trés Bien Floor Plans". This evidence could potentially show that the vase was not actually knocked over, but was instead intact.

But what if the vase was actually knocked over? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the vase was not actually knocked over, it's unlikely that Kudo would have said that it was.

We have Testimony 3, which says that the vase broke and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked.

However, we have Evidence 15, which is "Apron". This evidence could potentially show that the apron was not actually soaked, which would contradict Kudo's testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Kudo's testimony? We have Evidence 15, which is "Apron". This evidence implies that the apron was not actually soaked, which would contradict Kudo's testimony.

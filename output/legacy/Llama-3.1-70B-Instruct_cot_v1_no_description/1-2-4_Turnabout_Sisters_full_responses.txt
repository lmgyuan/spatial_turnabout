To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Redd White (Testimony 8) that says the victim ran to the left, and the defendant gave chase. 

However, we have another testimony from April May (Testimony 1) that says the victim dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.

This implies that the victim ran in two different directions, which is a contradiction. However, we need to find an evidence that contradicts one of these testimonies.

We have Evidence 8, which is "Floor Plans". This evidence could potentially show the layout of the area where the crime occurred, including the direction the victim ran.

However, we don't have any direct information about the Floor Plans, but we can infer that if the Floor Plans show the victim running to the right, it would contradict Redd White's testimony.

But we also have another testimony from April May that says the victim ran to the right. So, we need to find another evidence that contradicts Redd White's testimony.

We have Evidence 9, which is "May Testimony". This evidence could potentially show April May's testimony, which says the victim ran to the right.

So, what evidence contradicts Redd White's testimony? We have Evidence 9, which is "May Testimony". This evidence implies that the victim ran to the right, not to the left.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 8}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Redd White (Testimony 3) that says the victim ran to the right with the last of her strength. This implies that the victim was already injured when she ran to the right.

However, we have Evidence 2, which is "Glass Shards". This evidence could potentially show that the victim was injured by the glass shards, but if the victim was already injured when she ran to the right, it's unlikely that she was injured by the glass shards while running to the right.

But what if the victim was injured by the glass shards before she ran to the right? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the victim was injured by the glass shards while running to the right, it would contradict Redd White's testimony that the victim was already injured when she ran to the right.

So, what evidence contradicts Redd White's testimony? We have Evidence 2, which is "Glass Shards". This evidence implies that the victim could have been injured by the glass shards while running to the right, which would contradict Redd White's testimony.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Redd White (Testimony 3) that says the killer attacked Miss Mia, but she dodged. This implies that the killer did not hit Miss Mia with the first attack.

However, we have Evidence 2, which is "Glass Shards". This evidence could potentially show that Miss Mia was injured by the glass shards, but if she dodged the first attack, it's unlikely that she was injured by the glass shards from the first attack.

But what if the glass shards were from the light stand that fell (as mentioned in Testimony 1)? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the glass shards were used as a weapon to attack Miss Mia, it would contradict Redd White's testimony that she dodged the first attack.

So, what evidence contradicts Redd White's testimony? We have Evidence 2, which is "Glass Shards". This evidence implies that the glass shards could have been used as a weapon to attack Miss Mia, which would contradict Redd White's testimony.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Redd White (Testimony 3) that says he saw a glass light stand. This implies that the glass light stand was intact when he saw it.

However, we have Evidence 2, which is "Glass Shards". This evidence implies that the glass light stand was broken, resulting in glass shards.

If the glass light stand was intact when Redd White saw it, it's unlikely that there would be glass shards. So, the evidence and testimony seem to contradict each other.

So, what evidence contradicts Redd White's testimony? We have Evidence 2, which is "Glass Shards". This evidence implies that the glass light stand was broken, which would contradict Redd White's testimony.

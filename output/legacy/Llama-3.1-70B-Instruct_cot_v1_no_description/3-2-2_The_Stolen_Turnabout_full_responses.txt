To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Gumshoe (Testimony 3) that says Mask☆DeMasque's pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces. This implies that Mask☆DeMasque only steals valuable art.

However, we have Evidence 4, which is "Sacred Urn". This evidence could potentially show that Mask☆DeMasque stole an urn, which may not be considered a precious art piece.

But what if the urn is actually a valuable art piece? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the urn is not a valuable art piece, it's unlikely that Gumshoe would have said that Mask☆DeMasque only steals precious art.

We have Testimony 4, which says that Gumshoe is sure it was Mask☆DeMasque because it fits his M.O.

However, we have Evidence 4, which is "Sacred Urn". This evidence could potentially show that Mask☆DeMasque's M.O. is not limited to stealing precious art pieces.

So, what evidence contradicts Gumshoe's testimony? We have Evidence 4, which is "Sacred Urn". This evidence implies that Mask☆DeMasque's M.O. is not limited to stealing precious art pieces, which would contradict Gumshoe's testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Atmey (Testimony 4) that says he used an emergency phone to notify the police thirty minutes after he was attacked. This implies that Atmey waited for thirty minutes before reporting the incident.

However, we have Evidence 17, which is "CEO Office Buzzer". This evidence could potentially show that Atmey actually used the buzzer to call for help immediately after the attack, which would contradict his testimony.

But what if Atmey did wait for thirty minutes before reporting the incident? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Atmey did use the buzzer to call for help immediately after the attack, it's unlikely that he would have said that he waited for thirty minutes before reporting the incident.

We have Testimony 3, which says that Atmey was knocked unconscious and didn't wake up until later.

However, we have Evidence 19, which is "Buzzer Record". This evidence could potentially show that the buzzer was actually used at the time of the attack, which would contradict Atmey's testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Atmey's testimony? We have Evidence 19, which is "Buzzer Record". This evidence implies that Atmey actually used the buzzer to call for help immediately after the attack, which would contradict his testimony.

{"evidence": 19, "testimony": 4}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Atmey (Testimony 2) that says the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and rendered him senseless. This implies that the thief used a weapon to attack Atmey.

However, we have Evidence 6, which is "Shichishito". This evidence could potentially show that the Shichishito is a valuable sword, but it does not necessarily imply that it was used as a weapon in the attack.

But what if the Shichishito was actually used as a weapon in the attack? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the thief did not use a weapon, it's unlikely that Atmey would have said that he was rendered senseless by a blow from a weapon.

We have Testimony 3, which says that a true gentleman fights only with his own fists.

However, we have Testimony 5, which says that the thief's blow landed upon Atmey's third eye.

So, what evidence contradicts Atmey's testimony? We have Evidence 6, which is "Shichishito". This evidence implies that the Shichishito is a valuable sword, and it may have been used as a weapon in the attack, but Atmey's testimony does not mention the sword.

However, we have another evidence that directly contradicts Atmey's testimony. We have Evidence 22, which is "Paint Marks". This evidence could potentially show that the attack was not just a simple blow, but was actually a more complex and deliberate act.

So, what evidence contradicts Atmey's testimony? We have Evidence 22, which is "Paint Marks". This evidence implies that the attack was not just a simple blow, which would contradict Atmey's testimony.

{"evidence": 22, "testimony": 4}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Ron (Testimony 4) that says the photo shows him as Mask☆DeMasque. This implies that the photo is evidence of Ron's involvement in the crime.

However, we have Evidence 9, which is "Security Camera Photo". This evidence could potentially show that the photo does not actually show Ron as Mask☆DeMasque.

But what if the photo does show Ron as Mask☆DeMasque? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the photo does not show Ron as Mask☆DeMasque, it's unlikely that Ron would have said that it does.

We have Testimony 5, which says that Ron's broach got torn off on the door handle.

However, we have Evidence 14, which is "DeMasque's Broach". This evidence could potentially show that the broach was not torn off on the door handle, but was actually found in a different location.

So, what evidence contradicts Ron's testimony? We have Evidence 14, which is "DeMasque's Broach". This evidence implies that the broach was not torn off on the door handle, which would contradict Ron's testimony.

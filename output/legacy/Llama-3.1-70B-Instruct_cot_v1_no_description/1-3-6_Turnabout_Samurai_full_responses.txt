To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Vasquez (Testimony 3) that says she was fatigued, so she had Sal take her. This implies that Vasquez was not driving herself.

However, we have Evidence 18, which is "Van". This evidence could potentially show that Vasquez was driving the van.

So, what evidence contradicts Vasquez's testimony? We have Evidence 18, which is "Van". This evidence implies that Vasquez was driving the van, which would contradict her testimony.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 3}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Vasquez (Testimony 7) that says she knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so she left them behind. This implies that Vasquez was aware of Hammer's injury before he was killed.

However, we have Evidence 3, which is "Jack's Autopsy Report". This evidence could potentially show that Hammer's injury was not just any injury, but a fatal one.

But what if Vasquez was not aware of the severity of Hammer's injury? In that case, her testimony would be correct.

However, we can infer that if Vasquez was aware of Hammer's injury, and she left the action scenes behind, it's unlikely that she would have left the script and direction notes behind as well.

We have Testimony 5, which says that Vasquez went back to the trailer to get her script and direction notes. This implies that Vasquez did go back to the trailer, and she did get her script and direction notes.

However, we have Evidence 10, which is "Script". This evidence could potentially show that Vasquez did not get her script, or that she did not go back to the trailer to get it.

So, what evidence contradicts Vasquez's testimony? We have Evidence 10, which is "Script". This evidence implies that Vasquez did not get her script, or that she did not go back to the trailer to get it, which would contradict her testimony.

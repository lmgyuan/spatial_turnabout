Now, checking the evidence, Evidence 6 is Iris's Hood, which states that the hood was received before the lights out bell the night of the crime. The lights out bell was at 10 PM according to Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12). If Iris was wearing her hood at dinner and then went to the Inner Temple, she should have had the hood on. However, Bikini's Testimony 3 mentions Iris was dressed exactly as at dinner, implying she was wearing the hood. But Evidence 6 says the hood was received before the lights out bell, which was at 10 PM. If Iris was at the Inner Temple after 10 PM (since the crime happened between 10-11 PM), then she shouldn't have the hood anymore because she would have given it away before 10 PM. Therefore, Bikini's statement that Iris was dressed the same as at dinner (including the hood) contradicts the evidence that the hood was already handed over before 10 PM.\n\n{\"evidence\": 6, \"testimony\": 3}",

You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to look through the testimonies and cross-reference them with the evidences provided.\n\nStarting with the testimonies from Larry Butz (Testimonies 0 to 6). Let's go through each one.\n\nTestimony 0: Larry says he went to the shack around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. If he went at 9, why does he say it's 10:30? Maybe a time discrepancy here. But I need to check the evidence related to time.\n\nLooking at Evidence 7, the Weather Data. It mentions that on the night of the crime, snow was from 7 PM to about 10:50 PM, and lightning from 10 PM to around 11 PM. Specifically, lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. Also, there was a fire that started and went out around 30 minutes. So the timeline here is important.\n\nTestimony 3: Larry says there was still some thunder, but he went to check out the bridge. Testimony 5 says he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. Testimony 2 mentions he saw Dusky Bridge on fire after a white flash (which could be the lightning strike at 10:45).\n\nIf the lightning struck at 10:45, causing the fire, and the fire lasted 30 minutes, then the fire would have started at 10:45 and ended around 11:15. But Larry claims he saw the bridge on fire after the flash (the lightning strike), then went to check and met Nick. However, according to Testimony 0, he went to the shack at 9 PM, which he says would have been 10:30 PM. Wait, that seems like a time inconsistency. Maybe he's mixing up times. If he went to the shack at 9 PM, how did he end up at the bridge around 10:45? There's a time gap here. Alternatively, perhaps his timeline doesn't add up with the weather data.\n\nWait, Testimony 0 says he went to the shack at around 9, which he later states would have been about 10:30 PM. That seems contradictory. So maybe the actual time he went was 9 PM, but he's claiming it was 10:30? Or perhaps there's confusion in his testimony about the time. Let's check the weather data again. The snow stopped around 10:50, and the lightning was until 11 PM. The fire started when the lightning struck at 10:45. So if Larry saw the bridge on fire at 10:45, he must have been there then. But his testimony about the timing might conflict with the weather data. For example, if he claims he went to the shack at 9 PM, but the snow was until 10:50 PM, then if he went at 9 PM, the snow was still ongoing. But maybe that's not a direct contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3: Larry says there was still some thunder when he went to check the bridge. Thunder would correspond to the lightning strikes. The lightning was until 11 PM. If the fire started at 10:45, and Larry went to check it out right after, which would be around 10:45, then the thunder would still be happening. That seems consistent. Wait, but the problem is with Testimony 5: he says he arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later. But if Nick (Phoenix Wright) fell from the bridge and was hospitalized, then maybe the timing here is conflicting. But the evidence says Phoenix fell from the bridge, but according to Testimony 5, Larry and Nick were at the bridge together. Wait, but Phoenix is hospitalized because he fell from the bridge. So perhaps the contradiction is that Larry claims he met Nick at the bridge after the fire started, but Phoenix was supposed to have fallen and been hospitalized. So maybe the meeting couldn't have happened. However, the user's provided info says Phoenix is hospitalized after falling from the bridge, so if Larry met Nick there, that would be impossible. But looking at the evidence, Phoenix's fall is part of the case. Wait, in the characters, Phoenix is hospitalized because he fell from Dusky Bridge. So if Larry says he met Nick at the bridge after the fire (which started at 10:45 PM), then that's impossible because Nick would have already fallen. Unless the fall happened after that. Wait, the timeline might need to be pieced together. Let's think.\n\nIf the fire started at 10:45 PM due to lightning. The bridge was on fire. Larry went to check it, met Nick there. Then Nick fell. But according to the evidence, Phoenix is hospitalized because he fell from the bridge. So the fall would have happened during or after the fire. So maybe Larry's testimony about meeting Nick at the bridge is possible. Hmm. Maybe not a contradiction here.\n\nWait, looking at Testimony 5: Larry says he arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later. But according to the Weather Data, the lightning struck the bridge at 10:45. So the fire started then. If Larry arrived at the bridge and then Nick came, that would be around 10:45. But according to the autopsy report (Evidence 11), the victim died between 10-11 PM. Also, the victim's body fell 10 feet after death. So the murder happened in that time frame. But how does this tie into the contradiction?\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Testimony 6: Larry says he thought he'd never get another chance to see something so big burning. That's just a comment, not necessarily conflicting.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 2 says Larry looked out the window and saw the bridge on fire. According to the Weather Data, the lightning struck the bridge at 10:45. The fire started then and lasted 30 minutes. So the bridge was on fire from 10:45 to around 11:15. But Larry claims he saw it on fire when he looked out the window after the flash (Testimony 1 and 2). That aligns with the lightning strike. But maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nWait, Testimony 4: Larry says he ran into Nick. Testimony 5: He arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later. But Phoenix's badge is in the evidence (Evidence 0) when playing as Edgeworth, which might indicate that Phoenix is not present. But if Phoenix is hospitalized, how could he be at the bridge? That's a contradiction. So if Larry testifies that he met Nick at the bridge after the fire started (around 10:45), but Phoenix was already hospitalized from falling off the bridge, then that's impossible. Therefore, Testimony 5 (where Larry says Nick arrived at the bridge) contradicts the fact that Phoenix was hospitalized from falling off the bridge. But when did Phoenix fall? The evidence says he fell from Dusky Bridge and is hospitalized. If the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45, causing the fire, and Phoenix fell then, he couldn't have been there to meet Larry after the fire started. Therefore, Testimony 5's claim that Nick arrived at the bridge after Larry did contradicts Phoenix's hospitalization. \n\nSo the contradiction here would be between Testimony 5 (Larry meeting Nick at the bridge after the fire started) and the fact that Phoenix was hospitalized from falling off the bridge. But looking at the evidences, the only evidence directly related to Phoenix is Evidence 8 (Phoenix's status). However, the user provided evidences, Evidence 0 mentions Phoenix giving the badge to Edgeworth. The character list says Phoenix is hospitalized. So, the contradiction would be between Larry's Testimony 5 and Phoenix's status (hospitalized), but how is this captured in the evidence?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the Weather Data (Evidence 7), which states that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM, and the fire lasted around 30 minutes. The tracks photo (Evidence 14) shows tracks leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. But Larry's Testimony 5 says he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. However, if the bridge was on fire after the lightning strike, and Phoenix fell from it, perhaps the tracks photo only shows one set of tracks, implying only one person went to the bridge. But Larry claims both he and Nick were there. Therefore, if the tracks only show one set, that contradicts Larry's testimony of two people being there. But Evidence 14's Tracks Photo caption says \"One track is shown leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge.\" So if there's only one track, but Larry and Nick both went there, there should be two tracks. Therefore, Testimony 5 (which implies both Larry and Nick were at the bridge) contradicts the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) showing only one track. Thus, the pair would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 5. But wait, Evidence 14 is a photo taken that night showing one track leading to the bridge. If both Larry and Nick went there, there should be two sets of tracks. But the photo shows only one. Hence, contradiction. So Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo) contradicts Testimony 5 where Larry says he arrived at the bridge and then Nick came, implying two people went there, but the tracks only show one. So this is a solid contradiction.\n\n{\"evidence\": 14, \"testimony\": 5}",

The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair. Let me start by going through the testimonies and checking each against the evidence.\n\nFirst, looking at the testimonies. Testimony 2 by Butz says he saw Iris flying with her white hood fluttering. The relevant evidence here might be Iris's Hood (Evidence 6), which states that Iris was supposed to be wearing her hood at all times for protection. But wait, if she was wearing the hood, how could Butz see her face? Or maybe another angle. Wait, no, the hood itself is white. The testimony mentions her white hood, so that might not be a contradiction. Hmm.\n\nTestimony 1 and 2: Butz claims he was sketching in front of the bridge and saw Iris flying. Let's check the evidence related to the bridge. The Dusky Bridge Photo (Evidence 21) might show something, but the description says it's taken the morning after. The Weather Data (Evidence 7) mentions that lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM. Also, the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows one track leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. Wait, if Butz was in front of the bridge sketching, maybe the tracks would show his presence? But the tracks photo shows only one track. However, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was found near the bridge, which is part of the victim's staff (Evidence 9). The staff had a hidden sword and the sphere came from it. The murder weapon was the staff's sword, not the Shichishito (Evidence 10). \n\nLooking at Testimony 3: Butz says he transferred the shock onto the page, referring to his sketch. The Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15) is a horrible sketch of what he saw. If the sketch shows something that contradicts the evidence... For example, maybe the time or elements in the sketch don't match the weather. The Weather Data (Evidence 7) says there was snow until about 10:50 PM and lightning until 11 PM. If Butz was sketching outside during that time, the weather conditions might have affected visibility. But how does that contradict?\n\nWait, Testimony 0 and 1: Butz says he was sketching in front of the bridge. The Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows only one track leading to the bridge. If Butz was there, his tracks would be part of that. But if there's only one track, maybe it's from someone else, like the victim or the killer. If Butz was there, his tracks should be there, but the photo shows one track. Hmm, but if the photo was taken that night, maybe after the snow stopped? The snow stopped around 10:50 PM. If Butz was sketching during the snow, his tracks might have been covered. Wait, the snow was from 7 PM to 10:50 PM. If Butz was there during that time, the tracks could be covered. Then the tracks in the photo would be after the snow stopped. So the tracks would be from someone who walked after 10:50 PM. But the murder happened between 10-11 PM. So maybe the tracks are from the killer. If Butz was there sketching during the snow, his tracks would have been covered by the snow, so the tracks in the photo would be from later. But how does that contradict his testimony? Maybe Butz claims to have been there during the snow, but the tracks in the photo are from after the snow, implying someone else went there later. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 2 says Butz saw Iris flying with her white hood. But according to Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12), she was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. So if Iris was in her room, how could Butz see her flying? That's a contradiction. But Iris's Hood (Evidence 6) was given to the player before the lights out bell, which was at 10 PM. So Iris should have been in her room after 10 PM. If Butz saw her outside after 10 PM, that contradicts her testimony. But Testimony 2 is part of Butz's account. So the contradiction would be between Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) and Butz's Testimony 2. However, the user is asking for a testimony and evidence contradiction, not testimony vs testimony. Wait, the problem states \"evidences and testimonies\" so maybe a testimony contradicts an evidence.\n\nWait, the user said \"Which evidence and testimony contradict each other?\" So the pair is one evidence and one testimony. So let's check each testimony against the evidence list.\n\nLooking at Testimony 4 by Butz: \"...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up.\" The flames here might refer to the fire mentioned in the Weather Data (Evidence 7), which states that around 30 minutes passed between the fire starting and going out. The fire was due to the lightning strike at 10:45 PM. The fire would have gone out around 11:15 PM (30 minutes later). But Butz's Testimony 4 mentions the flames going out and then someone coming. However, the fire duration is part of the Weather Data. If Butz's testimony about the timing contradicts the fire duration, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 2 where Butz says he saw Iris flying. But Iris's Hood (Evidence 6) says that Iris was supposed to be wearing the hood, which protects from evil spirits, and that she received it before the lights out bell (10 PM). Iris's own testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room from 10 PM. So if Butz saw her outside after 10 PM, that contradicts her alibi. But the user is looking for a contradiction between a testimony (from Butz) and an evidence. The evidence here would be Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) but that's another testimony. Wait, Evidence 12 is Iris's Testimony. So if the question allows a testimony (from Butz) to contradict an evidence (Iris's Testimony), but the user's instruction says \"evidences and testimonies\" so the answer should pair an evidence (from the evidence list) with a testimony (from the testimonies list). \n\nWait, the evidences are numbered 0-21, and testimonies 0-4. So the answer must be one of the evidence numbers (0-21) and one of the testimony numbers (0-4). \n\nSo looking for a testimony (from Butz) that contradicts an evidence (from the list). Let's check Testimony 2 again: Butz saw Iris flying with the white hood. The relevant evidence would be Iris's Hood (Evidence 6), which says she was wearing it. That doesn't contradict. But if Iris was supposed to be in her room (Evidence 12), then Butz's Testimony 2 contradicts Evidence 12. But Evidence 12 is Iris's own testimony. So if the user considers that, but the problem states \"evidences and testimonies\" as separate lists. So perhaps the answer is Testimony 2 (Butz's claim) vs Evidence 12 (Iris's alibi). But in the given data, Evidence 12 is \"Iris's Testimony: Rang lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room until the murder was discovered.\" So that's an evidence. So if Butz's Testimony 2 (he saw Iris flying) contradicts Evidence 12 (Iris was in her room), then that's a valid pair. However, the problem says \"evidence and testimony\" which would be Evidence 12 and Testimony 2. But let me check the testimony list. The testimonies are all from Butz except maybe others? Wait, no. The Testimony entries are all from Butz here. Wait, looking at the Testimonies provided:\n\nTestimonies 0-4 are all from Butz. So perhaps the contradiction is between Butz's testimony and another evidence. For example, Testimony 2 says he saw Iris flying with her hood. But according to the Weather Data (Evidence 7), there was snow until 10:50 PM and lightning. If Butz was outside sketching during that time, maybe visibility was poor. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15) is a horrible sketch of what he saw. If the sketch shows something that contradicts another evidence. For example, if the sketch shows the bridge intact, but the Dusky Bridge Photo (Evidence 21) shows it damaged. But the photo is from the morning after. The bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM, so maybe the sketch shows the bridge before the lightning strike. But the timing would matter. If Butz was sketching before 10:45, then the bridge would be intact. But the murder happened around 10-11 PM. The victim's body fell 10 ft after death (Evidence 11). \n\nAnother angle: The Victim's Staff (Evidence 9) has a hidden sword, which was the actual murder weapon. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) was the apparent weapon with the suspect's fingerprints but is not the real one. Butz's testimony doesn't directly relate to that. \n\nWait, Testimony 4: Butz says the flames went out and then \"he came running up.\" The flames (from the lightning strike) went out around 11:15 PM (30 minutes after 10:45). If \"he\" refers to someone (maybe Phoenix), but Phoenix fell from the bridge and is hospitalized. So maybe that's a discrepancy, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 1: Butz claims to be sketching in front of the bridge. The Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows only one track leading to the bridge. If Butz was there, there should be tracks, but the photo shows only one. However, if the tracks were made after the snow stopped (snow stopped at 10:50), and Butz was sketching during the snow, his tracks would have been covered. So the tracks in the photo are from someone else, but that doesn't necessarily contradict Butz's testimony. \n\nWait, Evidence 14's caption: \"One track is shown leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge.\" If Butz was sketching in front of the bridge, he would have left tracks. If the snow stopped at 10:50, and the tracks were made after, then Butz's tracks (if he was there before 10:50) would be covered. But if he was there during the snow, his tracks would be covered. So the tracks in the photo are from someone after the snow stopped, like the killer. So Butz's testimony about being there might not contradict the tracks photo. Hmm.\n\nLooking at Testimony 3: Butz says he transferred the shock onto the page (the sketch). If Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15) is supposed to show something that's impossible given other evidence. For example, if the sketch shows the victim with the staff's crystal sphere, but the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was found near the bridge. The staff (Evidence 9) had no sphere. So if the sketch shows the staff with the sphere, that contradicts Evidence 9. But the sketch is described as \"horrible,\" so maybe it's inaccurate. But the problem states which evidence and testimony contradict. If the testimony says he drew what he saw, but the actual evidence shows the sphere was elsewhere, then Testimony 3 (transferring shock to the page) and Crystal Sphere (16) could be a contradiction. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the Victim's Staff (9) had no sphere, but the Crystal Sphere (16) was found near the bridge. If Butz's sketch shows the staff with the sphere, then the sketch contradicts Evidence 9. But the sketch's description doesn't mention that. The sketch's content isn't detailed beyond being \"horrible.\" So maybe not.\n\nWait, Testimony 2: Butz saw Iris flying. But according to the Weather Data (7), there was lightning until 11 PM. If Iris was outside flying, she'd be in a lightning storm, which is dangerous. But that's not a direct contradiction.\n\nAnother angle: Elise's Autopsy Report (11) says the body fell 10 ft after death. If Butz's sketch shows the body in a different position, but again, the sketch is not detailed.\n\nWait, Testimony 4 says the flames went out and then \"he came running up.\" The flames were from the lightning strike on the bridge (Evidence 7). The fire lasted 30 minutes. So if the fire started at 10:45, it went out around 11:15. Then \"he came running up\" after that. But Phoenix fell from the bridge and was hospitalized (Character 8). So if \"he\" is Phoenix, that's impossible. But maybe \"he\" refers to someone else, like Godot. Not sure. Not directly contradicting evidence.\n\nBack to Testimony 2: Butz claims he saw Iris flying with her hood. Evidence 6 says Iris's Hood was given to the player before the lights out bell (10 PM). So Iris should have been wearing the hood. If she was flying, that's possible. But according to Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony), she was in her room from 10 PM. So Testimony 2 contradicts Evidence 12. But Evidence 12 is an evidence item (Iris's Testimony), so pairing Testimony 2 (Butz) with Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) would be a contradiction. So that would be {\"evidence\": 12, \"testimony\": 2}. But the user specified that the answer must be one pair. However, Evidence 12 is part of the evidences list. Let me check the evidence list again.\n\nLooking at the evidences:\n\nEvidence 12: Iris's Testimony: Rang lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room until the murder was discovered.\n\nSo, if Butz's Testimony 2 (he saw Iris flying) contradicts Evidence 12 (Iris was in her room), then that's a valid contradiction. So the evidence is 12 and testimony is 2. That's possible.\n\nBut I need to confirm if this is the intended answer. Another possible pair: Testimony 4 by Butz says the flames went out, then someone came. The Weather Data (7) says the fire lasted 30 minutes. If the fire started at 10:45, ended at 11:15. Butz's Testimony 4 says after flames went out, \"he came running up.\" If the person came after 11:15, but the murder happened between 10-11 PM (Autopsy Report, Evidence 11). That's a contradiction because the murder's time of death is 10-11 PM, but the fire ended after 11 PM. So if the victim was killed during the fire, but the fire ended after 11 PM, which is outside the time of death window. Wait, the autopsy says time of death 10-11 PM. The fire started at 10:45 and lasted 30 minutes, ending at 11:15. So the murder must have occurred before the fire ended. But the victim's body fell 10 ft after death (from the bridge?). So if the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45, maybe the murder occurred around then. But if Butz saw the flames go out (after 11:15) and then someone came, but the time of death is 10-11 PM, that's a contradiction. So the person coming after 11:15 would be after the time of death. So that would mean the testimony contradicts the time of death. But the time of death is in Evidence 11: Autopsy Report. So Testimony 4 (flames went out, then he came) vs Evidence 11 (time of death 10-11 PM). But the flames went out at 11:15, so the person came after 11 PM, which is outside the time of death. So if the murder happened before 11 PM, but the person came after, that's not a direct contradiction unless the person coming is the killer. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 1: Butz was sketching in front of the bridge. The Tracks Photo (14) shows only one track. If Butz was there, why only one track? Maybe he didn't leave tracks because he was there during the snow. But the Tracks Photo's caption says \"one track is shown leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge.\" If Butz was there, he would have made tracks. However, the snow was falling until 10:50 PM. If Butz was sketching before 10:50, his tracks would have been covered by the snow. Then the single track in the photo is from someone after the snow stopped. So that's possible, and no contradiction. \n\nBack to the earlier point: Testimony 2 (Butz saw Iris flying) vs Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony). That's a solid contradiction. Since Evidence 12 is part of the evidence list, and Testimony 2 is in the testimonies list, this pair would be the correct answer. So the JSON should be {\"evidence\": 12, \"testimony\": 2}.\n\n{\"evidence\": 12, \"testimony\": 2}",

      "evidence": 12,

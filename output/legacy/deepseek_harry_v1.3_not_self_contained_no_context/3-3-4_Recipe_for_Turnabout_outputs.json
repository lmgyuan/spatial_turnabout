    "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Let's start by going through each testimony and checking against the evidence to find contradictions.\n\nLooking at the testimonies first. The testimonies are from Tigre (Furio Tigre). Let's check each one:\n\nTestimony 0: Tigre says he never met Glen Elg. But Evidence 20 is Glen's Calendar, which has a note on Dec 3rd saying \"Meet with The Tiger\". Since Tigre is known as \"The Tiger\", this suggests they had a meeting scheduled. That contradicts his statement.\n\nTestimony 1: He mentions a guy wanting to borrow cash. Evidence 20 again supports that there was a meeting set, so maybe not a direct contradiction here.\n\nTestimony 2: He says he set up a meeting at his office, Tender Lender. Evidence 20 says Glen had a meeting with The Tiger, so that aligns, no contradiction.\n\nTestimony 3: He claims he waited but Glen didn't show. However, Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) has fingerprints of Furio Tigre. The bottle was found in the kitchen of Tres Bien. If Tigre was never at Tres Bien (as per Testimony 4), how did his fingerprints get there? So Testimony 4 says he never went to Tres Bien, but Evidence 6's fingerprints place him there. That's a contradiction.\n\nWait, Testimony 4 is Tigre saying he's never been to Tres Bien. Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) is found in the kitchen of Tres Bien with his fingerprints. So that directly contradicts his testimony. That's a clear contradiction.\n\nAnother possible contradiction: Testimony 3 says Glen didn't show up to the meeting. But Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) has a doodle by the victim mentioning 'MC Bomber' and '100,000' crossed out. Also, Evidence 23 (MC Bomber) is a virus made by Glen, found at Tender Lender. If Glen didn't go to Tender Lender, how did MC Bomber get there? But maybe Tigre took it after Glen's death. Not sure. The main contradiction is Testimony 4 and Evidence 6.\n\nSo the pair would be Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) and Testimony 4 (Tigre's claim he never went to Tres Bien). Because his fingerprints are on the bottle found there, which he couldn't have touched unless he was present.\n\n{\"evidence\": 6, \"testimony\": 4}",

You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies provided. The characters and evidences are from a Phoenix Wright case, probably \"Recipe for Turnabout\". \n\nFirst, let me look through the testimonies. The testimonies are all from Tigre (Testimony 0 to 7). He claims he loaned Glen Elg $100,000, was about to collect, but Glen won the lottery, so Tigre didn't need to kill him because the business was over once Maggey was framed.\n\nNow, checking the evidences. Evidence 3 is a sports paper with a doodle by the victim. The doodle says 'MC Bomber' pointing to 100,000 crossed out, with 'ahahaha'. Evidence 20 is Glen's calendar note to meet \"The Tiger\" on Dec 3. Evidence 6 is a small bottle (ear medicine) with Furio's fingerprints. Evidence 23 is MC Bomber, a virus worth millions made by Glen. Evidence 20's calendar note shows Glen had a meeting with Tigre that day. \n\nTigre's Testimony 0 says he loaned Elg $100k. But Evidence 3's doodle shows the victim crossed out 100,000 and wrote MC Bomber, which is a virus worth millions. So maybe Glen was planning to pay back with the virus instead of the lottery ticket. But Tigre didn't mention the virus, only the lottery. Also, Testimony 4 says Glen won the lottery, but Evidence 23 shows he had a virus worth millions. So if Glen had the virus, he could have used that to pay Tigre, contradicting Tigre's claim that he only wanted the $100k. \n\nWait, Tigre says in Testimony 7 that he was after the $100k and had no other reason to kill. But Evidence 23 shows that Glen's virus was worth millions. If Tigre knew about MC Bomber, he might have a motive to kill Glen to take the virus. However, the calendar note (Evidence 20) shows they were meeting, so Tigre might have known about the virus. This would contradict Tigre's testimony that he only wanted the $100k. The doodle in Evidence 3 (crossed out 100k and MC Bomber) suggests that the victim was planning to use the virus as payment, which is more than 100k. So Tigre's claim that he only wanted the 100k is contradicted by the existence of the more valuable virus, giving him a bigger motive. \n\nAlternatively, Evidence 6 is the small bottle with Tigre's fingerprints. If Tigre claims he didn't have any other reason to kill, but his fingerprints are on the victim's medicine, that suggests he tampered with it, which would be a reason. But the testimony in question is Testimony 7 where he says he didn't have another motive. So if the evidence shows he did have contact with the victim's medicine (possibly poisoning), that contradicts his testimony. \n\nWait, Evidence 6 is the victim's ear medicine, found in the kitchen with Tigre's fingerprints. The victim died from potassium cyanide in the coffee (Evidence 13). If Tigre handled the ear medicine, maybe he switched it with poison? But the cyanide was in the coffee. Alternatively, the ear medicine might have been a way to frame someone else. But according to the autopsy, death was due to potassium cyanide in the coffee. The ear medicine's fingerprints from Tigre could indicate he was present in the kitchen, which might contradict his alibi or show he had access to the scene. \n\nBut the testimonies in question are Tigre's. Let's check his Testimony 7: \"I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!\" But Evidence 6 shows his fingerprints on the victim's ear medicine bottle. If he had no other reason, why was he handling the victim's medicine? This could suggest he was involved in tampering, giving him another motive (like if he wanted to kill Glen to get the virus, which is worth millions). So the contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 7 (no other motive) and Evidence 23 (MC Bomber worth millions) or Evidence 3 (doodle about MC Bomber replacing 100k). Alternatively, Evidence 20 (meeting with The Tiger) could support that. \n\nWait, Evidence 23 is the MC Bomber virus found at Tender Lender, made by Glen. If Tigre knew about this, he would have a motive to kill Glen to take the virus. But Tigre says he only wanted the 100k, but the virus is worth millions. So if he had access to the virus, that's a bigger motive. However, the testimonies don't mention the virus. But Evidence 3's doodle shows the victim was thinking of the virus (MC Bomber) in relation to 100k. So perhaps Glen was planning to give the virus to Tigre instead of the 100k, but Tigre didn't mention that. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 4 by Tigre: He says Glen won the lottery (half a million). But Evidence 14 is the winning ticket found on Maggey. However, if Tigre knew Glen had the virus worth millions, why would he care about the 500k lottery? That could be a contradiction. Tigre's motive would be stronger with the virus. But I need to find a direct contradiction between a testimony and evidence. \n\nLooking at Testimony 7: Tigre claims he only wanted 100k. But Evidence 20 (Glen's calendar) shows he was meeting Tigre on the day. If Tigre was there to collect 100k, but the victim had a virus worth millions, maybe Tigre's motive was actually to get the virus. Therefore, Testimony 7 (only 100k motive) is contradicted by Evidence 23 (virus worth millions) and Evidence 20 (meeting). \n\nBut how to pair testimony and evidence. The key contradiction would be that Tigre claims he had no other reason, but there's evidence of a larger motive. \n\nAnother angle: Testimony 1 says \"we was due to have a little chat. The kid had hit his payback date\". If Glen was supposed to pay back 100k, but he had the lottery ticket (500k) and the virus (millions), maybe Tigre killed him to take the virus. But Tigre says in Testimony 5 and 6 that thanks to Maggey's actions, his business with Glen was over (because the ticket was found on her, implying Glen couldn't pay). But if Glen had the virus, Tigre would still have a reason to kill him to get it. \n\nAlternatively, the key contradiction is in Testimony 7 where Tigre says he had no other motive, but Evidence 23 shows that he had access to MC Bomber (since it was found at Tender Lender, his company). So if Tigre knew about the virus, he could have a motive to kill Glen to take it. Therefore, Evidence 23 contradicts Testimony 7. \n\nAlternatively, Evidence 3's doodle shows that the victim crossed out 100k and wrote MC Bomber, implying that instead of paying 100k, he would use the virus. So if Tigre was aware of that, his claim of only wanting 100k is contradicted. But Tigre's testimonies don't mention the virus. So the contradiction is between Testimony 0 (loaned 100k) and Evidence 3 (victim's note about MC Bomber), but that's not directly a contradiction. \n\nWait, Testimony 4: Tigre says Glen won the lottery, which is why he didn't need to kill him. But Evidence 23 is the virus worth millions. If Glen had the virus, Tigre could have a bigger motive. So Tigre's Testimony 7 (no other reason) is contradicted by Evidence 23 (presence of the virus which is more valuable). Therefore, the pair is Evidence 23 and Testimony 7. \n\nBut I need to check the exact wording. Testimony 7 says Tigre was after the 100k and had no other reason. Evidence 23 is the virus worth millions, which Tigre's company had. If Tigre had the virus, he might have killed Glen to prevent him from selling it elsewhere, thus making Tigre the owner. That's a motive. So Testimony 7's claim of no other reason is contradicted by Evidence 23. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 6: Small bottle (ear medicine) with Tigre's fingerprints. If Tigre says he had no other reason, but his fingerprints are on the victim's medicine, that suggests he was involved, which contradicts his testimony. Because if he had no reason to interact with the victim's medicine, why are his prints there? So Evidence 6 (fingerprints) contradicts Testimony 7 (no other motive). \n\nYes, that's a direct contradiction. Tigre claims he had no other reason to kill, but his fingerprints are on the victim's medicine bottle found in the kitchen. If he had no reason to be there, why are his prints on the bottle? This suggests he was present and handled the medicine, implying involvement beyond just the loan. So the contradiction is between Testimony 7 and Evidence 6. \n\nBut let me check Evidence 6's description: \"Small Bottle: Found in the kitchen. Shape is different from others. Contents unknown. The victim's ear medicine. Covered in Furio Tigre's fingerprints.\" So the evidence directly links Tigre to the victim's medicine. If he claims he had no other reason to be involved, but his fingerprints are on the medicine, that's a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, the correct pair is Evidence 6 and Testimony 7. Because Tigre says he didn't have another reason, but his fingerprints on the victim's item suggest otherwise.\n\n{\"evidence\": 6, \"testimony\": 7}",

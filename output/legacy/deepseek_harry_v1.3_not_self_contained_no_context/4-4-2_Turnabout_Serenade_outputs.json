You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by going through each testimony and cross-referencing with the evidence provided.\n\nLooking at Lamiroir's testimonies first. Testimony 3 says: \"When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment...\" So she claims she went backstage briefly after her performance. Now, the evidence. Let me check Evidence 9, the Crime Photo. It mentions the victim was in Lamiroir's room, and the diagram (Evidence 10) shows the crime scene was her dressing room. If she went backstage, which would include her dressing room, she might have seen something. But in Testimony 4, she says she saw nothing because the body was behind a wall. Wait, but Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance. The autopsy report (Evidence 8) states time of death between 9-9:30 PM. If her performance ended around that time, she could have been there during or right after the murder.\n\nNow, Evidence 12 is the Headset. It says all concert staff wore one with a 30-foot range. If Lamiroir was part of the staff, she would have a headset. If she went backstage, maybe the headset's range could place her near the crime scene. Wait, but how does that contradict her testimony? Let me think again.\n\nTestimony 3: She went backstage after the performance. But Evidence 10's diagram shows the crime scene in her dressing room, and the body was behind some items. If she went backstage (to her dressing room), she might have been in the vicinity. However, she says in Testimony 4 that she didn't see the body because it was behind a wall. But wait, perhaps the key contradiction is that she claims she didn't return backstage after the second set (Testimony 2). Wait, Testimony 2 says: \"I did not return backstage after the second set.\" But Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance. Wait, maybe the performance was part of the second set? If the concert had two sets, and she performed during the second set, then Testimony 2 says she didn't return after the second set, but Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance. That might be a contradiction. Wait, maybe not. Let me check the testimonies again.\n\nTestimony 1: \"That night, I was invited to sing on stage, and this I did.\" Testimony 2: \"I did not return backstage after the second set.\" Testimony 3: \"When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment...\" So if her performance was part of the second set, then after finishing, she went backstage (Testimony 3), but Testimony 2 says she didn't return after the second set. That would be a contradiction. But maybe the performance was during the second set, and after that she went backstage once, which would be part of the same set. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the key contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nAnother angle: Evidence 4 is the Brooch found at the crime scene, belonging to Lamiroir. If she was there, perhaps she left it. But her testimonies say she didn't see anything. But how does that directly contradict?\n\nWait, let's look at Testimony 5: \"I saw bullet holes in the wall, and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot...\" But the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) mentions smeared writing in blood next to his right hand, and the victim was lying with his face turned left. If Lamiroir saw the bullet holes, how did she know LeTouse was shot? Unless she was there, but she claims she didn't see the body. Wait, maybe the bullet holes were visible from outside the room. But according to the Diagram (Evidence 10), there were two bullet holes on the wall where the door was. So if she entered the room, she might have seen the bullet holes. But she says she went backstage (Testimony 3), which would be her dressing room. If the crime occurred in her dressing room, then her going backstage would mean entering that room. But in Testimony 4, she says she saw nothing because the body was behind a wall. But if she entered the room, she might have seen the bullet holes. So Testimony 5 says she saw the bullet holes, implying she was in the room, but Testimony 4 says she didn't see the body because it was behind a wall. But the bullet holes on the door's wall would be visible upon entering. So if she entered the room after the performance (Testimony 3), she would have seen the bullet holes, leading her to know LeTouse was shot (Testimony 5). But if the body was behind a wall (as per Testimony 4), maybe she didn't see the body, but the bullet holes were visible. That's not a contradiction yet.\n\nWait, the contradiction might be between Testimony 3 where she says she went backstage (to her dressing room) and the Crime Scene Diagram (Evidence 10) which shows the victim was in her dressing room. If she went there, she would have seen the body or the bullet holes. But in Testimony 4, she claims she didn't see the body because it was behind a wall. However, if she was in the room, even if the body was behind some items, she might have seen the bullet holes. The key contradiction could be that she claims she went backstage (Testimony 3) but the crime scene (her dressing room) had bullet holes and the body, yet she didn't mention seeing the bullet holes at that time. Wait, but Testimony 5 says she saw the bullet holes. Maybe the timing is the issue. Let me check the order of testimonies.\n\nTestimony 3: After performance, went backstage. Testimony 5: She saw bullet holes and knew LeTouse was shot. Testimony 6: Then she was led to Gavin's room. So if she went backstage (to her dressing room) after the performance, and saw the bullet holes then (Testimony 5), but according to the autopsy, time of death was 9-9:30 PM. If her performance ended around that time, she would have entered the room where the murder happened. However, the Diagram (Evidence 10) says the victim was blocked from sight by items when entering the room. So she might not have seen the body, but the bullet holes on the door's wall would be visible. So when she entered, she saw the bullet holes, realized LeTouse was shot, and then was taken to Gavin's room. That seems consistent. Hmm, maybe not a contradiction here.\n\nAnother angle: The Brooch (Evidence 4) belongs to Lamiroir and was found at the crime scene. If she was there, she might have lost it. But her testimonies don't mention being in the room during the crime. Wait, but she went backstage after her performance (Testimony 3), which is when the murder occurred. So if the murder happened at 9-9:30 PM, and she went backstage then, perhaps she was present during the murder. But she says she didn't see anything. The Brooch being there could imply she was present, contradicting her claim of not seeing anything. But that's indirect. Maybe not the strongest contradiction.\n\nLooking at Evidence 12, the Headset. All staff wore one with a 30-foot range. If Lamiroir was wearing a headset, and the crime scene was her dressing room, then the headset's range might place her in proximity. But how does that contradict her testimony? Unless her headset was active and recorded something, but that's not mentioned.\n\nWait, Testimony 2: \"I did not return backstage after the second set.\" But Testimony 3: \"When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment...\" If the performance was part of the second set, then going backstage after that would be after the second set. So Testimony 2 and Testimony 3 would contradict each other. But the user is asking for evidence contradicting testimony, not testimonies contradicting each other. So the answer must be one evidence and one testimony.\n\nAnother thought: The Revolver (Evidence 5) is the murder weapon belonging to LeTouse. If LeTouse was shot with his own gun, perhaps indicating he was attacked by someone else. But how does this contradict a testimony? Maybe Lamiroir's Testimony 5 where she says she saw bullet holes and knew he was shot. But that's not a contradiction.\n\nWait, Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) mentions the victim's right hand had smeared writing in blood. If he was shot and tried to write something, but Lamiroir didn't mention that. But she claims she didn't see the body. So maybe not.\n\nWait, let's look at Evidence 7: Mixing Board. Allows music to be played in separate tracks. If during the concert, maybe the music was being mixed, which could relate to alibis. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 13: Switch \u2192 Remote Trigger. Triggers an igniter within 30 feet. Evidence 15: Igniter found at the crime scene, same as in Gavin's guitar. So maybe the murder involved the remote trigger. If someone used the remote to trigger the igniter, causing a distraction. But how does this contradict a testimony?\n\nWait, Testimony 6: Lamiroir was led to Gavin's room after seeing the bullet holes. If Gavin's room had the guitar with the igniter (Evidence 17 was burned the night of the concert), maybe the fire was triggered. But not sure how this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance. But Evidence 14 (Forum Diagram) shows the layout of the coliseum. Maybe the timing or the path she took would contradict, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, going back to Testimony 3 and Testimony 2. If the second set was her performance, then Testimony 2 says she didn't return backstage after the second set. But Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance (which was the second set). So those two testimonies contradict each other, but the user wants evidence contradicting testimony.\n\nWait, perhaps Evidence 8 (Autopsy Report) says time of death 9-9:30 PM. If Lamiroir's performance ended at, say, 9 PM, and she went backstage (Testimony 3), then she would have been there during the time of death. But she claims in Testimony 4 she didn't see the body because it was behind a wall. However, the Diagram (Evidence 10) shows the crime scene was her dressing room, and the body was blocked from view when entering. So if she entered her dressing room after the performance, she might not have seen the body but could have been present during the murder. However, this doesn't directly contradict unless there's evidence placing her there at the time.\n\nAlternatively, the Headset (Evidence 12) has a 30-foot range. If the crime scene was within 30 feet of where she was, maybe her headset was in range, implying she was near the crime scene. But if she claims she didn't go backstage (Testimony 2?), but wait Testimony 3 says she did go backstage. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 4. Testimony 3 says she went backstage (her dressing room), where Evidence 4's Brooch was found. But if she went there, her Brooch being found there isn't contradictory. Unless the Brooch was lost during the crime, implying she was present during the crime. But she claims she didn't see anything. But that's not a direct contradiction.\n\nWait, another angle: Evidence 16 is the Borginian Newspaper that doesn't mention the lyrics of Lamiroir's ballad. But Testimony 0 is Lamiroir saying she saw nothing. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the Remote Trigger (Evidence 13) and the Igniter (Evidence 15). If the murder involved the remote trigger, maybe the killer used it. But how does this contradict testimony?\n\nWait, going back to Testimony 5: Lamiroir says she saw bullet holes and knew LeTouse was shot. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows bullet holes in the wall. But according to Evidence 10 (Diagram), the bullet holes were on the door's wall. If she entered the room, she would have seen those bullet holes immediately. However, the Diagram says the body was blocked by items when entering. So she could have entered, seen the bullet holes, but not the body. So Testimony 5 is consistent. But maybe the number of bullet holes? The Revolver (Evidence 5) is a high-caliber revolver. The Crime Photo and Diagram mention two bullet holes. A revolver typically holds six bullets. If two shots were fired, but the Revolver is the murder weapon, that's plausible. Not a contradiction.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to find a direct contradiction where a testimony says something that is proven false by an evidence.\n\nLet me check Testimony 2: \"I did not return backstage after the second set.\" And Testimony 3: \"When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment...\" If the performance was part of the second set, then Testimony 3 contradicts Testimony 2. But the question is about evidence contradicting testimony. So which evidence would show that she did return backstage after the second set?\n\nEvidence 9 (Crime Photo) shows the crime scene in her dressing room, which is backstage. If the murder occurred during the second set, and she went backstage after her performance (which was part of the second set), then she would have been there when the murder happened. But how does the evidence directly contradict her testimony?\n\nWait, maybe the Brooch (Evidence 4) found at the crime scene. If she was there, she left it. But Testimony 2 says she didn't return after the second set. But Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance (which is during the second set). So if the second set ended after her performance, then Testimony 2 says she didn't return after the set, but she went backstage during the set. That's not a contradiction. Wait, perhaps the timeline is that the second set ended, then she didn't return backstage after that. But her performance was part of the second set, so after finishing her part, she went backstage (still during the second set), then the set ended, and she didn't go back again. So Testimony 2 and 3 can be consistent. So maybe that's not the contradiction.\n\nAnother approach: The Key Ring (Evidence 6) was found in the victim's hand. It holds keys to a guitar case and motorcycle. The Guitar (Evidence 17) belonged to Gavin and was burned. If Daryan is the guitarist for Gavinners, maybe he's involved. But how does this relate to Lamiroir's testimony?\n\nWait, the Headset (Evidence 12) has a 30-foot range. If Lamiroir was wearing one and was in the vicinity of the crime scene (her dressing room), then perhaps her headset was within range. But if she claims she didn't return backstage (Testimony 2), but the headset's signal places her there, that would contradict. But the problem is the evidence doesn't explicitly state that her headset was in range, only that all staff wore one. Unless there's evidence of her headset being active in the area.\n\nAlternatively, the Remote Trigger (Evidence 13) has a 30-foot range, same as the headset. If the trigger was used from the stage, but the crime scene was backstage, maybe distance is an issue. Not sure.\n\nWait, going back to the initial testimonies. Testimony 3: She went backstage after her performance. Evidence 10's Diagram shows the crime scene was her dressing room. If she went there, she would have been present at the crime scene around the time of the murder (9-9:30 PM). However, she claims in Testimony 4 that she didn't see the body because it was behind a wall. But if she was there, how did she not notice the gunshot or the bullet holes? Wait, Testimony 5 says she saw the bullet holes. So she did notice them, which implies she was there. But the Key Ring (Evidence 6) was found in the victim's hand. The victim was LeTouse, her interpreter. Maybe she had a motive, but that's not the contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 6. Testimony 3 says she went backstage, but Evidence 6 (Key Ring) was in the victim's hand. If LeTouse was holding the keys when he died, and she was there, maybe she had access to them. But how does that contradict?\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 18 is the Borginian Cocoon replica held by LeTouse. LeTouse was investigating this, which relates to incuritis (Evidence 19). If Lamiroir is from Borginia, maybe she's involved in that, but her testimony doesn't mention it. Not a direct contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe the crucial contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 12. Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance. If she was wearing the Headset (Evidence 12), which has a 30-foot range, and the crime scene was within that range, maybe communication logs would show she was there. But the evidence doesn't provide logs. However, the headset's range implies that if the crime scene was within 30 feet of where she was, she could have heard something. But she claims she saw nothing. But without specific evidence about what was transmitted, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the Revolver (Evidence 5) belonging to LeTouse. If he was shot with his own gun, it suggests a struggle or that the killer took his gun. Lamiroir says she didn't see anything, but if she was present, she might have seen the killer. But again, no direct evidence contradiction.\n\nWait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 8) says death from a gunshot wound, time 9-9:30 PM. Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance. If her performance ended around 9 PM, then she was there at the time of death. But she didn't report hearing a gunshot or seeing anything. However, the Crime Scene's Diagram (Evidence 10) shows two bullet holes on the door's wall. If the shooting happened when she was backstage, she would have heard the shots. But she claims she saw nothing (Testimony 0, 4). This could be a contradiction: she was present during the shooting but didn't hear anything, which is unlikely. However, the evidence doesn't mention sound, so maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the Mixing Board (Evidence 7) allows separate tracks. If the performance was ongoing, maybe the gunshot was masked by the music. So she might not have heard it. That could explain, but not a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the Remote Trigger (Evidence 13) and Igniter (Evidence 15) were used to create a distraction, like a firework or explosion, which covered the gunshot. So she might not have heard the shot. But again, this is speculation.\n\nI'm struggling here. Let me try to find a direct contradiction. Let's look at Testimony 2: \"I did not return backstage after the second set.\" But Evidence something shows she was backstage. For example, Evidence 4 (Brooch) found at the crime scene (backstage) implies she was there. If she didn't return after the second set, how did her Brooch get there? So if Testimony 2 says she didn't return backstage after the second set, but her Brooch was found there, that's a contradiction. So the Brooch (Evidence 4) contradicts Testimony 2. But when was the second set? If she went backstage during the second set (Testimony 3), then after the second set, she didn't return. But the Brooch could have been left during her visit during the second set, not after. So that's not a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the time of death is 9-9:30 PM. If the second set ended before 9 PM, and she didn't return after that, but the murder happened at 9 PM, then she wouldn't have been there. But if her performance ended at 9 PM and she went backstage then (Testimony 3), which is during the second set, then she was there during the time of death. But her Testimony 2 says she didn't return after the second set. If the second set ended after her performance, say at 9:15 PM, then she went backstage at 9 PM (during the set), and didn't return after the set ended. That would be consistent. But the Brooch being found there doesn't contradict unless it was left after the second set.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Key Ring (Evidence 6) in the victim's hand includes keys to a motorcycle and guitar case. If the guitar case is related to Gavin's guitar (Evidence 17), which was burned, perhaps Daryan was involved. But how does this relate to Lamiroir's testimony?\n\nI'm going in circles. Let me try to approach differently. Which testimony directly says something that is proven false by an evidence?\n\nTestimony 4: \"I saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall.\" But Evidence 9's caption says there's smeared writing in blood next to his right hand. If she was in the room, even if the body was behind a wall, she would have to approach close enough to see the bullet holes (Testimony 5), which are on the door wall. So she entered, saw the bullet holes, but didn't see the body. That's possible. But the writing in blood would be near the body. If she didn't approach further, she might not have seen it. So no contradiction.\n\nWait, the Revolver (Evidence 5) is the murder weapon, belonging to LeTouse. So he was shot with his own gun. If Lamiroir was there, maybe she took the gun, but she says she saw nothing. Not directly a contradiction.\n\nAnother angle: The Autopsy Report (Evidence 8) says death from a gunshot wound. The Revolver is the weapon. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the gun next to the body. But Testimony 5 says Lamiroir knew he was shot because she saw bullet holes. However, if the gun was found next to the body, it could look like a suicide, but the bullet holes in the wall suggest multiple shots. But Lamiroir knew it was a murder. But this is not a contradiction, just deduction.\n\nWait, Testimony 5: \"I saw bullet holes in the wall, and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot...\" But if the gun was next to the body, someone might think suicide. But she knew he was shot, implying murder. But the evidence shows it was murder, so no contradiction.\n\nI'm really stuck. Let me think again. The user wants one pair where evidence contradicts testimony. \n\nAh! Wait, Testimony 3: \"When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment...\" But Evidence 10 (Diagram) states that the crime scene (Lamiroir's dressing room) had the victim's body blocked from sight by items when entering. If she went backstage to her dressing room after her performance, she would have been in the room where the murder occurred. The autopsy time is 9-9:30 PM, which aligns with her performance timing. Therefore, she would have been present during or right after the murder. However, Testimony 4 says she didn't see the body because it was behind a wall. But if she entered the room, even if the body was blocked, she should have heard the gunshot or seen the bullet holes. But according to Testimony 5, she did see the bullet holes. So the contradiction might be between Testimony 3 and the fact that the body was in her dressing room, implying she was there during the murder, but she claims she didn't see anything (Testimony 4). Wait, but she does admit to seeing the bullet holes (Testimony 5). So maybe the real contradiction is between her claim in Testimony 3 (going backstage) and the Key Ring (Evidence 6) being in the victim's hand. Wait, no.\n\nWait, another angle: The Brooch (Evidence 4) is Lamiroir's and found at the crime scene. If she wasn't there after the second set (Testimony 2), how did her Brooch get there? Unless she was there during the second set, which she admits in Testimony 3. So no contradiction there.\n\nWait, Testimony 2: \"I did not return backstage after the second set.\" Testimony 3: \"When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment...\" If the performance was part of the second set, then going backstage after the performance is during the second set, not after. So Testimony 2 is about not returning after the second set ended. So she could have gone backstage during the second set (Testimony 3) and not after. So no contradiction. \n\nMaybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 9. Testimony 5: She saw bullet holes and knew LeTouse was shot. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim was shot in the shoulder. If the bullet holes in the wall are from the shots that hit him, but the wall bullet holes might be from missed shots. However, this isn't a direct contradiction.\n\nWait, the Revolver (Evidence 5) is a high-caliber revolver. The Crime Photo mentions the victim was shot in the shoulder. The bullet holes in the wall (Diagram, Evidence 10) are two. So possibly two missed shots and one hit. But the Revolver can hold more bullets. Not a contradiction.\n\nI'm really not finding it. Let me check a walkthrough in my mind. In the game, this case is from Apollo Justice. The contradiction here is that Lamiroir claims she didn't return backstage after the second set (Testimony 2), but the Brooch (Evidence 4) found at the scene suggests she was there. Alternatively, the key contradiction is that she says she went backstage after her performance (Testimony 3), but the headset (Evidence 12) would have transmitted her presence if she was there during the crime.\n\nAlternatively, the Remote Trigger (Evidence 13) and Igniter (Evidence 15) show that the murder was set up with a remote, which could mean the shooter wasn't present. But how does that contradict testimony?\n\nWait, in the actual game, the contradiction is that Lamiroir says she didn't return backstage after the second set, but the Brooch being found there indicates she did. So Evidence 4 contradicts Testimony 2. But in the given testimonies, Testimony 2 is \"I did not return backstage after the second set.\" Evidence 4 is the Brooch found at the crime scene (her dressing room), which is backstage. Therefore, if the Brooch is hers and found there, it means she was there after the second set, contradicting Testimony 2. However, Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance, which could be during the second set. If the second set ended after her performance, then Testimony 2's \"after the second set\" is after that. So the Brooch being there could have been left during Testimony 3's visit, not after the set. So maybe that's not the contradiction.\n\nWait, but perhaps the second set includes her performance, and after she finished, the second set continued. So leaving after her part would still be during the second set. Then Testimony 2 says she didn't return after the second set (i.e., after the entire set ended). So the Brooch could have been left during her visit during the set, not after. So no contradiction.\n\nBut if the murder occurred after the second set, and the Brooch was left then, then Testimony 2 is contradicted. But the Autopsy Report says time of death 9-9:30 PM. If the second set ended at 9 PM, then the murder happened after, and the Brooch implies she was there after the set. But without timing info on the sets, it's hard to confirm.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most likely contradiction is between Testimony 2 (did not return backstage after second set) and Evidence 4 (Brooch found there). But I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (went backstage after performance) and Evidence 10 (crime scene in her dressing room with the body). If she went there after the performance, she would have been at the crime scene around the time of death. But she claims she didn't see the body (Testimony 4). However, this is a contradiction only if the evidence shows she must have seen it. The Diagram (Evidence 10) says the body was blocked from view by items when entering. So she might not have seen it, but the Bullet holes (Testimony 5) she did see. So no contradiction.\n\nIn the game, I recall that the Brooch is hers and found at the scene, which contradicts her statement of not being there. But according to the given testimonies, Testimony 2 says she didn't return after the second set, but Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance, which might be during the second set. So the Brooch being there doesn't necessarily contradict Testimony 2. \n\nWait, maybe the correct pair is Evidence 4 (Brooch) and Testimony 2. If she says she didn't return after the second set, but her Brooch was found there, implying she did. But if she went backstage during the second set (Testimony 3), then the Brooch was left during that visit, which is allowed. So Testimony 2 is about after the set, not during. Thus, no contradiction.\n\nAnother possibility: Testimony 6 says she was led to Gavin's room after seeing the bullet holes. Evidence 17 is Gavin's guitar, which was burned. If the guitar was burned using the igniter (Evidence 15), which was triggered by the Remote Trigger (Evidence 13), then maybe the fire happened after she was there. But no direct contradiction.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating. The most straightforward contradiction is between Lamiroir's Testimony 2 (\"I did not return backstage after the second set\") and Evidence 4 (her Brooch found at the crime scene backstage). This suggests she did return, contradicting her testimony. But if she went backstage during the second set (Testimony 3), then the Brooch could be there without contradicting Testimony 2. But maybe the murder happened after the second set, so the Brooch being there implies she was there after the set, contradicting Testimony 2.\n\nGiven the time of death is 9-9:30 PM (Evidence 8), if the second set ended at 9 PM, and the murder happened at 9 PM, then Testimony 2 says she didn't return after the set (post-9 PM), but the Brooch being there implies she did. So Evidence 4 contradicts Testimony 2.\n\n{\"evidence\": 4, \"testimony\": 2}",

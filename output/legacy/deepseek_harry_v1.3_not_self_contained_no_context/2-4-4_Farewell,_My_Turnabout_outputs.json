You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user wants to know which evidence and testimony from the given list contradict each other. The task is to find one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a statement in the testimony.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the testimonies provided by de Killer. Let's go through each testimony and see what they're claiming. \n\nTestimony 3 says: \"While pretending to be the first person to discover the body and enter the scene,\" and Testimony 4 continues that Adrian Andrews knew Corrida was dead already. Testimony 5 mentions that the client (Andrews) created and planted the knife and button. \n\nLooking at the evidence, the key points are the fingerprints and the spy camera. The Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but according to Testimony 5, Andrews planted the knife. However, if the knife has Engarde's prints, that might suggest Engarde's involvement, but de Killer is saying Andrews did it. Wait, but maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nTestimony 2 says the client (Andrews) framed another. So, if the knife has Engarde's prints, that's framing him. But if there's evidence that shows Andrews couldn't have planted the knife, that would contradict. Let me check.\n\nWait, Evidence 21 is the Spy Camera set to record from 8 PM. The murder was at 8:15 PM. The video tape (Evidence 29) was retrieved from de Killer's hideout. The Video Tape might show the actual murder. If the Spy Camera was recording, then the footage might show who entered the room. But how does that connect to the testimonies?\n\nTestimony 3 is about Andrews pretending to discover the body. But if the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording, maybe the footage would show Andrews entering the room at a certain time, contradicting her claim of being the first to discover the body. Wait, but the Spy Camera's footage is mentioned in Evidence 21 and 22, and the Video Tape (29) is from de Killer's hideout. If the Video Tape is the actual footage, but the Spy Camera was set up by Engarde (since he bought the stuffed bear in Evidence 24), then maybe the Video Tape would show the real killer, which could be de Killer, contradicting de Killer's testimony that Andrews did it. But I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 5: \"the creation and planting of the 'knife' and 'button'.\" The button is Evidence 16, Jammin' Ninja's Button found in Engarde's hakama. If the button was planted by Andrews to frame Engarde, but the button is covered in Corrida's blood, that would support the framing. However, the Knife (15) has Engarde's fingerprints. If Andrews planted the knife, how did Engarde's fingerprints get on it? Unless she had access to his items. But maybe there's evidence that Engarde couldn't have been the one to plant the knife.\n\nWait, let me check the Autopsy Report (14). The cause of death was strangulation first, then stabbing. The Knife has Engarde's prints, but if he was framed, perhaps the Spy Camera footage would show someone else (like de Killer) committing the murder. But the problem is to find a direct contradiction between a testimony and an evidence.\n\nLooking at Testimony 5: Andrews planted the knife and button. But if the Knife (15) has Engarde's fingerprints, and if Engarde was not involved, then how did his prints get there? Unless the knife was stolen from Engarde, but that's not directly stated. Alternatively, the Knife has \"Gatewater\" engraved, which might link to the hotel, but the Security Lady is there. Hmm.\n\nWait, another angle: The Spy Camera (21) was recording during the murder. The Video Tape (29) from de Killer's hideout might contain footage that shows the real killer. If de Killer's testimony says Andrews planted evidence, but the Spy Camera's footage (Video Tape) shows de Killer committing the murder, that would contradict. However, the user hasn't seen the contents of the Video Tape. But the existence of the Spy Camera recording during the murder time (8 PM for 1 hour) might mean that the footage could show who was present. If Andrews was seen planting the knife, but de Killer's testimony says she did, that's not a contradiction. Alternatively, if the Spy Camera's footage shows that Andrews wasn't the one who planted the knife, then that contradicts the testimony.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 3: Andrews pretended to be the first to discover the body. But if the Spy Camera was in the room, maybe the footage shows that someone else (like de Killer) was there before her. However, the user doesn't have the footage, but the existence of the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) set to record at the time of the murder could mean that the Video Tape (29) would contradict the testimony. But since the Video Tape's contents are unknown, maybe the Spy Camera's existence is the key here.\n\nWait, but de Killer's Testimony 3 says that Andrews pretended to be the first to enter the scene. However, if the Spy Camera was recording, and the footage (Video Tape) shows that Andrews was actually the first to enter, then that would support the testimony. But if the Spy Camera's existence is known, and the camera was in the room, then Andrews entering the room would be recorded. If the footage shows that she entered after the murder, then it's possible. But how does that contradict?\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) with Corrida's fingerprints. The Crime Photo (9) shows the guitar case empty. The Knife (15) with Engarde's prints. If de Killer's testimony says that Andrews planted the knife, but the knife has Engarde's prints, then unless Andrews had a way to get Engarde's prints on the knife, there's a contradiction. But maybe the Spy Camera footage would show her planting it, which could be the case. However, the user is supposed to find a contradiction between existing evidence and testimony.\n\nWait, Testimony 5 says Andrews created and planted the knife. But the Knife (15) has Engarde's fingerprints, which would suggest Engarde handled it. If Andrews planted it, how did his prints get there? Unless she framed him by using his knife. But if the Spy Camera's footage (Evidence 21) shows that Engarde was not present, then the prints on the knife would be planted. But the problem is, the Spy Camera was in the victim's room. If Engarde wasn't there, but his fingerprints are on the knife, that suggests the knife was planted. But that would support the testimony, not contradict it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Security Lady (Character 3) could have seen something, but that's not evidence.\n\nWait, Evidence 25 is the Figurine that only Corrida and Andrews know how to open. Inside is Celeste's Suicide Note (27) which implicates Engarde. If Andrews had access to the figurine, she could have known about the note, but that's not directly related to the testimonies here.\n\nAnother angle: The Pistol (28) retrieved from de Killer's hideout was used to shoot Franziska. If de Killer is the assassin, then his involvement in the murder would contradict his testimony that Andrews is the client. But according to the given testimonies, de Killer is saying that Andrews is his client. Wait, no. Testimony 0 says \"Adrian Andrews is my client.\" But de Killer is the assassin, so if he's claiming Andrews is his client, but the Pistol is his, that might not be a contradiction. Wait, but the user might have to cross-reference this. However, the question is about evidence and testimony contradicting.\n\nWait, the Transceiver (Evidence 4) is from de Killer, used to communicate with Maya's kidnapper. If de Killer is the kidnapper, then he's involved. But his testimony says Andrews is his client. That could imply that Andrews hired him, but if there's evidence that de Killer acted independently, that might contradict. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking back, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 5 (Andrews planted the knife and button) and the Spy Camera's existence. If the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording the room, then it would have captured anyone planting the evidence. If the Video Tape (29) from de Killer's hideout contains footage that shows someone else (like de Killer) planting the knife, then that contradicts Testimony 5. However, the Video Tape's contents are unknown. But the Spy Camera's existence as recording at the time of the murder (8 PM for 1 hour, time of death 8:15 PM) means that the footage exists. So, if the testimony says Andrews planted the knife, but the Spy Camera's footage would show otherwise, that's a contradiction. But since the Video Tape is in the evidence but its contents are unknown, maybe the user is supposed to assume that the Spy Camera's footage (which would have been recorded) contradicts the testimony that Andrews planted the knife.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 says Andrews pretended to be the first to enter the scene. But if the Spy Camera was in the room and recorded her entering after the murder, that supports it. If the Spy Camera was in the room, then the footage would show who entered when. So if the Spy Camera's existence (Evidence 21) shows that Andrews was indeed the first to enter, that supports the testimony. But if there's evidence that someone else was there first, that would contradict. \n\nWait, Lotta's Photo (Evidence 17) is a picture taken in the hallway right after the murder, showing a person in samurai garb outside the door. If that person is de Killer or someone else, then maybe Andrews wasn't the first. But how does that connect?\n\nAlternatively, the key contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Andrews planted the knife) and Evidence 15 (Knife has Engarde's fingerprints). If the knife was planted by Andrews, then it shouldn't have Engarde's fingerprints unless she somehow obtained his prints. But if Engarde's fingerprints are on the knife, it suggests he handled it. However, if the Spy Camera's footage (from Evidence 21) shows that Engarde wasn't present, then his prints on the knife would imply it was planted. But the existence of the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) being present and recording during the murder time would mean that if Engarde was in the room, the camera would have recorded it. If the footage (Video Tape 29) from de Killer's hideout shows Engarde not being there, but the knife has his prints, that supports the planting. But since the Video Tape's contents are unknown, maybe the Spy Camera's existence itself is the contradiction. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the key contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Andrews pretended to be first to enter) and the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) which would have recorded her entering. If the Spy Camera was in the room and Andrews was the first to enter, then the footage would show that. But maybe the Spy Camera was in the room and someone else was there before her, which would contradict her claim. But without knowing the footage's content, how can we tell?\n\nWait, maybe the Spy Camera was set up by Engarde (as per Evidence 24, he bought the stuffed bear where the camera was hidden). The Spy Camera was recording from 8 PM. The murder happened at 8:15 PM. If Engarde set up the camera, he might have wanted to record the murder. If the footage shows de Killer committing the murder, that contradicts de Killer's testimony that Andrews is the client. But the problem is, the testimonies are from de Killer, who claims Andrews is his client and that she framed someone else. If the Spy Camera's footage (which is in the Video Tape 29) shows de Killer, then de Killer is lying about Andrews being his client. But since the Video Tape's contents are unknown, but the Spy Camera's existence is known, perhaps the existence of the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) contradicts Testimony 3 because if Andrews was the first to enter, the camera would have recorded her entering, but the testimony says she pretended to be the first. But without the footage, how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) with water on top. The Crime Photo (9) shows a smashed vase with water on the carpet. If the water from the vase was spilled, the Guitar Case's lid has water on top. Maybe this indicates the vase was broken after the case was placed there, but not sure.\n\nWait, the key contradiction I think is between Testimony 5 (Andrews planted the knife and button) and the Knife (15) having Engarde's fingerprints. If the knife was planted by Andrews, then how did Engarde's fingerprints get on it? Unless she had access to something of his. But if Engarde had no reason to be in the room, and the Spy Camera (21) shows he wasn't there, then his fingerprints on the knife would suggest it was planted. But the testimony says Andrews did the planting, which would align with that. So maybe that's not a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Andrews planted the button) and the Jammin' Ninja's Button (16) being found in Engarde's hakama. If Andrews planted it there, that's possible. But how does that contradict? It would support the testimony.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 3: Andrews pretended to be the first to enter the scene. But the Security Lady (Character 3) might have seen someone else, but that's not evidence. Alternatively, the Security Lady's testimony isn't listed here.\n\nWait, another angle: The Crime Photo (9) shows the Wine Glass (8) with Andrews' fingerprints. If Andrews was in the room before the murder, then her fingerprints on the glass would make sense. But Testimony 3 and 4 suggest she pretended to discover the body after the murder. If her fingerprints are on the glass, which was found at the scene, that implies she was there before the murder, contradicting her claim of being the first to discover the body. But according to the testimony, de Killer is saying that Andrews already knew Corrida was dead and entered the scene pretending to be the first. If her fingerprints are on the glass, that would mean she was there earlier, which supports de Killer's testimony. But where's the contradiction?\n\nWait, the Wine Glass (8) has Andrews' fingerprints and is filled with tomato juice. If the victim was killed at 8:15 PM, and the glass was there, then Andrews must have been there before or during the murder. If she was the killer, then that aligns with de Killer's testimony. But the problem is, the contradiction has to be between evidence and testimony.\n\nWait, perhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Andrews planted the knife) and Evidence 15 (Knife has Engarde's fingerprints). If de Killer says Andrews planted the knife to frame Engarde, then the presence of Engarde's fingerprints on the knife supports that. So that's not a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps another angle.\n\nLooking at Evidence 17: Lotta's Photo shows a person in samurai garb outside the door right after the murder. If that person is Andrews, then she was there. If it's someone else, like de Killer, then that contradicts the testimony. But the photo's person's identity isn't clear.\n\nAlternatively, the Spy Camera (21) was set to record from 8 PM. The murder was at 8:15 PM. If the Spy Camera was in the room, then it would have recorded the murderer. If the Video Tape (29) from de Killer's hideout contains this footage, and if it shows de Killer committing the murder, that would contradict de Killer's testimony that Andrews is his client. But since the Video Tape's contents are unknown, but the user knows that de Killer tried to recover it violently (as per Evidence 29's details), it's possible the tape incriminates him. Therefore, the existence of the Video Tape (29) contradicts Testimony 0 where de Killer claims Andrews is his client, because the tape would show de Killer's involvement. However, the user is instructed to pick one pair, and the answer must be from the given list. The Video Tape is Evidence 29, and Testimony 0 is de Killer stating Andrews is his client. So if the Video Tape shows de Killer, that contradicts his claim that Andrews is the client. But since the contents are unknown, perhaps this is the intended pair.\n\nAlternatively, considering the Spy Camera (21) and Transmitter (22), which were used to record and transmit the footage. The Video Tape (29) is in de Killer's hideout, and he tried to recover it. This suggests that the tape has incriminating evidence. If the Spy Camera's footage was transmitted via the Transmitter, then the Video Tape would show the real murderer. If de Killer is seen in the footage, then his testimony that Andrews is his client is a lie, as he was the actual perpetrator. Therefore, Evidence 29 (Video Tape) contradicts Testimony 0 (Andrews is his client). But the Video Tape's contents are unknown. However, de Killer's violent attempt to recover it implies it's important. So the existence of the Video Tape as evidence retrieved from de Killer's hideout contradicts his testimony that Andrews is the client, implying he's involved, making his testimony a lie. But how does the Video Tape's existence contradict the testimony? Unless the Video Tape's existence itself proves de Killer's involvement, which he's trying to cover up by claiming Andrews is the client. Thus, Evidence 29 (Video Tape) contradicts Testimony 0 (Andrews is client). But the user must choose one pair.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Testimony 5 says Andrews planted the knife and button. The Knife (15) has Engarde's prints. The Jammin' Ninja's Button (16) is covered in Corrida's blood and found in Engarde's hakama. If Andrews planted these, then she would need access to Engarde's clothing and to get his prints on the knife. The Spy Camera (21) and Video Tape (29) might show that she didn't plant them, but without seeing the footage, we can't say. \n\nWait, Evidence 24 is a Credit Card Receipt showing Engarde bought a stuffed bear identical to the one with the Spy Camera. This connects Engarde to the Spy Camera. Therefore, Engarde set up the camera to record the murder. If the Video Tape (29) shows de Killer committing the murder, then Engarde and de Killer are connected, which would contradict de Killer's testimony that Andrews is the client. But since the Video Tape is in de Killer's hideout, perhaps it shows that de Killer was hired by Engarde, not Andrews, contradicting Testimony 0 where de Killer says Andrews is his client. Therefore, Evidence 29 (Video Tape) contradicts Testimony 0.\n\nBut since the Video Tape's contents are unknown, maybe the intended contradiction is between the Spy Camera (21) and Testimony 3. Because if the camera was recording, then Andrews entering the room would be recorded. If Testimony 3 says she pretended to be the first to enter, but the camera's footage would show that she wasn't the first, that would contradict. But the existence of the camera (Evidence 21) doesn't directly contradict unless the footage is considered. However, the user might have to assume that the existence of the camera (which was set by Engarde) implies that Engarde had knowledge of the murder beforehand, making him involved, which contradicts de Killer's claim that Andrews is the client. But this is a bit indirect.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 5 says Andrews planted the knife. The knife has Engarde's prints. If the Spy Camera's footage shows Engarde handling the knife, that would mean Andrews didn't plant it, contradicting Testimony 5. But again, without the footage, this is speculative.\n\nAfter considering all possibilities, I think the most direct contradiction is between the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) and Testimony 3. The Spy Camera was recording the room during the murder, so if Andrews was the first to enter, the footage would show her. But de Killer's Testimony 3 says she pretended to be the first, but if the camera was there and the footage exists (even if not viewed yet), then it's a contradiction because the camera would have evidence contradicting her pretense. However, the existence of the camera itself doesn't necessarily contradict unless the footage is considered. But maybe the fact that the Spy Camera was present and recording means that the events were captured, which would either confirm or contradict the testimony. Since the Video Tape was retrieved from de Killer's hideout, it's likely that it shows the true events, contradicting de Killer's claims. Therefore, Evidence 29 (Video Tape) contradicts Testimony 0, but the Video Tape's contents are unknown. However, since the user has to choose from the given list, the intended answer might be the Spy Camera (21) contradicting Testimony 3 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, the Magatama (Evidence 1) allows detecting lies, but that's not directly relevant here.\n\nWait, looking back, Testimony 5 says Andrews planted the knife and button. The button (16) is in Engarde's hakama. If the Spy Camera (21) was recording, then the footage would show whether Andrews planted it. If the camera was there, then the existence of the camera means that the planting could be recorded. But unless the footage is reviewed, it's not a contradiction. However, the Video Tape (29) is from de Killer's hideout, which he tried to recover. This suggests that the tape shows de Killer's involvement. Therefore, the Video Tape (29) contradicts Testimony 0 where de Killer claims Andrews is his client. Therefore, the pair would be {\"evidence\": 29, \"testimony\": 0}.\n\nBut the user's answer must be in the given list. The Video Tape is Evidence 29, and Testimony 0 is de Killer's first testimony.\n\nYes, I think that's the intended pair. Because if the Video Tape shows de Killer committing the murder, then his claim that Andrews is his client is a lie. Thus, Evidence 29 contradicts Testimony 0.\n\n{\"evidence\": 29, \"testimony\": 0}",

The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. We need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair, so I have to carefully check each testimony against the evidence provided.\n\nFirst, I'll start by reviewing the testimonies. Testimony 3 says that Shelly de Killer was instructed to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews. The relevant evidence here is probably the Figurine (Evidence 25), which is a wooden bear-shaped puzzle that only Corrida and Andrews know how to open. \n\nWait, if de Killer was supposed to give the figurine to Adrian, but according to Evidence 25, only Corrida and Andrews knew how to open it. But if de Killer's client told him to retrieve it, maybe the client would need to know how to open it. But the testimony says de Killer's client requested him to find the figurine and give it to Adrian. However, if the client is someone else, like maybe Matt Engarde, but how does that contradict?\n\nLooking at the testimonies: Testimony 3 mentions the client (unknown) asked de Killer to find the figurine and give it to Adrian. But Evidence 25 states that only Corrida and Andrews know how to open the figurine. If the client was someone else, like Engarde, he wouldn't know how to open it, but the client's request to retrieve it might imply they wanted the contents. However, Celeste's suicide note (Evidence 27) was inside the figurine, which talks about Engarde's misdeeds. So if Engarde was the client, he might want to get the figurine to destroy the note. But how does that connect to the testimony?\n\nWait, the testimony says de Killer's client asked him to retrieve the figurine and give it to Adrian. But according to Evidence 25, only Corrida and Andrews knew how to open it. So if de Killer's client wanted the figurine given to Adrian, maybe the client assumed Adrian could open it. But why would the client need de Killer to retrieve it if Adrian could get it herself? Alternatively, if the client was someone else, like Engarde, who wanted to get the figurine from Corrida (since Corrida is the victim), then maybe that's the connection. But how does this contradict?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the contradiction is in the fact that the figurine was in the victim's room (Corrida's) and the client (Engarde) wanted to retrieve it. But the testimony says de Killer was supposed to give it to Adrian. However, if Adrian already knows how to open it, why would the client ask de Killer to give it to her? Unless the client didn't know that Adrian could open it, but Evidence 25 says only Corrida and Andrews (Adrian) know. So if the client is someone else (like Engarde), he might not know that Adrian can open it, but de Killer's testimony mentions giving it to Adrian. Wait, but the testimony says the client instructed de Killer to give it to Adrian. So the client must have known that Adrian would need it. But if the client is Engarde, why would he want Adrian to have the figurine containing his own incriminating suicide note? That seems counterintuitive. Unless he wanted to frame Adrian or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the contradiction is in the fact that the client asked de Killer to give the figurine to Adrian, but the figurine's contents (Celeste's note) incriminate Engarde. If Engarde was the client, he would want to destroy the note, not give the figurine to Adrian. So perhaps the client's request to give the figurine to Adrian contradicts the fact that Engarde (as the likely client) wouldn't want that. But how does this relate to the evidence and testimony?\n\nWait, let's look at the details again. Testimony 3: de Killer's client asked him to retrieve the figurine and give it to Adrian. Evidence 25: the figurine can only be opened by Corrida and Adrian. So if the client wanted the figurine given to Adrian, perhaps the client is someone who knows that Adrian can open it. But if the client is Engarde, he wouldn't know that, since only Corrida and Adrian know. Unless he found out somehow. But if the client is Adrian herself, that's a possibility, but why would she hire de Killer to kill Corrida and then retrieve the figurine? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the client is someone else.\n\nWait, the magazine clipping (Evidence 11) mentions a rumor that Corrida was involved with A.A., which is Adrian Andrews. So maybe Adrian had a motive if there was a love triangle or something related to Celeste Inpax's suicide. But that's more about motive.\n\nAnother angle: The testimony says de Killer was to give the figurine to Adrian. But the figurine was found at Engarde Mansion (Evidence 26: Celeste's photo found there, and Evidence 27: suicide note inside the figurine). Wait, no. Evidence 25 says the figurine is a wooden puzzle with a hollow inside, known only by Corrida and Andrews. The suicide note (Evidence 27) was found inside the figurine. So if the figurine was in Corrida's possession, and de Killer was supposed to retrieve it and give it to Adrian, but according to Evidence 25, only Corrida and Adrian could open it. So de Killer's client wanted Adrian to have it, implying that the client knew Adrian could open it. However, the client's identity is supposed to be someone who signed the letter in a way that made de Killer think it was a man (Testimony 4: \"When I saw the name at the end of the letter, I thought my client to be a man.\"). So the client is someone male, possibly Engarde. But if Engarde was the client, why would he want to give the figurine to Adrian? Because the figurine contains evidence against him (Celeste's suicide note). So maybe Engarde wanted to retrieve the figurine to destroy it, but the testimony says the client told de Killer to give it to Adrian. That's a contradiction. Because if Engarde was the client, he would want to get the figurine to destroy the note, not give it to Adrian. Therefore, the testimony (Testimony 3) that the client wanted de Killer to give the figurine to Adrian contradicts the evidence that the figurine contains evidence against Engarde, implying that the client (Engarde) would not want that. But how does that directly tie into the evidence?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the contradiction is that de Killer's client wanted to give the figurine to Adrian, but the figurine could only be opened by her and Corrida. Therefore, the client must have known that Adrian could open it, which would imply the client is someone who knows Adrian well. But Testimony 4 says the client's name made de Killer think it was a man. If the client is Adrian, she's a woman, so that's a contradiction. But Testimony 4 says the client's name made de Killer think it was a man, so the client's name was male. If the client was Adrian, she wouldn't sign with a male name. Unless she used a pseudonym, but that's speculative. Alternatively, the client is Matt Engarde, but he wouldn't want the figurine given to Adrian because it contains evidence against him. Therefore, the testimony that the client ordered de Killer to give the figurine to Adrian contradicts the fact that the client (Engarde) would not want that. But how is this supported by evidence?\n\nLooking at Evidence 27: Celeste's suicide note inside the figurine tells of Engarde's misdeeds. So if Engarde is the client, he would want to retrieve the figurine to destroy the note, not give it to Adrian. Therefore, Testimony 3 (client wants figurine given to Adrian) contradicts the fact that Engarde, as the likely client, would want to destroy it. But how does this directly tie to the evidence? The evidence that the figurine is known only by Corrida and Andrews (Evidence 25) and that the client (presumed to be Engarde) ordered it given to Andrews. But if Engarde wanted to destroy the note, why give the figurine to Adrian? Unless he didn't know the note was there. But maybe he did. Alternatively, the client is someone else. But if the client is Adrian, then Testimony 4's mention of the client's name being male is a contradiction. So if Adrian was the client, de Killer would have thought the client was male based on the name, which contradicts. But the problem is to find a contradiction between a testimony and an evidence.\n\nAlternatively, the contradiction could be between Testimony 3 and Evidence 3. Wait, Testimony 3 says de Killer was to give the figurine to Adrian. But Evidence 25 says that only Corrida and Andrews know how to open the figurine. So if de Killer's client wanted to give the figurine to Adrian, then the client must have known that Adrian could open it, which would mean the client is either Corrida or Andrews. But Corrida is the victim, so he's dead. If the client is Andrews, then Testimony 4 says de Killer thought the client was a man, which would contradict because Adrian is female. But there's no evidence directly stating that the client is Andrews. Alternatively, the client is Engarde, who is male, but he wouldn't know how to open the figurine. So the client (Engarde) asking de Killer to give it to Andrews makes sense because he knows she can open it. Wait, but why would Engarde want to give the figurine to Andrews? Because inside is the note incriminating him. That seems illogical unless he's trying to frame her. But if that's the case, maybe that's part of his plan. However, the contradiction would be if the client (Engarde) ordered de Killer to give the figurine to Adrian, but the figurine's existence and the note inside would implicate him. But how does that directly contradict testimony and evidence?\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is that Testimony 3 claims the client ordered de Killer to give the figurine to Adrian, but Evidence 3 (Press Conference Ticket) mentions the Nickel Samurai (Engarde) is to confess something. If Engarde is the client, then he might be trying to frame Adrian by giving her the figurine with the note. But that's more of a motive rather than a direct contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 25: the figurine can only be opened by Corrida and Andrews. Testimony 3 says the client asked de Killer to retrieve it and give it to Andrews. If the client is someone else (like Engarde), he wouldn't know how to open it, but that's not a contradiction. The contradiction would arise if the client's request is impossible. For example, if de Killer was supposed to retrieve the figurine, but only Corrida and Andrews can open it. But the testimony says de Killer was to retrieve it, which he could do physically, even if he can't open it. So that's not a contradiction.\n\nWait, another angle: The suicide note (Evidence 27) was inside the figurine. If the client is Engarde, he would want to retrieve the figurine to destroy the note. But the testimony says he wanted it given to Adrian. If Adrian received it, she would open it (since she can) and find the note, which incriminates Engarde. Therefore, Engarde would not want that. Hence, Testimony 3 (client orders de Killer to give the figurine to Adrian) contradicts the fact that the client (Engarde) would not want Adrian to have the note. But how is this supported by evidence? The evidence that the figurine contains the note (Evidence 27). Therefore, if the client is Engarde, Testimony 3 contradicts because he would not want Adrian to have the note. But this is a logical deduction, not a direct contradiction between evidence and testimony.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the contradiction is that Testimony 3 says the client wanted de Killer to give the figurine to Adrian, but Evidence 25 states that the figurine can only be opened by Corrida and Andrews. If the client is someone else (like Engarde), he couldn't open it, so why would he want to give it to Adrian? Unless he wanted her to have it for some reason. But this is not a direct contradiction. The contradiction must be between a specific evidence and testimony.\n\nWait, looking back at the testimonies and evidence again. Testimony 3: client asked de Killer to give the figurine to Adrian. Evidence 25: only Corrida and Adrian can open it. The client must have known that Adrian could open it. Therefore, the client is either Corrida or Adrian. But Corrida is the victim, so he's dead. If the client is Adrian, then Testimony 4 says de Killer thought the client was a man (since the name at the end of the letter made him think so). Therefore, if the client is Adrian, but she used a male name, that's possible, but there's no evidence she did. However, Evidence 11 (the magazine clipping) says that Juan Corrida was linked to A.A. (Adrian Andrews). If Adrian was the client, and she signed with a male name to trick de Killer, that's possible. But the contradiction would be between Testimony 4 (client's name implied male) and the fact that the client is female (Adrian). But how does this tie into the evidence? The user is asking for a contradiction between evidence and testimony.\n\nAlternatively, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record the victim's room. The Video Tape (Evidence 29) from de Killer's hideout might show something. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another angle: The Figurine (Evidence 25) is covered in many thin cuts. If de Killer was supposed to retrieve it, but the client's instruction was to give it to Adrian, but the only people who can open it are Corrida and Adrian. If the client was not either of them, then they can't open it. But Testimony 3 doesn't mention opening it, just retrieving and giving it. So no contradiction there.\n\nHmm. Maybe the Pistol (Evidence 28) is connected. But Testimony 3 is about the figurine. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at the testimonies again:\n\nTestimony 0: de Killer took the request by mail.\n\nTestimony 1: Sometimes he takes jobs without meeting the client.\n\nTestimony 2: The job was to kill Corrida and other small things.\n\nTestimony 3: One of those was to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian.\n\nTestimony 4: The client's name made de Killer think it was a man.\n\nSo the client is presumably a man, based on Testimony 4. If the client is male, then it's likely Matt Engarde. Now, the Figurine (Evidence 25) is something that only Corrida and Adrian can open. If Engarde wanted to get the figurine to Adrian, that suggests he wanted her to have it. But inside is Celeste's suicide note incriminating him. That's contradictory. So why would Engarde want Adrian to have the note that exposes him? Unless he was being forced or it's part of a plan. But if that's the case, then Testimony 3 (client asked to give figurine to Adrian) and the content of the figurine (Evidence 27) would contradict if the client is Engarde. But how does this tie into evidence?\n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is that the client (Engarde) ordered de Killer to give the figurine to Adrian, but the figurine's contents (Evidence 27) would incriminate him, so he wouldn't want that. Therefore, Testimony 3 and Evidence 27 contradict each other. But the user asked for evidence and testimony numbers. Evidence 27 is the suicide note inside the figurine.\n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 25. Because Testimony 3 says the client wanted de Killer to give the figurine to Adrian, but Evidence 25 says only Corrida and Adrian can open it. If the client is Engarde, he wouldn't know how to open it, but that's not a contradiction. The contradiction would be if the client is someone who couldn't know that Adrian can open it. But Testimony 3 just states the client wanted to give it to her; it doesn't mention opening. So maybe not.\n\nWait, another angle: The client ordered de Killer to give the figurine to Adrian, but the figurine was already in the possession of Corrida (since it was in his room, perhaps). So de Killer had to take it from Corrida and give it to Adrian. But if Corrida is dead (murdered by de Killer as per Testimony 2), then de Killer could take it. But how does that contradict?\n\nAlternatively, the Magazine Clipping (Evidence 11) says that Corrida was linked to A.A. (Adrian Andrews). If Adrian was involved with Corrida, maybe she wanted the figurine. But if the client is Engarde, why would he want her to have it? Maybe to frame her. But the figurine contains his own incriminating evidence. That's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 3 (Press Conference Ticket). If Engarde was going to confess, but he hired de Killer to kill Corrida, then the confession might be related. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the key here is to find a direct contradiction. For example, a testimony says X, but evidence proves X is impossible.\n\nTestimony 3: de Killer's client instructed him to give the figurine to Adrian.\n\nEvidence 25: the figurine can only be opened by Corrida and Adrian.\n\nIf the client is someone other than Corrida or Adrian, they couldn't open it, but the client's instruction was to give it to Adrian, who can open it. That's not a contradiction. But perhaps the fact that the client instructed de Killer to give it to Adrian suggests the client knew she could open it, implying the client is someone who knows that, which would be Corrida or Adrian. But Testimony 4 says the client's name made de Killer think it was a man, so the client can't be Adrian. If the client is Corrida, but he's the victim, so he's dead. Therefore, the client can't be Corrida. Therefore, the contradiction is that the client must be a man (per Testimony 4), but only Adrian and Corrida knew how to open the figurine. So if the client is a man, he couldn't have known that Adrian can open it unless he was told. But there's no evidence that the client was told. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (client wants figurine given to Adrian) and Evidence 25 (only Corrida and Adrian can open it), implying the client must have known Adrian could open it, but the client is a man (Testimony 4), which is possible if the client is someone who knows Adrian, like Engarde. But that's not a direct contradiction. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 24: Engarde bought a stuffed bear identical to the one in evidence (the spy camera bear, Evidence 23). The stuffed bear had a spy camera. The receipt (Evidence 24) shows Engarde bought it. So Engarde was spying on Corrida. If Engarde is the client, he had access to the spy camera footage. But how does this relate to Testimony 3?\n\nWait, the spy camera (Evidence 21) was set to record from 8 PM. The murder was at 8:15 PM. The Video Tape (Evidence 29) from de Killer's hideout might have the footage. If Engarde is the client, he could have used the spy camera to monitor Corrida's room. But this doesn't directly contradict any testimony.\n\nAnother angle: The Figurine (Evidence 25) is covered in thin cuts. The Suicide Note (Evidence 27) was inside. Celeste's note incriminates Engarde. So if the figurine was given to Adrian, she would find the note and use it against Engarde. Therefore, if Engarde is the client, why would he want that? Thus, the testimony that the client (Engarde) ordered de Killer to give the figurine to Adrian contradicts the fact that the note inside would harm him. But this is a logical contradiction, not directly between evidence and testimony.\n\nBut the user wants a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. The most likely pair is Testimony 3 (client wanted to give the figurine to Adrian) and Evidence 25 (only Corrida and Adrian can open it). The contradiction here is that if the client is a man (as per Testimony 4), then he couldn't have known how to open the figurine unless he was told by Adrian or Corrida. But if the client is Engarde, he could have known through Celeste's note, but that's speculative. \n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is that the client instructed de Killer to give the figurine to Adrian, but according to Evidence 25, only Adrian and Corrida can open it. Therefore, the client must have known that Adrian could open it, implying the client is either Corrida or Adrian. But since Corrida is dead and the client is a man (Testimony 4), it's impossible. Therefore, the client cannot exist, leading to a contradiction between Testimony 3 and Evidence 25.\n\nYes, this makes sense. Testimony 3 says the client wanted de Killer to give the figurine to Adrian. But Evidence 25 states that only Corrida and Adrian can open it. Therefore, the client must be either Corrida or Adrian to know that Adrian can open it. However, Testimony 4 indicates the client is a man, so it can't be Adrian. And Corrida is the victim, so he couldn't have hired de Killer to kill himself. Thus, the client's request as per Testimony 3 is impossible given Evidence 25 and Testimony 4. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 25.\n\n{\"evidence\": 25, \"testimony\": 3}",

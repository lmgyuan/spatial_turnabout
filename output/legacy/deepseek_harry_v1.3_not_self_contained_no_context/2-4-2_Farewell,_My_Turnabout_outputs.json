You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair. Let me start by going through the testimonies and the evidences.\n\nLooking at the testimonies from Gumshoe (Testimonies 0 to 5). Testimony 3 says the Jammin' Ninja's button was found in Engarde's hakama. The corresponding evidence here is Evidence 16, which is the Jammin' Ninja's Button. The testimony states that the button was ripped from the victim's costume and found in Engarde's hakama.\n\nWait, but the evidence says the button is covered in Corrida's blood. If the button was ripped off during a struggle, the blood would imply that Corrida was bleeding when the button was torn. However, the autopsy report (Evidence 14) says the cause of death was strangulation first, then stabbing. So Corrida was strangled to death, which might not cause external bleeding, then stabbed. The blood on the button could be from the stabbing. But when the button was ripped off, maybe during a struggle before the stabbing? Hmm, maybe not a direct contradiction here.\n\nLooking for other contradictions. Let's check the knife. Testimony 4 and 5 mention that Engarde's fingerprints are on the knife, which is evidence 15. But according to the autopsy, the cause of death was strangulation, not the stabbing. So the stabbing was post-mortem. If the knife was used after death, then Engarde's fingerprints on the knife wouldn't necessarily mean he's the killer. But that's more about the cause of death vs. the evidence, not directly contradicting testimony.\n\nWait, the guitar case (Evidence 7) has water on the lid. The crime photo (Evidence 9) mentions a smashed vase with water on the carpet. The guitar case's water might be from the vase. But how does that relate to testimonies?\n\nAnother angle: The Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record the room from 8 PM. The time of death was 8:15 PM. The camera would have recorded the murder. But if the footage was transmitted (Evidence 22), maybe someone else was involved. However, the testimonies from Gumshoe point to Engarde based on the button and knife. If the camera's footage could show someone else, that would contradict the testimonies. But the evidence isn't presented as video tape contents, just the camera existing.\n\nWait, the Video Tape (Evidence 29) was retrieved from De Killer's hideout. If the video shows De Killer, that would contradict Engarde's guilt. But the user hasn't provided the contents, so maybe not.\n\nLooking back at the button. Testimony 3 says the button was found in Engarde's hakama. But maybe the button was planted. The Guitar Case (Evidence 7) only has Corrida's fingerprints. If the button was ripped off, why is it in Engarde's clothing? If the murder happened in Corrida's room, how did the button get there? Maybe if Engarde wasn't present, but the button was placed there. But how does that contradict the testimony? The testimony is just stating where the button was found. The contradiction might come from another evidence.\n\nWait, the knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but the autopsy says death was by strangulation. So the knife wasn't the murder weapon. That could contradict Testimony 5, which says the knife was bought for a premeditated murder. If the actual cause of death was strangulation, then the knife was used post-mortem, so buying it for the crime would be irrelevant. But the testimony says \"the defendant bought the knife for the crime... premeditated murder.\" So if the knife wasn't the murder weapon, then buying it for the crime would be incorrect. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (claiming the knife was the murder weapon) and the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) stating the cause was strangulation. But the user asked for evidence and testimony contradicting each other. So Evidence 14 (Autopsy Report) contradicts Testimony 5 (Gumshoe's testimony that the knife was used for premeditated murder). But in the options, the answer should be one pair. Let's check the indices. Evidence 14 is Juan's Autopsy Report (index 14), and Testimony 5 is Gumshoe's Testimony 5. So {\"evidence\":14, \"testimony\":5} would be the pair. However, the user provided the list of testimonies and evidences. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, the knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but the actual murder was by strangulation. So the knife's fingerprints don't prove he committed the murder. But Gumshoe's testimony 5 says the defendant bought the knife for the crime, which would be a premeditated murder. However, if the murder wasn't committed with the knife, then the knife's purchase isn't directly related to the murder. So the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) contradicts Testimony 5, because the cause of death wasn't the stabbing. So that's a contradiction. But is there another contradiction?\n\nAnother possibility: The Security Lady (Character 3) is Wendy Oldbag, and the Autograph (Evidence 10) is addressed to \"Wendy\". So maybe she had a connection to the victim, but not sure how that contradicts testimony.\n\nAlternatively, the Jammin' Ninja's button (Evidence 16) being found in Engarde's hakama (Testimony 3). If the crime was committed by someone else, like De Killer, then how did the button get there? Maybe the button was planted. But unless there's evidence that contradicts the button's presence, like the Spy Camera footage showing someone else, but the Spy Camera's evidence isn't directly mentioned in testimonies.\n\nWait, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording during the murder. If the footage shows someone else, like De Killer, that would contradict the testimony that Engarde did it. But since the Video Tape (29) is retrieved and De Killer tried to recover it, maybe the video shows the real killer. However, without knowing the contents, it's hard to use that. But the user might expect that the existence of the spy camera's footage (which wasn't mentioned in the testimonies) contradicts the testimonies. But I need to stick to the given evidence and testimony.\n\nBack to the original thought: The Autopsy Report (14) states that the cause of death was strangulation, not the stabbing. Therefore, the knife with Engarde's fingerprints (Evidence 15) and Testimony 5 (Gumshoe claiming premeditated murder with the knife) would be contradicted by the Autopsy Report. But the question is which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So Evidence 14 contradicts Testimony 5. Let me check the indices again.\n\nEvidence 14 is Juan's Autopsy Report. Testimony 5 is Gumshoe's testimony that Engarde bought the knife for the crime as premeditated murder. However, since the actual murder was via strangulation, the knife purchase isn't directly linked to the murder. Hence, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) contradicts Testimony 5 (about the knife being the murder weapon). So the answer would be evidence 14 and testimony 5. But looking at the options, the user might have a different answer. Alternatively, maybe another pair.\n\nWait, the Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but according to the Autopsy, the stabbing was post-mortem. So even if Engarde's prints are on the knife, he might have stabbed the body after death. That doesn't necessarily contradict the testimony that he bought the knife for the crime. But the testimony says it's premeditated, which would require the knife to be part of the murder. However, the actual cause of death was strangulation, so the knife wasn't the murder weapon. Therefore, Testimony 5 (knife used for premeditated murder) is contradicted by Evidence 14 (strangulation as cause). So the pair is Evidence 14 and Testimony 5. But I need to check if this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Testimony 3: The button was found in Engarde's hakama. The button is from the victim's costume. But the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has water on top, and the crime photo (Evidence 9) shows a smashed vase with water. If the button was in Engarde's hakama, but he wasn't present at the scene, how did it get there? Maybe the water from the vase caused something. Not sure. Alternatively, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) would have recorded the killer. If the camera was in the room, but the testimony says Engarde's button was found, but the camera might show someone else. But again, the video's contents are unknown.\n\nAnother angle: The murder happened at 8:15 PM. The Spy Camera was set to record from 8 PM. So the murder should be on tape. If the camera was set by Engarde (as he bought the stuffed bear in Evidence 24), then maybe the video would show the real killer, but the testimonies point to Engarde. However, without the video content, this is speculation.\n\nAlternatively, the Figurine (Evidence 25) has Celeste's suicide note (Evidence 27) which tells of Engarde's misdeeds. This could provide motive for someone else (like Adrian Andrews) to kill Corrida. But how does that contradict the testimonies?\n\nLooking back, the main contradiction seems to be the Autopsy Report (14) stating death by strangulation, which means the knife was used post-mortem. Therefore, the knife's fingerprints (Evidence 15) and the testimony about the knife being the murder weapon (Testimony 5) would be contradicted by the autopsy. So Evidence 14 contradicts Testimony 5. Therefore, the answer should be {\"evidence\":14, \"testimony\":5}.\n\nBut let me check other possibilities. Testimony 3 says the button was found in Engarde's hakama. The button is covered in blood (Evidence 16). If the victim was strangled first, then stabbed, the blood would come from the stabbing. So the button could have been torn during the stabbing. But if Engarde wasn't present, how did the button get into his hakama? Maybe planted. But where's the evidence contradicting that?\n\nAlternatively, the Security Lady (Wendy Oldbag) has an autograph from Corrida (Evidence 10). If she was in the area, but not mentioned in the testimonies. Not sure.\n\nWait, the Pistol (Evidence 28) is connected to De Killer, who is the assassin. If De Killer did the murder, then the testimonies about Engarde would be wrong. But the testimonies don't mention De Killer. The contradiction here would be between the Pistol (if it's linked to the murder) and the testimonies pointing to Engarde. But without more info, hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, the Transmitter (Evidence 22) and Spy Camera (21) suggest that the footage was transmitted. If Engarde was watching, but he's the killer, why would he record himself? But again, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the Guitar Case (7) has Corrida's fingerprints. If he was already dead when stabbed, then the case being there with his prints is normal. Not sure.\n\nHmm. The most solid contradiction is between the Autopsy Report (14) stating death by strangulation, and Testimony 5 claiming the knife was bought for the murder (premeditated). Since the knife wasn't the cause of death, the testimony's assertion that the knife purchase indicates premeditation for murder is contradicted. So Evidence 14 and Testimony 5. Therefore, the answer should be evidence 14 and testimony 5.\n\n{\"evidence\": 14, \"testimony\": 5}",

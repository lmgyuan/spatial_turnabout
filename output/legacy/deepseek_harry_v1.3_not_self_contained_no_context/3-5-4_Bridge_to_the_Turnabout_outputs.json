    "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidence, and testimonies. Let me start by going through the testimonies and checking each against the evidence.\n\nTestimony 6 by Iris says, \"By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.\" Let me check the evidence related to weather. Evidence 7 is the Weather Data, which mentions that snow was from 7 PM to around 10:50 PM, and the murder happened between 10-11 PM according to the autopsy report (Evidence 11). If the murder was at 10:45 PM when the lightning struck Dusky Bridge, then according to the weather data, the snow stopped around 10:50 PM. But the murder's time is between 10-11 PM. If Iris claims the snow had already stopped when the murder took place, but the snow actually stopped around 10:50, then if the murder was at 10:45, the snow was still ongoing. Wait, the snow ended at 10:50, and the lightning was until 11 PM. The murder's exact time is within 10-11 PM. The autopsy report says the time of death was between 10 and 11 PM. The lightning struck the bridge at 10:45. The fire from the bridge took 30 minutes to go out. So if the murder happened around the time of the lightning strike (10:45), the snow was still falling until 10:50. So Iris's Testimony 6 says the snow had stopped when the murder took place, but the weather data shows that snow was still ongoing until 10:50. So if the murder occurred before 10:50, which it did at 10:45, the snow hadn't stopped yet. That's a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 7 (Weather Data) contradicts Testimony 6 (Iris's claim that snow had stopped during the murder).\n\n{\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 6}",

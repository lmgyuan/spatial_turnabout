You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by looking at the given testimonies and evidences.\n\nThe testimonies are all from Sorin Sprocket (Character 8). Let's list them out:\n\nTestimony 0: \"The truth is, I went to the vista deck with Pierce.\"\nTestimony 1: \"Pierce heard the commotion, and he came running.\"\nTestimony 2: \"That's why my name doesn't appear on the hold entry record.\"\nTestimony 3: \"I was badly injured from being stabbed, but I was frantic.\"\nTestimony 4: \"The knife wound is quite deep, and continues to throb with pain.\"\nTestimony 5: \"By the time we reached the scene, it was all over.\"\n\nNow, looking at the evidences. Let's see which ones could relate to these statements. \n\nTestimony 3 and 4 mention Sorin being stabbed with a deep wound. But looking at the autopsy report (Evidence 14), the victim (Gloomsbury) was hit twice on the head with the Time Keeper. There's no mention of a stabbing elsewhere. Wait, but Sorin is claiming he was stabbed. However, the autopsy report doesn't mention any stab wounds on the victim, but Sorin is the one with the stab wound. But maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 2 says Sorin's name isn't on the hold entry record (Evidence 15). The hold entry record lists key cards used. If Sorin claims his name isn't there, but maybe there's evidence that he was in the hold. For example, Evidence 13 is a photo of the hold taken by Larry, where Ellen is seen. If Sorin was in the hold but his key card isn't recorded, but then how did he get in? But Testimony 2 says his name isn't there, so maybe that's not a contradiction unless there's evidence he was there.\n\nWait, Testimony 3: Sorin says he was stabbed. But the evidence related to bloodstains: Evidence 16 (lift bloodstain) and 17 (candelabra with Gloomsbury's fingerprints and blood). The blood on the candelabra matches the lift. But if Sorin was stabbed and bleeding, maybe his blood would be present. However, the candelabra has Gloomsbury's blood (since he was the victim). But Sorin's testimony about being stabbed might not align with the available evidence. Wait, the Autopsy Report (14) says the victim was hit on the head, not stabbed. So if Sorin claims he was stabbed, but the only injuries mentioned in the evidence are the victim's head wounds, then perhaps there's a contradiction here. Because there's no evidence of a knife or stabbing related to the victim's death. So Sorin's testimony about a knife wound (Testimony 3 and 4) might not be supported by the evidence. The murder weapon is the Time Keeper (Evidence 4), which is a clock used to hit the victim. So if Sorin claims he was stabbed, but the only weapon involved is the Time Keeper, which is a blunt object, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 3 (or 4) would contradict Evidence 14 (Autopsy Report) which states the victim's cause of death was head trauma from the Time Keeper, not a stabbing. However, Sorin is talking about his own injury, not the victim's. Wait, but the question is about contradictions between a testimony and evidence. So Sorin's testimony about being stabbed (Testimony 3) might be contradicted by the lack of evidence of a stabbing weapon. But the evidences include the Time Keeper as the murder weapon, which is a clock, not a knife. The knife wound that Sorin claims to have would require a knife, but there's no evidence of such a weapon. Unless the knife is part of another evidence. Let's check the evidences again.\n\nLooking through the list of evidences, the murder weapon is the Time Keeper (Evidence 4). There's no mention of a knife. The only other weapon-like evidence is the candelabra (Evidence 17), but that's related to the victim's fingerprints and blood. So if Sorin says he was stabbed with a knife, but there's no evidence of a knife being involved, that could be a contradiction. But is there any evidence that directly contradicts his claim? For example, if there's evidence that he couldn't have been stabbed, or that the wound is fake. Alternatively, perhaps the Autopsy Report (14) only mentions the victim's injuries, not Sorin's. But Sorin's stab wound could be real, but unrelated to the murder. However, the question is to find a contradiction between a testimony and evidence. Let me check Testimony 3: \"I was badly injured from being stabbed, but I was frantic.\" The corresponding evidence that might contradict this could be the Autopsy Report (14) which only discusses the victim's injuries (head trauma), but that's about the victim, not Sorin. Alternatively, maybe the bloodstains. Evidence 16 (lift bloodstain) and 17 (candelabra) have blood that matches. If Sorin's blood was present, but the blood found is from the victim (since the candelabra has the victim's fingerprints and blood), then Sorin's claim of being stabbed and bleeding might not align with the blood evidence. However, if Sorin's blood is not found where he claims to have been injured, that could be a contradiction. But there's no evidence stating that the blood is his. Alternatively, looking at Evidence 5 (Broken Lantern) has a bloodstain on the inside wheel handle, as if someone gripped it with a bloody hand. If Sorin was stabbed and bleeding, he might have left blood there. But in Testimony 3, he claims to have been stabbed and frantic. If his name isn't on the hold entry record (Testimony 2), but the photo of the hold (Evidence 13) shows Ellen, maybe Sorin wasn't there. Alternatively, maybe another point.\n\nWait, Testimony 0 says Sorin went to the vista deck with Pierce. Evidence 2 is Ellen's Statement, which states she saw a suspicious third party on the vista deck when attacked by Gloomsbury. If Sorin and Pierce were there, Ellen might have seen them. But Ellen's Statement says she saw a third party, which could be Sorin and Pierce. So maybe that's not a contradiction. Alternatively, Testimony 2: Sorin's name isn't on the hold entry record (Evidence 15). But if there's a photo of the hold (Evidence 13) that shows Sorin there, that would contradict. But Evidence 13's description says Ellen is seen near the center. So unless Sorin is in the photo too, but the description doesn't mention that. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3: Sorin claims he was stabbed, but the murder weapon is the Time Keeper, a clock. There's no knife mentioned. So if Sorin was stabbed, where's the knife? The only possible knife-related evidence is not present. Thus, his testimony about a stabbing is contradicted by the lack of evidence of a stabbing weapon, while the murder was committed with the Time Keeper. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Sorin's stabbing) and Evidence 14 (Autopsy Report stating the victim was killed by the Time Keeper, not a stabbing). Wait, but Sorin's stabbing is his own injury, not the victim's. The autopsy is about the victim. So maybe Sorin's stabbing is a lie because there's no evidence of a knife. But the evidence list doesn't include a knife. So the contradiction could be that Sorin claims to have a stab wound, but the murder weapon is a clock, implying that there's no knife involved, hence his injury is fabricated. Therefore, Testimony 3 is contradicted by Evidence 4 (Time Keeper being the murder weapon, not a knife). But Evidence 4 is about the murder weapon used on the victim, not necessarily on Sorin. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the bloodstain on the lantern's handle (Evidence 5) is from someone with a bloody hand. If Sorin was stabbed and bleeding, he might have left that blood. But the blood on the candelabra and lift (Evidence 16 and 17) matches, which might be the victim's. If Sorin's blood isn't found, that could mean he wasn't actually injured. But the problem is that the evidence doesn't mention Sorin's blood. So perhaps the contradiction is between Sorin's Testimony 3 (being stabbed) and the lack of any evidence supporting a stabbing (no knife, no blood from Sorin). However, the question requires a specific evidence and testimony pair. Another angle: Testimony 3 says he was stabbed, but the Autopsy Report (14) says the victim was killed by two hits to the head. If Sorin is claiming he was stabbed by the same attacker, but the murder weapon doesn't align. But maybe the attacker used the Time Keeper on the victim and a knife on Sorin. But there's no evidence of a knife. Therefore, Sorin's testimony about being stabbed is contradicted by the absence of a knife in the evidences, implying he's lying. So the contradiction would be Testimony 3 (stabbed) and Evidence 14 (murder weapon is Time Keeper, which isn't a stabbing weapon). But the Autopsy Report is about the victim, not Sorin. Alternatively, maybe Testimony 3 is contradicted by the Business Card Wallet (Evidence 9), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the Fog Machine (Evidence 8) and Photo of Reception (10) show fog, but how does that relate? Maybe not. Let me check other evidences.\n\nWait, Evidence 14: Autopsy Report says Gloomsbury's head was hit twice with the Time Keeper. So the victim's cause of death is blunt force trauma. Sorin's testimony about being stabbed (Testimony 3 and 4) is about his own injury. If Sorin's injury is real, there should be evidence of a knife or his blood somewhere. But the only blood evidence is in the lantern's handle (Evidence 5), which is from someone gripping it with a bloody hand. If Sorin was stabbed, he might have bled there, but the bloodstain on the lantern is on the inside wheel handle. The bloodstain on the lift (16) matches the candelabra (17), which has the victim's fingerprints. So that blood is likely the victim's. Therefore, if Sorin was stabbed and bleeding, there's no evidence of his blood, which contradicts his testimony. But which evidence directly contradicts his testimony? The lack of a knife or his blood. However, the problem is that the user wants a specific evidence and testimony pair. Maybe the contradiction is between Sorin's claim of being stabbed (Testimony 3) and the Autopsy Report (14) which doesn't mention any stabbing, implying that Sorin's injury is unrelated or fabricated. But the Autopsy Report is about the victim, not Sorin. Alternatively, maybe the Business Card Wallet (Evidence 9) has a suspicious imprint that could relate to a knife, but the description doesn't specify. Alternatively, the Key of Love (20) is used to activate the Time Keeper. Not sure. \n\nWait, another angle: Sorin's Testimony 2 says his name isn't on the hold entry record (Evidence 15). The hold entry record lists key cards used. If Larry took a photo of the hold (Evidence 13) that shows Ellen, but if Sorin was in the hold, his key card should be in the record. But Testimony 2 says his name isn't there. However, the photo only shows Ellen, not necessarily Sorin. So that's not a direct contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, Testimony 0: Sorin went to the vista deck with Pierce. Ellen's Statement (Evidence 2) says she saw a suspicious third party on the vista deck when attacked. If Sorin and Pierce were there, Ellen would have seen them, but her statement refers to a third party. If Sorin and Pierce are the third party, maybe that's not a contradiction. Or perhaps Ellen's statement implies someone else was there. But this is speculative.\n\nWait, the main contradiction I can see is Sorin's claim of being stabbed (Testimony 3 and 4) but the murder weapon is a clock (Evidence 4) and the victim's injuries are from that. So if Sorin was stabbed, there's a separate weapon involved, but no evidence of it. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Sorin's stabbing) and the lack of evidence of a stabbing weapon. However, the user wants a specific evidence number. The only evidence related to the murder weapon is Evidence 4 (Time Keeper), which is the murder weapon. So Sorin's testimony about a stabbing contradicts the fact that the murder weapon was a clock, implying that Sorin's injury is unrelated or fabricated. Thus, the pair would be Testimony 3 (Sorin's stabbing) and Evidence 4 (Time Keeper as murder weapon). But Evidence 4's description says it's the murder weapon used on the victim, so Sorin's injury could be from another source. However, since there's no evidence of another weapon, perhaps this is a contradiction. Alternatively, the Autopsy Report (14) doesn't mention any stabbing, but that's about the victim. So perhaps the correct contradiction is between Sorin's Testimony 3 and the Autopsy Report (14), but the autopsy report is about the victim's injuries, not Sorin's. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Business Card Wallet (Evidence 9) has an imprint that matches the Time Keeper's key (Evidence 20), implying that Sorin had access to activate the Time Keeper, which could contradict his testimony about being elsewhere. Not sure. \n\nWait, Testimony 3: Sorin says he was stabbed, but Evidence 5 (Broken Lantern) has a bloodstain on the inside wheel handle. If Sorin's blood is there, but the bloodstain is from the victim (since the victim was in the lantern), then Sorin's claim of being stabbed and bleeding might not hold. However, the bloodstain on the lantern is from someone gripping it with a bloody hand. If the victim was placed inside after being killed, maybe the bloodstain is from the killer. But if Sorin's blood is not there, his testimony about being injured might be false. But without knowing whose blood it is, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother angle: Testimony 3 says Sorin was stabbed and frantic. The Broken Lantern (Evidence 5) was wheeled by Larry from the hold to the reception hall. If Sorin was injured, he might have left blood in the hold or elsewhere. The bloodstain on the lift (Evidence 16) matches the candelabra (17), which has the victim's fingerprints. So that's the victim's blood. Therefore, Sorin's claim of being stabbed and bleeding isn't supported by any evidence, implying he's lying. The contradiction would be between Testimony 3 and the lack of evidence of his blood, but which specific evidence contradicts it? Since there's no evidence directly stating that there's no blood from Sorin, perhaps the answer lies elsewhere.\n\nWait, Sorin's Notebook (Evidence 18) has a torn-out page. If Sorin's notebook is supposed to detail everything, but a page is missing, that could indicate he's hiding something. But how does that contradict his testimony? Maybe the torn page would have shown he was elsewhere, contradicting his alibi, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the Fog Machine (Evidence 8) and Photo of Reception (10) show the hall was foggy. If Sorin claims to have been somewhere, but the fog obscured visibility, that might affect testimonies. But not directly a contradiction.\n\nHmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to summarize:\n\nPossible contradictions:\n\n1. Sorin's Testimony 3 (stabbed) vs. Evidence 4 (murder weapon is Time Keeper, not a knife). But this is about the victim's murder weapon. Sorin's injury could be from a different incident.\n\n2. Sorin's Testimony 2 (name not on hold entry) vs. Evidence 13 (photo of hold with Ellen). If Sorin was in the hold but his key wasn't used, but the photo doesn't show him, so no contradiction.\n\n3. Testimony 0 (Sorin and Pierce on vista deck) vs. Evidence 2 (Ellen saw a third party there). If Ellen saw them, but they claim to be there, maybe no contradiction. Unless Ellen's statement says she saw someone else, but the evidence says \"suspicious third party\", which could be them.\n\nWait, Ellen's Statement (Evidence 2): She saw a suspicious third party on the vista deck when attacked by Gloomsbury. If Sorin and Pierce were there (as per Testimony 0), then Ellen's statement would align with that. So no contradiction.\n\nAnother angle: The Hold Entry Record (Evidence 15) lists key cards used. Testimony 2 says Sorin's name isn't there. If Sorin needed to access the hold but his key wasn't used, that might relate to another evidence. The Photo of Hold (13) shows Ellen, but maybe Sorin used someone else's key. Not directly a contradiction.\n\nWait, going back to the stab wound. If Sorin claims to have a deep knife wound (Testimony 3 and 4), but the only blood evidence is from the victim (on candelabra and lift), and the murder weapon is a clock, perhaps Sorin is lying about being stabbed to cover something up. The contradiction here is that there's no evidence of a knife or his blood, which would support his claim. But since the question asks for a pair of evidence and testimony that directly contradict each other, maybe the answer is Testimony 3 and Evidence 14 (Autopsy Report), but the autopsy is about the victim. Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and the lack of a knife in the evidence list. But the user wants an evidence number. The only evidence that could contradict is the Autopsy Report (14) which states the victim's cause of death, but not directly related to Sorin's injury.\n\nAlternatively, the Business Card Wallet (Evidence 9) has a suspicious imprint. If the imprint is from the Time Keeper's key, and Sorin had access to it, but he claims to be injured, maybe that's a contradiction. Not sure.\n\nWait, the Key of Love (20) is used to activate the Time Keeper. If Sorin had this key, but his notebook (18) has a torn page, maybe he's involved. But how does that contradict his testimony?\n\nAlternatively, the Candelabra (17) has Gloomsbury's left-hand fingerprints (he's right-handed according to Gloomsbury's Note 7, which says the note was written by a right-handed person but the candelabra has left-hand prints. Wait, wait: Evidence 7 (Gloomsbury's Note) says the writing is smudged as if written by a right-handed person. But Evidence 17 says the candelabra has Gloomsbury's left hand fingerprints, which is his dominant hand. So there's a contradiction there about Gloomsbury's handedness. But that's between Evidence 7 and 17, not involving the testimonies.\n\nBut the question is about a testimony and evidence contradiction. Let me focus again.\n\nSorin's Testimony 3: \"I was badly injured from being stabbed, but I was frantic.\" If he was stabbed, he would have bled. The Broken Lantern (Evidence 5) has a bloodstain on the inside wheel handle. If that blood is Sorin's, then his testimony is supported. But if the blood is the victim's, then maybe not. However, the Autopsy Report (14) says the victim was hit on the head, so the blood on the lantern handle could be from the victim. But how would the victim's blood get there? The victim was inside the lantern. The handle's bloodstain is from someone gripping it, perhaps the killer moving the lantern. If the killer had the victim's blood on their hands, that's possible. But if Sorin's testimony about being stabbed is true, his blood should be somewhere else. Since there's no evidence of his blood, his testimony might be contradicted by the absence of supporting evidence. However, the user requires a specific evidence number that directly contradicts the testimony. The only evidence that could relate to Sorin's injury is if there's evidence that he couldn't have been stabbed, but I don't see that.\n\nAlternatively, Sorin's Testimony 3 says he was stabbed, but in Testimony 0 he says he was on the vista deck with Pierce. If the timeline doesn't add up, but that's between testimonies, not evidence.\n\nWait, another thought. The Time Keeper (Evidence 4) requires the Key of Love (20) to activate. If Sorin had the key, but his testimony about being stabbed distracts from that. Not sure.\n\nWait, the key contradiction I think is between Sorin's testimony about being stabbed (Testimony 3) and the lack of any evidence supporting a stabbing (no knife, no blood from Sorin). But which evidence specifically contradicts this? The Autopsy Report (14) only addresses the victim's cause of death. The murder weapon (Evidence 4) is the Time Keeper, which is a clock, not a knife. Therefore, the presence of the Time Keeper as the murder weapon contradicts Sorin's claim of being stabbed, implying that there was no knife involved in the crime, and thus his injury is fabricated. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 4.\n\nBut Evidence 4 is the murder weapon used on the victim. Sorin's injury is separate. So maybe the contradiction is that if Sorin was stabbed, there should be a knife, but the only weapon is the Time Keeper. Therefore, his testimony about a stabbing is contradicted by the lack of a knife in the evidence, with the murder weapon being the Time Keeper. Thus, Evidence 4 (Time Keeper) contradicts Testimony 3 (stabbed), implying that the stabbing is a lie.\n\n{\"evidence\": 4, \"testimony\": 3}",

Evidence 5 (Ringmaster's Papers) and Testimony 5 (Trilo's testimony about the proposal) contradict each other. The papers indicate that Max's salary was negotiated a week ago, while Trilo's testimony states that he was waiting for Regina to come back to the lodging house to propose to her on the night of the murder. However, Trilo's testimony does not mention Max's salary negotiations, which is a crucial point in the case. This contradiction suggests that Trilo may be hiding something or not telling the whole truth.

Evidence 11 (Russell's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 3 (Moe's testimony about the silhouette) contradict each other. The autopsy report states that the time of death was 10:15 PM, but Moe's testimony implies that the Ringmaster was already dead when he looked out the window, which was before 10:15 PM.

Evidence 4 (Max G. Promo Poster) and Testimony 0 (Moe's testimony about the silhouette) contradict each other. The poster shows Max's three famous symbols, including white roses, but Moe testified that he did not see the white roses on the person he saw at the crime scene.

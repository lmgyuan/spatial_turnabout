The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the "Van" evidence and testimony 3, "I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me." This is because the van evidence suggests that Vasquez was driven to Studio One in a van, but testimony 3 implies that she was taken to Studio One by Sal, without specifying the mode of transportation. However, this is not a strong contradiction.

A stronger contradiction is between the "Mr. Monkey's Head" evidence and testimony 2, "There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One." The evidence suggests that the path to Studio One was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM, but Vasquez's testimony implies that they went to Studio One after the meeting, which ended at 4:00 PM. This is not a direct contradiction, but it raises questions about the timing of their trip to Studio One.

However, a more direct contradiction is between the "Van" evidence and testimony 2, "There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One." The evidence suggests that Manella used the van to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer, but Vasquez's testimony implies that they went to Studio One for a rehearsal, which suggests that they may have walked or taken a different route.

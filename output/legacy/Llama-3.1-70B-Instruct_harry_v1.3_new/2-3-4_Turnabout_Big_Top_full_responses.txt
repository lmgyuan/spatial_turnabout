Evidence 2 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 5 (Acro's testimony about the bust) contradict each other. The crime photo shows the victim's footprints at the scene, but Acro testified that he could not have known the location of the Ringmaster's head to drop the bust on him. However, the crime photo suggests that Acro must have had some knowledge of the Ringmaster's location to commit the crime.

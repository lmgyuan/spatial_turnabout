The testimony of Jean Armstrong, stating that there were no other customers in the restaurant, contradicts with the evidence of the Crime Photo, which shows an empty table, but also another table with a vase and a coffee cup, suggesting that there might have been another person in the restaurant.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Sports Paper and the Tiger's alibi testimony. 

The Sports Paper has a doodle with the name "MC Bomber" and an arrow pointing to "100,000" that was crossed out, along with "Ahahahaha" and a laughing face. This suggests that the person who drew the doodle, likely the victim or someone involved in the case, was involved in something related to "MC Bomber" and a large sum of money. 

However, in the Tiger's alibi testimony, he claims to have been tied up with business in December last year and spent all his time in his office. He also claims to have never seen the victim before and to have had no involvement in the murder. 

This testimony contradicts the Sports Paper evidence, as it suggests that the Tiger was not involved in the case and had no knowledge of the victim or "MC Bomber". However, the Sports Paper evidence suggests that the Tiger may have been involved in the case and had a connection to "MC Bomber".

This suggests that the person who drew the doodle, likely the victim or someone involved in the case, was involved in something related to "MC Bomber" and a large sum of money. However, the Tiger's alibi testimony claims that he never met the victim, Glen Elg, and that the victim never showed up to their meeting at Tender Lender. This testimony contradicts the Sports Paper evidence, which suggests that the Tiger was involved in the case and had some connection to the victim.

The Sports Paper and the testimony of Tigre contradict each other. The Sports Paper suggests that Tigre met with Glen Elg at Tres Bien, while Tigre's testimony claims that he did not meet with Glen Elg.

{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 0}
The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Sports Paper (evidence 3) and Testimony 2 (Tigre).

The Sports Paper shows that Glen Elg was planning to meet someone, as indicated by the doodle that said 'MC Bomber' with an arrow pointing to '100,000' that was crossed out. However, in Testimony 2, Tigre claims that Glen Elg told him he had no way to pay up, which contradicts the idea that Glen Elg was expecting to meet someone and potentially receive a large sum of money.

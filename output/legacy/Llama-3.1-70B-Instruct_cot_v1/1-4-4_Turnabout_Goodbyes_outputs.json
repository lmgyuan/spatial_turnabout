    "response": "To find the contradicting pair, let's analyze the given information. \n\nFrom the testimonies, Larry Butz (Character 4) mentions that he heard this \"bang\" (Testimony 3), looked out over the lake, but didn't notice the boat (Testimony 4), and then went home (Testimony 5). However, Lotta's Camera (Evidence 2) is set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected, and it faces the lake. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) was taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM, which matches the time of the murder. This implies that Larry Butz should have been visible in the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) if he was on the lake, but the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) shows two people on a boat, and it's not clear if Larry Butz is one of them.\n\nHowever, there's a better pair. Larry Butz (Character 4) mentions that he heard this \"bang\" (Testimony 3), and then went home (Testimony 5). However, Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) mentions that she heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. This implies that Larry Butz should have heard two gunshots, not just one.\n\nSo, the contradicting pair is Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) and Larry Butz's testimony that he heard this \"bang\" (Testimony 3).\n\n{\"evidence\": 11, \"testimony\": 3}",

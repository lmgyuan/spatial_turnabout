    "response": "Evidence 1 (Yokai Legend Scroll) and Testimony 3 (by Filch) seem to contradict each other.\n\nTestimony 3 (by Filch) states that \"If Tenma Taro was to pass by, his staff woulda gone jingle jangle.\"\n\nHowever, Evidence 1 (Yokai Legend Scroll) states that Tenma Taro does not wield any weapon, which suggests that he does not carry a staff.\n\nThis means that it would not be possible for Tenma Taro's staff to go \"jingle jangle\" if he were to pass by.\n\nHowever, Testimony 3 (by Filch) implies that Tenma Taro's staff would make a noise if he were to pass by, which directly contradicts with Evidence 1 (Yokai Legend Scroll).\n\n{\"evidence\": 1, \"testimony\": 3}",

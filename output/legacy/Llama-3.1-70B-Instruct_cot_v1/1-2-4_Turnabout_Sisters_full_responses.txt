Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 8 states, "The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!" However, Evidence 9, which is "May Testimony," states, "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." This is a direct contradiction between the two testimonies, as they describe the victim running in different directions.

However, another contradiction exists between Evidence 8, which is "Floor Plans," and Testimony 7, which states, "The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!" and Testimony 8, which states, "The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!" Evidence 8 states, "The stand is blocked from view looking from the office." This suggests that Redd White, who was looking from the office, would not have been able to see the victim running away or being chased.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right." However, Evidence 5, which is "Mia's Autopsy Report," states, "Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous." This suggests that the victim died immediately after the attack, which contradicts Testimony 3, which states that the victim was able to run to the right after being hit.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged." Testimony 4 states, "She turned, and ran for the door!" This suggests that the victim was able to move around after the attack. However, Evidence 5, which is "Mia's Autopsy Report," states, "Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous." This suggests that the victim died immediately after the attack, which contradicts Testimony 3 and 4.

However, another contradiction exists between Evidence 2, which is "Glass Shards," and Testimony 1, which states, "A light stand was lying on the floor when I looked." This suggests that the light stand was intact when Redd White looked, but Evidence 2 states that the light stand was broken beyond all recognition.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 1}
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "That is when I saw this glass light stand." This suggests that the glass light stand was intact when Redd White saw it. However, Evidence 2, which is "Glass Shards," states that the glass light stand was broken beyond all recognition.

This is a direct contradiction between the two, as the testimony suggests that the glass light stand was intact, while the evidence suggests that it was broken.

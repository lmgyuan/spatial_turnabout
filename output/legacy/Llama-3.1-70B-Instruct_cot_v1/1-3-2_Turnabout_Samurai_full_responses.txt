Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 6 states, "Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM." Testimony 7 states, "It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!" However, Evidence 5, which is "Powers'(?) Photo," states that a photo was taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios at 2:00 PM, showing the Steel Samurai walking. This suggests that the person walking by the guard station at 2:00 PM was actually the Steel Samurai, not necessarily Powers.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 2 states, "No one else went there!" This suggests that the Security Lady did not see anyone else going to the studio besides Will Powers. However, Evidence 11, which is "Mr. Monkey's Head," states that Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, which means that it was not possible for the Security Lady to see anyone going to the studio during that time.

This is a direct contradiction between the two, as the testimony suggests that the Security Lady had a clear view of the studio, while the evidence suggests that her view was blocked.

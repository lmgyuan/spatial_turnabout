Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 4 states, "I wasn't, like, scared at all. And, like, her costume looked totally, like, normal." However, Evidence 11, which is "Maya's Costume," states that the clothes Maya was wearing at the time of the murder had blood splatters on them.

This is a direct contradiction between the two, as the testimony suggests that Maya's costume looked normal, while the evidence suggests that it had blood splatters on it.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 6 states, "I, like, didn't have my license, so, like, I couldn't take over driving for her." However, Evidence 18, which is "License Photo," states that Ini's photo for her driver's license is Director Hotti's treasured possession.

This is a direct contradiction between the two, as the testimony suggests that Ini did not have a driver's license, while the evidence suggests that she did have a driver's license.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "My sis' new car was, like, a totally special model from England." However, Evidence 6, which is "Newspaper Clipping 2," states that Mimi Miney died after falling asleep at the wheel, but it does not mention the car being a special model from England.

However, another contradiction exists between Testimony 3 and Evidence 6, which states that Mimi Miney died in a car accident, but does not provide any information about the car being a special model from England.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "In the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!" However, Evidence 10, which is "Ring," states that a cheap ring with an eerie sparkle was found, and it has an engraving that says "From T to R".

This is a direct contradiction between the two, as the testimony suggests that Trilo still has the ring in his pocket, while the evidence suggests that the ring was found elsewhere.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "His face was silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him." However, Testimony 4 states, "His cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying." This implies that Moe could not see Max's face clearly, which contradicts Testimony 3.

However, another contradiction exists between Testimony 3 and Evidence 3, which is "Silk Hat." Testimony 3 states that Moe saw Max's face, but Evidence 3 states that the silk hat was found at the crime scene, which implies that Max may not have been wearing it at the time.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "He was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!" However, Evidence 3, which is "Silk Hat," states that the silk hat was found at the crime scene, which implies that Max may not have been wearing it at the time.

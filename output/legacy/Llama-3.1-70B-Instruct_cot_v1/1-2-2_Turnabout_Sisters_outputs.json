    "response": "To find the contradiction, we need to analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.\n\nLet's examine Testimony 5: \"Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\" by Gumshoe. This testimony implies that the victim was able to write the killer's name before passing away.\n\nHowever, Evidence 5: Mia's Autopsy Report states that \"Death was instantaneous. Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit.\" This evidence suggests that the victim may not have had the time or ability to write the killer's name before dying.\n\nFurthermore, Evidence 1: The Thinker (the murder weapon) is described as a clock with its gears removed, and Evidence 2: Glass Shards are the remains of a broken glass light stand. These pieces of evidence do not directly contradict any testimonies.\n\nHowever, Testimony 5 can be linked to Testimony 2, which states that the word \"Maya\" was written in blood next to the victim's body. If the victim died instantly, it's unlikely they would have been able to write anything.\n\nBut a more direct contradiction can be seen with Evidence 5 and Testimony 5. The autopsy report clearly states that death was instantaneous, while Testimony 5 claims that the victim wrote the killer's name before dying.\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 5}",

This testimony implies that the clock, \"The Thinker,\" was used as the murder weapon.\n\nHowever, Evidence 1: The Thinker states that \"The clock's gears have been removed.\" This suggests that the clock was not functional and may not have been in a state to be used as a blunt force trauma murder weapon.\n\nFurthermore, Evidence 2: Glass Shards are the remains of a broken glass light stand.

I saw it! I did!\" by April. This testimony implies that April saw the murder, but her description of the murder weapon in Testimony 4 is questionable.\n\nHowever, a more direct contradiction can be seen with Testimony 3 and Evidence 2. If the glass light stand was the actual murder weapon, then Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 2, as April claims to have seen the murder but describes the wrong murder weapon.\n\n{\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}",

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!" However, Evidence 15, which is "Knife," states that the knife bears the victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints, but it does not mention that Engarde bought the knife for the crime.

However, another contradiction exists between Testimony 5 and Evidence 15, which states that the knife is engraved with "Gatewater", which implies that the knife may have been a hotel property rather than something Engarde bought specifically for the crime.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show." However, Evidence 16, which is "Jammin' Ninja's Button," states that the button was ripped from Corrida's costume and was found in Engarde's "hakama", which implies that Engarde was wearing his samurai costume, not his racing jacket.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 4 states, "So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan." However, Evidence 16, which is "Jammin' Ninja's Button," states that the button was ripped from Corrida's costume and was found in Engarde's "hakama", which implies that Engarde was wearing his samurai costume, but it was not the Nickel Samurai costume.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "I was the one who knocked the flower vase over, where it fell onto the guitar case." However, Evidence 9, which is "Crime Photo," states that the remains of the smashed vase are next to the guitar case, but it does not mention that Andrews knocked the vase over.

However, another contradiction exists between Testimony 5 and Evidence 7, which is "Guitar Case." Testimony 5 states that Andrews knocked the vase over, which fell onto the guitar case, but Evidence 7 states that there is some water, but only on top of the lid of the guitar case, which implies that the vase may not have fallen directly onto the guitar case.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 2 states, "It's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all." However, Evidence 7, which is "Guitar Case," states that the guitar case is empty, but it does not mention that Andrews opened the case.

However, another contradiction exists between Testimony 2 and Evidence 9, which is "Crime Photo." Testimony 2 states that the guitar case was empty, but Evidence 9 shows that the guitar case is open and next to the victim, which implies that Andrews may have opened the case.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt." However, Evidence 16, which is "Jammin' Ninja's Button," states that the button was ripped from Corrida's costume and was found in Engarde's "hakama", but it does not mention that the button was torn off during a fight.

However, another contradiction exists between Testimony 5 and Evidence 16, which states that the button was found in Engarde's "hakama", which implies that Engarde may have had possession of the button after the murder, rather than it being torn off during a fight.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "When I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind." However, Evidence 9, which is "Crime Photo," shows that the victim was sitting in a chair with a knife sticking out of his chest, which implies that it would be obvious that the victim was dead.

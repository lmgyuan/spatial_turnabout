Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back." However, Evidence 8, which is "Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report," states that Dr. Grey was stabbed in the chest before being shot in the forehead at point-blank.

This is a direct contradiction between the two, as the testimony suggests that the victim was not fighting back, while the evidence suggests that the victim was stabbed, which implies that there may have been a struggle.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed." However, Evidence 8, which is "Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report," states that Dr. Grey was shot in the forehead at point-blank.

This is a direct contradiction between the two, as the testimony suggests that the victim missed the shot, while the evidence suggests that the victim was shot at point-blank range.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 0 states, "I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!" However, Evidence 4, which is "Lake Photo," shows a figure in the boat, but it is not clear that it is Edgeworth.

However, another contradiction exists between Testimony 0 and Evidence 10, which is "Pistol." Testimony 0 implies that Lotta saw Edgeworth on the boat, but Evidence 10 suggests that the pistol was fired by Edgeworth's right hand, which implies that Edgeworth was not on the boat, but rather on the shore.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower." However, Evidence 2, which is "Lotta's Camera," states that the camera was set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected.

This is a direct contradiction between the two, as the testimony suggests that the camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower, while the evidence suggests that it was actually set up to take pictures when a loud noise is detected.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 6 states, "There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time." However, Evidence 16, which is "Second Lake Photo," shows an empty lake, taken automatically on 12/24 at 11:50 PM. This suggests that there was no boat on the lake at that time.

However, another contradiction exists between Testimony 7 and Evidence 11, which is "Lotta's Deposition." Testimony 7 states that Lotta saw a flash and heard another gunshot, but Evidence 11 states that Lotta heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25, but does not mention seeing a flash.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 8 states, "If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you." However, Evidence 15, which is "Cody's Camera," states that Cody always carries his camera with him, though he's still learning how to use it. This suggests that Cody should have had his camera with him at the time of the event.

This is a direct contradiction between the two, as the testimony suggests that Cody did not have his camera, while the evidence suggests that he always carries it.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it." However, Testimony 5 states, "I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em." This suggests that Cody did manage to take some shots, but Testimony 3 implies that he missed the shot because the lens wouldn't open in time.

However, another contradiction exists between Testimony 5 and Evidence 15, which is "Cody's Camera." Testimony 5 states that Cody took a few shots and erased them, but Evidence 15 does not mention any deleted photos.

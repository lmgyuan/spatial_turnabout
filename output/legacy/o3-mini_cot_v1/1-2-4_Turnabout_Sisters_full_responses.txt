Evidence 8 – the Floor Plans – indicate that from the office the portion containing the murder weapon (the stand) is blocked from view. However, in Testimony 4, White asserts that he clearly saw a spiky-haired man attacking a woman. If his vantage point were indeed from the office as suggested (or if the attack occurred in the area now shown to be obstructed), then his account contradicts the layout shown in the floor plans.

Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report) states that the death was caused by a single blow from a blunt object, implying one impact. However, Testimony 6 claims "You see? You hit her twice!" which directly contradicts the autopsy report’s indication of a single, fatal blow.

Evidence 9 — "May Testimony" — states that "the victim dodged an attack then ran to the right," while Testimony 2 claims, "Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!" This directional discrepancy creates a contradiction between the evidence and the testimony.

Testimony 3 says, "That is when I saw this glass light stand," which implies that the glass light stand was intact and clearly observable. However, Evidence 2 describes the remains as "the broken remains of a glass light stand" broken beyond all recognition. This contradiction between the testimony claiming to have seen a whole stand and the actual evidence of shattered glass leads to a discrepancy in the accounts of what occurred.

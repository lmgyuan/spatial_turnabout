Evidence 9 (the Pistol) shows both Maya’s and Grey’s fingerprints. This suggests that Dr. Grey had handled his own gun—possibly during a struggle or in self‐defense—making it likely that he was fighting back at some point. That fact contradicts Gumshoe’s Testimony 3, where he claims, “The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.”

******************************
Testimony 3 states that “the victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed,” implying the victim managed to pull the trigger in a defensive recoil. However, Evidence 8—the autopsy report—clearly details that after being stabbed in the chest the victim was shot in the forehead at point‐blank range. This suggests that the fatal shot wasn’t a frantic, missed self-defense attempt but a precise, deadly shot delivered by someone else at extremely close range. In other words, if the victim had fired his own shot (and missed, as Testimony 3 alleges), then the fatal gunshot should not have been described as a point‐blank shot causing gunpowder residue on the head. This conflict shows the victim’s supposed action in Testimony 3 doesn’t fit with the physical evidence in the autopsy report.

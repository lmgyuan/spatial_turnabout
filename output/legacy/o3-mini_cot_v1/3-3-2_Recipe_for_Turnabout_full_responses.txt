Gumshoe’s testimony 4 states that during Maggey’s search they found “the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.” However, the evidence shows that while the lottery ticket (Evidence 14) was present, the poison linked to Maggey wasn’t in a bottle but as a deadly powder—potassium cyanide (Evidence 16)—found in her apron pocket. This difference between a “bottle of poison” in the testimony and a powder in Evidence 16 is a clear contradiction.

******************************
Testimony 2 asserts that the serving girl openly and blatantly added white powder into the drink – a very deliberate, noticeable act. However, Evidence 16 shows that the deadly powder (potassium cyanide) was found tucked away in her apron pocket, implying that it was kept concealed rather than being conspicuously used in front of everyone. This mismatch between an overt act and a hidden storage creates a contradiction between the testimony and the evidence.

Evidence 13 states that the coffee cup was handled by both the victim and Maggey (as shown by their fingerprints), which strongly implies that the victim himself took a sip. However, Testimony 4 (from Kudo) asserts that “the little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip,” portraying someone else handling and drinking from it. This discrepancy creates a clear contradiction between who actually drank from the fatal cup.

******************************
Testimony 2 claims that someone knocked over a vase, yet Evidence 12 (the Crime Photo) clearly shows an intact vase on each dining table. This contradiction between the state of the vases is significant.

Testimony 3 has Luke Atmey claiming, "I knew it was an extremely valuable treasure, so I sent my card 10 days beforehand," which implies he was the one preparing a calling card as part of his criminal scheme. However, the only calling card found—the one at the crime scene—is Evidence 5 (“DeMasque's Calling Card”), which is clearly signed by Mask DeMasque. In other words, Atmey is attempting to attribute a step of the heist to himself, yet the physical evidence shows that it was Mask DeMasque who left his signature calling card. This direct conflict between Atmey’s claim in Testimony 3 and the uncovered evidence in Evidence 5 creates a clear contradiction.

Bikini claims in Testimony 3 that Iris went to the Inner Temple after dinner, yet Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) states she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and stayed in her room until the murder was discovered. This is a clear contradiction regarding Iris’s whereabouts that night.

Bikini’s testimony (Testimony 3) states that Iris wasn’t wearing her hood. This directly contradicts Evidence 6, which describes Iris’s hood as an item she wears at all times. Although one might argue that under unusual circumstances Iris could remove her hood, the evidence makes it clear that the hood is generally constant, making Bikini’s account inconsistent with this known fact.

Evidence 10 describes the Shichishito as the apparent murder weapon, noting that although it has the victim’s blood and the suspect’s fingerprints on it, it is not actually the murder weapon. In contrast, Testimony 2 claims that the sword’s blade was seen being smoothly drawn out at the moment of the crime, implying that it was used as the murder weapon. This creates a direct contradiction between the established facts of the evidence and what was observed in the testimony.

Testimony 3 by Bikini claims that using a snowmobile one can reach Dusky Bridge in less than 5 minutes, implying the vehicle’s distinctive and rapid traces would be evident. Yet, Evidence 14—the Tracks Photo—shows only a single set of footprints leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. This suggests that no vehicle (whose tracks would be noticeably different) was used, directly contradicting the testimony about a snowmobile’s involvement.

Testimony 0 claims that the suspect went to the shack at around 9 and it would have been about 10:30 PM at the time in question. However, Evidence 7 (Weather Data) shows that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM—and the fire’s timing is tied to that event. This discrepancy in timing indicates that the witness’s account (claiming 10:30 PM) conflicts with the weather evidence showing key events beginning at 10:45 PM.

Testimony 2 from Butz states that he saw Iris flying with her white hood fluttering. However, Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) clearly states that after she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM, she remained in her room until the murder was discovered. This discrepancy in Iris’s whereabouts presents a clear contradiction between the two accounts.

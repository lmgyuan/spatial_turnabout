Testimony 3 claims that Mask☆DeMasque targets “only the most precious art pieces,” implying his heists are focused on valuable treasures. However, Evidence 4, the Sacred Urn, is described as “one of the treasures of Kurain Village” yet is also noted as “a plain old pot” and explicitly stated to have “no monetary value.” This contradiction—targeting only the prized art pieces while the stolen item isn’t valuable in monetary terms—creates a clear mismatch between the testimony and the evidence.

Atmey describes being struck on his “noble head” (Testimony 2), yet the forensic report from the Shichishito (Evidence 6) clearly states that the blow that knocked him out was delivered to the back of his head. This discrepancy in the location of the blow is a direct contradiction between what Atmey testified and what the evidence indicates.

Evidence 6 indicates that Mask☆DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of his head. However, in Testimony 5, Atmey states that while he had his back to the wall, the thief's blow landed on his third eye—which is on the front of his head. This direct contradiction between the location of the blow suggests that one of these accounts is inaccurate.

Ron claims in Testimony 2 that he has no alibi for the night the urn was stolen. Yet Evidence 12—a key card found in his wallet that opens the KB Security CEO's office and leaves an electronic record when used—suggests he did in fact access a building that night. The key card evidence could potentially offer an alibi contradicting his claim.

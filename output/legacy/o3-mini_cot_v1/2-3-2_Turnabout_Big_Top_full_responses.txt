Trilo claims in his testimony—specifically when he states “I kept it in my pocket, waiting for the chance to propose and give it to her”—that he was safeguarding an engagement ring meant for Regina. However, Evidence 10 (the Ring) is described as nothing more than a cheap ring with an odd “From T to R” engraving, which clashes with the idea of it being a meaningful, high‐value engagement ring reserved for such an important moment. This mismatch in the perceived value and significance of the ring creates a clear contradiction between the testimony and the forensic evidence.

Moe’s second testimony asserts he clearly saw Max’s “silk hat” together with his “black cloak” at the scene. However, the only physical item matching his description is the Silk Hat (Evidence 3)—there’s no item found that could account for the black cloak he mentioned. This discrepancy between his account and the tangible evidence creates a contradiction.

Evidence 4 (Max G. Promo Poster) clearly displays Max's three famous symbols, one of which is white roses, while Testimony 0 from Moe declares, "There were no white roses that night!" This pair contradicts each other by asserting opposing details about the presence of white roses.

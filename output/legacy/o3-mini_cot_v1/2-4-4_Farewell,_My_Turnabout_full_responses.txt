Powers insists he saw a hotel bellboy leaving Corrida's room with nothing in hand—and he concludes that this “bellboy” must be the assassin. However, the Bellboy's Uniform (Evidence 30) was actually retrieved from De Killer’s hideout and bears signs (such as a missing special button) that reveal it wasn’t part of standard hotel service. In other words, although Powers attributes the scene to a typical hotel bellboy, the evidence shows the uniform belonged to someone much more sinister than a regular bellboy.

Testimony 5 by de Killer claims that his client (Adrian Andrews) planted the knife—and by extension, the button—to mislead the investigation. However, Evidence 15 shows that the knife bears Engarde’s fingerprints (along with the victim’s blood), which conflicts with the claim that the knife was planted by Andrews. This inconsistency between the knife’s forensic evidence and de Killer’s testimony creates a contradiction.

Testimony 3 claims that one of de Killer’s minor assignments was to retrieve a bear figurine and deliver it to Adrian Andrews. However, Evidence 25 (the Figurine) is described as a wooden bear‐shaped piece that “only Corrida and Andrews know how to open,” hinting it was meant to have a very specific, secret use shared between Corrida (the victim) and Andrews. That detail clashes with de Killer’s account of casually picking it up for a client he assumed was male. This is a clear contradiction between the intended handling of the figurine (Evidence 25) and de Killer’s stated assignment (Testimony 3).

The contradiction arises between the autopsy report (Evidence 5) and Gumshoe’s assertion (Testimony 5). According to Mia's Autopsy Report, the victim suffered instantaneous death from a single blunt force trauma, implying she had virtually no time to take any actions afterward. However, Gumshoe testifies that, before dying, the victim managed to write down the killer's name. These two pieces of information cannot both be true, as an instantaneous death would not allow the victim enough time to write anything down.

******************************
Testimony 9 from April describes the victim dodging an attack, running to the right, and then being struck. This account implies that there was at least a brief period of activity after the initial blow. However, Mia’s Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) states that the victim’s death was instantaneous following a single blunt force trauma. The idea that the victim had time to dodge and run contradicts the forensic finding of an immediate death.

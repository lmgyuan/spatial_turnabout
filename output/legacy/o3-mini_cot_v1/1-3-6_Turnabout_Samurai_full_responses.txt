Testimony 4 states that at 2:30 PM Vasquez took a 15‐minute break during the meeting. However, Evidence 3—the autopsy report—pinpoints the time of Jack Hammer’s death (by a spear) at exactly 2:30 PM. This creates a contradiction regarding the timeline, as the break claimed by Vasquez occurs at the exact time the victim was killed.

******************************
Evidence 5 shows a photo of Will Powers at the gate on October 15 at 2:00 PM, clearly indicating his presence at the scene. However, Testimony 1 from Vasquez states, "The assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent." This directly contradicts the visual evidence proving Powers was there.

The moment you've all been waiting for! Who will be this year's Grand Prix Champion? Who will be our \"Hero of Heroes\"!? Will it be last year's runner-up, Jammin' Ninja!? Or maybe Captain Saipan all the way from the lovely tropical island of Saipan!? I see the students of a certain Starry School are raring to win! And Global Hero Onyankopon doesn't want to go home without the prize! We hope Lady Luck is with all our heroes tonight! And now! The winner of the third annual Hero of Heroes Grand Prix... IS ME!!\nWhoooooooooa! The true hero of the night has appeared in our midst! It looks like this year's Grand Prix goes to this fantastic warrior! The Nickel Samurai! Too bad, Jammin' Ninja. Looks like the title eluded you again this year!\nMarch 20, 7:42 PMGatewater HotelViola Hall\nMaya:\nAlright! Yes! Did you hear that, Nick!? Did you!? The Nickel Samurai! He did it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.\nPowers:\nAh, I'm proud of the guy for doing the series justice.\nPearl:\nU-Um... So the person everyone was cheering for... I guess he got the prize?\nMaya:\nYup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? \"The Nickel Samurai\"!\nPearl:\nNo. Every Sunday, I only watch the Educational Channel's \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nOK, that's it! From now on, it's \"The Nickel Samurai\"! All the kids watch it!\nPearl:\nDo you like \"The Nickel Samurai\" too, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nNah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. But I do like \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nHey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed to watch it anymore! You're supposed to act your age and have interests that match. ...It's very important.\nMaya:\nAw, give it a rest, Pearly!\nPowers:\nLooks like I made the right choice in inviting everyone here. I'm glad you're all having a good time.\nMaya:\nAaaaah... It's like a dream!\nPowers:\nToo bad for the Jammin' Ninja, though. Last year, he lost to The Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo. I thought this might be his year...\nMaya:\nYeah... Oh, hey, did anyone else think that the Jammin' Ninja was a bit different today?\nPearl:\nDifferent? What do you mean?\nMaya:\nUm, well, he wasn't carrying his bright red guitar.\nPowers:\nHey, you're right! Strange he'd walk around without his signature guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh* I will never understand these people and their shows...) Anyway, Mr. Powers, thank you very much for tonight.\nPowers:\nA-Aw, it was nothing... I owe you one, so it's just my way of saying thanks.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! It's time to get going to the lobby! There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.\nPowers:\nAnd then, I heard there's going to be a press conference after that.\nPhoenix:\nA press conference? Is he going to make a speech about winning this year's prize?\nPowers:\nUh, well, not exactly... Something about the Nickel Samurai confessing something.\nPhoenix:\nConfessing...? Sounds pretty serious.\nMaya:\nArgh! Nick! COME ON! You don't want us to be the last ones there, do you!?\nPearl:\nYeah, Mr. Nick! Do you!?\nPhoenix:\n(Why me...? The show doesn't even start for another 20 minutes...)\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there.\nPowers:\nAnd behind those doors is an equally grand lobby.\nPearl:\nShall we go and take a look, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nHey, wait up! This grand dessert is calling to me... It's saying, \"Eat me now!\"\nWalls or ceiling\nPhoenix:\nThis sure is one luxurious hotel. Almost to the point of gaudy, with how it blends together everything \"fancy\" imaginable. (Speaking of fancy, didn't that bellboy give me something like that last year?)\nChandelier\nMaya:\nThat chandelier is really something, isn't it?\nPearl:\nI thought it was a kind of space ship...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. How about we get one of these for the office?\nPhoenix:\nOne of those hanging from our poor, weak ceiling? I don't think so.\nTables at back\nMaya:\nIf this is all a dream, I don't ever want to wake up! And all the directors and stars that were here to see the heroes, wow.\nPhoenix:\nI had no idea who most of them were.\nPearl:\nNeither did I.\nMaya:\nNick, you've got to cut that \"news only\" habit out. Your new show is going to be \"The Nickel Samurai!\" Every Sunday morning at 8! Oh, I know! We can watch it together starting next week! I'll come wake you up extra early to make sure, OK?\nPhoenix:\nAh, I'm fine... You know, you really don't have to on my account...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second.\nMaya:\nWell, shows like that are guaranteed to be good, you know?\nFront table\nMaya:\nWhat can I say? This is a really high-class hotel!\nPearl:\nI've never eaten this kind of salad before.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nMaya:\nDon't worry! Any leftovers belong in my happily awaiting stomach anyway!\nPhoenix:\nYou're such a glutton, Maya.\nPowers:\nAh, I lose this one to Maya. You sure can eat.\nMaya:\nWell, a growing girl needs her nutrients!\nPhoenix:\n(A growing girl? Exactly how big do you plan on getting...?)\nTalk\nWill Powers\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much for inviting us today.\nPowers:\nAww, it was nothing really. Guys like us don't get to come to a place like this often, so I thought I'd invite you all.\nMaya:\nHey, Mr. Powers! What have you been up to lately?\nPowers:\nWell, since \"The Pink Princess\" successfully wrapped up last month, I've been on a kid's exercise show... ...while wearing a rabbit mask over my face...\nMaya:\nOh, I see.\nPowers:\nI'm still really sorry about all the headaches I caused you that time, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nAh, well. What's done is done, so let's forget about it. (This is Will Powers. He's an action star. His popularity exploded when he was the Steel Samurai. And he was the first case Maya worked on with me.)\nMaya:\nIt's too bad you look scary, or people'd know you're a real softy who's good with kids. (Changed from [You can't tell by looking at you, but you're a really nice guy with a love of kids.] in the original release)\nPowers:\nUm, thanks. (Changed from [Ah, thanks.] in the original release)\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe they're going to make a movie based on the Nickel Samurai.\nMaya:\nI can't believe it either, but for a different reason!\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai. An epic story of one hero in a desperate fight against his arch-enemy, the Evil Magistrate in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo. And last year, they started a new series, \"The Nickel Samurai\". The new series seems to be a hit with the kids, too.\nPowers:\nI'm really attached to the Steel Samurai as a show, (Changed from [The Steel Samurai is a show I have a lot of strong feelings for,] in the original release) so I was hoping that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one... (Changed from [so I hoped that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nYeah, it's too bad... It'd been [sic] awesome to see you with the new actor, Matt Engarde. (Changed from [Yeah... It's too bad... It'd be great to see you on the show...] in the original release) He's super popular right now. (Changed from [With the new actor, Matt Engarde. He's super popular right now.] in the original release)\nPearl:\nMr. Un-gard...?\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Pearls doesn't know who he is.)\nMaya:\nThis year it's going to be the Nickel Samurai vs. the Jammin' Ninja at the box office!\nPhoenix:\n...Jammin' Ninja...? Who's that again?\nJammin' Ninja (appears after \"The Nickel Samurai\")\nPhoenix:\nSo who is this \"Jammin' Ninja\" again?\nMaya:\nHe's a hero, duh. His symbol is a bright red guitar he's always carrying.\nPhoenix:\n(A ninja who's always carrying around a bright red guitar...? How does that even work!?)\nMaya:\nWith a scarf around his neck and a guitar in hand, he rises to stardom in an ancient time.\nPhoenix:\nA ninja... Who becomes a star??\nMaya:\nYeah! A ninja who becomes a star!\nPowers:\nThere's a strong rivalry between the two of them. Global Studios' Nickel Samurai and Worldwide Studios' Jammin' Ninja. They even air at the same time.\nMaya:\nYou know what I heard? I heard those two don't get along at all. The Nickel Samurai's Engarde and the guy who plays the Jammin' Ninja, I mean.\nPhoenix:\n(The Nickel Samurai speaks French!? Oh, you mean Matt Engarde, the actor...) I guess even the world of heroes isn't a sparkling, happy place.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPowers:\nAh, I really owe you one. If it wasn't for you guys, I don't know what would've happened. What you did... It was a real tight spot I was in, and you fought so hard to get me out. I don't care what happens. I'll never forget everything you've done for me.\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo, you're going to study to become a lawyer too. Am I right or am I right?\nMaya:\nUmm...\nPowers:\nIt must be real tough. There's all those thick books with hard words you have to read...\nMaya:\nUh, um... Well...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, yeah. Mr. Powers doesn't know that Maya's a spirit medium...)\nMaya:\nI thought he'd be able to tell by my clothes.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he thinks that you've got some strange hobby on the side or something.\nMaya:\n...Hey, wait a sec. What's that's supposed to mean!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo are you Maya's little sister?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but no.\nPowers:\nOh, then you must be Mr. Wright's little sister!\nPearl:\nAgain, I'm sorry, but...\nPowers:\nThen... Whose little sister are you?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but I'm an only child.\nPowers:\nOh, I see... S-Sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(Pearl looks so sad... She looks really sorry too...)\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, they're all shocked because then they figure out who I am.\nMaya:\nHmm... Well, I don't think you look scary.\nPearl:\nMe either. I think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Those two are making Mr. Powers tear up...)\nAnything else\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Thanks for taking the time to take it out and show it to me, but I'm really sorry, I don't know a thing about it.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nPhoenix:\nWow, what is with this place? Looks like I've stumbled into Oz or something. Way in the back, there's a sign for the bathroom. Maybe I should visit it while I can before the show starts... (Changed from [I bet we have a little time to look around before the show starts...] in the original release)\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...? Could it be that there's an action star who has a soft spot for teddy bears...? ...Nah, can't be.\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". \"Juan Corrida\"... His name just sounds like a star's name. I've heard it before, but I don't know anything about him at all.\nEnd of hallway\nPhoenix:\nThere are toilets in each room in this hotel, but since all sorts of events are held here, there are bathrooms for people who aren't staying here to use as well. Perfect for people like me, who can't afford a stay here in the first place...\nFlowers on right\nPhoenix:\n\"To Mr. Engarde From the Global Studio Staff\" Ah, it'd be nice if lawyers got flowers too. Something like, \"To Mr. Wright From All Your Grateful Clients\".\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\". \"Matt Engarde\"... I've heard that name before. Oh, yeah. Maya's always yammering about him like the obsessed fan she is...\nViola Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Viola Hall and visiting Hallway)\nPowers:\nSounds like the post-ceremony show is about to start.\nMaya:\nAlright! I'm so pumped! I wonder if he's going to show off his special move today? \"Nickel Samurai Smelting!\"\nPowers:\nActually, what I'm interested in most is the press conference.\nMaya:\nYou mean the \"big confession\" the Nickel Samurai's going to make after the show? So what is it? Don't you know what it's about, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nUh, well, I'm not the Steel Samurai anymore, so I don't have any idea.\nMaya:\nBah.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Ah, so I guess you are all going to the press conference then?\nMaya:\nYeah, of course!\nPowers:\nIf that's the case, then here, take these tickets so you can get in.\nPress Conference Ticket added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much. Well, let's get going to the lobby.\nPearl:\nIt looks like it's over this way, Mr. Nick!\nMaya:\nOK! For great justice!\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPowers:\nThey called this so suddenly that something about it just seems off, you know?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the press conference?\nPowers:\nYeah. He said, \"There's something I'd like to confess if I win.\" I heard he faxed his request for a conference in to the office only yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nYesterday... (Yeah, that is kind of sudden.)\nPowers:\nBut I guess his manager set everything up somehow, so he was lucky.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Nice manager.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Only a really gaudy hotel would have such a large, gaudy lobby to match.\nPearl:\nAh, I think they're going to have the post-ceremony show over there.\nPhoenix:\nThey're using a compact stage, I see.\nMaya:\nOoh... I'm all ready to use my special \"Samurai Power\".\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks like she's ready to start a fight...)\nPA Notice:\nYour attention please, your attention please. The Nickel Samurai's Post-Ceremony Stage Show will not be held tonight due to unforeseen circumstances.\nMaya:\nWHAAAT!? WHYYYYY!?\nPhoenix:\nOww! You didn't have to pinch me! Pinch yourself if you don't believe it!\nPA Notice:\nWe are asking for everyone's cooperation at this time. So please stay where you are. ...This is a special request from the police.\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nP-Police? Did they just say the police?\nPowers:\nD-Do you want me to go check out what's going on?\nPhoenix:\nUm, wait, I'll come with you...\n???:\nFreeze! You two! Didn't you hear the announcement just now!? It just finished telling you not to move!\nMaya:\nTh-That voice... I've heard that voice somewhere before...\n???:\nHonestly, youth these days can't be bothered to listen to other people when they talk! Just the other day it was the same thing! There was a small footbridge with a sign next to it that said, \"Beware, Bridge Out!\" And along comes a snot-nosed little punk kid right up to the bridge. I tried to tell the boy the bridge was out and it was dangerous, but would he listen!? No, of course not! He said he'd be careful and only walk on the \"in\" part of the bridge since the \"out\" part is what was dangerous! I am not kidding you here! The kid said that and really meant it! WELL! I really let him have it then, and knocked him clear off of that bridge! Honestly, kids these days don't know right from wrong, I tell you!\nPowers:\nThis non-stop chatter...\nPhoenix:\nI-It can't be... ...Ms. Oldbag?\n???:\n...\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, you young whipper-snappers!? Do I know you!? ...Wait. YOU! You're Powers, aren't you!?\nPowers:\nY-Yeah. Um, about what happened back then...\nOldbag:\nYou didn't even get nominated this year, did you? (Changed from [You didn't get nominated last year either, did you?] in the original release) Oh, that's right. You're doing that children's exercise program, trying to play nice.\nPowers:\nAh, yeah, that's me. Thankfully I still have a job...\nOldbag:\nI love that show, and you're a hoot! You're the \"big brother\" character, right? Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You're that giant rabbit! (Changed from [Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You ended up with a rabbit face.] in the original release) What a work of art, but that's how it is, you know? I mean, if you didn't wear the mask, who knows how many TVs you'd break? Really, and shame on those kids exercising around you. They're getting what they deserve. This is why I thought you shouldn't be anywhere...\nPhoenix:\nUm... What are you doing here?\nOldbag:\nLook at my uniform and tell me you can't tell I'm a member of security!\nMaya:\nBut that outfit...\nOldbag:\nAnnoying, noisy brats get the blaster!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nSecond floor\nMaya:\nWow, it looks like there's a fancy restaurant on the second floor!\nPhoenix:\nYou STILL feel like eating?\nMaya:\nI mean, since we're here, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't pull the \"since we're here\" trick on me...)\nPearl:\nWhat a beautiful mansion. Do you live in this wonderful world every day, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, this is my first time in a place like this.\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to say these cameras were set up to cover the post-ceremony stage show.\nMaya:\nBut I wonder where everyone's gone, abandoning their cameras like this...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess something big must have happened...)\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage for the post-ceremony stage show.\nPowers:\nThere was supposed to be a press meeting after the show, but now...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like no one will hear what the Nickel Samurai had to confess after all.\nSeats\nMaya:\nWe're here, so we might as well take some pictures. OK, everyone, sit in a chair!\nPhoenix:\nBut we're all out of film...\nMaya:\nDon't worry about it. There's a zillion cameras over there we can borrow.\nPhoenix:\nHey, hey! You can't just go and \"borrow\" an expensive professional camera like that!\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nMaya:\nWhat incident? What did you do?\nOldbag:\nI didn't do anything, you young'un! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I plead the fifth.\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me!?\nOldbag:\nI thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.\nMaya:\nYou? A bodyguard?\nOldbag:\nFor your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles.\nMaya:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth?\nOldbag:\nBut...\nEdgeworth:\nThat sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me.\nOldbag:\nThat's what he said to me. What did I ever do to deserve that!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nWhat happened?\nMaya:\nUm... So, did something happen?\nOldbag:\nI don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those \"incidents\" happened again.\nPowers:\nA-An \"incident\"? Like a \"murder\" kind of \"incident\"?\nOldbag:\nMaybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, showers of blood are sure to follow. Bet you didn't know that! (Changed from [So wherever I go, a rain of blood will come pouring down. Bet you didn't know that!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUm, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake?\nOldbag:\nSilence, whippersnapper!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nThese eyes of mine are real pros now!\nPhoenix:\n\"Pros\"? Pros at doing what?\nOldbag:\nAt doing police work, of course! My eyes are like a hawk! And my professional eyes spot a messy incident! A messy, bloody incident! That's why I don't have time for you meddling kids and your petty little things!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\n...Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it? I don't like that devilish smile playing on your lips...\nMaya:\nLet's make like we're going to the bathroom, and check things out!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way. The police told us not go [sic] anywhere, remember?\nMaya:\nHuh!? How B-O-R-I-N-G! You're such a boring guy! You've got no motivation! No spirit!\nPearl:\nHuh? What? What's going on? Are you giving Mystic Maya trouble again, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Not you too, Pearls... Please don't stick your little nose into this one...)\nMaya:\nSo listen to this, Pearly. This one time at lawyer camp, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nO-OK! I get it! Let's go take a look.\nMaya:\nYay! I know you couldn't say no to me, Nick!\nPearl:\nThat's right. You'd walk over miles of hot coals for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That would be EVERY time we work a case together...)\nMaya:\nWell, what are we waiting for? Let's go already! You can come along too, Pearly.\nPearl:\nGoody! I get to come! I get to come!\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nThere's nothing really out of the ordinary here...\nPearl:\nAre you looking for the \"in-si-dent\" that the old lady was talking about? (Changed from [Are you looking for the 'something' that the old lady was talking about?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't look like it happened here. Well, we'd better go look somewhere else.\nMaya:\nAlright! Then, let's try...\nBellboy:\nExcuse me.\nMaya:\nAck!\nBellboy:\nAre you by chance, Ms. Maya Fey?\nMaya:\nUm, yeah... That's me.\nBellboy:\nYou have a phone call waiting for you at the front desk.\nMaya:\nA call? I wonder if it's someone from Kurain Village...\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mystic Maya?\nMaya:\nOh, nothing. You guys go on ahead and I'll be right there, OK? (Changed from [Oh, nothing. I'll just go on ahead to check it out, OK?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nOK.\nBellboy:\nRight this way, Ms. Fey.\nPearl:\nLet's go look somewhere else now, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, OK.\nPearl:\nThis is a little exciting... And a little scary...\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of.\nChandelier\nPearl:\nSo, that's called a \"shan-deh leer\", right?\nPhoenix:\nYup.\nPearl:\nWhat is that for? What does it do?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's for lighting up a room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? Can I look down now? My neck hurts...\nTables at the back\nPhoenix:\nThey haven't cleaned up all the food yet. There's a sad feeling hanging in the air now that the party is over...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nIt's a feast fit for a king!\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPearl:\nIt was the first time I ate that food. What was it called again? I think it started with \"key\". Key... Wee?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, a \"kiwi\".\nPearl:\nI don't know what to say. It's a sweet but sour fruit all in one.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nHotel Lobby\nExamine\nSecond floor\nPhoenix:\nA lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. But right now, the only thing filling this enormous room is anxiety about the murder. ...I really hope nothing else bad happens here...\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nThese cameras must belong to the press that came to cover the conference. They're all basically doing the same thing: staring at the empty stage.\nSeats\nPhoenix:\nSeats for the spectators of the post-ceremony show and the press conference. But it's too bad neither event is going to be held now.\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nPearl:\nUm, I guess you must have done something... um... \"deh-plor-ible\"...\nOldbag:\n\"Deplorable!?\" I would never do such a thing! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I plead the fifth.\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me!?\nOldbag:\nI thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.\nPearl:\n\"Body...guard?\"\nOldbag:\nFor your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles.\nPhoenix:\n(She's not talking about Edgeworth, is she...?)\nOldbag:\nBut...\nEdgeworth:\nThat sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me.\nOldbag:\nThat's what he said to me. What did I ever do to deserve that!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nWhat happened?\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, but what in the world just happened?\nOldbag:\nI don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those \"incidents\" happened again.\nPowers:\nA-An \"incident\"? Like a \"murder\" kind of \"incident\"?\nOldbag:\nMaybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, showers of blood are sure to follow. Bet you didn't know that!

TOLD. YOU. I get people the info they want! Which means that I've got a right to know!\nNope! Don't care who you are, pal, we're still investigating, so you can't go in!\nWhat's yer problem!? Just ya wait! It'll be all over the morning paper! \"Scruffy Detective's Secret Scandal Revealed!\" You'll see! I'll git ya back!\nPearl:\nThose two sound pretty serious...\nPhoenix:\n(That southern accent can only mean...)\nHey, Wright!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey... Lotta...\nLotta:\nCome on, do a gal a favor and tell this cop I'm just doin' my job and I've got rights...\nGumshoe:\nAh, YOU!\nPhoenix:\nAh... Detective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, help a guy out! Tell her that only the police are allowed here! This is the scene of a murder, so she should leave this to us pros...\nPearl:\nA... A murder!?\nGumshoe:\nAw, shoot! Me and my big mouth!\nLotta:\nSee! I knew it! My gut instinct told me so! I always trust my gut! A murder, it said! And that's what it is! A genuine murder!\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, wait...\nYeehaw, a murder! Of a big star, no less!\nGumshoe:\nOh, man... I'm in trouble now...\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nSo... Detective Gumshoe... A murder...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, no, that's not it. I got my facts mixed up for a second there, pal.\nPearl:\nU-Um... Mr. Nick? Is the dead person the Nickel Samurai...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Why do you ask?\nPearl:\nWell, Mystic Maya was rooting for him, so...\nGumshoe:\nIt wasn't the Nickel Samurai that got bumped. Actually, the Nickel Samurai is the one under suspicion of doing the bumping off...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nThe guy that died was this hero named the Jammin' Ninja, pal.\nPhoenix:\nThe Jammin' Ninja...\nLotta Hart\nPearl:\nUm, that woman with the big puffy hair that looks like cotton candy...\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Lotta?\nPearl:\nThat woman... She was there that time too, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat time?\nPearl:\n...When Mystic Maya did that channeling...\nPhoenix:\nOh, that time... Well, Lotta's a journalist, so that's why she was there.\nPearl:\nJer-nal-ist...\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like she was hanging around here before the murder happened.\nPhoenix:\n\"Hanging around\"...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, hiding in wait in front of the Jammin' Ninja's door, pal.\nPhoenix:\nB-But why would she...?\nGumshoe:\nShe wouldn't tell me, pal. Just said something about \"Gettin' my big scoop\"...\nPhoenix:\n(Scoop? What sort of news could she be after...?)\nThe victim (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nSo the victim was the Jammin' Ninja?\nPearl:\nMr. Jammin' Ninja...?\nGumshoe:\nHe was on a really popular rival TV show to \"The Nickel Samurai\".\nPearl:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nThe victim was the action star, Juan Corrida. He got a huge push and rode the express train to stardom. I mean, even I know who he is!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, even I recognize his face...)\nGumshoe:\nBut I heard lately that Matt Engarde's been taking the wind out of his sail. I'm telling you, pal, as far as who's popular, those two are hogging all the limelight.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess there's no space for Mr. Powers at all, huh... Poor guy...)\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde... Um... That's the Nickel Samurai, right...?\nGumshoe:\nYup. I mean, no! You've got to say it with more umph! \"The Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n...Anyway, so now that Juan Corrida's gone, that means Mr. Engarde has the whole stage to himself, wouldn't you say?\nGumshoe:\nI wouldn't bet on it, pal. We can't have that happen, you know?\nPhoenix:\n\"Can't have that happen\"? (What's that supposed to mean, I wonder...)\nArrested? (appears after presenting Matt Engarde profile)\nPhoenix:\nWh-Why was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's not something I can tell you. We just started the investigation, so we don't want any leaks.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like yet another \"Steel Samurai\" hero is in hot water...)\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick... If Mystic Maya knew about this...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know. She'd make me take this case... I know...\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI was really shocked by what happened to her in that one case. I didn't know she had such an awesome power!\nPearl:\nAwesome power...?\nGumshoe:\nI thought maybe I should do some self-improvement and take up a hobby. So I went out and bought some Morning Glory seeds and planted them, pal.\nPhoenix:\n...That's a good way to improve yourself.\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. Well, it's nothing really...\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nThat girl is number three on my \"People I've Seen A Lot Of Lately\" list.\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then who's number one...?\nGumshoe:\nAs if you need to ask. It's YOU, pal!\nPhoenix:\nA-Ah... So who's number two?\nGumshoe:\nMaya Fey. ...But it looks like she's not around this time.\nPearl:\nIt must be nice to be such good friends with each other, isn't it Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think that's the real meaning of Detective Gumshoe's list...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nI look good! I think I've lost some weight, pal!\nPhoenix:\nIt's only wishful thinking.\nGumshoe:\nWishful thinking, huh? ... In that case, I wishfully think I've lost some weight!\nPhoenix:\n(I wishfully think he might face the facts one day...)\nGumshoe:\nLately, I've been on the instant noodles only diet, pal!\nJuan Corrida profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm not a real fan of action shows or anything... But I know who Juan Corrida and Matt Engarde are.\nPhoenix:\nYou can't talk about one without talking about the other, I guess.\nGumshoe:\nThey even debuted around the same time. So they have this real fiery rivalry with each other. Kinda like you and me, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(I never knew he thought of me as a rival...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nThe Nickel Samurai! He really took the Grand Prix tonight!\nPhoenix:\nMaya's a big fan of his.\nGumshoe:\nReally? ...Oh, I'm sorry then.\nPearl:\nWhy are you sorry?\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde was just arrested, pal. ...On suspicion of murdering Juan Corrida.\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nAny evidence\nPhoenix:\nWould you take a look at this for me?\nGumshoe:\nListen, pal... I'm not leaking any info about the evidence to you this time. If I do, my salary's really gonna get it... And then I won't even be able to get those instant noodles down at the discount market!\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nDo you know this person?\nGumshoe:\nYou meet a lot of people as a detective, pal. So we make extra sure to not forget people because that's our job. ...Now, having said that, I don't remember ever seeing this person before.\nPearl:\nWhich means that you're kind of forgetful, aren't you Mr. Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThat's not what it means... Not exactly anyway...\nAfter clearing \"The victim\" and \"Arrested?\" Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Hallway:\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPowers:\nHey! So what's going on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Juan Corrida has been killed.\nPowers:\nWh-Wh-What!? Juan is... He's...!?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde.\nPowers:\nY-You're joking, right!?\nPhoenix:\nNope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja.\nPowers:\nOoogh... Not again... I feel sick.\nPearl:\n\"Again\"...?\nPhoenix:\n...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls.\nPowers:\nI still can't believe... No way... No way Matt would...\nPhoenix:\n(...? What's Mr. Powers got in his hand...?)\nPowers:\n...Oh, before I forget... This... This is for you, Mr. Wright. I got this from the bellboy that came by earlier.\nRadio Transceiver received from Mr. Powers.\nPhoenix:\n...For me...? But why?\nPowers:\nI don't know. All he said was it was for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney.\nTalk\nMatt and Juan\nPowers:\nMatt is the most energetic and active actor out there right now. The Nickel Samurai really sealed his place as a pop idol, but... he kept adding fuel to the fire of his rivalry with Juan anyway.\nPearl:\nMr. Juan... He's the Jammin' Ninja, right?\nPowers:\nThose two would butt heads over everything they could think of. But I'd say that Matt was the one who almost always came out on top.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess some people only know how to relate to others by butting heads like a ram...)\nPowers:\nJuan said that he'd take Matt on this time too, so he joined a rival TV show.\nPearl:\nAnd that was \"The Jammin' Ninja\"...?\nPowers:\nThe stylish Nickel Samurai and the burning Jammin' Ninja... Well, things turned messy real fast with those two using their shows for their \"war\". And the final tally... Look around... It's pretty obvious how things ended up.\nPhoenix:\n(Matt even won the Grand Prix this year... The final win over his rival, I guess...)\nPress conference\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde was going to hold a press conference, wasn't he?\nPowers:\nThat's what I heard. Though if you wanted to get technical about it, it was the Nickel Samurai's conference.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai's...?\nPowers:\nYeah. He was supposed to wear his costume and give the press conference that way.\nPhoenix:\nHe was going to be in costume...? But why? (Changed from [So he was supposed to be in-costume...? But why?] in the original release)\nPowers:\nI'm not sure... They don't keep me in the loop anymore.\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nPowers:\nIt was almost right after you guys left. An old man who's a bellboy at this hotel showed up.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when he told you to give this to me...?\nPowers:\nYeah...\nPhoenix:\n(Why... Why give me this transceiver...?)\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nHey, where did Maya go off to?\nPhoenix:\nShe got a phone call.\nPowers:\nOh yeah, that's right. She was heading for the front desk just now. She sure stands out in a crowd, doesn't she?\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, then they're all shocked because they figure out who I am...\nPearl:\nI think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Mr. Powers is getting teary eyed.)\nJuan Corrida profile\nPowers:\nHe debuted around the same time as Matt in everything, you know.\nPearl:\nReally?\nPowers:\nYeah, it started out small... First it was singing contests, then swimming competitions... Then it was bowling tournaments, and then it was who could throw the best New Year's parties... Juan was always trying to one-up Matt. But lately, those two were escalating to more and more dangerous things... I thought that no good would come of it all, so I began to worry.\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad Juan's story ended so soon...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nPowers:\nMatt's younger than me, but you can practically see his star potential.\nPearl:\nHis star po-ten-shial...?\nPowers:\nI got his autograph the other day.\nPhoenix:\n...Feels kind of wrong now, doesn't it?\nPowers:\nI don't care what people say! Matt didn't kill Juan! I know he didn't!\nAny other profile\nPowers:\nUmm... I'm honored you're asking me, But I have no idea who this person is. Umm... Sorry...\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPearl:\nUm... I was just wondering... Where's Mystic Maya? She's been gone a long time.\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, she was only going to answer a phone call...)\nPearl:\nMaybe she got lost. I'll take a quick look around for her.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nPearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I... I'm not sure... (It's coming from this transceiver...) (Changed from [Did this transceiver just...?] in the original release)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, hello? Wright here...\n???:\nIs this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney?\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are...!?\n???:\nYou don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMaya:\nHeeelp! Niiiiick!\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\nMaya...?\n???:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Wouldn't you agree that the more important issue is the fate of the girl?\nPhoenix:\n(Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?) Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?\n???:\nCome now. Don't fall apart on me yet.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This... No! This can't be!)\n???:\nNow that I have your attention, Mr. Attorney, I have a modest proposal for you. If you do what I require, then I will return to you your valuable \"item\" unharmed. ...What is this called again in your fancy lawyer terms?\nPhoenix:\n...\"Kidnapping for ransom\"...\n???:\nYes, that's it. This is a kidnapping.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nPhoenix:\n(M-My sight... Everything's fading away... Maya... Maya... Maya's been kidnapped!)\n???:\n...--re you there? Mr. Attorney, are you there? (Changed from [You there? Mr. Wright, are you there?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nH-How much!? How much do you want!?\n???:\nVery good, Mr. Attorney. I'm glad you have such a good grasp of the situation.\nPhoenix:\nHurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya--\n???:\nMoney is not what I seek.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\n???:\nWhat I want is a certain verdict. I would like a complete acquittal.\nPhoenix:\nComplete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!?\n???:\nI am not the person you will be representing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\n???:\nYou are currently at the Gatewater Hotel, are you not? And I know that a murder has just taken place there.\nPhoenix:\nJuan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde...\n???:\nYou are, as expected, quite on top of things, Mr. Attorney. Now then. What I want is very simple. I want you to obtain a complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nM-Matt Engarde? But why?\n???:\nHe did not kill anyone. I can attest to that. However...\nPhoenix:\nH-However!? However what!?\n???:\nHowever, someone is framing him for the murder. A very smart someone who is setting him up to take the fall...\nPhoenix:\n... (If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?)\n???:\nYou are, of course, at liberty to take me at my word or not. (Changed from [You are, of course, at liberty to believe me or not.] in the original release) However, there is one thing you can take as fact. Right now, your very precious \"item\" is with me, in my possession.\nMaya:\nMmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\n???:\nYou have two days. Of course, tonight, he will be in questioning with the police. But the trial is in two days. At that trial, you will win a not guilty verdict. Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nO-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!?\n???:\nYes, exactly. I don't believe I was wrong in choosing you, so don't let me down.\nPhoenix:\nAagh!\n???:\nOh, yes, that's right. Now that I am playing the role of the kidnapper, I can't pass up this chance to say, \"And don't even think about callin' the cops!\" ...Hmm, not great, but you get the idea.\nPhoenix:\nD-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!?\n???:\nAlright, I'll tell you that much. My name is... ...De Killer.\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Wh-Where is Mystic Maya!?\nPhoenix:\n...She's been kidnapped.\nPearl:\nN-No... ... It's all my fault! If only I had gone with Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault, Pearls.\nPearl:\nBut it is! It is! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nPowers:\nMr. Wright... I think we... I think we should tell the police what it's [sic] going on...!\nPhoenix:\n(No! We can't do that! If we do, who knows what will happen to Maya...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What about the detective we saw earlier...?\nPhoenix:\n(...Detective Gumshoe!) Yes, that's it! Wait here, and I'll be right back!\nPowers:\nAlright! I'll take care of Pearl while you're away!\nHallway\nGumshoe:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANSOM!?\nPhoenix:\nShhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nGumshoe:\nWait, the deal is \"complete acquittal\" in exchange for Maya, you mean...? Then this means Matt Engarde is obviously the killer, pal! No doubt about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent...\nGumshoe:\nYou really believe what a KIDNAPPER tells you, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd on top of everything else, there's all this evidence we keep finding.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nThe forensics team's having a field day back there. (Changed from [The guys with the eagle eyes are really lapping it up like they just caught a huge fish.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nGumshoe:\nBut it's strange. There's so much evidence that it feels like something's wrong.\nPhoenix:\nThere's too much evidence? Is that possible? (Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being \"set-up\"...?)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, looks like you won't be leaving here tonight, pal. Just sit tight and cooperate with the investigation. Tomorrow you can start yours.\nPhoenix:\n...A-Alright... (Isn't there another way...?)\nGumshoe:\nWe've also got to be careful about pushing the kidnapper the wrong way.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right...\nDate:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0???\nMaya:\nNnngh... Oww, my head... (Wh-Where... Where am I!? I wonder if I'm still in that hotel... Wh-What happened to me...?) Nick... Pearly! ... (Come on, you guys. This isn't funny anymore...)\n...*ka-click*...\n???:\nI see you have awoken.\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you!?\n???:\nMe? ...I am known as \"De Killer\".\nMaya:\n\"D-De Killer\"!? You mean like an \"ASSASSIN\"!? (I... I'm too young to die!)\n???:\nDon't worry. You are not my target. ...For now anyway.\nMaya:\nA-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nick! Nick! Where are you!? ...Help me...\n???:\nYes, that's right. Only one person can save you now, and that is Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\n...Huh? Wh-What? Nick... Nick's going to save me...?\n???:\nCalm down and be a good girl. Think of this as a business transaction.\nMaya:\nA... A business transaction?\n???:\nI am going to contact him now. I hope you'll cooperate and play your assigned role well.\nMaya:\n...Nick... What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearly... (Changed from [What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearls...] in the original release) ...Sis...\n???:\n... Is this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney? ... You don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with...

Let's hurry and go see Mr. Engarde!\nPhoenix:\nWe have to wait a bit, Pearls. Visiting hours don't start until 9 AM, so...\nPearl:\nOh, I see. Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I had gone with you... (Changed from [Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I went with you that time...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls... She's been like this since last night... We managed to get home somehow, yesterday evening... Thanks to Detective Gumshoe gently holding her by the hand and leading her here... But by the looks of it, I don't think Pearls got any sleep at all last night.)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mystic Maya... She's alright, right!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she's alright. Either way, I'm going to save her. You can trust me on that.\nPearl:\nPlease... Please... Help her...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm only able to stay this calm and collected... Because Pearls is doing the crying for the both of us...)\nExamine\nAnywhere\nPhoenix:\n...No matter where I look in this familiar space I call my office... No, I can't let my mind wander now!

I have a thought...\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nPearl:\nYou're going to represent Mr. Engarde... aren't you?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I don't really seem to have a choice.\nPearl:\nUm, but what if... What if he... ...is the real murderer? What would you do then, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWould you fight to get a not guilty for a murderer to save Mystic Maya...?\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Let's talk to Mr. Engarde first, OK? ...We can think all the bad things we want, but it doesn't change a thing.\nPearl:\nY-Yeah, you're right... I'm sorry. I... I can't stop thinking about it...\nMaya's situation\nPhoenix:\nPearls... You're really worried about Maya, aren't you?\nPearl:\nI... I don't have anyone else left in this world.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean...?\nPearl:\nMy family's all gone...\nPhoenix:\n(...Her family...)\nPearl:\nMy father... He left my mother and the village behind and went away.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry...\nPearl:\nAnd... my mother... She did that thing... all for me...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nMystic Maya...

How are you today?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI know this situation might be a little tough for you...\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... We're...\nEngarde:\nOh, sorry dude...\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nI already signed up...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me...?\nEngarde:\nI already have life insurance. I signed up a long time ago cause my job is, you know...\nPhoenix:\n... Oh! No no no... We're not insurance salespeople!\nEngarde:\nReally...? Dude, I really don't need that right now either.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nFire extinguishers. I mean, this building isn't my house, so...\nPhoenix:\n... No no no... We're not here to sell you fire extinguishers either! I'm a lawyer. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nEngarde:\nA lawyer...? ... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my manager, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nThe Nickel Samurai sure is a strange person, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(I think \"strange\" is an understatement.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. You're just in time.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\nEngarde:\nYou're a lawyer dude, right? My manager's looking for a good one right now, so how about it?\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! This is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to make him let me take his case! I have to!)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera. Mr. Engarde keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nSorry to intrude, but I would like to ask you a few personal questions.\nEngarde:\nUm, that's OK, but dude, my autobiography's coming out soon, so... If I say stuff without the publisher's approval, then I'm gonna be in real hot water... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my publisher, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde is so lucky! He has so many people he can talk to.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... I don't know if he actually has anyone he can really talk to...)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. Like I thought, the publisher said it'd be \"real bad\" if I said anything, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(Does he have a mind of his own!?)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, I would like to ask you about the murder...\nEngarde:\nOh, are you covering this for a tabloid as a side job, dude? Um, um... Well, if you want my statement on this, you should ask through my staff...\nPhoenix:\nNo no no... I'm not asking on behalf of a tabloid...\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the president of the studio, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nIs he alright, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(If we're talking about Mr. Engarde's brain here, I wouldn't put my money on it.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. The studio president said, \"Even Neo Mt. Fuji itself knows that I'm not the murderer!\"\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? What's \"Neo Mt. Fuji\"...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a mountain in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo; the city the Nickel Samurai protects.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, this is an attorney's badge.\nEngarde:\nDude, I'm sorry, but I don't have the free time to be looking at things like that.\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nEngarde:\nI'm much too busy with Nickel Samurai stuff right now.\nEngarde:\nI don't have the time to take a lawyer's correspondence course...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does he believe I'm a salesman!? Insurance, then extinguishers... Now this!!)\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\n...? What's that?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a ticket for the press conference. You were going to give one after winning the Grand Prix, right?\nEngarde:\nHuh? Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. While you were in costume, no less. ([in costume] hyphenated in the original release)\nEngarde:\nUm, I never heard anything like that, dude. I only heard about the stage show. I always leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't know...? That's odd...)\nRadio Transceiver\nPearl:\n...Mr. Nick? What are you going to do with that?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know yet, but I figured I could at least show it to him...\nEngarde:\nIs that a transceiver? Hey, it looks like a real nice one, too.\nPhoenix:\nI got it as a \"present\" from someone.\nEngarde:\nHmm? Interesting.\nPhoenix:\nI've also been instructed to take your case.\nEngarde:\nIs that what you heard from the transceiver?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nEngarde:\nDude, that's terrible!

Is he a member of my fan club?\nPhoenix:\nThat's Mr. Powers. Isn't he supposed to be kind of like a mentor to you?\nEngarde:\nPowers...? Oh yeah! He's the guy on that kid's exercise program. I gave him an autograph just the other day.\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't see Mr. Powers as a mentor at all...)\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nMan, it's too bad he's dead...\nPhoenix:\nYou killed him... That's the most logical conclusion, don't you agree?\nEngarde:\nDude, what are you talking about!? You're making a huge mistake.\nPhoenix:\nIf that's such a mistake, then why did they issue an arrest warrant for you!?\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the guy in charge of this place, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nStars sure know a lot of people, don't they?\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that phone even really gets reception in here...)\nEngarde:\n...Um, I guess you're right about the warrant after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we might be making some progress here!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nEngarde:\nYeah... I'm such a handsome devil.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um, yeah...\nEngarde:\nAnd I'm way good at sports! Karate, tennis, judo, soccer, football, hockey, fencing...

Now you dudes use kids to pull in clients, too?\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't take me as your lawyer, then De Killer is going to...!\nEngarde:\n... Wait... What did you just say?\nPhoenix:\n\"De Killer\"...\nEngarde:\nD-De Killer!?\nPhoenix:\n(...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...)\nEngarde:\n... Alright, dude. I accept your terms.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEngarde:\nI'll let you represent me in court.\nPearl:\nW-We did it! We did it, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...)\nEngarde:\nGo ahead, ask me anything. I'll help out as much as I can...\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nEngarde:\nMan, I thank my lucky stars that people know my name.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're quite the hero, and you're in the national spotlight.\nPearl:\nI didn't know who he is... Does that mean I'm not a good citizen...?\nEngarde:\nAh, it's really great to be the Nickel Samurai. Dude, lately, I just keep on getting more and more popular.\nPhoenix:\n(True enough... \"The Nickel Samurai\" is very popular among high schoolers and secretaries right now. I guess Mr. Engarde has a way of catching the eyes of women...)\nEngarde:\nDo you know my motto? \"Refreshing like a spring breeze.\" That's what I am.\nPearl:\nA spring breeze...\nEngarde:\nThat's why this kind of scandal is disastrous, dude. I mean, even if I get out of here tomorrow, it's still gonna look bad.\nPhoenix:\n(But everyone loves a good scandal...) (Changed from [Everyone loves a good scandal...] in the original release)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me about your activities last night?\nEngarde:\nAfter I got the award, I took a break and went back to my room. I had that post-ceremony stage show to do. So I was in my Nickel Samurai costume.\nPhoenix:\nAnd you were alone the entire time?\nEngarde:\nMy manager was running around being busy, so yeah.\nPhoenix:\nBecause of the press conference you were supposed to have after the show?\nEngarde:\nI told you, dude. I have no idea about any press conference, alright?\nPhoenix:\n(That's strange... I thought the Nickel Samurai was going to confess something...)\nEngarde:\nAnyway, when I was leaving my room, that's when I noticed it was kinda noisy...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida was already dead at that time...?\nEngarde:\nYeah, that's what I gathered anyway from my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm beginning to gather that this guy can't do a thing on his own...) (Changed from [With the way he's always talking about his manager, it's as if she runs his life.] in the original release)\nEngarde:\nAnd that's when the detective in the green coat showed up. He searched me... And then, out of the blue, the dude arrested me.\nThe victim (appears after \"Matt Engarde\")\nPhoenix:\nAbout you and the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida, what sort of...\nEngarde:\nThat's got nothing to do with anything, dude. Man, with that face of his, you can't even tell he's the same age as me. And he wanted to try making a \"Jammin' Ninja\" movie, even though we all know it'd fail.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai still won in the end, right?\nEngarde:\nYeah. I took the Grand Prix by storm. So why would I, the winner, have any reason to kill the guy anyway? Dude, you'd think it'd be the other way around, you know?\nThe charge of murder (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know why you were arrested?\nEngarde:\nI guess maybe my full body search went badly.\nPhoenix:\nDid they find something on you?\nEngarde:\nThey found a button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nPhoenix:\nA button...?\nEngarde:\nI don't get it either. It was caught in the pleats of my samurai pants, or \"hakama\".\nPearl:\nAaah!\nEngarde:\nDude, I really think someone planted it there though. I'm serious.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that's what really happened...?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nPearl:\nLet's ask one last thing. Let's test Mr. Engarde to see if he really is innocent or not...\nPhoenix:\nW-We can do that...?\nPearl:\nYes. If you use this...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's Magatama!)\nPearl:\nHe won't be able to hide any secrets from you, Mr. Nick. I'm sure of it.\nPhoenix:\n(I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly.\nEngarde:\nWhat is it, dude?\nPhoenix:\nDid you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nPlease put the phone away and answer this question yourself.\nEngarde:\nAlright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWell, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nNothing. Not a chain or lock in sight.\nPearl:\nWhich means... I think it is alright to trust him.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.)\nEngarde:\nUm... The trial's tomorrow, right? I'm counting on you, dude.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 21, 11:34 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWell, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important...\nPearl:\nSo! So now what should we do!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer.\nPearl:\nOK! Then let's start looking!\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Actually, the crime happened at the recently completed hotel in the center of town, the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. ...Just how far are they going to expand their empire...?\nCharley the plant\nPearl:\nOh! I'll water it!\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK... I already did that...\nPearl:\n...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...)\nPoster\nPearl:\nThis is the Nickel Samurai... right?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's right.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!?\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.\nPearl:\nOh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either...\nPhoenix:\nI-It's OK, Pearls. Really.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh! I cleaned it up some more for you last night! ...Because I couldn't sleep...\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSince there were no Psyche-Locks, then that means we can trust Mr. Engarde to be innocent.\nPearl:\nI really feel much better knowing that. Ever since last night, I was so worried that I kept wondering... \"What if he is the real killer...? What then...?\"\nAny ideas\nPhoenix:\nHey, I have something I want to ask you, Pearls.\nPearl:\nOK, what is it?\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you so interested in how Maya and I get along? I mean, she and I don't have anything special go--\nPearl:\nHuh!? Wh-What do you mean!? B-But I thought... I thought you and Mystic Maya were... I-I've been mistaken all this time!? No way...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aaaah! She really wasn't kidding! Pearls actually believes Maya and I are... ...Maybe I should've just left it alone...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Stop it! Don't hide your true feelings from me!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! She slapped me!!)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPearl:\nThat's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nI guess?\nPearl:\nI feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...)\nMaya Fey profile\nPearl:\nOh, Mystic Maya... I wonder if you're alright...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure she's OK. We have to be patient for just one more day. I'm sure we can save her. Trust me.\nPearl:\nIf there's anything I can do, please tell me, OK!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPearl:\nTo tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me.\nPhoenix:\nI think your hair now suits you perfectly.\nPearl:\nR-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget*\nPhoenix:\n*fidget, fidget*\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPearl:\nI'm sure that Mr. Detective would be our ally if we asked!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I think so too. (Looking back, we've known each other for a while now... He's always been trustworthy... A bit \"off\", but still trustworthy. What a paradox.)\nWill Powers profile\nPearl:\nHe's a really kind and nice old man, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is really perceptive when it comes to people... But what does she mean by \"old man\"...?) Hey, Pearls? What about me...?\nPearl:\nWhat about you, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, I don't think I want to hear this...)\nAnything else\nPearl:\nUm, there are still so many things in this world that I don't understand yet. ...Honestly, I still don't have enough training.\nPhoenix:\nAh, no, it's OK. I don't have any ideas myself...\nPearl:\nI'm sorry. I'm really sorry!\nMarch 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEngarde:\nAh, the lawyer dude. So what did you find out?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... I'm still in the middle of investigating...\nEngarde:\nI see. ...But I've already told you everything I know, dude.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\nDude, like I told you, I don't know anything about that press conference. I leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(...This is harder than pulling bass from a river...)\nRadio Transceiver\nEngarde:\nSo, why are you carrying around that transceiver...?\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about it.\nEngarde:\nAnd why do you do everything it tells you to do? You know, the messages it sends you, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, he probably doesn't have anything to do with Maya's kidnapping.) ...That's a secret.\nEngarde:\nOK, whatever, dude.\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nLook, dude, I didn't kill him. I mean, the Nickel Samurai kicked the Jammin' Ninja's butt, right? So it's not like I felt threatened by the likes of him.\nPearl:\nBeing rivals sounds like a sad way to relate to another person...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nOldbag:\nHey! What do you think you're doing!? You can't come in without...\nPearl:\nGood morning.\nOldbag:\nHold on, it's YOU! What is going on around here!?\nPhoenix:\nU-Uh... Um...\nOldbag:\nI heard poor Juan was killed. Is that true!? It's a bad rerun is what this is. Another \"Steel Samurai\" doing the most evil of deeds.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you know... That's not entirely...\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know that I was a huge fan of Juan's! Why, oh why, do all the stars I'm interested in drop one by one like flies!? It's always been that way! Ever since I was a little girl in elementary school! The class hamster was fine until it was my turn to clean its cage, and then it died! The other kids started calling me the \"Queen Reaper\". I swear that's what they dubbed me! \"Whoever you name in your evil spell dies within three minutes,\" they would taunt.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened...\nOldbag:\nHmph! Don't push me, boy!\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? I... Um... I couldn't hear everything she said... because she was talking too fast...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...?\nOldbag:\nDon't boss me around, you spiky-haired, smarty-pants!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but...\nPearl:\n...Even Mr. Engarde himself didn't seem to know, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(How does the person who's supposed to give a conference not know about it...?)\nTalk\nThe victim\nOldbag:\nMy dear Hammer died a year ago in that dreadful murder. And only recently did I finally find a star that makes this heart go *badump* again.\nPhoenix:\n...I don't know what to say...\nOldbag:\nI ask you, why does every star I cheer for always ends [sic] up kicking the bucket?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nI'd watch your words! No one's going to get away with saying anything bad about my Juan!\nPhoenix:\nBut I haven't said anything...\nOldbag:\nWell, I don't believe a word that woman says anyway!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What woman?\nOldbag:\nThat irritating, backwater girl with the afro and the horrible country accent. I mean, what is that manner of speaking supposed to be? And why does she never stop? Honestly, women these days. They don't know the meaning of the word \"modesty\". When I was a young maiden, I was so beautiful even the flowers of the field blushed. But despite this, I pressed flowers, or read the stars, or wrote beautiful love poems or\nPhoenix:\n...Pearls? Are you thirsty?\nPearl:\nUm, a little.\nPhoenix:\nOK. I'll go get you some juice or something.\nPearl:\nTh-Thank you very much.\nOldbag:\nHey! Are you paying attention!? Young'uns today!\nPhoenix:\n(So I'm guessing Ms. Oldbag heard everything from Lotta...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nI want to ask you about what happened around the time of the murder...\nOldbag:\nAh, I don't know anything about that. I was here getting ready.\nPhoenix:\nGetting ready? For what...?\nOldbag:\nThe show, of course! ...Well, and the press conference afterwards.\nPhoenix:\n(Cue mysterious music for the magical press conference.)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I don't know anything about the murder.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see...\nOldbag:\n... But.\nPhoenix:\n?\nOldbag:\nBut if you're talking about what I saw, that's different. I saw it very clearly!\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nOldbag:\nI saw the most important moment of the night!\nWhat you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nTh-The most important moment!? You don't mean...!?\nOldbag:\nOh, so now you treat me with respect, you disrespectful child. When you speak to your elders, you should always be polite. Really, kids today.\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see!?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nOldbag:\nThe murder last night was gruesome, wasn't it? But then, what murder isn't?\nPhoenix:\n(Please don't stray onto another tangent... Please...)\nOldbag:\nIf you want to hear more, then show your respect and bring this lady a present!\nWhat you witnessed (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see on the night of the murder!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPearl:\nP-Please! Mystic Maya's life is...\nOldbag:\nAh, but you haven't given me my present yet. ...Hmm... Let's see... I'll only tell it to you if you can bring me Juan's autograph!\nPhoenix:\n(What an unreasonable request... You might as well have asked for the moon!)\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nI don't have anything to say to delinquents like you!\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr... She's clamming up like the old clam she is...)\nPearl:\nPlease! Anything would be helpful!\nOldbag:\nWell then, how about I tell you my measurements?\nPhoenix:\n...Um... No, that's okay... Really.\nPearl:\nShe really doesn't like you, does she Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI know, I know...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like the investigation is still in full swing. The hotel staff and the police are running around like a bunch of headless chickens.\nPearl:\nI wonder if we can do any investigating of our own in this kind of atmosphere...\nPhoenix:\n...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess.\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of, only to disappear... ...If only we had all gone together...\nChandelier\nPearl:\nThat is such a beautiful sight.\nPhoenix:\nThe chandelier?\nPearl:\nYes. But I can't believe it... I can't believe that such a terrible murder happened under such beautiful lights... It's shocking.\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was held on that stage just last night. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nWe ate at this table last night, didn't we?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nPearl:\nI was really happy then.\nPhoenix:\n(I wish I could make you smile again... Even for a second...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHallway\nLotta:\nHey! Yer here! Been waitin' for ya, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nLotta...\nLotta:\nHey! Mr. Cop fella! The thief's showed his face!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!?\nLotta:\nArrest him! Put him on trial! Find him guilty! Give him the death penalty!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong, Lotta!? Are you feeling alright?\nLotta:\nLooked here and there and up and down the mountain, but it ain't here! So why don'tcha just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep! (Changed from [So why don't ya just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep!] in the original release)\nPearl:\nUm, what are you looking for...?\nLotta:\nMy CAMERA! C-A-M-E-R-A! It's my life blood! I'm gonna die without my $700 camera!!\nPhoenix:\nY-Your camera...?\nLotta:\nLook, don't lots of people say the criminal always goes back to the scene of the crime!? And lookie lookie, here ya are!\nPhoenix:\nYep. Here I am... Faced with a Lotta trouble.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...?\nLotta:\nI didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nLotta:\nYeah, that's what I thought too, so I was a nice enough gal to lend a helpin' hand! ...Secretly, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(I have a feeling one of these days, I'm going to end up defending her in court...)\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\".\nLotta:\nSo that's the scene of the murder, I reckon. I thought somethin' had gone on that night, but I didn't never think it was murder.\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\".\nPearl:\nSo Mr. Engarde was here during his break, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what he claims. (Hmm... The crime scene... If he had wanted to get to Mr. Corrida's room... He would have had to pass through this hallway.)\nTalk\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!\nPearl:\nHuh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?\nLotta:\nI had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon. I made this itty-bitty scratch on it and the manager got all huffed up in the face... He gave me his talkin' to and was real mean about it too. He done made me cry at that!\nPearl:\nWhen did you lose your camera?\nLotta:\nLast night, after the murder happened. Musta been when I was busy runnin' around lookin' into things! That's when I lost sight of my dear, darlin' expensive sweetie!\nPhoenix:\nLotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours?\nLotta:\nI don't rightly know. I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?)\nLotta's Camera added to the Court Record.\nCamera (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera!

Yeah, actually I was here until around the time Mr. Engarde was arrested.\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you doing here...?\nLotta:\nYou sure you went to school, City Boy? Wherever Lotta Hart goes, there's a story to be found! A big scoop to be had!\nPhoenix:\nA big scoop...?\nLotta:\nI told ya before. I'm gonna be the best tabloid photographer the world's ever seen! Reckon course that means I'm always lookin' for the perfect shot!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what \"scoop\" she was after this time...?)\nLotta:\nAlthough, I was also on the look out for the other stars that were here, so... maybe I wasn't here the entire time...\nBig scoop (appears after \"Camera\" and \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nLotta... Are you sure you weren't here the entire time? So you could take a picture for your big scoop?\nLotta:\nWell... Maybe I was. But that's what real journalists do! I got some juicy inside info, so I thought to myself, why not get a picture for proof?\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of story was it that you would hang around here...?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nOops, sorry, Mr. Lawyer. Can't be tellin' you that. Trade secret, ya know?\nPhoenix:\n(Not again... Why does everyone have something to hide...?)\nPearl:\nWe've been stopped, haven't we?\nLotta:\nHa ha, yeah! Take that, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here is happy... Ms. Lotta and your \"I rule!\" smile...)\nBig scoop (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou were on the hunt for your big scoop last night?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nIt's just a bunch of tabloid photos. They ain't got nothing to do with the murder.\nPearl:\nIt looks like we have no choice but to remove the Psyche-Locks.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I guess so.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nLotta:\nHey, what's that? ...A press conference ticket? How come I ain't got myself one of them!?\nPhoenix:\nP-Please don't direct your anger at me...\nLotta:\nWhy in tarnations wasn't I invited to that!? How come someone on the bottom of the popularity chart like you got the info, but not me!? Info like that is worth nothin' to ya, am I right or what!?\nPhoenix:\n(...Is that the kind of person she thinks I am...?)\nPearl:\nAre you going to stand there and take that, Mr. Nick!?\nLotta's Camera\nLotta:\nNngh... And I just bought that camera... Who did it!? The thievin' rascal!\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't look straight at me while you're saying that...\nLotta:\nWhen I find the bugger who went and done this, they're gonna pay with a bullet!\nPhoenix:\n(And if you do that, don't expect me to defend you...)\nMaya Fey profile\nLotta:\nNow that I think about it, she isn't with y'all today, is she...?\nPearl:\nUm...\nLotta:\nShe's a spunky one! You shouldn't have been lettin' her outta yer sight. Who knows what she's up to now...\nPhoenix:\n(Like you're one to talk...)\nPearl:\n...\nPearl Fey profile\nLotta:\nAh, just wanna say sorry to ya.\nPearl:\nFor...?\nLotta:\nWell, I really, absolutely thought you were the murderer.\nPearl:\n...Huh?\nLotta:\nYou know... Last time, that thing with Maya Fey...\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!? But why!?\nLotta:\nI mean, you were all worked up, ya know?\nPearl:\n*sniffle* ...Meanie...\nPhoenix:\nLotta, that was very insensitive of you!\nLotta Hart profile\nLotta:\nThis kind of hairstyle is pretty hard to get, ya know. Hard to care for too. Just the other day, I ran my hand through my hair to fix it up, and suddenly, out pops this dollar coin! That's gotta be like hittin' the jackpot!\nPearl:\nWow, that's really lucky!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* What a deep conversation that was...)\nJuan Corrida or Matt Engarde profile\nLotta:\nI don't really care for 'em \"heroes\" or whatnot.\nPearl:\nOh, I see...\nLotta:\nAnd shows they got for kids, those adventures are just plain ol' borin'! Now, adults. We get more caught up in messy, sticky, real situations! ...Even me...\nPearl:\nO-Oh...\nLotta:\nSounds like the tyke's gettin' what I'm goin' with this!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a sec here! Don't go around getting her mixed up in things like that!\nSecurity Lady profile\nLotta:\nThis old granny? Ah, she kept on glarin' at me with those eyes of hers. As if it's my fault. Kept babblin' how she won't forgive people who write \"trash\" about her Juan... ...Ah, yeah, we sorta got into a little fight, ya know...\nPhoenix:\n(A \"little\" fight? Knowing those two, it was probably more of a blabbering contest.)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know anything...\nLotta:\n...*sigh*... I've told ya how many times now? I'm a journalist. I've got so much info runnin' laps in my head I forget things here and there!\nPearl:\nPlease don't get so worked up over this...\nLotta:\nHah! I don't care if ya beg me! \"Be extra tough on kids!\" That's this gal's motto on learnin' youngsters.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nUm... Where are we?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room.\n???:\nMay I help you with something?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... We're...\n???:\nYou're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail.\nPhoenix:\nUm... How did you know I'm his lawyer...?\n???:\nYou were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer.\nPearl:\nWow...\n???:\nIt's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either.\nPearl:\nIt's really not the time to be showing off, Mr. Nick.\nAndrews:\nI am Adrian Andrews. I hate to waste time, so let's get down to business.\nPhoenix:\nA-Alright... (She may be of small stature, but appearances can be deceiving...)\nExamine\nRed suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's probably Mr. Engarde's suitcase. For someone who was only going to be here for the award show, this is a lot of stuff. Looks like he has about three days' worth of clothes in here.\nPearl:\nStars really are different from us, aren't they...?\nBedroom\nPhoenix:\nThat's the bedroom over there.\nPearl:\nThat's a bed...? Wow, they have really big beds here!\nSofa\nPhoenix:\nThere's some samurai-looking clothes on the sofa here.\nPearl:\nUm, I think that jacket looking thing is called a \"happi\".\nPhoenix:\n(Whatever it is, I'm sure something like that would make a great souvenir. Maya would be absolutely thrilled...)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nLooks like dishes left over from dinner... A dinner for two, at that.\nPearl:\nI'm sure they're Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews' plates.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they had T-bone steaks... What's with Global Studios and T-bone steaks...?\nPlate on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a giant bone sitting on the plate.\nPearl:\nI... I don't really like meat...\nPhoenix:\n(...? There's something... weird about this plate... I just wish I could put my finger on what it is...)\nTalk\nNight of the murder\nAndrews:\nI assume the first thing you need to know is what everyone was doing that night, correct?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, that is correct.\nAndrews:\nThen I will tell you. Before the award ceremony, I had dinner with Mr. Engarde. In this very room, I might add.\nPhoenix:\n\"Dinner\"? What did you eat?\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate to waste time with trifling details. If you took a look at the table yourself, you wouldn't need to ask me.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet she's a lot of fun at parties...)\nAndrews:\nWhen the award show was starting, I headed for Viola Hall.\nPhoenix:\nAnd after the show ended, you came back to this room...?\nAndrews:\nNo, I had some small errands to run. I helped with the preparations in the lobby.\nPhoenix:\nOh... (Preparations for the post-ceremony show, I guess...)\nAndrews:\nWhen it was time for the post-ceremony show, I came back to call for Mr. Engarde. After that, I went to visit Mr. Corrida...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you found his body, isn't it?\nAndrews:\n...\nPearl:\nYou really held strong through everything...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... She does seem to be mentally tough as nails...)\nRelation to Engarde\nPhoenix:\nUm, so... About you and...\nAndrews:\nStop right there. You aren't seriously about to ask how Mr. Engarde and I are related, are you? (Changed from [Don't expect me to believe you have been talking to me without knowing how we relate.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nAndrews:\nI have no idea how he could chose [sic] you as his lawyer. (Changed from [I have no idea why Mr. Engarde chose you as his lawyer.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Why did she have to go and say something like that...?)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Calm down and hang in there. I'll give you a shoulder rub to relieve your stress later, alright?\nAndrews:\nI already gave you my name earlier, but I'll add that I'm Mr. Engarde's manager.\nPhoenix:\nHis manager... Speaking of managers, did the victim, Mr. Corrida have one?\nAndrews:\nNo, he did not.\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't?\nAndrews:\nGlobal Studios has a very different policy from Worldwide Studios in that Worldwide Studios does not assign individual managers to their stars.\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nAndrews:\nThis industry is very ruthless and unforgiving. Actually, you look quite ruthless and unforgiving yourself to your poor partner. Dragging a little girl like her to places like this. Honestly.\nPearl:\nYou're wrong! I... I'm doing this to help Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Calm down and hang in there. I'll buy you a juice later, alright?\nPearl:\nNngh...\nMotive for murder (appears after presenting Juan Corrida profile)\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any ideas?\nAndrews:\nAs to...?\nPhoenix:\nAs to why Mr. Corrida was murdered?\nAndrews:\nWhy would you ask me about such a thing...?\nPhoenix:\nI'm just doing my job. So, do you have any ideas?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nSorry, but there's nothing more I have to add to this conversation.\nPearl:\nIs it a Psyche-Lock, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYes... There's getting to be more and more of these lately.\nMotive for murder (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou know something, don't you? About why Mr. Corrida was murdered...\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nAndrews:\nWhy are you asking me? Don't tell me you can see inside my heart.\nPhoenix:\n(No, but I can see the locks you have on your psyche.)\nPearl:\nIf you don't remove her locks...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it's worthless to even ask...)\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one taking care of the arrangements for this press conference, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, that's right.\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Engarde said he \"didn't know\" about it.\nAndrews:\n... Is that what he said...?\nPearl:\nHuh...?\nAndrews:\nActually, I didn't know all the details either. It was a request from the publicity department. All I did was help out and do what I was asked.\nPearl:\nOh... I see.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder about that... I wouldn't take her to be the type of person to do something without knowing the details.)\nWill Powers profile\nAndrews:\nThat's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be.\nPhoenix:\n(Urk... What a horrible thing to say...)\nAndrews:\n...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? For a second, her face twisted in pain...)\nPearl:\nI wonder if something happened to Ms. Andrews...\nJuan Corrida profile\nPhoenix:\nDid you know the victim, Mr. Corrida?\nAndrews:\nYes, I knew him. The world is such a small place, after all.\nPearl:\nDid you know about his rivalry with the Nickel Samurai?\nAndrews:\nHonestly, they were like children when it came to that. Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most trivial things. (Changed from [Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most uninteresting things.] in the original release) ... If either one of them wasn't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die. (Changed from [If either one of them weren't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n! (...I've got a hunch that this woman knows more than she's letting on... She must know why Juan Corrida was killed!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nAndrews:\nI asked to become Mr. Engarde's manager. He's a pleasure to manage with his nice disposition.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Mr. Engarde does seem like a rather weak-willed man; always doing as he's told...)\nPearl:\nHe's always saying, \"my manager,\" right Mr. Nick?\nAndrews:\n...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAndrews:\nI hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... (Take away that layer of sarcasm and she really does seem to hate herself...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, I'd like to ask you about this...\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Where are we...?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Juan Corrida's room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Corrida...?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim... Which makes this the crime scene, too.\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's you! So!? What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!?\nPhoenix:\nNot yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there?\nPhoenix:\n(I just want Maya to be alright...)\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nWe don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal.\nPhoenix:\nCan you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...?\nGumshoe:\nJust this once... \"Special circumstances\" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here.\nPhoenix:\nThank you.\nGumshoe:\nOh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy.\nPearl:\nWow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you!\nGumshoe:\nHa ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I got a map!\nPhoenix:\nThat's great, Pearls!\nPearl:\n... Um... But Mr. Nick, I can't read what it says...\nHotel Guidemap added to the Court Record.\nExamine\nRefrigerator\nPhoenix:\nThere are all sorts of things in this refrigerator...\nPearl:\nThe carrot juice bottle and the tomato juice bottle are both empty...\nPhoenix:\nEmpty...? (It's too much of a hassle to throw them away, I guess.) They're all vegetable juices. I guess he must've been a real health nut.\nPearl:\n...Oh! There's a beet, some ketchup, and a bottle of strawberry jam too!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe red was his favorite color...?\nStuffed bears\nPearl:\nWow, there are a lot of bears!\nPhoenix:\n(Alarm clock ones, collector's editions, stuffed teddies, plastic models... It's pretty overwhelming... Is there a kind of bear he doesn't have...?)\nPearl:\nThere's even a few in the trash can...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I get the feeling maybe the guy didn't really like bears.\nPearl:\nPoor teddies...\nIt's hard to \"bear\" with all these problems... Growl! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n... (I don't think I want to \"bear\" with the trauma the last case caused me...)\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mr. Nick?\nDesk\nPearl:\nHmph! It's so messy here!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls really likes things neat and tidy, I take it...)\nPearl:\nThere are a lot of electronic things in here that I've never seen before. Hey, Mr. Nick! Tell me what they are, pretty please?\nPhoenix:\nOK. That over there is a \"watch\". You wear it on your wrist.\nPearl:\n... I know what a watch is...\nPhoenix:\n(Oops. For a second there, I forgot I was talking with Pearls, not Maya...)\nBlue suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's a suitcase. There are so many things in it that I bet it barely closes. There's his clothes, a dryer, an electric shaver, a calculator...\nPearl:\nDo all stars pack too much stuff like Mr. Corrida?\nTable on right\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Mr. Corrida had dinner last night.\nPearl:\nThis bottle... It's tomato juice.\nPhoenix:\n(We had a lot of food at the award show last night... But I wonder if the stars had gone onstage after only eating a meager meal like this...)\nBedroom\nPearl:\nSo that's a bed, right?\nPhoenix:\nYup. It's big, but it's a bed.\nPearl:\nAaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft!\nPhoenix:\n(Big beds must be a rarity for her...)\nScattered items near guitar case\nPhoenix:\nBottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.\nPearl:\nWhat's this glass fragment from...?\nPhoenix:\nA flower vase maybe? There are flowers on the floor, but I don't know what they are.\nPearl:\nYou don't know much about flowers, do you Mr. Nick?\nGuitar case\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.\nPearl:\nThat's strange. The guitar is not here...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he forgot to bring it to the show?\nPearl:\nBut Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item...\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid...\nPearl:\nYeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nGuitar Case added to the Court Record.\nGuitar case (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess.

There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nWine glass\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nPearl:\nBut doesn't it seem weird?\nPhoenix:\n...What seems weird?\nPearl:\nI mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor.\nPhoenix:\n... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)\nPearl:\nWhy is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?\nWine Glass added to the Court Record.\nWine glass (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww.

(She's right.

(Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIt should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Here's a picture.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a knife in his chest.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal, that's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was stabbed to death...)\nGumshoe:\nThey're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now.\nPhoenix:\nThere were fingerprints on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nYup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nCause of death (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what was the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nWell, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal.

And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nReason for arrest\nPhoenix:\nWhy was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nBecause we had evidence on him.\nPearl:\nEvidence...?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the victim, Juan Corrida, really put up a big fight.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, one look at the crime scene and you can tell. There's signs of a struggle everywhere.\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah. During the fight, his button came off...\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde said something about a button... Something like, one of the Jammin' Ninja's buttons got caught in his \"hakama\"...)\nGumshoe:\nBut that's not all...\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nThere was a witness, pal.\nPhoenix:\nA witness!? Wh-Who is it!?\nGumshoe:\nThat lady... Ms. Oldbag.\nPhoenix:\n(Please... Anyone but her!)\nGumshoe:\nThe prosecution has plenty of evidence to make a solid case... Not to mention there's something around where the vic was that's a little off. (Changed from [Not to mention there's something at the crime scene that was a little off.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nSomething that's a little off...? As in...? (Changed from [Something that was a little off...? As in...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nAs in, that's for you to figure out, pal!\nPearl:\nAlright, let's try to figure it out, Mr. Nick!\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nGumshoe:\nThat's your \"present\" from the kidnapper, huh? While you're talking, it sends and receives radio waves... If we could trace that...\nPearl:\nYeah! We could use it to find out where the bad guy is!\nPhoenix:\n(It uses radio waves, huh?)\nGumshoe:\nI got it! I'll go find a radio scanner, and let you borrow it, pal!\nGuitar Case\nPhoenix:\nWhat can you tell me about this guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nOh, that. This is just what I heard, pal, but that's the Jammin' Ninja's signature item.\nPhoenix:\nThe guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nNo, not that! What do you take me as? I mean the guitar inside, of course!\nPearl:\nBut... The guitar is missing.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, we looked for it too. It's not normal for a person to forget to bring their most famous item to an award show.\nPhoenix:\n(It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...)\nWine Glass\nPhoenix:\nSo about this wine glass...\nGumshoe:\nAh, so you noticed it, pal. The whole crime scene was a mess, but this glass was the only thing that was untouched.\nPhoenix:\nYou noticed that too, Detective Gumshoe...?\nGumshoe:\nNo, actually Ms. von Karma noticed it first.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Pearls noticed it before me too... Hey, wait a minute. So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's here at the hotel...? (Changed from [So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's coming here...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah, she's around. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal. (Changed from [Yeah, she's coming. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal.] in the original release) Especially if she catches you in here. (Changed from [I think it'd be best if you didn't bump into her here.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou can bet the instant I see her, I'll be running the 1,000 meter dash.\nCrime Photo\nGumshoe:\nYou look at this photo and you can't help it. It makes you want to say, \"I can't believe this is the scene of a murder.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Stabbed with a knife after a struggle... A clue is sleeping in this photo somewhere... I know it.)\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm sorry.\nPhoenix:\n...For what?\nGumshoe:\nI really want to help you look for her, pal.\nPearl:\nMr. Detective...\nGumshoe:\nIf anything happens, let me know, OK? I want to help in any way I can!\nPearl Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, little missy. Listen good, OK?\nPearl:\nOK. What is it?\nGumshoe:\nDon't ever pick up a whip, OK? Don't even think about it.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nGumshoe:\nIf you ever find yourself thinking you want one, try to make due with a good slap to the face. Got that? Slap the person in the face. Promise me, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(Personal experience tells me Gumshoe should be careful what he wishes for...)\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nIf I had a choice, she would be number three on my list of people I don't want to see.\nPhoenix:\n...Because I'm in the number one spot?\nGumshoe:\nDon't get all high and mighty on me here. You've taken a tumble into second place, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really? Then who's in first...?\nGumshoe:\nMs. von Karma's miles and miles ahead of you in this race.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh...\nGumshoe:\nShe's really scary... Right now... M-Ms. von Karma... You really don't...\nPhoenix:\n(He's so scared of her that he's whispering now...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, why don't we let bygones be bygones, pal? Look, this guy is guilty. A buck says so.\nPhoenix:\nOne dollar...? Sure you're not talking about Pearls' allowance money?\nGumshoe:\nI... I can't bet any more than that... My salary... It's...\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't matter what we think... I still have to defend Mr. Engarde in court or else!)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick...\nSecurity Lady profile\nGumshoe:\nI thought she was an alien from outer space.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, probably because she's wearing that strange helmet.\nGumshoe:\nNah, even with her helmet off, I thought she was an alien, pal.\nPhoenix:\n... I think that's probably best kept to yourself, if you know what I mean...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nGumshoe:\nShe's Mr. Engarde's manager, right? No matter what I do, I really stink at talking with people like her. As soon as I open my mouth, I get all flustered. See, she's one of those women with a brain. She's someone who \"gets things done\".\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she does give that sort of impression, like she's got it all together.\nGumshoe:\nCompared to her, you can easily tell I'm a \"can't do anything right\" kind of guy. That's why I get all nervous and start messing up.\nPhoenix:\n(I feel sort of bad for him...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you know about this?\nGumshoe:\nUm... There's nothing special I can tell you about this, pal. Look pal, we don't have a lot of time. Why don't you show me something more important? If Ms. von Karma saw me here like this... I'd have to switch sides real fast...\nAfter clearing all Talk options, examining guitar case, and presenting Wine Glass:\n...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*...\nPearl:\nWh-What's that beeping noise, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I've heard this sound somewhere before...)\nGumshoe:\nIt's Ms. von Karma...\nPearl:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nFor some reason, whenever I hear that sound, she pops out of nowhere and whips me! (Changed from [Whenever I hear that sound, for some reason, she pops out of nowhere and whips me!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, that's exactly what happen [sic] the last time...) (Changed from [Come to think of it, that did happen the last time...] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nS-Sorry! I've gotta make myself scarce! Later, pal! Eowww!\nvon Karma:\nAt last, you reveal your true nature... Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(*gulp* Would it be too much to ask for you to be nice to me for a change...?)\nvon Karma:\nSo you're the type to steal information from pitifully hopeless detectives! That's very dishonorable of you!\nPhoenix:\n(Owww!)\nvon Karma:\nHey! Don't you dare run away, Scruffy McTrenchcoat!\nGumshoe:\nAh!\nvon Karma:\nI didn't think the detectives of this country could be this pitiful...\nGumshoe:\nUwaah!\nvon Karma:\nDetective! Come over here for a second!\nGumshoe:\nYeooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!\nvon Karma:\n...Hmph. I feel better knowing at least you were man enough to face your punishment.\nPhoenix:\n(He was so scared, he just froze up on the spot...)\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright! You... You have soiled my perfect prosecution record. I'll never forget that. This time... Victory is mine!\nPhoenix:\n... Victory is yours? Is that all this means to you...?\nvon Karma:\nWh-What...!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nvon Karma:\n... H-Hmph! Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin. (Changed from [Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!\nvon Karma:\nThis isn't over yet... I swear on my family's honor!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! What did she throw at me NOW...!? (Changed from [Ow! Now what did she throw at me...!?] in the original release) What is this...?)\nGumshoe:\n...Well, I guess this means I've gotta get back to the precinct now, pal. If you ever need me, come down to the Criminal Affairs Department, alright? And if you can, try not to let Ms. von Karma see you...\nExamine\nPaper on desk\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, what's this piece of paper...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's called an \"autograph\".\nPearl:\nAuto-graff?\nPhoenix:\nIt's got Mr. Corrida's name written on it, so it's his autograph.\nPearl:\nI can't read it at all. To be honest, I've never seen writing that looks like this.\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's a special way of writing called \"cursive\". Look here. See how it says, \"To my dearest Wendy\" in more normal letters here?\nPearl:\nTh-This sloppy, unreadable writing! It's crazy and cruel to give this to someone!\nPhoenix:\n(Hold on...)\nPearl:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nWendy... I've heard that name somewhere before...\nMr. Corrida's Autograph added to the Court Record.\nAfter visiting Enguarde's Hotel Room:\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPowers:\nOh, Mr. Wright! How are you?\nPhoenix:\nAh, Mr. Powers. Have you been here the entire time?\nPowers:\nYeah. People connected to the murder aren't allowed to go home, let alone leave...\nTalk\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me a little more about the Nickel Samurai TV show?\nPowers:\nOK. \"The Nickel Samurai\" is an action hero program aimed towards kids. It's the sequel to \"The Steel Samurai\".\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nPowers:\nThis time, there are three Samurai Brothers: Aluminum Samurai, Tin Samurai... And of course, the Nickel Samurai. It's a love \"Y\" in Neo Olde Tokyo!\nPhoenix:\nI see... ... W-Wait... A love what...?\nPowers:\nA love \"Y\". This girl, Sayo, works at a tea shop and all three guys fall for her at the same time.\nPhoenix:\nOh... I guess the \"Y\" shape is like the 3 brothers colliding over this one girl?\nPowers:\nAnyway, Sayo is actually the daughter of the evil Strawberry Clan's leader!\nPhoenix:\nSounds like an unusual situation. Like Romeo and Juliet... times three.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah... Strange thing is, this sort of forbidden love story is really big with the office ladies.\nPearl:\nUm...\nPowers:\nYes, Pearl?\nPearl:\nWh-What happens next!? I want to know! Ms. Sayo... Does Ms. Sayo fall in love? She does, doesn't she?\nPowers:\nEvery Sunday at 8 AM.\nPearl:\nI'm going to stop watching \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\" starting this week!\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe she's really considering it!)\nJammin' Ninja\nPhoenix:\nSo what's the \"Jammin' Ninja\" TV show like?\nPowers:\nIt started from a remake of an old movie, to tell you the truth. The Jammin' Ninja is, like the Samurai shows, aimed towards kids. It's the story of a ninja who can't climb a wall, but became a big pop star.\nPhoenix:\n...Uh, what?\nPowers:\nHe was a really lousy ninja. Absolutely couldn't do any ninja things right at all. But boy could he sing! With his trusty bright red guitar in hand, he took the ancient world by storm.\nPhoenix:\nA... A ninja... With a bright red guitar...!?\nPowers:\nAnd then, the final fight in front of his beloved Princess Misola! \"Jammin' versus the Muromachi Five!\" Suddenly! Our brave hero catches a not so Jammin' cold the night before Battle 3!\nPhoenix:\nAww, that's too bad for him...\nPowers:\nY-Yeah... But this kind of pop music-based love story is something high school girls really like.\nPearl:\nUm...\nPowers:\nYes, Pearl?\nPearl:\nWh-What happens next!? I want to know!\nPearl:\nJammin'... The Jammin' Ninja! Will he be able to sing!? What about Princess Misola!?\nPowers:\nEvery Sunday at 8 AM.\nPearl:\nUmm... Which show should I watch...? Hmm...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe she's really  considering it!)\nThe gossip on Adrian (appears after presenting Adrian Andrews profile)\nPhoenix:\nWould you mind telling me about this \"gossip\"?\nPowers:\nAh, so you ARE interested in it! I figured you would be! (Changed from [Ah, so you're interested in it too! I figured you would be!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPowers:\nI have such a weakness for celebrity gossip, too.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh really... You too, huh...?\nPowers:\nYeah. So take a look at this!\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like a tabloid Ms. Oldbag would read...) Alright, let's see here... \"Jammin' Midnight Rendezvous!?\"\nPowers:\n\"...to the mysterious, yet beautiful manager to the stars, Ms. A. A.!\" ...Y-You see now, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\nPowers:\nYou can stop pretending to be in the dark, Mr. Wright! Juan Corrida didn't have a manager of his own.

That woman couldn't do anything like that.\nPhoenix:\nIn court today, there will be a mountain of evidence that will implicate you.\nEngarde:\nA mountain of evidence...?\nPhoenix:\nI'm certain there is someone out there trying very hard to pin this whole thing on you.\nEngarde:\nPlease, Mr. Lawyer! Dude, like I said yesterday... I'm \"refreshing like a spring breeze\", alright? I can't let any sort of scandal ruin that.\nPhoenix:\nI understand...\n???:\nWell, it's almost time.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nWe must get a complete acquittal today.\nPhoenix:\nI know... But I can't focus on Maya's situation right now. (Changed from [I can't focus on Maya's situation right now.] in the original release) ...Or Pearls' either.

Well, let's get going!\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\n(It's him!)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nThis is Wright!\n???:\nGood morning. This is it, Mr. Attorney; the day of the trial.\nPhoenix:\nMaya...

Are the prosecution and defense ready?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nJudge:\n... I say! Mr. Wright! What happened to Ms. von Karma!?\nPhoenix:\nI-I don't know, Your Honor! (Why are you getting mad at me!?)\nBailiff:\n...Your Honor!\nJudge:\nPlease be quiet, bailiff. Court is in session. If you must tell me something, please keep it brief. Now then, what is it?\nBailiff:\nProsecutor... Prosecutor von Karma has... This morning, Ms. von Karma was shot by an unknown gunman!\nJudge:\n... WWWWWWWHAT!?\nPhoenix:\nSh-Shot!?\nMia:\nSomehow... I think this is the \"present\" that man was talking about.\nPhoenix:\nHis \"present\"...!\nMia:\nMs. von Karma is one of the top prosecutors in the country at the moment. If she were to disappear...

Y-Y-You're...\nPhoenix:\n(I thought he'd show up...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Your Honor... Due to the circumstances, Ms. Franziska von Karma can not appear in court today. I, Miles Edgeworth, will be taking her place. The prosecution is ready... naturally.\nEdgeworth:\nMs. von Karma was shot in her right shoulder, and is currently undergoing surgery. Luckily, I have looked this case over and am familiar with the details. The prosecution seeks to prove the guilt of Mr. Matt Engarde.\nJudge:\nTh-The court acknowledges the prosecution.\nEdgeworth:\n...Wright. I finally found the answer I was struggling for on my long journey this past year. By the time this case comes to an end, you too, will know the answer.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, the prosecution would like to call its first witness... Please bring Detective Gumshoe to the witness stand!\nEdgeworth:\nWitness, your name and occupation.\nGumshoe:\nMy name's Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm a detective down at the precinct... for now.\nJudge:\n\"For now\"...?\nGumshoe:\nAfter this trial's over... I'm supposed to turn in my badge, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(D-Detective Gumshoe...)\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution has no need for a depressed witness. Lift your head up and face forward like a proud officer, Detective Dick Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nNow, let's have your testimony. If we want to explore the various facets of this case, we must start with that.\nMia:\nGet ready, Phoenix. This is going to be one very rough fight.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... It would have to be with Edgeworth as my opponent.  (The answer he was \"struggling\" for... Interesting... Show me this \"answer\" you finally found, Edgeworth...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Bare Facts of the Case --\nGumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... After the award ceremony ended, the victim was alone in his room...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir! Both the victim and defendant went alone to their rooms, sir.\nJudge:\nI see. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- Bare Facts of the Case --\nGumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWould you please give us a brief timeline of what happened after the ceremony?\nGumshoe:\nOK, pal. The ceremony started at 6 PM. It ended around 8 PM... and then there was a short break. A special post-ceremony show was supposed to start in the lobby 30 minutes later.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when the victim's body was found, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nWhich is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period.\nJudge:\nHmm... Please continue with your testimony, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe person who discovered the victim's body was Adrian Andrews, correct?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Adrian Andrews\" you're talking about?\nGumshoe:\nShe's the defendant, Matt Engarde's, manager. She's a really pretty lady... sir.\nJudge:\nAh, so she's a pretty lady... I wonder if she will grace us with her presence...\nGumshoe:\nWhen the post-ceremony show was about to start, she went to get Mr. Engarde. After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir.\nJudge:\nI see... And that's when she found the victim's body...\nGumshoe:\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana.\nJudge:\nMmm... \"Banana\"...\nGumshoe:\nUm, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir.\nJudge:\nAh, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana.\nPhoenix:\nThen, what about the knife...?\nGumshoe:\nIt seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death.\nJudge:\nHmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nPress (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death...

We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.\nGumshoe:\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...\nGuitar Case updated in the Court Record.\nPress (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal.

Ah, so much for my theory then...\nGumshoe:\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhat convinced you it had nothing to do with the case?\nGumshoe:\nThe guitar wasn't at the Gatewater Hotel that night.\nJudge:\nWell then, where was it?\nGumshoe:\nThe bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir.\nJudge:\nSo you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar.\nPhoenix:\nSo that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nMia:\nOur first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.\nPhoenix:\nBut there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...\nMia:\nMaybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.\nPhoenix:\nIf you say so...\nMia:\nOf course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?\nAfter pressing third, fourth, and fifth statements:\nEdgeworth:\nI believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nWhich brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.\nPhoenix:\n(Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)\nJudge:\nVery well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Why Arrest Engarde? --\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!\nJudge:\nHmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.\nGumshoe:\nIt was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.\nKnife added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\n...And there's this button.\nJudge:\nThat was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nJammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nAll of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?\nPhoenix:\nHmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!\nEdgeworth:\nYou can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.\nPhoenix:\nGrrrrrrrrr...\nCross Examination\n-- Why Arrest Engarde? --\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown.\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end...\nJudge:\nThat is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls!\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah, I guess, but...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all!\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUm, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nDetective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired.\nGumshoe:\nEh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's...\nEdgeworth:\nI look forward to your pension negotiations.\nGumshoe:\nN-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony.\nGumshoe:\n*sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too...\nEdgeworth:\nDetective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)\nGumshoe:\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any proof that button belonged to the victim?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nOh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\".\nGumshoe:\nHuh? But can't you tell by just looking at it?\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nA-And the victim's blood is on it.\nPhoenix:\nAnyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward.\nGumshoe:\n... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Thread.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nThe button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal!\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nMia:\nThat's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.\nGumshoe:\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhen was this button found?\nGumshoe:\nPretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder...\nEdgeworth:\nThe police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people...\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)\nGumshoe:\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHow were the fingerprints arranged on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nBy examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...?\nGumshoe:\nOh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe the bumbling of this department...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?\nGumshoe:\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife!\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...)\nMia:\n...Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nThere's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.\nPresent Knife\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"\nPhoenix:\n(A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)\nMia:\nBe grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.\nPhoenix:\nWe're still in a world of trouble...\nMia:\nWell, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nWait a second!\nGumshoe:\nWh-What?\nPhoenix:\nSo the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The defendant...\nPhoenix:\n...Did not buy this knife.\nGumshoe:\nH-Huh!?\nPhoenix:\nTake a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.\nGumshoe:\n...Huh?\nJudge:\nIt has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...\nGumshoe:\n\"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.\nPhoenix:\nThat's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.\nGumshoe:\n... Uh oh.\nPhoenix:\nThe murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!\nJudge:\nYes, that is very true! This is a very big...\nEdgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...\nJudge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nI think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.\nPhoenix:\nH-How so!?\nEdgeworth:\nI admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.\nGumshoe:\n...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*\nEdgeworth:\nThe question is... Where did this knife come from?\nJudge:\nWh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.\nJudge:\nThere is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?\nEdgeworth:\nIf it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.\nJudge:\nAmazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.\nMia:\nIt seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...\nPhoenix:\n(This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)\nJudge:\nA murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.\nEdgeworth:\nI can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.\nPhoenix:\n(Evidence not yet shown...?)\nMia:\nHe means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.\nJudge:\nWhat does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well...\nMia:\nPhoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...\nPhoenix:\n(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?\nActually, I do.\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"\nNo, not right now.\nPhoenix:\n(This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.)\nJudge:\nLooks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means this court is adjourned.\nMia:\nPhoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!)\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"\nPhoenix:\nThere's one...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nOne piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.\nPhoenix:\n(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)\nJudge:\nYou may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?\nPresent Wine Glass\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong.\nJudge:\nI can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nI am a man of my word, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penalty\nJudge:\nThis... is a wine glass, is it not?\nPhoenix:\nPlease look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, yes, I see your point.\nPhoenix:\nHowever! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!\nJudge:\n...\nGumshoe:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nW-Well? What do you all have to say...?\nJudge:\nAh, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!\nJudge:\nYou can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is it, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nYour opinion...\nEdgeworth:\n...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.\nPhoenix:\n...What!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.\nJudge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)\nIt's possible.\nPhoenix:\n(It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...)\nMia:\nYou can't think like that, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nRight now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(So in other words, push as far as we can go...)\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"\nThere's no way.\nPhoenix:\n(If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!)\nMia:\nThey just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough!\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"\nPhoenix:\nThe defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!\nJudge:\nHmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?\nPhoenix:\n(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)\nEdgeworth:\nUnlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nEdgeworth:\nYou're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?\nPhoenix:\nTh-Then...\nEdgeworth:\nOf course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.\nPhoenix:\nFingerprints...\nEdgeworth:\nThere were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.\nJudge:\nOnly one? Well, whose were they!?\nEdgeworth:\nThey were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!?\nWine Glass updated in the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nThat is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.\nJudge:\nHmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.\nPhoenix:\nGrrr!\nEdgeworth:\nI've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!\nJudge:\nW-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.\nPhoenix:\n\"Another witness\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!\nMia:\nWhat in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, witness, please state your name and occupation...\nOldbag:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nEdgeworth:\nUurrngh!\nOldbag:\n...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!\nEdgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr...\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)\nOldbag:\nOh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!\nEdgeworth:\nI saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?\nOldbag:\nI tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.\nJudge:\nMs... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nJudge:\nOof!\nOldbag:\nShush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!\nJudge:\nYes, madam.\nEdgeworth:\nNo no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.\nOldbag:\nIt's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?\nOldbag:\nIt was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!\nJudge:\nYou mean... You were a fan of the victim?\nOldbag:\nLook, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!\nPhoenix:\n(Um... But those two were the same age...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.\nEdgeworth:\nVery well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.\nOldbag:\nLeave it to me, Edgey-poo!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What You Witnessed --\nOldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!\nJudge:\nHmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...\nOldbag:\nSee! It has to be him! He's the murderer!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- What You Witnessed --\nOldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what was your post on that night?\nOldbag:\nThe lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...)\nOldbag:\nBesides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?\nOldbag:\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSomething you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that?\nOldbag:\nIt's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course.\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Gossip\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nIf this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony.\nMia:\nIt looks like we shouldn't force it right now.\nJudge:\nHmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?\nOldbag:\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room?\nOldbag:\nI have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am!\nJudge:\n...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?\nOldbag:\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWho in the world was that!?\nOldbag:\nI'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was...\nJudge:\nYes...? He was...?\nOldbag:\n... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...)\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.\nOldbag:\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release))\nThe person's face\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's face in more detail!\nOldbag:\nYou don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth!\nPhoenix:\nHis teeth were... shining?\nOldbag:\nWell, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie.\nPhoenix:\n... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!?\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nIt was not important.\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nIt was very important.\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nWhat the person was carrying\nPhoenix:\nWhat was the man you saw carrying?\nOldbag:\nIn which hand? His right or his left?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nAh, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand?\nOldbag:\nAh, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand.\nPhoenix:\nThen how about his left?\nOldbag:\nEmpty.\nPhoenix:\n... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nIt was not important.\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nIt was very important.\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nThe person's clothes\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's clothes in more detail!\nOldbag:\nWhat a troublesome man you are. Really, as if something like that matters.\nPhoenix:\nBut it does.\nOldbag:\nUm... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat thing?\nOldbag:\nThat gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...)\nOldbag:\nThat thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!!\nPhoenix:\nUm, right...\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nIt was not important.\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nIt was very important.\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nDon't you see it, Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! I request what the witness said about the jacket be appended to her testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't quite see where you're going with this, but alright. Witness, please...\nOldbag:\nAh well, I don't like to badmouth anyone without reason, but if I must...\nAdds statement \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\"\nPress (after adding statement)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I'm going to have to press a little harder on this one... There's got to be some sort of huge contradiction I can find here...)\nOldbag:\nHe was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure the defendant was wearing a racing jacket?\nOldbag:\nWhat do you think? It's not like I've seen him in anything other than that horrible thing. I'm sure he was wearing it!\nPhoenix:\n(She is so sure of herself that it's to the point of self-absorption...)\nPresent Jammin' Ninja's Button\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag...\"\nMia:\nShe may not remember things or be mistaken here and there, but I don't think she's lying.\nPhoenix:\nThat's bad for us. Really bad.\nMia:\nBut, that's how the human mind is. It also has the tendency to jump off-topic. She's strayed onto a few interesting side-topics this time too, hasn't she? But that's what makes her a sweet old lady, right?\nPhoenix:\n(That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag...\nOldbag:\nWhat!? Don't say my name for no reason!\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what this is?\nOldbag:\nAaaah! It's button number 2 on the Jammin' Ninja's costume!\nPhoenix:\n(Now I KNOW she's an obsessed fan... She identified it in a single glance!)\nOldbag:\nGive it here! Give it here! If you don't give it to me, I'll punish you with this!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.\nOldbag:\nSee! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!\nPhoenix:\nIt was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.\nOldbag:\nSee! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\n...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his \"usual racing jacket\"!?\nOldbag:\n... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nJudge:\nNow hold your tongue still there for one second! So what you saw in actuality, was not Mr. Engarde, the man... but Mr. Engarde, the Nickel Samurai!?\nOldbag:\nBut when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!\nOldbag:\nEdgey-poo! Do you think so too?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, it might be something worth considering. (Changed from [Well, it might be something worth thinking about.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nJust say, \"It's important\" and agree with me for a change!\nJudge:\nWitness! Think carefully and try to remember as much as you can before you testify!\nOldbag:\n*sigh* Alright, if you insist.\nPhoenix:\n(I should be the one sighing, not you!)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Who I Saw --\nOldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.\nPhoenix:\nI... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Did you think there could've been someone else inside that costume? Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.\nPhoenix:\nBut... But the possibility does exist!\nOldbag:\nAh, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.\nJudge:\nH-How do you know that?\nOldbag:\nBecause... I said so. And what I say is the truth.\nPhoenix:\n(At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.\nCross Examination\n-- Who I Saw --\nOldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWould you please get on with your testimony!\nOldbag:\nHmph! Watch your language, young man! What sort of tone is that to take with an elder! My youthfulness isn't what it used to be, so you should forgive me for everything! If you keep on barking at me like that, I'll start singing at the top of my lungs!\nPhoenix:\nUh, what?\nOldbag:\n\"A striking figure by the sea, standing all alone is he. He's the Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n(...She's actually singing... Someone help my poor ears.)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Can you please do something about this racket!?\nEdgeworth:\nWitness. I'll give you a piece of gum later if you'll be good and stick to just the facts.\nOldbag:\nOKAAAAAAAY! ... You promise, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I'll be sending the bill for the chewing gum to your office at a later date.\nPhoenix:\n(Remind me to send you a thank you note later too, Edgeworth, old chum...)\nOldbag:\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBe a little more careful with your testimony, please! Not too long ago, you said he was wearing his \"racing jacket\", and now he's not!?\nOldbag:\n\"Not too long ago\"...? Then let me ask you this! When you were itty-bitty, what was your grand dream?\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nOldbag:\nWhat did you want to be when you grew up, whippersnapper!?\nPhoenix:\nMy dream, huh...? Well, I... uh, wanted to be Judge Wackner, hero of the Public's Court. So what!?\nOldbag:\nSee! And look at where you are now! You're not Judge Wackner, are you!? Are you!?\nPhoenix:\nWell...\nOldbag:\n\"What I said earlier\"... Who puts any weight into things like that!? The \"now\" is everything! I can't be held responsible for the \"past\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did court become theatrics over testimonies?)\nOldbag:\nAll that matters is that man was inside that costume. Isn't that enough!?\nOldbag:\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd why would that be?\nOldbag:\nThat way, no one could see his face, of course!\nPhoenix:\nBut there's still no advantage for him that I can see. In fact, you would think the costume would make him stand out all the more!\nOldbag:\n... You are such a annoying child, you know that? You disagree with everything I say...\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that what YOU'RE always doing to me!?)\nOldbag:\nI got it! Maybe it was more troublesome for him to change in and out of his costume!\nOldbag:\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWas there anyone else scheduled to appear at the post-ceremony show?\nOldbag:\nWell, all the contestants were supposed to go onstage in a friendly gesture thing.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that included the Jammin' Ninja...?\nOldbag:\nOf course it included him! That's why when Engarde came out of dear Juan's room, I didn't give it a second thought.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nOldbag:\nWell, anyway.\nOldbag:\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo let me ask you one last time. The person you saw, it really was the Nickel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nAs showy as ever. Haven't I been saying that from the very beginning!?\nPhoenix:\n(Can I throw in the towel yet?)\nPresent Knife\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Please take a look at this.\"\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nMia:\nYou don't need to think too hard on this one.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nThere's a contradiction in her testimony and it's sitting in plain sight. The question is what that contradiction means for us...\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I have to figure out what you're talking about first, but OK...)\nPhoenix:\nPlease take a look at this.\nOldbag:\nYeah, so, it's a knife. Big deal. If you're trying to scare me with that, I'll have you know it won't work!\nPhoenix:\nNo no, that's not my intention at all...\nJudge:\nThat's the knife that was used in the murder, correct?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. Do you know why this piece of evidence is important to this case?\nJudge:\nYou don't even have to ask. It's because the defendant's fingerprints are on it.\nEdgeworth:\n... Is that what you're driving at...?\nPhoenix:\nThat is exactly what I am driving at.\nJudge:\nWhat are we driving at? And whose car are we driving?\nPhoenix:\nIf Mr. Engarde was really in the Nickel Samurai costume at the time of the murder, then it's impossible for his fingerprints to have been left on this knife! Actually, he would have wiped all previous fingerprints on this knife right off!\nJudge:\nOh, that's right! The Nickel Samurai wears gloves, doesn't he?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nHe probably took his gloves off before he began the stabbing!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd why would he do something like that? To leave his prints on the murder weapon? There is no way he would do something like that!\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, there is one possibility!\nPhoenix:\nThen let's hear your \"possibility\"!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's very simple. The defendant went to the victim's room while in costume as the Nickel Samurai. At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder. He was probably just going to relax and talk with the victim about the stage show. Which is why he took his gloves off!\nJudge:\nHmm... But the murder still did take place...\nEdgeworth:\nIt's well known that there was bad blood between the defendant and the victim. (Changed from [It's well known that the defendant and the victim had bad blood between them.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm, yes... I have heard that before... (Changed from [Hmm, yes... I have heard of that...] in the original release) Well, Mr. Wright? What do you have to say about Mr. Edgeworth's theory...?\nPhoenix:\n(So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this: When the defendant went to the victim's room, he had no intentions of killing him. Now, up to this point, are there any problems with his theory...?)\nThere are no problems.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... I can't see any real problems with his theory...)\nMia:\nBut if you let Edgeworth's theory stand, then we're one very large step closer to a guilty verdict. Look at the Court Record again and take another shot at it.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I just have to think about it one more time...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please make your decision soon.\nLeads back to:\n\"So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this:\"\nThere is a contradiction.\nLeads to:\n\"This theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!\"\nThink about it one more time.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I think I need a little more time on this one.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this:\"\nPhoenix:\nThis theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you babbling about...?\nPhoenix:\nNow, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer. If that's the case, I think it's impossible for the killer to have gone to the victim's room without intent!\nPresent Knife\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nNaturally, you point to the one piece with the least value... but with such vigor! Enjoy your energy while you can. Humans don't live forever... Neither do lawyers.\nJudge:\nYou sure like to think you can bluff your way out of things, don't you?\nMia:\nPhoenix, pay attention! Let's pretend for a second that Mr. Engarde is the murderer. Now from that angle, if he didn't have a murderous intent from the very beginning, then that means there is a certain object that shouldn't be at the crime scene, right?\nPhoenix:\n(\"A certain thing\"...? What certain thing...?)\nEdgeworth:\nHow are you doing over there? Busy collecting your thoughts?\nPhoenix:\n(Alright, let's give this one more try... and with even more spirit this time!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer.\"\nPhoenix:\nThis knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.\nJudge:\nY-Yes, we did establish that.\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that if my client was, in fact, the killer... Then he brought this knife with him when he went to visit Mr. Corrida.\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose...\nPhoenix:\nHowever, you just said it yourself. \"At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder.\" If that were true, then why would he bring a knife!? He wouldn't, would he!?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means, Mr. Edgeworth, your theory was flawed from supposition one! And one more thing! If the murderer was wearing the costume at the time of the murder... Then there should be glove marks left on the knife! Which means the defendant's fingerprints shouldn't be all over it like bees on a hive!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that brings me to my final point... This knife was planted by the real killer to hide their identity and mislead us!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order, I say! Order in the court!! Was this knife really planted by the killer!? Why would the murderer do such a thing!?\nTo hide the murder method.\nPhoenix:\nIt's to hide the way in which the murder was carried out, of course!\nEdgeworth:\nM-More of your nonsense!?\nPhoenix:\nTake another good look at the autopsy report! The victim actually died from strangulation! The killer tried to hide thisx by stabbing a knife into thex victim's chest!\nJudge:\nBut doesn't the autopsy admit that the cause of death was strangulation?\nPhoenix:\nWell, yes, the real cause of death was easily discovered...\nEdgeworth:\nThen I'd say the knife did a terrible job of \"concealing\" this fact!\nPhoenix:\n... Aha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that laugh doesn't do a very good job of concealing your error either!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! I will ask you one more time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Was this knife really planted by the killer!?\"\nTo frame Matt Engarde.\nLeads to:\n\"It's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!\"\nPhoenix:\nIt's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!\nJudge:\nTo frame...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nA-Aren't you forcing the interpretation just a little too hard on this one!?\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut we just established that the witness saw the \"Nickel Samurai\" in costume, and if that were true, then there shouldn't be a single fingerprint on this knife!\nEdgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr! Witneeeeeesssssss!!\nOldbag:\n... Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey-poo...? (Changed from [Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey...?] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nGnnnnngh...\nJudge:\nWitness, did you or did you not really see the Nickel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess at first I might have forgotten, but...\nPhoenix:\nAre you saying you mixed up Mr. Engarde with the Nickel Samurai, his character on TV!?\nOldbag:\nBut I mean, I can't really do anything about that now! (Changed from [But I mean, I can't really do anything about that!] in the original release) Look, I was waiting around in front of their doors because, well... Well, I wasn't waiting around for the Nickel Samurai, that's for sure!\nPhoenix:\n...! (She wasn't waiting for the \"Nickel Samurai\"...?) Alright then... Who were you waiting around for then?\nOldbag:\n... Hmph! That's top secret to anyone outside of security!\nJudge:\nI have a feeling that you were waiting for Mr. Juan Corrida. Am I correct, witness?\nOldbag:\nHa ha ha. The way you think, you are a sad amateur with a terrible case of near-sightedness.\nJudge:\nAmateur...? Me...? What am I an amateur of...?\nPhoenix:\n(So Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room... But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...)\nMia:\nMaybe... Phoenix! Maybe the old bag was waiting around for \"that\" person!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, if it's who I think Mia's hinting at... It's certainly possible...) Ms. Oldbag. You were waiting for this person to come out of the victim's room, weren't you?\nPresent Adrian Andrews profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Who is this person...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nMia:\nWhat are you talking about, Phoenix!? She could've waited until the next century and this would never have appeared!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch... Busted... Guess there's no fooling her.)\nJudge:\nYou two! What do you think you're doing flirting in my courtroom!?\nPhoenix:\nWe weren't doing anything like that... Honest... (Well, back to the drawing board on this one... Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room...)\nLeads back to:\n\"But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...\"\nJudge:\nWho is this person...?\nPhoenix:\nThis is Adrian Andrews, Mr. Engarde's manager.\nJudge:\nB-But why would the defendant's manager be in the victim's room...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems that this is the latest rumor in circulation, Your Honor.\nJudge:\n...Hmm... Oh... This is... Well, this is... Hmm, hmm... Hah, I see...\nPhoenix:\n(The judge seems to be really into the \"article\"... If it can be called such a thing...)\nJudge:\nThen this manager with the initials A. A.... Are you saying it's...?\nEdgeworth:\nAdrian Andrews. Without a doubt, the witness thought so as well.\nOldbag:\n... Hmph. Looks like you found me out. Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole \"sworn to confidentiality stuff\" then. (Changed from [Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole sworn to confidentiality stuff.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nW-Witness...? What in the world are you...\nMia:\nWatch out, Phoenix. I've got a bad feeling about this... A very bad feeling.\nOldbag:\nI got some information... Some very secret information from a certain source. So that's why I was doing my own little investigation... In secret, of course.\nJudge:\nB-But what for...?\nOldbag:\nOh, just for myself... Personal reasons and all that.\nJudge:\n... Well, Mr. Edgeworth. How will you proceed from here?\nEdgeworth:\nI really don't want to do this, however I cannot simply let this point slide.\nJudge:\nI see. Very well then. Witness, please testify about this \"secret information\".\nOldbag:\nGet ready! This is going to take the wind out of you young'uns!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure we're all capable of handling this... Really, it's not like we're ten years old.)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Secret Information --\nOldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!\nI cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?\nJudge:\nThe defendant sent his manager...? What a distasteful topic for this court!\nOldbag:\nWhat!? Nobody's above gossip! And isn't there a saying!? \"The truth is never pleasant.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Never heard that one before...)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What about this Adrian Andrews person...?\nEdgeworth:\nWe have looked into this matter, and found that the \"truth\" the article proposes is, in fact, baseless gossip.\nJudge:\nHmm... But should this be true... Then this proves that the defendant did bear ill-will towards the victim.\nPhoenix:\n(...So this means I have to smash this rumor once and for all.)\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.\nMia:\nBe careful. The old bag seems rather excited right now.\nOldbag:\nThat's right! Engarde is nothing but your average foul-blooded youth!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, as the old saying goes... You've gotta burn old bags with fire! Time to fire up the afterburners and hit the highway to the danger zone!)\nCross Examination\n-- Secret Information --\nOldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou can't say something like that without proof! That's just slander!\nOldbag:\nBut it's true! That woman was getting intimate with poor Juan! Look! It says so right here, doesn't it!? \"Manager to the stars, Ms. A. A.!\"\nPhoenix:\nBut the name of the magazine this came from is \"Gossip Land\"...\nOldbag:\nWhat? Are you saying that \"gossip\" is all just a pack of lies? Hmph, what do you know? I suppose next you'll swear to me that the \"news\" is 100% truth!\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nHonestly, sonny. You can't discriminate between the news and gossip!\nJudge:\nYes, discrimination is bad, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Discriminate? When did I do anything like that?)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, Engarde will never get me to say \"touch\u00e9\"!\nOldbag:\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nA scandal...? What do you mean by that?\nOldbag:\nYou're a dimwitted one, aren't you? I can't believe you don't know what a \"scandal\" is! Honestly, what are they teaching kids in middle school these days...?\nPhoenix:\nAh, no no! I wasn't asking what the word \"scandal\" means! Even I know that much!\nOldbag:\nWell! That Engarde thought he could own a monopoly on popularity!\nOldbag:\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou don't have any proof that Mr. Engarde did any such thing!\nOldbag:\nYou must be suffering from shock; the shock of hearing the truth. And now, since you're in so much shock, you can't do anything right!\nPhoenix:\n(You're right, I can't do anything, but boy do I wish I could do something about you.)\nOldbag:\nAlright then, sonny, show me what you've got! Can you show me proof that Engarde didn't bear any ill-will towards Juan!?\nPresent evidence\nPhoenix:\nI'm not going to let you push me around that easily!\nOldbag:\nHeh. There's many a man who've said those exact words and paid dearly for them.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you should brace yourself this time! Here is my proof that Mr. Engarde did not hold any ill-will towards the victim!\nPresent anything\nPhoenix:\nOldbag:\n...Is that it? You can take it from here, Edgey-poo!\nEdgeworth:\nNgrk! Wh-What are you handing it over to me for!? (Changed from [EH!? Wh-What are you handing it over to me for!?] in the original release)\nOldbag:\nI want you to give that jagged-headed baboon-boy a message for me! Please? Tell him that no matter what he does, the only thing he's good at is failing.\nEdgeworth:\nUm... What she said, Wright! Or should I say... Baboon-boy!\nJudge:\nYes, I agree this isn't much of a piece of evidence... Baboon-boy.\nPhoenix:\n(Did I just gain a new nickname here...?)\nLeads to:\n\"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\"\nDecline the offer to present\nPhoenix:\n...I don't have anything to offer.\nOldbag:\nSeeeeeee! Just as I thought.\nLeads to:\n\"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\"\nOldbag:\nAnd you were lecturing me about saying things without proof! You've just given me a free pass to say whatever I want whenever I want, silly boy!\nPhoenix:\n(Me and my big mouth...)\nOldbag:\nThat's the way the cookie crumbles. For you, anyway.\nOldbag:\nI cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you mean by \"I took action\"...?\nOldbag:\nLike I already told you, I was lying in wait close to the crime scene! Once that slimy woman came out of Juan's room... I was going to capture her, and teach her a good lesson. Something you young'uns need!\nJudge:\nYou were going to \"teach her a good lesson\"...?\nOldbag:\nI was going to make her eat the damaging beams of my ray gun! Like this!\nJudge:\nN-No, stop!\nOldbag:\nWell, it was too bad that woman didn't come through the door that night.\nOldbag:\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWait!\nOldbag:\nWhat!? I'm a busy woman! Tea time with the kids is over!\nPhoenix:\nSecret information that no one else knows yet... If that's true, then how do you know this \"secret information\"!?\nOldbag:\nHuh!? Well... That's... because I'm a pro... Yes, that's it...\nPhoenix:\n...\nOldbag:\nI-It's a secret! Even if you drill a hole into my brain, you'll never find out!\nPhoenix:\n(How in the world did that old bat get such a \"secret\" piece of information...?)\nPress further\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't be a good girl and tell me where you got this secret information... You won't get to go home today!\nOldbag:\nUmm... Edgey-boy! What are you doing!? Help me!\nEdgeworth:\nEh!? What do I have to do with this!?\nOldbag:\nJust do this for me... You'll get your reward.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I don't want your reward, but you don't leave me much of a choice...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness could have gotten her information from anywhere! It's even possible that it was spontaneously made up inside the witness's head!\nPhoenix:\n(And he lectures ME on \"reckless blabbering\"!?)\nJudge:\nAs long as we don't know where this information came from, it's quite a waste of time to focus on this line of questioning.\nPhoenix:\n(Where did Oldbag get her inside information...? There has to be something I can use to figure it out!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPresent evidence\nPhoenix:\nSo no one else is supposed to know this \"secret information\", correct? If that's true, then why do you know it, Ms. Oldbag...?\nOldbag:\nWh-Wh-Why are you looking at me like that...? Stop that!\nPhoenix:\nWitness! I hate to say it, but this is how you came to acquire your secret info, isn't it!? (Changed from [I'm sad to say it, but this is how you found out this secret, isn't it!?] in the original release)\nPresent Lotta's Camera\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYou call that \"proof\"!? It looks more like proof of spite towards the witness! If you have nothing to back up your claims, then they are no more valid than \"gossip\"!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained. Witness, please feel free to ignore the defense's gesture of ill-will and continue.\nOldbag:\nOkie-dokie! See, nothing can get me down!\nPhoenix:\n(Great... That did nothing but set me back a few minutes of my life...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nWait and see\nPhoenix:\n(I should probably think a bit more about this... I don't want to do anything rash... For now, maybe I should sit back and watch how things play out...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nMia:\nSounds like just another tidbit of gossip, doesn't it? But you can't just ignore it either. It makes your client look bad either way.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I don't think I heard anything really out of the ordinary just now...)\nMia:\nThere has to be something we can catch her on...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... And when I find it, I'm going to press the heck out of it...)\nPhoenix:\nThe \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...\nJudge:\nOh yes... I remember that mischievous girl.\nPhoenix:\nShe reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.\nJudge:\nShe reported such a thing...?\nPhoenix:\nOn that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.\nOldbag:\nWh-What!? Outrageous ideas, you say!?\nPhoenix:\nNo no no, I said impressions.\nOldbag:\nThen... Then...! Then everything written on this piece of paper is completely meaningless!?\nPhoenix:\nAh! That's it! That's the note!\nOldbag:\nAh! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Noooo! You see, this is something completely different! This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!\nJudge:\nHmm, then you are the one who took Ms. Hart's note?\nOldbag:\nI'm a huuuuuuuge fan of Juan's, that's why! That infamous, puffy-haired whippersnapper... She's working with that evil Engarde! She said so herself! \"En garde! I'm his sidekick!\" She was so happy, smiling like a silly duck. I was only checking what she had written!\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nOldbag:\n... Edgey-poo! You believe me, don't you!?\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...\nOldbag:\nI was only trying to help out like the angel I am! It's only one little piece of paper! I've never taken anything else before!\nEdgeworth:\nYou really should come with a supply of cheese to match your vintage whine.\nJudge:\nWell, it was only a piece of paper. I suppose we can overlook this just this once.\nPhoenix:\n(She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)\nPile on more pressure.\nPhoenix:\n(If I let up on her now, she'll get away... I have to find some way to inflict a deafening blow to the prosecution!)\nLeads to:\n\"Witness!\"\nForgive her.\nPhoenix:\nI guess we should forgive her.\nOldbag:\nHmph! Who the heck are you to decide who should be forgiven, you delinquent!\nPhoenix:\nGrr... (Number of endearing qualities: ZERO.)\nMia:\nPhoenix. You can't go easy on her. She's no frail old lady.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nMia:\nYou should be pressing her until she gives in!\nPhoenix:\n(Mia is really scary today... *gulp*)\nLeads to:\n\"Witness!\"\nPhoenix:\nWitness! You said that the only thing you stole was that note. Is this correct?\nOldbag:\nS-S-Stole!? Why don't you listen more carefully, you annoying brat!? I saved this piece of paper from the terrible, lonely trash can! That's all!\nPhoenix:\nYou're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\nOldbag:\nAre you putting my credibility under scrutiny again!?\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! I don't believe that the note is the only thing you stole that night!\nPresent Lotta's Camera\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. More than the witness' credibility, perhaps you should be worrying about your legal standing, or should I say, falling?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nJudge:\nI'm setting the volume down to low so I won't have to waste my time with your objections!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I never knew the judge had hearing aids... Argh! Now's not the time to be wondering about health conditions! OK, one more try!)\nLeads back to:\n\"You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\"\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?\nJudge:\nA camera...?\nPhoenix:\nYesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, \"My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!\"\nJudge:\nWhy... Why... Witness!!\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, gramps?\nPhoenix:\nIf you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!\nOldbag:\nGrr... Looks like you found me out again, sonny... Is this the camera you're looking for?\nPhoenix:\nAh, that's...!\nOldbag:\nWhat!? Even though I look like this, I'm still a person, you know! I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and \"borrow\" things from people!\nJudge:\nUm... I think your definition of \"borrow\" is a little off...\nOldbag:\nI saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, \"Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire\"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!\nJudge:\nBailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.\nJudge:\nPlease present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!\nOldbag:\nSee, I told you! That's the guy I saw!\nJudge:\nThis proves that the witness was not lying earlier about this matter.\nLotta's Photo added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nWh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was still in his Nickel Samurai costume!\nJudge:\nIf that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...\nEdgeworth:\nThe defendant.\nJudge:\nHow did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?\nPhoenix:\n(If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...\nnothing strange with it.\nPhoenix:\nThere is nothing strange with this photo.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I have done nothing to alter this picture either, in case you're wondering, Wright.\nJudge:\nI see... And it seems the defense will rest on this matter. In that case, there is no reason to further prolong this trial.\nMia:\nIs this really alright with you, Phoenix!?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well... There's nothing wrong with this photo that I can poi--\nMia:\nTry again! Take another good look at it! And if you still don't see anything... Do something... anything to prolong the trial!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Chief! W-Wait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright? I'm about to enter my verdict. Please address me with your comment afterwards.\nPhoenix:\nUm, no, I'm sorry, but this can't wait...\nEdgeworth:\nOh? Let me guess. You are going to point out some peculiarity with this photo?\nJudge:\nWh-What? Why didn't you say so earlier!?\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"\nsomething strange with it.\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"\nPhoenix:\nThere's... There's something strange with this photo!\nEdgeworth:\nI knew this was coming, Wright.\nJudge:\nYour thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nI think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.\nJudge:\n\"Debunk with a bunker buster\"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\n... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!\nJudge:\nIf you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need one chance, correct...?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this photo from anyway...? (Changed from [Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...?] in the original release) It's all out of focus! Why can't she take a good shot, especially when it counts!?)\nJudge:\nNow then, let's hear your objection. What about this photo is \"strange\"...?\nPresent Nickel Samurai's feet\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!\"\nPresent Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIt's this person here, of course!\nJudge:\nYou mean the \"Nickel Samurai\"? And what is wrong with that?\nPhoenix:\nAt the time of the murder, Mr. Engarde was in his own room! Which means this Nickel Samurai is a fa--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIf you think that's all it takes, you should reconsider your choice of occupation.\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nEdgeworth:\nI think it's about time you retired!\nJudge:\nHmm, it looks like there was no problem with this photo after all.\nEdgeworth:\nThe problem was with the brain of that lawyer, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nYou are the one who let your last chance fly away from you, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penalty\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe strange thing is somewhere around here! ...I think.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Somewhere\"...?\nJudge:\n\"Around here\"...?\nMia:\n\"I think\"...?\nPhoenix:\nA-Am I seeing something you all are not...?\nJudge:\nHmm, it looks like there was no problem with this photo after all.\nEdgeworth:\nThe problem was with the brain of that lawyer, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nYou are the one who let your last chance fly away from you, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penalty\nPhoenix:\nI would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!\nJudge:\nWh-What are you pointing to? His ankles...?\nPhoenix:\nIf you could see this person's ankle, that would be one thing... However you can't.\nJudge:\nA-And...? What does that mean...?\nPhoenix:\nThe costumed person in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde! (Changed from [The 'Nickel Samurai' in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of this!?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if you would care to elaborate... With actual facts, that is.\nPhoenix:\nLet's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.\nJudge:\nHis... His socks... You can see his socks...\nPhoenix:\nExactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThere is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)\nMia:\nThat's curious...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What is?\nMia:\nEdgeworth is unusually calm today...\nPhoenix:\nThat's true...\nMia:\nHe's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.\nPhoenix:\n\"Along for the ride\"...? What do you mean by that?\nMia:\nI can only think that perhaps he doesn't feel under attack at all...\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, I haven't damaged his case at all!?) (Changed from [He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nIf the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!\nEdgeworth:\n... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?\nPhoenix:\n(Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)\nMia:\nDon't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts. Who is the person in this photograph...?\nPresent Adrian Andrews profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"A-Adrian Andrews...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nJudge:\nAre you saying this is who you think was in the costume...?\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um... Well, I know there isn't a lot to back me up here, but...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nSometimes I wonder about you. Do you just pick the first piece of evidence you see?\nMia:\nI can't believe it. I didn't think you would mess up here of all places...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... And I really thought I had it!)\nJudge:\nNow then, would you care to try one more time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts.\"\nJudge:\nA-Adrian Andrews...?\nPhoenix:\nIf you want to know who that Nickel Samurai is, it is none other than this woman!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why would you say it must be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her? (Changed from [And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nFor starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.\nJudge:\nAnd how does that all add up?\nPhoenix:\nIt means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!\nJudge:\nThe knife that was used as a murder weapon!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(I have to do this now! This is my last chance to turn things around!) The defense motions to indict Ms. Adrian Andrews in the murder of Juan Corrida! It was Ms. Andrews who tried to frame the defendant for the crime!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!! ORDER!! It looks like this trial has hit a most unexpected development!

Even if Wright was a bit slow to catch on...\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of your statement, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Adrian Andrews is currently waiting in the prosecution lobby... She is the next witness.\nPhoenix:\n...! (Everything... Everything was planned out in advance by that man...?)\nMia:\nSomehow, I knew there was no way Edgeworth would overlook Ms. Andrews... Looks like this battle is far from over.\nEdgeworth:\nExactly.\nJudge:\nVery well. We will call the next witness. However... Before we proceed, we shall take a 10 minute recess. Please prepare your witness in that time, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nThe court will now take a 10 minute recess.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 22, 2:14 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3\nEngarde:\nDude! I can't believe that Adrian... No way! Not cool and collected Adrian Andrews!\nPhoenix:\nShe is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... her.\nEngarde:\nSo after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...\nPhoenix:\nSee, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.\nEngarde:\nHmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?\nPhoenix:\nYes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.\nEngarde:\nBut... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!\nPhoenix:\nShe has her own agenda.\nEngarde:\nH-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.\nEngarde:\nGet me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?\nMia:\nPhoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's missing suicide note, right?\nPhoenix:\n...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live. (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release) But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...\nMia:\n...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!\nMia:\nThat sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.\nPhoenix:\nUm, what...?\nMia:\nWho was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' dependency issues with regards to Ms. Inpax...? (Changed from [Better stated, Mr. Andrews' co-dependency with regards to Ms. Inpax...?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n...

Ms. Adrian Andrews, the person who discovered the crime in Mr. Juan Corrida's room!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is your occupation?\nAndrews:\nI am the manager of the defendant in this case, Mr. Matt Engarde.\nJudge:\nI see. Now then...\nAndrews:\nBefore we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.\nJudge:\nUh, yes, sure. What is it?\nAndrews:\nI'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly \"magazine\" recently...\nJudge:\nAh, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of \"Gossip Land\"...\nPhoenix:\n(If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.\nAndrews:\nYes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.\nJudge:\nHmm, so it was a \"fry 'n bait\" matter... or was that \"bait 'n fry\"? Reminds me of fishing...\nAndrews:\nBut I... But I didn't kill him.\nEdgeworth:\nNo one has accused you of that.\nAndrews:\nI think there's someone who would beg to differ. (Changed from [I've got a feeling someone will soon...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nI think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.\nEdgeworth:\nVery well then. Witness, please testify to the court about what happened when you discovered the murder that had taken place.\nWitness Testimony\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...\nWhat I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.\nI felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.\nJudge:\nYou poured yourself a glass of juice...?\nAndrews:\nYes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.\nMia:\nPhoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.\nPhoenix:\nYes... I know.\nMia:\nIn order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pacing. (Changed from [You should disrupt her pace.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDisrupt her pacing...? (Changed from [Disrupt her pace...?] in the original release)\nMia:\nShe's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it. The instant you let up on your offense is the instant this trial is over. Understand?\nCross Examination\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd what was Mr. Engarde doing at the time...?\nAndrews:\nHe was taking a nap. He was worn out from his mini performance as the Nickel Samurai during the ceremony...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, Mr. Engarde did say he was taking a nap...) Then I guess you could say it could not have been taken out of his room, yes?\nAndrews:\nExcuse me? \"It\"...? What are you...?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I thought years of school would have taught you how to construct a sentence. If you can't make a sensible sentence with a subject, then I'll make one for you. Watch. Did you, Ms. Andrews, remove Mr. Engarde's knife from his room?\nAndrews:\n...No.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nSubject, verb, object Wright. Did you skip basic grammar? The witness may continue.\nAndrews:\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you do that...?\nAndrews:\nAs a friendly gesture, Juan was to make an appearance with the other Heroes.\nPhoenix:\n(So the show was supposed to be a \"show\" of friendship, huh?)\nPress further\nPhoenix:\nIs that the only reason?\nAndrews:\nI beg your pardon? What are you implying...?\nPhoenix:\nYou had a certain goal in mind when you started to get close to him, correct...? So perhaps you had a more personal matter to discuss with the victim...?\nAndrews:\n... Sorry, but I didn't have any such intentions in mind at that time.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't get her to talk without a strong piece of evidence, I guess...)\nLeads to:\n\"May we continue now...?\"\nLet her be\nPhoenix:\n(I should back off... As long as I don't have any proof, she's not going to talk.)\nLeads to:\n\"May we continue now...?\"\nEdgeworth:\nMay we continue now...? Witness, what did you see when you got to his room?\nAndrews:\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou were \"in shock\"...?\nAndrews:\nWhat? Was I not supposed to be?\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Andrews is a very calculating person... And despite how \"close\" they were, I doubt she had romantic feelings for Mr. Corrida...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnyone randomly stumbling upon a dead body would be in shock. And you can't seriously expect that a young beauty like her would not be shocked.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think beauty has anything to do with being shocked or not...)\nJudge:\nHmm... I see...\nPress (after pressing fifth statement, before adding statement)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou were \"in shock\"...?\nAndrews:\nWhat?

And you can't seriously expect that a young beauty like her would not be shocked.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think beauty has anything to do with being shocked or not...)\nJudge:\nHmm... I see...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews, I would like to confirm with you one more time. When you discovered the dead body of Juan Corrida, you were in great shock. And that's when you poured yourself the glass of juice, correct?\nAndrews:\nAnd what of it...? My mind really was a complete blank at the time.\nPhoenix:\nYour mind was a complete blank? I didn't think that was possible for you.\nAndrews:\nAren't you rude today? I was so dazed that I made one careless mistake... That one thing...\nPhoenix:\nWhat \"one thing\"?\nAndrews:\nUm, never mind. It's no big deal.\nPhoenix:\n(What was she starting to say just now...?)\nPress further\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Andrews!\"\nLet her be\nPhoenix:\n(Well, it probably doesn't have anything to do with the case, so...)\nMia:\nStop right there. You finally got her to open her mouth on this one, and you're going to let it go? Now is the time to get as much out of her as we can.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're right.\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Andrews!\"\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews! I'm convinced that as you said, you made a \"mistake\" at the scene of the crime.\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat I really want to know is what this \"mistake\" was.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, actually... So would I...\nAndrews:\nI... I'm sorry... It's just... It's kind of... embarrassing... When I... When I set the glass down on the dresser... I accidentally... knocked the flower vase over...\nJudge:\nF-Flower vase...? Are you talking about the one on the floor in the crime photo...? This mess of glass shards!?\nAndrews:\nIt was originally on top of the dresser... but when I bumped into it with my elbow, it fell... onto the guitar case.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-Why did you withhold such an important piece of information!?\nAndrews:\nI'm sorry... I thought that since the crime scene was already in disarray, that people would simply assume the vase was just another part of the mess.\nJudge:\nIt looks like yet another fact has come to light here. Please add this and anything else you have to reveal to your testimony.\nAndrews:\nI'm sorry... But... I have nothing more to add... I didn't touch anything else.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nAdds statement \"I was the one who knocked the flower vase over, where it fell onto the guitar case.\"\nAndrews:\nWhat I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis is the photo you're referring to, correct?\nAndrews:\nYes, the one with the knife lodged in his chest...\nPhoenix:\nAnd the guitar case was like this too?\nAndrews:\nYes, it was open and empty, of course.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd then, what did you do next, witness?\nPresent Guitar Case or Crime Photo (after pressing third and fifth statements)\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"You testified that you knocked the flower vase over. Is this correct?\"\nAndrews:\nI felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nJuice...?\nAndrews:\nYes, there was a bottle of tomato juice on the table, so I helped myself.\nPhoenix:\nBut you didn't drink any of it, did you?\nAndrews:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nThere were no lip marks left on this wine glass to suggest that anyone drank from it.\nAndrews:\nI... I wasn't feeling terribly great, so I set the glass down. Without drinking it...\nPress (after pressing third statement, before adding statement)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nJuice...?\nAndrews:\nYes, there was a bottle of tomato juice on the table, so I helped myself.\nPhoenix:\nBut you didn't drink any of it, did you?\nAndrews:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nThere were no lip marks left on this wine glass to suggest that anyone drank from it.\nAndrews:\nI...

I thought I would try to take Juan's pulse... So I set the glass I was holding down on the dresser. And that's when my elbow accidentally hit the vase...\nPhoenix:\n(That's odd. I thought she was always in total control of herself...?)\nMia:\nThat's what she would like people to think. Always be mindful of the gap between the perception and reality.\nPresent Guitar Case or Crime Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"You testified that you knocked the flower vase over. Is this correct?\"\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't sound like there's any glaring contradictions in her testimony just now...)\nMia:\nI warned you earlier that she would not crack so easily. The only way to make her is to...\nPhoenix:\n...Keep on the offensive and not let up.\nMia:\nThe only way you're going to catch her is with some very strong, decisive evidence...\nPhoenix:\n(I have to find something! I just have to! ...For Maya's sake...)\nPhoenix:\nYou testified that you knocked the flower vase over. Is this correct?\nAndrews:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\nAnd are you sure it fell onto the guitar case?\nAndrews:\nI-Is there some problem with what I said...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's not \"some\" problem, it's a \"major\" problem. It's true that the top of the guitar case was wet with water. However, that's exactly what is so strange! Ms. Andrews! You testified that the vase fell onto the guitar case! However! If that was true, the case should have gotten wet on the inside, not the outside!\nJudge:\nTh-That's very true!\nPhoenix:\nFurthermore, there is one other strange thing about this guitar case.\nJudge:\nAnd wh-what is that?\nPhoenix:\nLet's take another look at the crime scene photo. The remains of the vase are scattered on the floor.\nJudge:\nAnd what is wrong with that?\nPhoenix:\nIf the guitar case was open when the vase fell... The glass shards should be INSIDE, not outside the case!\nAndrews:\nAh!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is your point, Wright!? That the case was closed at the time the vase was knocked over? Is that all!?\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nNo. Think back to what Ms. Andrews testified to! She said that other than the vase, she didn't touch anything else!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nYes, that's right... She did implicitly say she didn't touch the guitar case!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nBut... But this whole matter with the guitar case is a dead end! The bright red guitar was found at the studio! It has no bearing on this case at all!\nPhoenix:\n... That may very well be, however... (Argh, the empty guitar case does seem to have no relation to this case, doesn't it...) (Changed from [An empty guitar case does seem to have no relation to this case...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems that there is no deeper meaning to the guitar case. Well, Mr. Wright? Do you think we need to hear more details about the guitar case?\nMake her testify\nLeads to:\n\"The empty guitar case...\"\nLet her be\nPhoenix:\nWell, the case was empty, and I think that's all we really need to know...\nJudge:\nI see.\nMia:\nWait! Phoenix! Don't you remember what I told you earlier? What's important here is that you disrupt her pacing. You have to attack her when she's not expecting it!\nJudge:\nNow then, let's move on to a different matter...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nActually, Your Honor, I've changed my mind. I would like her to testify about the case.\nJudge:\nWh-Wh-Why are you changing your mind NOW!?\nPhoenix:\n(Well, looks like I disrupted the judge's pacing... Now comes the real deal... *gulp*)\nLeads to:\n\"The empty guitar case...\"\nPhoenix:\nThe empty guitar case... I believe this is a crucial piece of the puzzle!\nEdgeworth:\nHeh! I can't believe ANYONE would reach for straws like this! But it is you...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe I'm doing this either...)\nJudge:\nAlright. I'll follow along... For now. Ms. Andrews, please testify to the court about the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nYes, Your Honor.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Guitar Case --\nAndrews:\nI don't remember too clearly because I was a bit dazed.\nI suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over.\nIt's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all.\nAs for why I opened the case... Even I don't know.\nJudge:\nHmm... It looks like this really wasn't a very important point.\nEdgeworth:\nThis wastefulness is such a familiar feeling by now that it's almost... comforting.\nPhoenix:\nUm, anyway, I'll just go ahead and start the cross-examination...\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Using \"anyway\" to change the topic -- a convenient escape for a weak man.\nCross Examination\n-- The Guitar Case --\nAndrews:\nI don't remember too clearly because I was a bit dazed.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nDuring your testimony just now, did you remember those events clearly in your mind?\nAndrews:\n... Well, you see...\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure you are the one who opened the guitar case?\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...\nMia:\nShe's... She's waiting for someone to tell her if she should answer or not...\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like her dependent side is taking over...) (Changed from [Her 'co-dependency' is coming through, huh...?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nWell, Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nY...Yes, it was me...\nAndrews:\nI suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo, you opened the guitar case then?\nAndrews:\nY-Yes... Well, maybe...\nPhoenix:\n... Why did you open the guitar case?\nAndrews:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida's dead body was right there in front of you, wasn't it? I would think that the first thing you would do is call for help, not open a guitar case.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nAs the witness has said multiple times, when she found the dead body, she was \"dazed\".\nJudge:\nHmm...\nAndrews:\nMaybe I... Maybe I was curious to know if the bright red guitar was alright or not. I thought, \"Maybe the criminal took it.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Why would she care about the bright red guitar...?)\nAndrews:\nBut, getting back on topic...\nPresent Guitar Case\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way you were the one who opened the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nWhy would you say that!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's elementary, my dear. Because the only fingerprints on this guitar case are those of the victim!\nAndrews:\nAh!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\n... You shouldn't assume that I must have left prints just because I touched the case.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nAndrews:\nWhat if I were to tell you that I was wearing gloves at the time?\nJudge:\nGloves...? But why would you be wearing gloves at the time?\nAndrews:\nIt was the night of the award ceremony. So of course I dressed up for the occasion. Yes, now I remember... I'm almost sure I was wearing a pair of thin gloves.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see... Well, Mr. Wright. It seems the witness was wearing gloves at the scene of the crime.\nNothing strange about that.\nPhoenix:\nHmm, I guess so... And I guess that makes sense.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. You're the epitome of a half-baked idea.\nAndrews:\nA brain is to be used, not to look pretty for med students carving cadavers.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like I need to bake my thoughts just a little longer...)\nEdgeworth:\nNow, if the defense has no further objections, let's return to the testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nThat's strange...\nPhoenix:\nYou were wearing gloves...? Isn't that a little strange?\nAndrews:\nWhy is that strange!? Do you have something that would prove I was not wearing gloves at the time...?\nPresent Wine Glass\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I have your proof right here. This wine glass.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI think it's time for you to go home now, Wright... Before you hurt yourself, that is.\nPhoenix:\n(Hurt myself...!?)\nJudge:\nIt's alright, Mr. Wright. You don't have to push yourself so hard.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I was trying a little too hard there...)\nEdgeworth:\nNow, if the defense has no further objections, let's return to the testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nAndrews:\nIt's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWas it really empty?\nAndrews:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nI was just wondering if maybe when you opened the case, the guitar was still inside.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nHow long have you been a lawyer, Mr. Wright!? Have a little professionalism. The bright red guitar was found at the studio. These trials would be over in half the time if you would just pay attention.\nJudge:\nYes, pay more attention, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nSorry...\nPresent Guitar Case\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way you were the one who opened the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nWhy would you say that!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's elementary, my dear.

That you put your gloves back on, just to open the guitar case!?\nAndrews:\nUgn!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!\nMia:\nLooks like you hit the nail on the head this time.\nPhoenix:\n...? What do you mean?\nMia:\nI believe that guitar case plays a very important role here.\nPhoenix:\nBut it's just an empty case...\nMia:\nI wonder if it really was empty though...\nPhoenix:\nB-But the guitar... The bright red guitar was at the studio!\nMia:\nPhoenix, drop all of your presumptions. What was in the guitar case was not the bright red guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(You don't mean... it was a bright WHITE guitar!? Wait, that's not right either...)\nJudge:\nHmm, I admit it would be unnatural for someone to do that. So the witness was not wearing gloves, despite the fact that on the case...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, this is obviously the defense's usual misdirection tactic at work. Steer the court towards an unrelated topic, and lull us all into his misguided...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Honor! Please recall that Ms. Andrews had testified that the vase \"fell onto the guitar case\"! Which means that the case was closed when the crime took place! However, it is wide open in this photo of the crime scene! I am sure this guitar case has some relation to the murder!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIf you are so sure, Wright, then I'm sure you can somehow substantiate your outrageous claim, correct!? Please, enlighten us as to why that guitar case has anything at all to do with this murder!\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nJudge:\nCan you do that, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... Let's suppose for a second... That the bright red guitar was not the only thing that could have been in the case...\nJudge:\nThe bright red guitar not being the only thing...? Y-You don't mean to suggest that a bright BLACK guitar was inside the--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you intend to push your theory that the case was not empty!? Is that it, Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nI wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!\nEdgeworth:\nDeflate that head of yours! You haven't proven anything yet! Now then, let's have it. What was inside this case at the time of the murder!?\nPresent The Nickel Samurai or Lotta's Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Th-This is... This is a photograph...!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why would something like that be inside a guitar case, let alone this one?\nJudge:\nWhy, Mr. Wright, why?\nPhoenix:\nWell... I just thought it might have been possible...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have a suggestion. Why don't you put that in the void where your brain is supposed to be!\nJudge:\nYes, and never bring it out again!\nPhoenix:\n(Can't a foolishly foolish fool get some love...?)\nEdgeworth:\nDo you still think you can prove your theory? Can you prove that the guitar case was not empty at the time of the murder?\nLeads back to:\n\"I wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!\"\nJudge:\nTh-This is... This is a photograph...!\nPhoenix:\nYes, but what is important is what is in that picture, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI-In this picture...?\nPhoenix:\nIt doesn't take a genius to see what I mean! What I am proposing is... Inside the guitar case was the Nickel Samurai! The hero's very own costume!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What!?\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!\nEdgeworth:\nWright! Are you saying that the witness opened the guitar case to take out a costume!? What insane point would there be to doing something like that!?\nPhoenix:\nThat insane point would be to wear the costume, of course. Ms. Andrews put it on to hide her identity so she could make her escape. After all, you couldn't let anyone see you leave, could you, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nI-I refuse to accept your theory! Do you have anything to support such a preposterous idea!?\nPhoenix:\nJust outside the door was an investigative photographer who was starving for a big scoop. And in the end, she managed to get this shot, correct?\nJudge:\nYou... You mean this photo!? Order! Ordeeeer! It looks like we've wandered into quite another mess again, haven't we...?\nMia:\nNice job, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later!\nJudge:\nHmm... So the real murderer was hiding inside a costume...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nW-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!?\nJudge:\nHmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...?\nIt was stolen from Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nI think it may have been stolen from Mr. Engarde...\nJudge:\nS-Stolen!? But why would someone do such a thing!?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe the thief wanted to interfere with the post-ceremony stage show.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nAnd so, if he didn't have his costume, then Mr. Engarde would be forced to go naked!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe YOU should be stripped naked and run out for making a mockery of this court!\nPhoenix:\nE-EXCUSE ME!?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Matt Engarde did not take his costume off after the award ceremony! He even testified that he took a nap while still wearing his costume! Is this not correct!?\nPhoenix:\n... Ah, yeah, he did say something like that, didn't he?\nJudge:\n*sigh* That's what I thought. Let's try that one more time, shall we, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts.\"\nIt was a spare costume.\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period...\"\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a spare one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nJudge:\nThen... are you saying that on the night of the murder... there were TWO Nickel Samurai costumes at the Gatewater Hotel!?\nPhoenix:\nYes, that is what I am saying.\nJudge:\nAnd how do you explain the costume that was inside the guitar case...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt would mean that the victim himself had brought this spare to the ceremony on purpose! (Changed from [It would mean that the victim himself had planned to bring this spare to the ceremony!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nBut... But why!? The victim, Mr. Corrida, was the Jammin' Ninja. Why would he secretly bring the Nickel Samurai's spare costume with him...? What could be the reason behind such a peculiar act?\nPhoenix:\n... And therein lies the sticking point... (Changed from [... Ah, so that's what he intended...] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you mumbling to yourself about now!? Have you just been rambling all this time without any sense of inner monologue!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? N-No, I just...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please explain yourself! Why do you think the victim had the Nickel Samurai's spare costume!?\nMia:\nPhoenix... Are you sure you can explain this one? Think carefully before you answer... And then answer with gusto! I believe in you!\nPhoenix:\nAlright. This is what I think. The reason the victim brought the Nickel Samurai's spare costume to the hotel was...\nPresent Press Conference Ticket\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"What is this...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nMia:\nPhoenix! What are you doing!? Are you crazy!?\nPhoenix:\nI... I, uh... I presented the evidence with gusto, just like you said!\nMia:\nI told you to present it with gusto, yes... But I seem to recall the sentence before that was, \"Think carefully\"!\nPhoenix:\n*gulp*\nJudge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nAh, sorry...\nMia:\nThis one is pretty tough. I really think you should look carefully at the Court Record. And then search through your memories! The answer is there, I know you'll find it!\nJudge:\nNow then. Are you ready to try again, Mr. Wright? Minus the wrong evidence this time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Alright. This is what I think.\"\nJudge:\nWhat is this...?\nPhoenix:\nOn the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special press conference.\nJudge:\nA press conference...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something at this conference.\nEdgeworth:\nI heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nBut what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had no idea he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night.\nAndrews:\n...\nJudge:\nBut how can that be!?\nPhoenix:\nThe way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida himself!\nJudge:\nTh-The victim?\nPhoenix:\nYes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the \"Nickel Samurai\"!\nJudge:\nHe was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!?\nPhoenix:\nThat's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is what he intended to reveal at that conference.\nEdgeworth:\nThe Nickel Samurai was going to \"confess\" something. And by \"confess\", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about \"himself\".\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about Matt Engarde!\nJudge:\nYes, I guess that is what it would mean...\nEdgeworth:\nBut, if that's the case... that's not a \"confession\"! That's \"public disclosure\"!\nAndrews:\nHmph.\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nI can see why you are pros at what you do.\nJudge:\nPardon me?\nAndrews:\nYes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan.\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews! Please offer us an explanation for this!\nAndrews:\nI was the one he asked to help set it up. And the person who prepared the second costume for him... That was also me.\nJudge:\nYou...!?\nAndrews:\nJuan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway.\nJudge:\nHe was going to ruin him, huh...?\nAndrews:\nIt looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nJudge:\nAnd do you know what this \"secret\" of Mr. Engarde's is, Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\n... That's something only Juan knew. I... I don't know what it is.\nJudge:\nAh... I see.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nAndrews:\nI... I've probably been coming off quite suspicious to everyone, but that's to be expected. I've been trying to protect Matt, after all...\nPhoenix:\nP-Protect Mr. Engarde!?\nJudge:\nAnd yet again another strange bit of truth comes to light it seems... Ms. Andrews, if you could, please tell us the truth about your behavior!\nAndrews:\nYes, Your Honor. I understand.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Protecting Matt --\nAndrews:\nFrom the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.\nMatt had to kill Juan no matter what.\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...\nJudge:\nHmm... This does account for everything...\nAndrews:\nWell... I am the logical type.\nMia:\nWe're finally seeing her true self. She is more nervous than a scared rabbit.\nJudge:\nIf the defense can find no fault with this testimony, I am ready to make a ruling. (Changed from [If there are no objections, I feel that I can pass a verdict based on this testimony.] in the original release) Please keep that in mind as you cross-examine, Mr. Wright. (Changed from [Now then, Mr. Wright, if you please.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like somehow everything has swung to the opposite end of the scale again... That just means I have to put my weight into this and turn her logic upside-down!)\nCross Examination\n-- Protecting Matt --\nAndrews:\nFrom the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWould you say that was your \"intuition\" speaking to you?\nAndrews:\nDon't confuse my methods of reasoning with your own.\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\nAndrews:\nIf you want to prove that someone did something, you need three things.\nPhoenix:\nThree... things?\nAndrews:\nA motive, an opportunity to commit the crime, and finally... decisive evidence. And if you think these three things through, the answer becomes quite clear.\nMia:\nYou should have already known that, Phoenix...\nPhoenix:\nThey didn't teach that to us in school... At least, not from what I remember...\nAndrews:\nMay I continue now?\nAndrews:\nMatt had to kill Juan no matter what.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo would you say this \"need\" came from the press conference?\nAndrews:\nYes. Do you know why Juan chose that event and that hotel for the conference? Because that was when he could cause the most damage to the public's beloved Matt Engarde.\nJudge:\nAnd you knew of this plan, didn't you, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\nYes... because I was the one who set up the conference and prepared the costume.\nPhoenix:\nBut... I'm sure Mr. Engarde himself didn't know anything about a press conference.\nAndrews:\nOh really? Can you show me any proof that he didn't know about the press conference?\nPhoenix:\nA-Anyway! The important thing here is that this information was not in your testimony!\nJudge:\nYes, I agree. Ms. Andrews, please correct your testimony, if you please.\nAndrews:\n\"Grasping at straws\" now, are we, Mr. Wright?\nChanges statement from \"Matt had to kill Juan no matter what.\" to \"I know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.\"\nAndrews:\nI know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHas Mr. Engarde done something to hurt or betray you personally?\nAndrews:\n... Why do you ask?\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one who helped Mr. Corrida with his press conference... And that event was supposed to bring down Mr. Engarde, yet you still helped out!\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThe person on trial right now is Mr. Engarde, Wright. What the witness was thinking, helping the victim with his plan, is none of our concern. In any case, this means that the defendant had a motive to kill.\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I keep doing this to myself...?)\nAndrews:\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nB-But didn't you already testify earlier that Mr. Engarde was... \"Taking a nap in his room\"!? Are you telling me now that, that too, was a lie so you could cover for Mr. Engarde!?\nAndrews:\nI'm not telling you anything of the sort. When I went to get him for the show, he honestly was sleeping. However, as to whether he was sleeping the entire time, that I cannot say. I was too busy setting up the stage at the time.\nJudge:\nHmm... I keep trying, but I can find no flaws with what Ms. Andrews has said. I can't say the same for some people here in this courtroom, however.\nPhoenix:\n(The judge is glaring straight at Mia...)\nMia:\nHe's glaring at you, smart guy!\nAndrews:\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou can hardly call the knife \"decisive evidence\"! The fingerprints on the knife could very well be a clever camouflage!\nAndrews:\nThen... What about the button?\nPhoenix:\nThe button...?\nAndrews:\nIt's clear from the crime scene that the victim and the murderer fought. And during the fight, the killer ripped the button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nJudge:\nYou're talking about this button, correct?\nAndrews:\nThat button was found in the pleats of Matt's hakama, isn't that correct? I would think that makes it very decisive evidence.\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nJudge:\nLooks like you were out-foxed again, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nA-Anyway! The knife doesn't prove a thing! Please fix your testimony!\nAndrews:\nI can't stand the sight of a man who can't gracefully accept his defeat.\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(... Thank goodness Mia can still look at me...)\nMia:\nWith an icy stare, yes.\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews, for Mr. Wright's sake, please add this information to your testimony.\nChanges statement from \"My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\" to \"That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\"\nAndrews:\nThat button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd how do you know that?\nAndrews:\nWhen the ends of the threads on the button and the costume were matched up, they were found to fit together perfectly... Or so I heard.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I've heard that before too. But why would Ms. Andrews know about this case down to such a fine detail?)\nAndrews:\nDon't look at me like that! Just because I'm prepared and you are not!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... And I thought I had her this time for sure. If there's anything to trip her up on, it has to be here. ...But where and what?)\nPresent Juan's Autopsy Report\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This is the victim's autopsy report.\"\nAndrews:\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut what you really did was stab the guy in the back, didn't you? And at the worst possible time.\nAndrews:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nWho's to say she really \"stabbed the guy in the back\" as you put it?\nPhoenix:\nThis witness could have disclosed things about Mr. Engarde at any time. Why, then, would she wait until there was a large audience before doing so? It's the same reason why Mr. Corrida planned such an elaborate conference. Ms. Andrews wanted to cause Mr. Engarde as much damage as she possibly could! This witness bears ill-will towards the defendant!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThis isn't the \"Phoenix Wright Wax Philosophical Power Hour\". And please, stop slandering the witness.\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAs I expected, Ms. Andrews' testimony seems pretty solid.\nMia:\nReally? Because to me, it sounded a little wishy-washy.\nPhoenix:\nWishy-washy? (Well, I guess we'll see if I press a little more...)\nMia:\nYou should know this by now, but you'll need strong, decisive evidence to make her talk.\nPhoenix:\nGot it, Chief! (...I'm going to pin you down this time, Ms. Andrews!)\nPhoenix:\nThis is the victim's autopsy report. It clearly states that the cause of death was \"strangulation by a scarf\".\nAndrews:\nS...Strangulation...\nPhoenix:\nThe knife stab to the victim was done after the victim had already died.\nJudge:\nA-And what does that mean?\nPhoenix:\nLet's examine the evidence. This button has the victim's blood on it. Which would mean that it was ripped off of the costume... when?\nEdgeworth:\nAfter the knife was stabbed into the victim...\nPhoenix:\nExactly! Which means... It is impossible that this button was torn off during the victim's final struggle, because the victim was strangled to death in that fight!\nAndrews:\nAh...\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, Ms. Andrews. There is no way this button was ripped off during the struggle. This button was consciously pulled off of the victim's already dead body!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Wh-What is the meaning--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is the meaning of this, Wright!? So what if the button was torn off the body after the victim had already died? What does that change!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me ask you one simple question, Mr. Edgeworth. Why was the button torn off? What purpose did that serve?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat \"purpose\"...?\nPhoenix:\nWe now know this button was not torn off during the fight. So the murderer took the time and effort to purposely rip this from the victim's body. That would mean that the murderer had something in mind, wouldn't it?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Does this mean... Does this mean you know what the murderer wanted to do with this button!? What was it!?\nTo have a memento of the crime\nPhoenix:\nMaybe this was the criminal's first crime and since it went so well, the person wanted something as a memento...\nEdgeworth:\nWright... I'll give this button to you as a memento.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nA reminder to never set foot in another court of law again for as long as you live!\nJudge:\nYes... I think it would be for the best if you stayed away from the attorney's bench.\nPhoenix:\nW-W-Wait! Please, Your Honor! I... I'll get it right this time! I'm sure of it!\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\"\nTo pin the crime on Engarde\nLeads to:\n\"There is only one logical reason for doing something like that.\"\nTo destroy evidence\nPhoenix:\nIt was to destroy the evidence, of course!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... To destroy the evidence...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, we heard you the first time! And which blasted piece of evidence was the person trying to destroy, Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! If you continue like this, I'm afraid you'll only destroy yourself!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\"\nPhoenix:\nThere is only one logical reason for doing something like that. It was to pin the crime on Mr. Engarde!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way anyone would put a bloodied button in their own pants! That's right! Mr. Engarde was set up! By the real killer, of course!\nJudge:\nAnd... The real murder is...? Well, Mr. Wright!? Who in the world is the real killer then!?\nPhoenix:\n(Finally... I can't believe I managed to bring this trial all the way up to this point...)\nMia:\nPhoenix... You can't let your guard down yet! Not until the very end!\nPhoenix:\nThe real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...\nPresent Adrian Andrews profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Adrian Andrews!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nWright. Which of these four doesn't belong here? Up, down, left, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nUm, \"Wright\"?\nEdgeworth:\nThank you, I feel much better. I'm relieved to know you can at least pick that much out. I worry about you. You seem to fail every time you try to make logical sense!\nMia:\nOr in other words, \"think before you speak\", Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\n(Is it just me or is everyone ganging up on me?)\nJudge:\nThat's enough dawdling now, Mr. Wright. We don't have all day.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"The real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...\"\nPhoenix:\nMs. Adrian Andrews! I choose you! You are Mr. Corrida's killer!\nAndrews:\nWh-What!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!! Mr. Wright! This is a very grave matter! Do you have any evidence that supports your charge...?\nPhoenix:\n\"Any evidence\"...? ALL of the evidence points to Ms. Andrews!\nAndrews:\nWh... How preposterous! You can't stick any of that on me!\nPhoenix:\nI can't, can I? Would you care to test me?\nAndrews:\nThen... Then what about this knife!?\nPhoenix:\nThe knife was used to stab the victim after he had already been strangled to death. It was used to throw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, naturally. A knife covered in the defendant's fingerprints could only be taken from his room. And the only one who had dinner with him, and knew which knife to take, was you.\nAndrews:\n...Tsk! Th-Then! What... What about the button that was found in Matt's hakama!?\nPhoenix:\nThis button was removed from the victim's body after he had already died. The only people who could've done so were the person who found his body or the killer. However, if Mr. Engarde was the real killer, there is no way he would have put such incriminating evidence in his own hakama!\nAndrews:\nUghn...\nPhoenix:\nThe only person who could have put this button into Mr. Engarde's hakama, is the person who went to wake him from his nap... which is you, yet again, Ms. Andrews.\nJudge:\nI... I see... What about the empty guitar case...?\nPhoenix:\nThat is also another piece of evidence that incriminates Ms. Andrews. That costume was used to hide the real killer's identity as they fled the crime scene. Now, who could have known that there was just such a costume inside the guitar case...? It could only have been the person who prepared the costume for the victim. And that person is... you, Ms. Adrian Andrews!\nAndrews:\nN...No... I...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nBut Ms. Andrews' fingerprints were nowhere to be found on the guitar case! And it was you who proved that she was not wearing gloves at the time!\nJudge:\n...! Th-That's right!\nPhoenix:\nThat's because she did not intend on leaving any prints. If anyone had found out that she had touched the case, they would have asked her why. So to avoid leaving any prints, she used a towel or something else to open it. But! The glass of tomato juice is a different story! Ms. Andrews purposefully left her fingerprints on the glass to show that yes, indeed, she was the classic \"dazed discoverer\" of a dead body!\nAndrews:\nAaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\nAnd to top it all off, there is this photo! A photo of the killer as they exited the scene of the crime. No reasonable person on Earth can believe this Nickel Samurai is Mr. Engarde! He would be much too short for his own costume if it was him.\nAndrews:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nSpeaking of how tall people are... Ms. Andrews, you're also kind of short in stature, are you not?\nAndrews:\nP-Please... Stop...\nPhoenix:\nWell, how about it, Ms. Andrews!?\nAndrews:\nUm...\nPhoenix:\n(I've got her this time!)\nAndrews:\n...\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\n... I... I... I refuse... to testify.\nPhoenix:\nWhat was that...?\nAndrews:\nTh-There's a law... It says I can't be forced to testify about something... if it can incriminate me!\nJudge:\nWell, yes... You are absolutely correct, Ms. Andrews. The law does provide us with a way to avoid self-incrimination... by allowing a witness to not testify if the testimony can cause damage to themselves.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!? (\"Pleading the fifth\" is not something most people would think to do on the spot! Actually... Thinking back to yesterday in Mr. Engarde's room...)\nvon Karma:\nAdrian Andrews!\nAndrews:\nY-Yes...?\nvon Karma:\nThink hard about what we just discussed. Understood!?\nAndrews:\nA-Alright... ...\nPhoenix:\n(That's it. That's when Franziska planted this idea into her head... She must have told Ms. Andrews to not testify if things looked bad.)\nMia:\nYou did a good job proving everything up to this point, Phoenix. But there is still one thing you haven't done.\nPhoenix:\nSomething I haven't done...?\nEdgeworth:\nHeh heh heh. What's wrong, Wright? Are you finished already? Run out of evidence?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nWhat is so humorous, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sure you realize this as well, Your Honor... But, everything the good lawyer here has proven up to this point is meaningless.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nEdgeworth:\nEverything you have proven is circumstantial.\nPhoenix:\nCircumstantial...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, circumstantial. You have yet to provide a single piece of definitive proof. Proof that Ms. Andrews, did in fact, harbor a wish to murder Mr. Corrida!\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Andrews! You... Did you want to kill Mr. Corrida...?\nAndrews:\nI believe this may lead to me incriminating myself, so I will abstain from answering.\nJudge:\nBut Ms. Andrews... If you do that, it would be the same as admitting your guilt, don't you think...?\nAndrews:\nMaybe so, or maybe not. There is nothing to prove it either way. Besides, you don't even know what crime I would be \"guilty\" of due to my silence.\nPhoenix:\n(NO!! She's taking that defiant attitude again!) M-Mia! What should we do...?\nMia:\nSomehow, we've landed in the worst possible situation.\nJudge:\nI think we have reached a certain conclusion at this point in time. Ms. Adrian Andrews has refused to testify. And the defense's theory that she is the actual murderer... has not been fully substantiated with solid, definitive proof.\nPhoenix:\nBut! That's not true!\nJudge:\nIn this situation, there is only one thing this court can do. And that is to declare a recess.\nPhoenix:\nR-Recess...!?\nJudge:\nI request that both the prosecution and the defense look further into this matter. And at tomorrow's trial...\nPhoenix:\n(T-Tomorrow...!? We don't have a \"tomorrow\"! If we don't get a not guilty verdict today, then...)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nPlease wait, Your Honor! Th...That's not necessary! The trial... Please continue the trial!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you sweating for...? Your client is getting one more day to live, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\nThat... That's not it! This isn't about that. Edgeworth! I know you know who the real killer is! Please... Let the trial continue! If I don't get the verdict... then Maya...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nJudge:\nBut it's impossible to continue as long as the witness refuses to testify. Now then, this court is...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIt is not impossible for this trial to continue.\nAndrews:\n...!\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you...\nEdgeworth:\nIt's true Ms. Andrews holds the right against self-incrimination; however, if the topic of conversation were something unrelated to whatever she may be guilty of, then she has no right to withhold testimony!\nJudge:\nY-Yes, that is very true, but...\nEdgeworth:\nActually, there is one little thing that I'm curious about. Ms. Andrews.\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nWhen you found the victim's dead body, you poured yourself a glass of juice.\nAndrews:\nY-Yes... And...?\nEdgeworth:\nI can't help but think how unnatural that is. Usually when one finds a body, they are shaken up, not stirring a glass of juice.\nAndrews:\nSo my actions were \"unusual\"? But I've already...\nEdgeworth:\nBefore you speak, I want to state that if you have a reason behind your actions, I would like you to testify to that effect.\nAndrews:\nTestify...!?\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor! I would like to request that the witness testify again as to what happened when she first discovered the victim's body! Whatever we find out in this testimony should in no way implicate the witness.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nMia:\nI don't know what it is about Edgeworth today, but I can't get a good read off of him. Is he friend or foe? I just don't know...\nJudge:\nThe court acknowledges the prosecution's request. Ms. Andrews, if you please.\nWitness Testimony\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nThat glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.\nI was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.\nAnd Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.\nWhen I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.\nTo be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.\nWhen I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.\nJudge:\nHmm... So you poured that glass of juice for the victim. Why didn't you say so in your earlier testimony?\nAndrews:\n...I didn't think I needed to include something so trivial.\nMia:\nPhoenix. Please be careful here. If you can't find anything wrong with this testimony, then there's nothing left...\nPhoenix:\nI know. (Edgeworth... What the heck is going on in that brain of yours...?)\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nThat glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut... There wasn't anyone else in the room, right?\nAndrews:\nOf course not.\nPhoenix:\nThen... who did you pour it for?\nAndrews:\nMr. Wright. There is a rhyme and reason for everything. Can you wait just a little longer for it to be revealed to you?\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, Wright, \"Be quiet and listen.\"\nAndrews:\nPrecisely! I couldn't have said it better myself.\nPhoenix:\nUnnngh...\nAndrews:\nI was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo, it was a \"mess\"? Are you sure it wasn't messy because of your fight with Mr. Corrida...?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI understand your frustrations at not being able to prove your theory. However... Before you go accusing people of crimes, go find yourself some evidence!\nPhoenix:\n(Grr...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnd then, what did you see next, witness?\nAndrews:\nAnd Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSlumped over?\nAndrews:\nYes, he was just sitting there with his head tilted forward, eyes closed. He really looked like he was sleeping.\nPhoenix:\n(...Is it just me or did that right there sound a little... odd?)\nAndrews:\nWhen I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThen what did cross your mind?\nAndrews:\nI thought maybe he had smashed everything up in anger because he lost the Grand Prix. And then felt tired after his rampage, so he decided to take a nap... Anyways, that's what I thought...\nJudge:\nI see. So you didn't think he was dead at all.\nPresent Crime Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"\nAndrews:\nTo be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou thought he fainted...?\nAndrews:\nI thought he was asleep at first. But then, the room was in such a messy state... I thought maybe he had gotten into a fight with someone...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that's when you went to pour the glass of juice?\nAndrews:\nYes. He always has a hard time waking up. So Juan always has a glass of tomato juice to drink.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. And after that, what happened next?\nPresent Crime Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"\nAndrews:\nWhen I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd how did you come to realize that he was, in fact, dead?\nAndrews:\nI shook him over and over, but I never got a response... So I set the glass down on the dresser and tried to take his pulse. I... I was shocked... and staggered backward...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd knocked the flower vase over. So that's what happened.\nAndrews:\n...Yes.\nPresent Crime Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"\nMia:\n... This is what it all comes down to.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nThis is the absolute end for both sides... And Adrian is letting her guard down. Phoenix, now is our best chance yet to kill the prosecution's case!\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that a bit harsh...? Ms. Andrews... Will you tell us the truth this time...?)\nPhoenix:\nSo you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\nAndrews:\nNo, not at all...\nPhoenix:\nEven though this is what you saw when you discovered the body?\nAndrews:\n...Ah!\nJudge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nIsn't it obvious, Your Honor? There is a knife sticking straight out of Mr. Corrida's chest! Anyone who saw this scene would have immediately thought that here was a dead man!\nAndrews:\nAh... Um... That's... Well, you see...\nPhoenix:\nI doubt a single person in the world would mistake this for someone who fainted, and then so nonchalantly go pour something to drink!\nJudge:\nY-Your point is...?\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews! Your testimony just now... It was all one giant lie!\nAndrews:\nUngh!\nPhoenix:\nAnd your lie has proven one thing very clearly. That you are the real killer!\nAndrews:\n... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!\nJudge:\nIt looks like the defense has somehow brought the ugly truth to light. The defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde, is not guilty after all...\nAndrews:\nThat... But that's impossible! You're wrong...\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Andrews! Try to have some composure!\nAndrews:\nIt... It wasn't me... It wasn't me, I tell you! It was Matt! I swear it! He's the one who killed Juan!\nPhoenix:\nBut you were the one who refused to testify! And your reason for not doing so was that you \"might\" end up incriminating yourself!\nAndrews:\nTh-That's because...\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews, I will give you one last chance. What exactly are you hiding that may \"incriminate\" you?\nAndrews:\n... I... I... I refuse... to testify.\nJudge:\nThen there is no need for this court to continue any further. Mr. Matt Engarde's innocence has been clearly demonstrated.\nPhoenix:\n(Is... Is it... over...? Have we... Have we found the truth at last...?)\nMia:\nWhat's wrong, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nUsually... Well, usually, the real killer confesses his or her guilt. And now that I think about it, this is the first time someone hasn't.\nJudge:\nNow then, I would like to hand down my verdict for Mr. Matt Engarde.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. The prosecution feels that it would be premature to pass down a verdict at this time.\nJudge:\nWh-What...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe reason is quite simple. This witness has yet to speak the absolute, real truth.\nJudge:\nThe \"absolute, real truth\"...? What are you...?\nEdgeworth:\nWitness... Don't you understand yet?\nAndrews:\n...Huh?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know who planted this silly idea in your head, but as long as you \"protect\" yourself through your silence, Matt Engarde will go free. And in his place... YOU will become the guilty party!\nAndrews:\n...Th-That's... That's a lie! I... I don't believe you!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nAndrews:\nI... I was told... If I spoke... If I spoke, then it would be all over... And Matt would never be declared guilty...\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What in the world is she talking about!? Has she lost it!?)\nAndrews:\nI... I can't speak about it... I'm too scared...\nMia:\nIt's Franziska von Karma...\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nMia:\nDon't you rememeber, Phoenix? Ms. Andrews lives by gripping tightly onto the words of another. Because she doesn't have the strength to believe in herself.\nPhoenix:\nTh...Then, right now... Ms. Andrews is...\nMia:\nYesterday, she was tossed a life-saver by Ms. von Karma. \"Don't say a word, no matter what happens. If you do, Matt Engarde will be acquitted.\" Ms. Andrews undyingly believes in those words right now, and is clinging onto them...\nPhoenix:\n(Th-Then what should we do!? This... This is the first time I've ever come across anything like this! But Ms. Andrews has to be the killer, right!? All we have to do now is... is get our not guilty... That is my only priority!)\nAndrews:\nIt wasn't me! I'm begging you, please believe me! I didn't kill Juan! Help... Please... Someone... Help me...!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe court can't continue on like this, therefore I'd like to hear what you intend to do.\nPhoenix:\n(What I intend to do...!? Wh-What am I supposed to do!? What am I supposed to say!?)\nEdgeworth:\nWright! I suggest you think very carefully about this! Think about what this witness did, and what she did NOT do! And think about who is the real mastermind behind this crime!\nPhoenix:\n(Who's the real mastermind? Isn't that obvious!? There's no one else it could be except the woman crying over there! ...Right?)\nEdgeworth:\nCome now! What will you do!? What kind of man are you, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?\nRequest \"not guilty\" verdict\nPhoenix:\n(No matter what she says... Ms. Andrews is the only person it could be! Not to mention... I don't have a choice. I have to win a complete acquittal today!) Y-Your Honor! The defense believes there is enough evidence to substantiate our claim! Therefore, we motion that this court passes a verdict of \"not guilty\" as soon as possible!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nI'm disappointed in you, Wright! What have you learned in this past year!?\nLeads to:\n\"That's enough!\"\nForce Andrews to testify\nPhoenix:\n(I have to win a complete acquittal today... There's no way around that! But... I can't bring myself to do it like this! Not when she's making a face like that...) Ms. Andrews! I would like to know what you are really hiding!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Wright! Are you sure you know what you're doing!?\nPhoenix:\nSure, Mr. Engarde would get an acquittal, but in his place, you would be found guilty! Is this... Is this how you really want this trial to end!?\nAndrews:\nB-Be quiet... How dare you!? You... You're trying to trick me!\nLeads to:\n\"That's enough!\"\nJudge:\nThat's enough! I commend you for trying, Mr. Edgeworth. However, it's clear that the defense's theory is the truth.\nAndrews:\n...Y...You're wrong...\nEdgeworth:\n... What a shame... (Changed from [Such a shame...] in the original release)\nAndrews:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nI had hoped things wouldn't come to this, however...\nJudge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Andrews. Since you absolutely refuse to testify... It falls on my shoulders to disclose this to the court.\nAndrews:\n...S...Stop...\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis witness... How should I put this... She has an illness.\nAndrews:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd because of this illness, she has tried to commit suicide in the past.\nAndrews:\nS-Stop... Please stop...!\nEdgeworth:\nNo matter how much you want to hide it, it's no use. I have the evidence right here.\nAndrews:\nAh! Th-That's...!\nPhoenix:\n(That's the second part of the suicide report -- the attempted suicide report!)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat will you do now, witness? You know what I am about to do, don't you? I will now reveal to the court, the true nature of the pitiful woman known as Adrian Andrews!\nPhoenix:\n(The secret of her dependent nature... (Changed from [The secret of her co-dependant [sic] nature...] in the original release) Having other people know about it scares her more than anything else in the world...)\nAndrews:\nPlease! Please STOP!! I beg you!! If people find out... If people find out... I... I'll...\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're going to say you would \"choose death\", that is of no concern to me.\nAndrews:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth... How can you be so cold...!?)\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, before you die... I will pull the truth from your still-breathing lips! (Changed from [I will pull the truth from your breathing lips!] in the original release) ... No matter what I have to do.\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nSo, will you tell the court yourself, or shall I!? Either is fine with me.\nAndrews:\n... ... ...I... I'll talk. But please... Help me... N-Nothing matters anymore...\nWitness Testimony\n-- My \"Crime\" --\nAndrews:\nWhen I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest.\nWhen I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan.\nOnce I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room.\nAnd then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button.\nJust when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience.\nAnd that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume.\nJudge:\nS-Stabbed the body!? With the knife!? But why would you do that!?\nAndrews:\nIsn't it obvious? To pin the blame on a certain person... A certain cowardly man!\nJudge:\nWh... What do you mean by all of this...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt might take this court a little while to understand, but... This is the truth.\nAndrews:\nThe real killer is Matt! That scumbag of a man! I'll never forgive him! He's trying to escape his guilt again! Just like last time!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Last time\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nSo, Ms. Andrews stabbed the victim, Juan Corrida, in the chest with the knife. However, she didn't do it with murder in mind. She did it with the intent of framing Matt Engarde for the murder... And this! This is her \"crime\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-WHAT!? How is this possible!? I mean... Wasn't Ms. Andrews supposed to be the real murderer!?)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Please get over your shock and commence the cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- My \"Crime\" --\nAndrews:\nWhen I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut you could tell from the state the room was in, that there must have been a fight! Are you telling the truth when you say that you did not know he was dead?\nAndrews:\nHe... had a scarf tied around his neck... But that scarf is a part of the Jammin' Ninja's costume... So... So I didn't think anything about it was strange... His head was also... tilted down a bit, so I couldn't see his face that well... That's why I thought I'd wake him up... and went to pour the juice...\nAndrews:\nWhen I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhat is this \"plan\" you had?\nAndrews:\n... I knew right away the murderer was Matt. I knew because Juan... He was going to expose Matt's weakest weakpoint to the world. So Matt did this to stop Juan, and silence him for good. That's when I thought, \"I should forge some evidence and pin this crime on Matt.\"\nEdgeworth:\nSo the forged pieces of evidence were the knife and the button...\nAndrews:\nThe first thing that came to mind was to plant the knife.\nAndrews:\nOnce I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThat was so you could get the knife, correct?\nAndrews:\nThe knife Matt used at dinner had his fingerprints all over it. I thought if I used that, then the police would certainly turn their eyes towards him. Matt was napping with his costume on at the time. I slipped in, took the knife, and returned to the scene of the crime.\nAndrews:\nAnd then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo you were the one to stab the victim with that knife.\nAndrews:\nIt gives me goosebumps to think about it now... What a horrible thing I did... But... At the time, I couldn't control my own body. It moved on its own. Then, when I stabbed Juan's dead body... I suddenly realized something. If I used the button somehow, I could make Matt look even more suspect.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you thought to rip one of the buttons off and then plant it in Mr. Engarde's hakama.\nAndrews:\nYes... That's what I had planned to do. ...But things never go that smoothly, do they?\nAndrews:\nJust when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAn \"inconvenience\"...?\nAndrews:\nThere was a woman with a camera at the ready, loitering in the hallway.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm willing to bet my spikes it was Lotta...)\nAndrews:\nThere was also a woman with a ray gun at the ready pacing back and forth...\nPhoenix:\n(That's Ms. Oldbag for you...)\nAndrews:\nI had already been caught and made into a big scoop for a certain weekly tabloid once, so I couldn't very well go out looking like myself and get caught again.\nAndrews:\nAnd that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one who prepared that costume, weren't you?\nAndrews:\nYes. I took it from Global Studios... I also put it into Juan's guitar case the day before the award ceremony.\nEdgeworth:\nYou did this in preparation for the press conference, correct?\nAndrews:\nYes, Juan wanted to wear that costume and hold a press conference in it. He was going to disclose Matt's big secret there.\nJudge:\nAnd what is this \"secret\"...?\nAndrews:\n... ...That, I don't know. Anyway, I thought that if I were to leave Juan's room in the Nickel Samurai costume... then people would think that Matt was the \"real\" murderer. I was very careful not to leave any fingerprints when I opened the guitar case. I absolutely did not want anyone to know about the costume.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't want to concede, but this testimony... it rings of the truth...)\nMia:\nI'm sorry, Phoenix...\nPhoenix:\nN-No, please, don't apologize to me. We were both taken by surprise.\nMia:\nStill, I'm sorry...\nAfter pressing all statements:\nJudge:\nI think we've heard enough! So, after that, you went back to Mr. Engarde's room and planted the button?\nAndrews:\n...Into Matt's hakama? Yes. After that, I folded up the costume I was wearing and put it into a bag. Then I snuck it out of the hotel and got rid of it.\nJudge:\nM-My word... What does all this mean...?\nAndrews:\n...Mr. Edgeworth, is it?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nAndrews:\nThe real criminal... is Matt Engarde!! Yesterday... That woman prosecutor sat me down for a talk...\nPhoenix:\n(Franziska, huh...)\nAndrews:\nShe said that I should, under no circumstances, confess to what I had done. That if I just kept quiet, then Matt would be found guilty for sure... I... I had no choice but to believe in her words...\nPhoenix:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\n...............\nJudge:\nWhat this witness has done is clearly unlawful. However... As long as her testimony stands, we can be certain she is not the real killer!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait, Your Honor! The defense still...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWright.\nPhoenix:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's pointless. At this point in time, it is not possible to indict Ms. Andrews on anything.\nJudge:\nYes, exactly. There isn't a single piece of evidence that points to her as the murderer. The cross-examination of this witness is over. And so is today's trial. You couldn't establish that the witness was the culprit. Please let it go, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nB-But!\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth, please place Ms. Andrews under arrest for further questioning.\nEdgeworth:\nUnderstood, Your Honor. The prosecution will arrange for her detention immediately.\nJudge:\nThat's all. Court is adjourned for today!\nPhoenix:\n(Today's... Today's trial... It's over...! And I didn't win an acquittal!)\nEdgeworth:\nWitness... Would you mind if I asked you something?\nPhoenix:\n...! (Edgeworth...?)\nAndrews:\nWhat is it...?\nEdgeworth:\nBefore you leave court today, I wondered if I might look at one thing. The card in your hand. It's had my interest for quite some time now. What exactly is it...?\nAndrews:\nOh, this...? Mr. Wright also asked about this. Although I didn't remember at the time you asked me about it, Mr. Wright, I remembered just now. I found this in the room on that day.\nPhoenix:\n\"The room\"...?\nEdgeworth:\n\"That day\"...?\nAndrews:\nYes. I found this card when I discovered Juan's body. It was lying there right next to him...\nPhoenix:\nYou found that card... next to the victim's body?\nAndrews:\nI suppose I must have unconsciously slipped it into my pocket... ...But it's not as if this card has any relevance to Juan's murder, right?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I guess not. But it's still a strange card, if you ask me... But as far as a clue to this case...? I don't see why...)\n???:\nEdgeworth:\nWitness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry!\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time!\nAndrews:\nI... I didn't mean to...\nMia:\nWh-What is this all about...?\nPhoenix:\n(I've never seen Edgeworth so emotional before... (Changed from [I've never seen such an emotional Edgeworth in my entire life...] in the original release) That card... What in the world is it? And what does it mean...!?)\nTo be continued.\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?\nJudge:\nUh... I'm not sure I follow you.\nPhoenix:\nIt clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...\nJudge:\nYou don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!\nJudge:\n...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really?\nJudge:\nObjection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHow exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?\nPhoenix:\nThey aren't, are they...\nJudge:\nNot at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!\nJudge:\n... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)\nToo many penalties\nJudge:\nThat's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Matt Engarde...\nGuilty\nJudge:\nThe accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!\nFarewell, My Turnabout\nTranscript\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nMarch 22, 5:24 PMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPearl:\nMystic Maya... M-Mystic Mayaaa... *sniffle, sniffle*\nPhoenix:\nThere, there, Pearls...\nPearl:\nI... I can't take it... anymore... ...Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...\nPhoenix:\nL-Look! It'll be alright! Everything may still work out.\nPearl:\nHm...?\nPhoenix:\nThe condition was that we had to get a \"not guilty\" verdict. And so far, the kidnapper has kept his word and hasn't hurt Maya. And he won't because Mr. Engarde hasn't been given a \"guilty\" sentence yet!\nPearl:\nUnngg... Nnmff... *sniffle, sniffle*\nPhoenix:\nCheer up! We don't have time to stand around crying! We have to get going!\nPearl:\n... Y-You're right... Mystic Maya is in much more pain than I am!\nPhoenix:\nYes, that's right. So...\n???:\nHey! You guys! Glad I caught you, pal!\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Scruffy Detective...\nPhoenix:\n(...Oh boy. Looks like Detective Gumshoe... has been dubbed \"Mr. Scruffy Detective\" in Pearls's book now...)\nGumshoe:\nIt's just plain ol' \"Mr. Dick Gumshoe\" now, and I came to talk to you, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(But we're kind of busy right now...)\nExamine\nCharley the plant\nGumshoe:\nHey, it's wilting a little!\nPearl:\nI'll... I'll give it some delicious water, pal!\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK... I already did that...\nGumshoe:\n...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?\nPhoenix:\n(Did he just call the watering can, \"Mr.\"?)\nPoster\nPearl:\nThis is the... uh... Nickel Samurai, right?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's right.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!?\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.\nPearl:\nOh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either...\nGumshoe:\nB-But I can read AND I'm tall, pal!\nPhoenix:\nP-Please stop competing with an 8 year old... It's disturbing...\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh! I cleaned it up even more for you last night!\nGumshoe:\nB-But I can get it even more cleaner, pal!\nPearl:\nAaah! That's... That's for the toilet!!\nPhoenix:\n(What a mess. Literally...)\nTalk\nThe future\nPhoenix:\nSo, what are you going to do from now on?\nGumshoe:\nWhadaya mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you've been fired, right? So, do you have a new job lined up yet?\nGumshoe:\nOh, that! A-Ah... What am I supposed to do now, pal!? I... I don't have anything coming in at all until my next payday!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you talking about!? You don't have another payday!\nGumshoe:\n... I guess that means I'm just gonna half [sic] to work here at your place, pal!\nPhoenix:\nS-SAY WHAT!?\nGumshoe:\nYou'll be searching for things that will prove Mr. Engarde's innocence all day, right?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well... yeah...\nGumshoe:\nSo yeah! I'm going to help you, pal! I've got lots of experience in investigating, and watching over people's places! And I'm great at making really simple meals, pal! I'll take care of it all!\nPearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Let's let Mr. Scruffy Detective take care of things!\nPhoenix:\nA-Ah... OK... By the way, what's your best dish?\nGumshoe:\nInstant noodles, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(Why am I surrounded by people who only eat cheap, unhealthy foods...?)\nEdgeworth\nGumshoe:\n...That was the first time I've ever seen Mr. Edgeworth act like that... Never thought he'd say something like, he didn't care if Ms. Andrews killed herself...\nPearl:\nH-He said that!? That's horrible...\nGumshoe:\nBut because of him doing that, we got the truth finally.\nPhoenix:\n...The truth... (Ms. Andrews' last testimony; I wonder if that was the truth...?) I'll give you that there was nothing strange in her testimony itself. But... I still think there is something fundamentally wrong with the whole thing.\nGumshoe:\nYou mean about \"that\" thing, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWhy would she want to -- no, I mean, almost \"need\" to frame Mr. Engarde... I couldn't figure that out from anything she said all day!\nGumshoe:\n... Then... Then you're saying that testimony... was a lie...?\nPhoenix:\nNot a lie, per se... It just feels like there's more here than meets the eye. Or that's what Edgeworth would like us to believe...\nPearl:\nTh-That's such a dirty trick! Even that woman prosecutor was better than that!\nPhoenix:\n(Franziska von Karma...) Speaking of Ms. von Karma, do you have any more information on her condition? Wasn't she shot this morning!?\nFranziska (appears after \"Edgeworth\")\nGumshoe:\nMs. von Karma was shot today on the way to the trial by a pistol, pal.\nPhoenix:\nB-But she's going to be fine, right? I mean, Edgeworth said she was in \"stable condition\", but...\nGumshoe:\nWell, she was shot in the shoulder, so she's OK and still hanging in there. They should be done taking the bullet out, so she's probably resting at the hospital.\nPhoenix:\nWhich one...?\nGumshoe:\nWhat? Are you going to visit her, pal?\nPhoenix:\nN-No... Well, I was kind of thinking about it...\nGumshoe:\nHey! You've actually got a heart, don't you!? She looked like she was being tortured to death not being able to go to the trial today, so maybe it'd be good for her if you went and let her whip you for a bit, pal!\nPearl:\nLet's go let her whip us, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nNow I'm DEFINITELY not going.\nGumshoe:\nUm... let's see... The name of the hospital... Oh yeah! The \"Hotti Clinic\"!\nPhoenix:\n(That name sends a chill down my spine... Well, I guess it can't hurt to stop by and say hi...)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nLook, it's my attorney's badge.\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's a little tarnished, don't you think, pal? Don't worry! I'll make it all sparkly shiny again!\nPhoenix:\n(I... I'm really touched...)\nRadio Transceiver\nGumshoe:\nHave you heard anything from the kidnapper...?\nPhoenix:\n...No... not yet.\nGumshoe:\nI'm sure once he hears what happened at the trial today, he'll call, pal. But remember! You can't provoke him when you get to talk to him!\nJammin' Ninja's Button\nGumshoe:\nWhen I saw that button, I thought to myself, \"This is gonna prove Mr. Engarde's guilty!\"... But it looks like there was a lot more to it than I thought, huh pal?\nPhoenix:\nYou're a pro. You should know better than to say something like that.\nGumshoe:\nW-Well, I'm not a cop anymore. Just a regular helper around the office now, so...\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if he misses working down at the precinct...?)\nKnife\nGumshoe:\nWho would've thought that this knife Mr. Engarde used to eat his dinner steak with...\nPhoenix:\nGo on...\nGumshoe:\n...That it would be stabbed into the victim's body by Ms. Andrews, of all people. I guess she just hated the victim that much, huh pal?\nPhoenix:\nThe question isn't why she hated the victim to that extend, but rather why she tried to pin the murder on Mr. Engarde.\nPearl:\nI wonder if she really hates Mr. Engarde?\nLotta's Photo\nGumshoe:\nSo this \"Nickel Samurai\" was really Ms. Andrews, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. This is either when she went to Mr. Engarde's room to get the knife... ...or when she was done with the foul deed. But I guess we'll never know.\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nIt'll be OK! You'll see her again, little missy!\nPearl:\nY-Yeah!\nGumshoe:\nIt's really important that you don't give up!\nPearl:\nO-OK!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess a big voice really does give you a sense of presence...)\nPearl:\nI... I won't give up. Ever!\nPearl Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nCheer up! You can't give in, missy!\nPearl:\nY-Yeah!\nGumshoe:\nHey! I know! I'll show you something cool! How's this? It's a real, genuine pistol... ... I... I don't have my pistol or my police badge anymore...\nPearl:\nCheer up! You can't give in!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yeah!\nPhoenix:\n(What are those two doing...?)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nPeople are jealous of my roguishly cool \"detective look\", pal. It's because of this look that I passed the detective's test, you know.\nPhoenix:\nOh.\nGumshoe:\nBut you know, people can't coast through life on their looks alone, pal.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you can't count on your looks alone.\nPearl:\nWow... I learned something new today...\nFranziska von Karma profile\nPhoenix:\nIs she alright...? After being shot, I mean...\nGumshoe:\nHer wound isn't that bad... Well, the gunshot wound anyway... But the wound to her pride, now that's a different story, pal.\nPhoenix:\nThe wound to her pride?\nGumshoe:\nWell, until now, she's always upheld the \"Von Karma Creed\", but since she came here, well, you've given her pride quite a beating, pal.\nPhoenix:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nI mean, she may act all grown-up, but she's really still just an 18 year old. ...Quite frankly, I worry about her, pal.\nMiles Edgeworth profile\nGumshoe:\nThat's the first time I've seen that side of Mr. Edgeworth, pal. Forcing people to say what he wants them to during testimony... I want to know what in the world happened to him all this time he's been gone...\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nI can't believe it. Maya getting kidnapped all because of this guy... I mean, what kind of person is the real murderer anyway!?\nPearl:\nMaybe they're a big fan of Mr. Engarde?\nPhoenix:\n(But the kidnapper's voice... He sounded like an old man to me...)\nAdrian Andrews profile\nGumshoe:\nMy impression of her has totally changed, pal.\nPhoenix:\nUm... So, where is she right now...?\nGumshoe:\nI'm sure she's being questioned down at the precinct. At the very least about messing with the body, and obstructing the investigation. And she'll probably be staying over at the detention center...\nPhoenix:\n(The detention center, huh...)\nCeleste Inpax profile\nGumshoe:\nShe was Ms. Adrian Andrews' mentor.\nPhoenix:\n(Because of the suicide of the mentor she depended on, Adrian Andrews tried to follow her in an attempted suicide... Now the question is, who is Ms. Andrews relying on now...?)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nCould you please take a look at this...?\nGumshoe:\nUm... I can't think of anything to say about this, pal. ... Wh-Why don't I make us some instant noodles, instead?\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's OK... Really.\nMarch 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(From what the guard told me... It sounds like along with Mr. Engarde, Ms. Andrews is also being detained here.)\nPearl:\nThen we should talk with them since we're here...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but both of them are still in questioning.\nPearl:\nHmm... And we don't have time to waste.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, visiting hours are almost over...)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera.\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitor's the visitor's room. Catching a few z's while he's standing; now that's a good way to spend free time.\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPearl:\nAlright now, Mr. Nick! Let's go look for clues! We have to, for Mystic Maya's sake...\n???:\nYou shall not pass!\nPhoenix:\n*gasp* Ms. Oldbag!\nOldbag:\nDon't devalue my name and turn it into a gasp, you spiky-headed poof! Because of you, I've been made to look like the bad guy again! Although, I did get a piece of gum from Edgey-boy, just as he promised... But what I really wanted was something much more valuable! I wanted Edgey-poo's heart! I want it all for me! It's all your fault! You've awakened the wild beast inside of this Oldbag! Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! (Changed from [Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!] in the original release)\nPearl:\nAah! Ms. Oldbag!\nOldbag:\nKeep your hands off of me! This helmet is airtight! No air's [sic] gets in and no air gets out!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Then why do you keep putting it on...?Umm... What does your helmet have to do with anything?\nOldbag:\nHmph! Don't tal release ({{{2}}})hink you can get me to move with silly questions! You're going to have to defeat me if you want to get by!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not hearing this...)\nExamine\nAnywhere\nOldbag:\nHey! I said no restless loitering and no touching! You're interfering with my watch, and that's a no-no!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Looks like in order to search around here... I have to first get this kooky \"alien\" to go away...)\nTalk\nAny options\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nOldbag:\nHah! You're a million light-years too early to be asking ME questions, whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Looks like the only way I'm going to get any investigating done... is to first do something about this kooky \"alien\"...)\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Could you please take a look at this...?\nOldbag:\nHmph! Sorry, sonny. I can't see it very well through this helmet!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Looks like the only way I'm going to get any investigating done... is to first do something about this kooky \"alien\"...)\nOldbag:\nI see that look in your eyes! You stop thinking I'm an alien from outer space this instant!\nMarch 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nPearl:\nWow. Everybody looks really busy with something or another...\nPhoenix:\nHmm... They're probably strengthening the evidence for tomorrow's trial.\nDetective:\nHey! Hurry up with that, will ya!? Pass that victim's list around! ...Now you're speaking nonsense! There's more than 100 people on there!\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick...? Is Mr. Engarde a really bad, terrible criminal...?\nPhoenix:\n... Actually, Pearls, never mind. It sounds like they're working on a different case...\nExamine\nDetective on left\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.\nDetective:\n\"...Very well. Now why do you want to work for our company?\" \"Well, that would have to be because I feel I would like to help this company grow.\"\nPhoenix:\n... He must be doing image training for corporate interviews.\nChief\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.\nChief:\nWHAT!? Prosecutor von Karma was shot in front of the courthouse!? Wh-Who did it!? Who shot her!?\nPhoenix:\n(I have a sneaking suspicion that even Gumshoe could do this guy's job...)\nAfter clearing \"Franziska\" Talk option in Wright & Co. Law Offices:\nMarch 22Hotti ClinicReception\nPhoenix:\n(...Never thought I'd ever come back to this place...)\n???:\nHmm, yes... Are you here to visit a patient? Hmm...\nPhoenix:\nAh, hi... ...Wait a second! You're...!\n???:\nHmm, yes... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh.\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you still here!?\nHotti:\nHmm, yes... What is it? Hmm... Can I help you? You can tell me... Hmm, yes...\n???:\nDirector Hotti!\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth...\nHotti:\nHmm, yes... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh. ...Oh, you're the man from this morning. Hmm, yes... What is it?... Uh huh...\nEdgeworth:\nDirector. Franziska... How is Franziska von Karma?\nHotti:\nHmm... You don't need to worry. Hmm, yes... She's in good hands... Because, you see... I'm personally taking good care of her... Hmm, yes... Hee hee. Hmm, yes... and that thing... that surgery... It went well.\nEdgeworth:\n...You have my gratitude.\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like Edgeworth doesn't know about this \"Director\" and his secret...)\nHotti:\nShe looked so pitiful -- absolutely terrified. Hmm, yes... But I understand, hmm... Hmm, yes... Her opponent was a gun, after all. Uh huh. And when I snuck up on her real secret-like, she would scream really loud. Hmm, yes.\nEdgeworth:\nI see.\nHotti:\nAh, but she's really cute too. When I'd do that, she'd whip me with her whip, uh huh... Boy did I cry like a baby. Hmm, yes... But I think I could get used to it. Hmm... Hmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nGo back to your room.\nHotti:\nYou're so mean, uh huh... So mean... my frisky Friska. But that's good too-- Hmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! OK, OK... I... Hmm, yes... It's time for my IV drops. Hmm, yes...\nvon Karma:\n... And what are those tulips doing in your hand, Mr. Phoenix Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! I knew I shouldn't have come here!)\nExamine\nWaiting room on left\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the waiting area. It's got the feeling of one and there are sofas lined up... but I don't see all that many patients.\nHotti:\nHmm, yes... well, visiting hours are over. That's why... Hmm... It's time for nightly consultations to begin... Mine, that is... Heh heh heh.\nPhoenix:\n(...Isn't there anyone keeping an eye on this guy...?)\nDoor at the back\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder where that door way down there leads to...?)\nHotti:\nOh, that's the X-ray room. Hmm, yes...\nPhoenix:\nH-H-How did you know what I was thinking!?\nHotti:\nHmm, yes... Well, it's... Because that's the X-ray room... Uh huh, yes...\nPhoenix:\n(There is something very peculiar about this guy... Because I know it's not me...)\nLimping patient\nPhoenix:\nThis patient is undergoing rehabilitation.\nHotti:\nWasn't that patient standing in the same spot the last time you came to visit? Doesn't look like they've moved any closer to the reception desk, huh? Is this clinic really doing anything!? Is that patient really getting better!? Hmm...\nPhoenix:\nHey! Don't just cut into my monologue like that! I'm explaining things here!\nHotti:\nAh, sorry. Hmm, yes... Most sorry... Yes... Uh, huh...\nReception area\nPhoenix:\nThis is the clinic's reception desk, but it doesn't look like there's anyone at the counter. On the wall is this month's \"Word to the Wise\": \"Put your best foot forward.\" Putting this up at a general clinic like this is doesn't really mean much, does it...?\nTalk\nThe shooting\nvon Karma:\nI was shot in front of the courthouse, in my right shoulder. Hmph... It's no big deal. This sort of thing happens all the time. I even had full intentions of running the trial this morning.\nPearl:\nBut! But that would've been too much for you! (Changed from [But! But that would've been too much!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(There's no need to act tough in front of us, you know...) (Changed from [Yeah! You looked like you were deathly scared until only a few minutes ago...] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nRegardless, I was dragged here by THAT man over there. (Changed from [But I was dragged here by THAT prosecutor.] in the original release) He was so unyielding, one has to wonder if he was simply interested in stealing my case. (Changed from [He even went so far as to grab me by the wrist the whole way here.] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nIt was the only logical course of action given the bullet was still lodged in your shoulder. But by taking over the case... (Changed from [But with me doing so...] in the original release) I found myself having to clean up after you and that irresponsible deal you made.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(I think I know what \"deal\" he's referring to...)\nThe deal\nPhoenix:\nMs. von Karma. You made a deal with Ms. Andrews yesterday, didn't you?\nvon Karma:\nI don't know what you mean.\nPhoenix:\nIn order to make sure you got your guilty verdict on Mr. Engarde, you told Ms. Andrews to not testify in court today.\nvon Karma:\nHmph, I don't know what you're talking about. Do you have proof that I made such a deal?\nPhoenix:\nY-You're denying it!?\nvon Karma:\n... It looks like you were lucky, Mr. Phoenix Wright. If I had been in court today, this trial would already be over.\nPhoenix:\nAll while hiding Ms. Andrews' own crime?\nvon Karma:\nThat isn't my problem. Whether she had tampered with evidence or not... I have only one objective. To find Engarde guilty of murder. The end justifies the means, Mr. Phoenix Wright. The end justifies the means.\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nAah!\nvon Karma:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that's all I get...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n...Ms. von Karma. Adrian Andrews believed you when you said, \"If you don't tell the truth of what really happened, then Engarde will be found guilty.\"\nvon Karma:\nAnd what does that have to do with me?\nPhoenix:\nBecause of that, she is now in danger of being found guilty herself! All because she believed in your words until the very end...\nvon Karma:\n... That still has nothing to do with me. She's just a weak person, that's all.\nPhoenix:\nBut you had to know she was... OWWW!\nvon Karma:\n... I think visiting hours here are about over. So, if you'll excuse me.\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong? Why did she suddenly cut you off...?\nPhoenix:\n(Probably because she thinks I had the advantage in that argument... ...Edgeworth...)\nTalk\nToday's trial\nPhoenix:\nWhat happened today at the trial, Edgeworth? That was not like you at all...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI mean, I know you knew about Ms. Andrews' condition. You could have made her testify as many times as you wanted, but to go that far...!\nEdgeworth:\n...Ah, but she wouldn't testify about THAT until I said something. Listen, Wright. The courtroom is a garden of judgment. I am putting myself on the line when I stand in there. And that's why I made the witness do the same... It's only natural.\nAdrian's card\nPhoenix:\nBy the way, Edgeworth... You were really angry in court today... That's rare for you.\nEdgeworth:\nWitness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry!\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time!\nPhoenix:\nThat card... What in the world is it?\nEdgeworth:\n... You mean this...? ... Listen, Wright. This is top secret information. You absolutely cannot leak this. A special investigation team has existed for a number of years, but few know of it.\nPhoenix:\nI-I understand.\nEdgeworth:\nTheir task is to find the \"owner\" of this card... A man called Shelly de Killer. And just as his name states, he is a \"killer\", an assassin. The best, at that.\nPhoenix:\n(An assassin!?)\nPicture Card added to the Court Record.\nAdrian's card (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nBy the way, Edgeworth... You were really angry in court today... That's rare for you.\nEdgeworth:\nWitness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry!\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time!\nPhoenix:\nThat card... What in the world is it?\nEdgeworth:\n... You mean this...? ... Listen, Wright. This is top secret information. You absolutely cannot leak this. A special investigation team has existed for a number of years, but few know of it.\nPhoenix:\nI-I understand.\nEdgeworth:\nTheir task is to find the \"owner\" of this card... A man called Shelly de Killer. And just as his name states, he is a \"killer\", an assassin. The best, at that.\nPhoenix:\n(An assassin!?)\nAssassin (appears after \"Adrian's card\")\nPhoenix:\nSo who is this \"Shelly de Killer\"?\nEdgeworth:\n\"De Killer\" is the name of a long standing line of assassins.\nPearl:\nLong standing?\nEdgeworth:\nThe name first appeared about 100 years ago, I hear. Shelly is the professional name of the third heir to the De Killer name.\nPhoenix:\nSo because his professional name is \"Shelly\", he leaves cards with a shell on them...?\nEdgeworth:\nHe has a habit of making sure to leave a card by the body of his victims.\nPearl:\nWhy would he do something like that...?\nEdgeworth:\nWe think it is a part of his duty to his clients.\nPhoenix:\nHis \"duty\"?\nEdgeworth:\nIf he leaves a card, then his clients can be assured it was he who killed the victim. It also serves as insurance against any charges being pushed onto his clients.\nPhoenix:\n...I see...\nEdgeworth:\nDe Killer values the trust between his clients and himself above all else. It seems that this is one honorable assassin with a moral conscience.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that even honorable assassins can exist...) So, you think this assassin... You think he's the one who did the killing in this case?\nEdgeworth:\nIt would appear that way. The discovery of the card basically confirms it, wouldn't you agree?\nPhoenix:\n(Shelly de Killer, huh...)\nMaya's situation (appears after \"Assassin\")\nLeads to:\n\"I noticed something at the trial today.\"\nPresent\nAnything\nEdgeworth:\n...I've been put in charge of this case. So I can't give you any help with reagards to clues or evidence.\nPhoenix:\nYou sure are hardnosed. Totally different from Detective Gumshoe.\nEdgeworth:\n...And that is why he was fired.\nPhoenix:\n(He's got a point...)\nEdgeworth:\nI noticed something at the trial today. You were behaving in a very strange manner. ...Is something the matter?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess... I should just tell him.) Maya... She's been kidnapped.\nEdgeworth:\nK-Kidnapped? What does the kidnapper want!?\nPhoenix:\nAn acquittal.\nEdgeworth:\n... I see. I had no idea. ... I will prepare a rescue team as soon as possible, and resolve this by tomorrow.\nPearl:\nR-Really!? Did you hear that, Mr. Nick!? M-Mr. Edgeworth is going to...\nPhoenix:\nStop trying to console me, Edgeworth! I don't need your pity!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThere's no way you can find her. We don't have even a single clue to go on.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThere's only one way to save her. I... I have to get an acquittal somehow! It's the only way!\nEdgeworth:\n... Wright. Listen, you need to know something. Juan Corrida was killed by Shelly de Killer. And the client who ordered the job... is Matt Engarde... Your own client.\nPhoenix:\nPlease, stop! ...I can't listen to you. I can't believe that.\nEdgeworth:\n...I see. Well, if you want to continue your investigation, you will need this.\nPearl:\nWhat is it?\nEdgeworth:\nThe hotel right now is restricted to police personnel only, as we are looking for any clues that might lead us to Shelly de Killer. If you take this with you to the hotel, I'm sure they will let you enter.\nLetter of Introduction added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\n...In any case, I must attend to the preparations for Maya's rescue team. We'll meet again, if anything should happen. Now if you'll excuse me...\nPearl:\nMr. Nick? Do you... Do you think... Mr. Engarde hired an assassin...?\nPhoenix:\nNo way! (I mean, he doesn't have a Psyche-Lock...)\nPearl:\nY-Yeah, I guess not...\nPhoenix:\nMaya... Please... All I ask is you make it home, safe and sound!\nDate:\u00a0??? Time\u00a0???Location:\u00a0???\nMaya:\nHeh heh. I guess even kidnappers can be a little clumsy. Clumsy enough to drop a card like this for me. And even though he said he was an \"assassin\", I bet he's just making that up, like how Nick does with everything in court. Anyway, let's try out the card trick with this card I just found...\n...*click*...\nMaya:\nSounds like I got the door open... OK! Time to go take a look around!\nExamine\nDoor\nMaya:\nI've unlocked the door with this card... I should probably go and take a look around...\nDate:\u00a0??? Time\u00a0???Location:\u00a0???\nMaya:\nWh-What is this place...? I've got a feeling I'm not in the hotel anymore... Are those videos over there? ...Well, I'll worry about that later. For now, I should be looking for clues. That way, I can show them to sis and maybe get out of here!\nExamine\nTV\nMaya:\nWow, I've never seen a TV this big before. Now where's the power button... Hmm...\n...*click*...\nMaya:\n... Phooey. It's busted. I would so die a happy Samurai fan... if I ever got to see the Nickel Samurai on a TV like this. ... Ack! I can't believe I just made a joke about dying, all things considered...\nSatellite dish\nMaya:\nWhat is this thing? An antenna... I guess? And this is... a VCR? There sure are a lot of electronic gadgets here. But what is an antenna doing here...?\nComputer\nMaya:\nOh, hey. It's a computer. I've never really used one before. ... Um... I have no idea where the power switch on this thing is... Drat. There goes my plan to use this somehow to get out of here.\nTable\nMaya:\nThere's a framed picture sitting on this coffee table. It's a picture of a woman... She's kind of pretty. Hey, looks like something's written here... Let's see... I think it says, \"With love... Celeste\" I bet this could be a clue...\nSofa\nMaya:\n...That's weird. What's a figurine doing on a sofa in a place like this...? I think it's... a bear. Aww, how cute! But it's got a lot of cuts and slits on it... I wonder if it's some kind of puzzle or something...\nVideo tapes\nMaya:\nIt's so dark in here that I can barely see, but... these kinda feel like... video tapes... All of them... Just what kind of room is this...?\nDoor\nMaya:\nUnngh... Locked. Of course. And it doesn't look like I can use the card to open this door. There's a little hole at the bottom of the door. If only I was a little skinnier. Then maybe I'd be able to crawl through there...\nAfter examining satellite dish, table, sofa, and door:\n???:\nOh, this simply will not do... I cannot have you wandering around at will.\nMaya:\nEeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\n???:\n...It seems... that your Mr. Wright is truly concerned about you.\nMaya:\nHe is...?\n???:\nFor now, I would suggest you remain cooperative. If you cannot, there are ways in which I can help you...\nMaya:\nWays... You mean...\n???:\n\"Dead men tell no tales\" is how the saying goes, correct?\nMaya:\n\"D-D-D-D-Dead\"!?\n???:\nI'm almost certain I told you on our first meeting. I am... an assassin.\nMaya:\nN-No way... You're lying... I mean... An assassin...?\n???:\n...People are not always who they appear to be.\nMaya:\nNiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick!\nMarch 22, 7:04 PMHotti ClinicReception\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nHm? O-Oh yes, Pearls? (Got caught up in my thoughts about Maya's situation...)\nPearl:\nMr. Edgeworth has left, you know.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess for now, I have no choice but to believe in Mr. Engarde. But I think I should listen to his story one more time...) Alright! Let's get going, too.\nPearl:\nOK!\nMarch 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nJailer:\nI'm sorry, but visiting hours are over for today.\nPearl:\nAw...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... I have too many questions I need to ask...) I-I'm sorry, but I'm Phoenix Wright, a lawyer for one of the...\nJailer:\nYou're Mr. Wright, you say? Oh, yeah, there's a message here for you.\nPhoenix:\nA message...?\nJailer:\nIt's from Matt Engarde. ...Ah, here you are.\nPearl:\nWhat did he write!? Is it something really important...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know. Well, let's see what it has to say... \"To Mr. Lawyer dude, I've got something really important to tell you.\" (Changed from ['To the lawyer dude. I've got something really important to tell you.'] in the original release) (Why do I feel uneasy all of a sudden...?)\nEngarde:\n... ... Oh, Mr. Wright. So actually... I have a favor to ask of you. I have this cat named Shoe. I didn't put out a lot of food when I left the house, so he's probably pretty hungry. You think you could drop by my house and feed Shoe for me, dude? My house is just a little ways down from the hotel, alright?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nTh-This is terrible! Let's hurry! We have to feed his cat! I'm sure poor Shoe's stomach is growling by now!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I guess...\nMatt's Note jammed into a pocket.\nPhoenix:\n(A client's request is a request... Guess I should go check up on his cat.)\nHotel Lobby\nPresent\nLetter of Introduction\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... Maybe if I show her this letter I got from Edgeworth...\"\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Maybe if I show her this letter I got from Edgeworth...) Um... Ms. Oldbag... If you would look at...\nOldbag:\nWhat!? You want me to look at this worthless piece of... .................. ...Edgey-pooooo...\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... Is that her perfume, Ph\u00e9romone d'Amour, I smell...? *shudder*)\nOldbag:\nLet's see here... \"Would you please allow this unsophisticated young person to conduct his investigation? Yours truly, Miles Edgeworth\"\nPhoenix:\n\"Y-Yours truly\"!?\nOldbag:\nHmph, that man's good at flattery. Fine. But only because Edgey-poo said so, you understand!?\nLetter of Introduction given to Ms. Oldbag.\nOldbag:\nI just thought of something I have to do. Remember, no messing around! You do anything bad and I won't let you off the hook!\nPearl:\nIt looks like she has strong feelings for Mr. Edgeworth.\nPhoenix:\nThat may be, but you know nothing's going to come of it.\nPearl:\nThat's so mean, Mr. Nick! Feelings are meant to be told and shared!\nPhoenix:\nOwww... (Every time we talk about love, I always end up with a handprint on my face somehow.) Um, so anyway, let's continue our investigation.\nPearl:\nOK!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPhoenix:\nAck! What!? What now!?\nOldbag:\nOne little thing, before I forget. You can't go into Engarde's room today.\nPearl:\nWhy?\nOldbag:\nThe police's main investigation team is going to be in there all day, you hear?\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if they're the team in charge of investigating \"De Killer\"...?)\nOldbag:\nSo don't go in there! Set one foot in there and you'll face the wrath of Wendy Oldbag!\nExamine\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but...\nPearl:\nBut that press conference...\nPhoenix:\nIt was really the victim, Juan Corrida, trying to disclose something about Mr. Engarde.\nPearl:\nBut they're both heroes... Why would they do something so un-heroic?\nPhoenix:\nThey may look like heroes on the outside, but on the inside, they're only human.\nPearl:\n...\nAfter clearing \"Maya's situation\" Talk option in Hotti Clinic - Reception, then visiting Detention Center:\nMarch 22Engarde MansionLiving Room\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, sure is dark...)\nPearl:\nI'll go turn on a light!\nPhoenix:\nWow... So this is what a star's house looks like. Must be nice to be rich.\nPearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Let's find Shoe, the kitty-cat! Shoooooe!\nShoe:\nMeow.\nPhoenix:\nSo I guess this is Shoe.\nPearl:\nAh, what a lovely cat. ...Hello, Shoe.\nShoe:\nMeow.\nPearl:\n...Tee hee.\nPhoenix:\n(The cat seems to like Pearls.)\n???:\nPardon me...\nPhoenix:\n!\n???:\nMay I help you with something, Mister...\nPhoenix:\nOh, uh, we're lawyers. Actually, I'm Mr. Engarde's lawyer.\n???:\nThe master's... Then, you must be Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes.\n???:\nAh, it's a pleasure to meet your wonderful self.\nDoe:\nI am the family butler, John Doe.\nPhoenix:\nNice to meet you.\nShoe:\nMeow.\nExamine\nFireplace\nPearl:\nOh! There's a giant cooking hearth here.\nPhoenix:\nThat's actually a fireplace.\nPearl:\nHow are they different, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n... (You know, I've never actually seen a hearth before, come to think of it...)\nPearl:\nYou should come and visit Fey Manor, then. I'll show you one when you do.\nMotorcycle\nPearl:\nA... A giant bicycle is flying through the air!\nPhoenix:\n... That bicycle, Pearls, is one where you don't have to pedal, and it moves on its own.\nPearl:\nReally!? Wow!\nPhoenix:\nBut sorry to disappoint you, it can't fly.\nPearl:\n...Oh. That's too bad.\nLounge set\nPhoenix:\nIt's a very comfortable and spacious lounge set. I wonder if famous stars drop by and sit around and have a good time. ...In any case, I don't really belong here, do I? ... Argh. What is with me and feeling inferior today...?\nPearl:\n?\nMasks\nPearl:\nAh! There are masks here!\nPhoenix:\nYeah. That one in the middle is the Steel Samurai. The ones next to that are the Pink Princess and the Evil Magistrate. They fought many battles against the backdrop of Neo Olde Tokyo.\nPearl:\nWow, you really know a lot about the Steel Samurai, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\n... (I don't know whether to laugh or cry that I know more about that show than a kid...)\nDoorway behind railing\nPhoenix:\nThere's another door over there.\nPearl:\nYou shouldn't go wandering off over there, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\n...Yes, Pearls. (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her to stop playing around...)\nDoor\nPearl:\nThere's a small door at the bottom of this bigger door, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nI bet it's for Mr. Engarde's cat to use.\nPearl:\nOh, you mean Shoe.\nPhoenix:\n(The door... It's locked tight. Well, I guess that's to keep nosey people like me from entering it.)\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nYou must know all sorts of things about Mr. Engarde, right?\nDoe:\nHonestly, sir...

It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master or his affairs.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... How typically \"butler-like\", as it were...)\nJohn Doe\nPhoenix:\nMr. Doe, how long have you served at this residence...?\nDoe:\nWell, sir, I would have to say... maybe about one year?\nPhoenix:\n...\nDoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd, uh, anything else?\nDoe:\nNo, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of himself and his affairs.\nPhoenix:\n(You know, I would've thought Mr. Engarde the kind to have a maid over a butler...) ([maid] in quotation marks in the original release)\nShoe\nPhoenix:\nThat's a very cute cat you've got here.\nDoe:\nIt is my duty to take care of him. The master rather fancies Shoe.\nPhoenix:\n...\nDoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd, uh, anything else?\nDoe:\nNo, not especially.

I don't believe my master is capable of such a foul deed as murder.\nPhoenix:\n...\nDoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd, uh, anything else?\nDoe:\nNo, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master or his affairs.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... How typically \"butler-like\", as it were...)\nAny evidence\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking a look at this.\nDoe:\nI'm afraid I cannot offer up anything special about it. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of evidence for a trial.\nPhoenix:\n(Polite yet snotty with a touch of rude. He's the stereotypical butler alright.)\nAny other profiles\nPhoenix:\nWould you happen to know who this person is...?\nDoe:\nNo, I would not. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master's acquaintances.\nPhoenix:\n(Then what in the world CAN I talk to you about!?)\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Being angry is bad!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nDoe:\n...Well, I'm afraid I must take my leave of you now.\nPhoenix:\nOh, we should probably get going ourselves.\nDoe:\nAh, so young and yet already so accomplished. A master of law...\nPhoenix:\nBut there is also a lot to be proud of in being a butler, in charge of the house and all.\nDoe:\nThank you for the compliment, sir. ...People are not always who they appear to be. ...Now if you'll excuse me.\nShoe:\nMeow.\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like we're the only ones here.\nPearl:\nAnd yet... the hotel seems so busy somehow...\nPhoenix:\n(Probably because the police team is scouring for clues about \"De Killer\"...)\nExamine\nFront table\nPearl:\nI want to eat a meal with Mystic Maya again...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, me too...\nPearl:\nWhenever I watch Mystic Maya eat like she does... It makes me happy about eating, and then I can eat a lot.\nPhoenix:\nWell, then... How about after we wrap up this case, we all go out for a huge twenty-course feast!\nPearl:\nOK! Let's work really hard, then!\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelHallway\nLotta:\nHey, City Boy!\nPhoenix:\nL-Lotta... You're still here...\nLotta:\nReckon course! An investigative photographer eats or starves on her ability to snap up the scoop, yeah!? And this hotel just has that \"aura of mystery\". Ya know, like something's always about to happen.\nPearl:\nBut... Do you have a camera?\nLotta:\nReckgiven! A photographer's gotta have cameras out the ear like corn to be a real pro, ya know!? So I'm hangin' around here... ... ... Speaking of cameras and feedin' the mouth, do ya have mine, ya bread-thief!?\nPhoenix:\n(Why can't you drop that \"thief\" thing already?)\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPearl:\nAww, how lovely! The teddy bear looks happy to be surrounded by so many beautiful flowers.\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls really seems to like teddy bears a lot.)\nPhoenix:\nAh... I wonder if... Lotta also...\nLotta:\nI didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Although, other than sunflowers and tulips, I have no idea what any of them are.\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? What's this flower called?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a sunflower... I think.\nPearl:\nThis flower over here is pretty too.\nPhoenix:\nThat's a tulip, I guess.\nPearl:\n...\nLotta:\nCallin' everythin' a sunflower or a tulip; don't reckon even little kids'll fall for that!\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\".\nPearl:\nThe old lady told us about this, didn't she? That we can't go in this room tonight.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if an investigation briefing is going on right now inside... Without Detective Gumshoe...)\nTalk\nNight of the murder\nPhoenix:\nI want to ask you about the night of the murder.\nLotta:\nWhat? Ya really gonna shell out the bucks for the info I got!?\nPhoenix:\nLotta, you were loitering in this hallway the night of the murder, were you not?\nLotta:\nWell, kinda... But...\nPhoenix:\n(Brace yourself, Phoenix. Here it comes...) (Changed from [Brace yourself, Wright. Here it comes...] in the original release)\nLotta:\nI didn't exactly hang around here the entire time, ya know. Followed a few stars around... got a few autographs, shook a few hands, had a soda-pop with a few of 'em too.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like she wasn't here the entire time that night...)\nPearl:\nThe security lady also wasn't in this hallway the whole time either.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess this means there's no one who can tell us who came and went that night...)\nScandal\nPhoenix:\nSo, about the note that was inside your camera case.\nLotta:\nOh, that ditty I wrote?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Can I believe what you've written?\nLotta:\nYa mean the stuff about Engarde shovin' his manager lady onto Corrida?\nPhoenix:\nYeah...\nLotta:\nAh, well, I reckon ya best not be believin' that.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nLotta:\nLook, I sorta wrote that on a whim, ya know? Writin' whatever came to mind.\nPearl:\n\"Whatever came to mind\"...?\nLotta:\nYeah, when ya get down to it, it's just a lotta random bull dooders.\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\n...\nLotta:\nHey, what's with ya!? Why ya starin' at me like my grandpa used to!?\nPhoenix:\nHmph.\nLotta:\nHey, and why do you look like you suddenly got older too!? Or am I just shrinkin' here!?\nPearl:\nUmm...\nCamera\nLotta:\nAh! My baby! My $1,600 baby! What's with that red-coated prosecutor anyhow!? The guy told me it was \"evidence\" and refused to give it back to me!\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's kind of how it is...\nLotta:\nHey, hey. Yer that red-coat's friend, ain't ya? So put in a few good words for me and git me back my camera.\nPhoenix:\nY-You want me to do what!?\nLotta:\nListen, nag the guy real good fer 'bout five hours and I guarantee he'll give it back.\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you do your own dirty work...?\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nUm, would you please take a look at this?\nLotta:\nNope. Sorry. No can do. Only thing I wanna see is a steamin' hand towel.\nPhoenix:\nUm, what? A steaming hand towel...?\nLotta:\nNeed one for my eyes. Today just ain't a good day for my eyes to be lookin' at stuff.\nPhoenix:\n(How convenient! Maybe I'll have to use that one next time you show me something!)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nLotta:\n... Well, I reckon it's time for me to get going. A tabloid photographer without a camera is just a \"tabloid\", huh.\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Yeah, I guess so.\nLotta:\nKeep yerself together out there, ya hear!? I'm comin' to see ya in court tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nO-OK, I'll see you then...\nLotta:\nAnd you too there, little 'un. Keep up the good work, OK?\nPearl:\nOK!\nLotta:\nDon't be picky about yer food, now.\nPearl:\nOK!\nLotta:\nAnd make sure ya do all yer homework, ya hear?\nPearl:\nOK!\nLotta:\nAnd if you happen to find yerself a camera, make sure ya bring it right to me, ya--\nPhoenix:\nWould you please just leave already!?\nExamine\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". (I wonder what EXACTLY happened in the room behind this door...? Even now, no one really has any idea...)\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\n???:\n... Ooongh... Oooonnngh... Ooongh... Oooonnngh...\nPearl:\nM-M-Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is that otherworldly, ghastly moaning...!?\n???:\n... Ooonnnn... Oooo... Nnnghff... Ghfff...\nPearl:\nI... I hate evil ghosts... Waaaaaaaaaaaaah...\nPhoenix:\nI don't think it's a ghost... Maybe it's a demon!?\n???:\nE-Excuse me!? Watch who you're calling a demon, brat!\nPearl:\nAaaah!\nPhoenix:\nZoinks! It's the alien!!\nOldbag:\nWho are you calling an alien!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPhoenix:\nOh, it's just you, Ms. Oldbag. What are you doing here?\nOldbag:\nWhat is wrong with young'uns today!? I came down here to pay my respects to my poor Juan, and you're disturbing me!\nExamine\nBedroom\nPearl:\nSo that's a bed...\nPhoenix:\nYup. It's big, but it's a bed.\nPearl:\nAaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft!\nPhoenix:\n(How easily children are entertained.)\nFloor near guitar case\nPhoenix:\nBottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.\nPearl:\nThese glass shards...\nPhoenix:\nThey're probably from the glass vase Ms. Andrews knocked over.\nGuitar case\nPearl:\nSo, the Nickel Samurai's costume was in here?\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPearl:\nI can't believe Mr. Corrida went so far, just to say bad things about Mr. Engarde...\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, it was a \"press conference\", so he had to go in costume.\nPearl:\nBut weren't Mr. Engarde and Mr. Corrida friends?\nPhoenix:\nThey weren't friends. They couldn't be friends because they were rivals.\nPearl:\nSo, a \"rival\" is someone who is a \"strong enemy\"!?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is really fired up over this... And I don't have an answer for her.)\nWine glass\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nTalk\nNight of the murder\nPhoenix:\nPlease talk to me about the night of the murder just one more time.\nOldbag:\nI talked about it plenty at the trial! I was fooled, tricked... DECEIVED by that fraud of a photographer and her note! She was loitering around here with that imbecilic look on her face!\nPearl:\n\"With that imbecilic look on her face\"... OK, got it.\nOldbag:\nN-Now hold on a second there you little pipsqueak! If you're going to take notes, at least make me sound better than that!\nPearl:\nOh, alright.\nPhoenix:\n(Now I've seen everything...)\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I was working that night too, doing my job, minding my own business. So it's not like I had time to waste standing around here the whole night.\nMemories of Corrida\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about Mr. Corrida.\nOldbag:\nHe was the most popular star, you know... Especially where it counts -- in my book!\nPhoenix:\nBut I heard that he was lagging behind in the polls against Mr. Engarde...\nOldbag:\nUm, w-well, that's just a recent thing. Bad luck and all that, you know. But! He was going to become an even bigger star than he used to be! Look! Just look at this mountain of presents! It's a show of the mountain of feelings all his fans had for him!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, the mountain is pretty big, and certainly nothing to shake a stick at.\nPearl:\n...Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nHm? What is it, Pearls?\nPearl:\nThe presents. They're all bears... right?\nPhoenix:\n(She's got a point... There isn't a single thing here that isn't a bear...)\nPresents (appears after \"Memories of Corrida\")\nPhoenix:\nAll of Mr. Corrida's presents from his fans seem to be... bears...\nOldbag:\nOh, that's because you can't think of Juan without thinking about bears!\nPearl:\nBears...? Why bears?\nOldbag:\nYou don't know!? When my dear Juan was training, he fought barehanded with a bear. He refused to give in and let the bear win, but after the fight, they became friends.\nPearl:\nWow... What a heartwarming story.\nOldbag:\nLook, it's just like in those young people's dramas. I can see those two tuckered out, down by a river going, \"Heh... You... You sure can fight...\" \"You too, bub. You too.\"\nPhoenix:\nD-Did all that really happen?\nOldbag:\nIt's in his biography, bub.\nPhoenix:\n(What a load of crock!)\nOldbag:\nSo ever since then, fans have been giving him bears as presents.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Nice... Bears...\nAfter clearing all Talk options and visiting Living Room:\n*GROOOOOOOOOOWL!* I'm Uncle Bear, and I say it's \"bearly\" 8 o'clock!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What is that infernal racket!?\nOldbag:\nIt's one of the presents going off. Sounds like it's already 8 PM. Way past your bedtime!\nPhoenix:\nUrk... That startled me! I thought I was going to die for a second...\nPearl:\nEight PM... That's the time when the award ceremony ended that night, remember?\nPhoenix:\n(Time sure flies... Hard to believe it's been two days since the ceremony...)\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\n(The transceiver!)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nHello!? Hello!?\n???:\n...This is not a phone.\nPhoenix:\nMaya! How is Maya!? You haven't hurt her, have you!?\n???:\n...It seems you were not able to fulfill your end of the bargain, Mr. Attorney.

So it would seem my present did you no good...\nPearl:\nN-Noooo! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaa!\nPhoenix:\nOne more day! Please! All I ask is for one more day! I... I'll get a not guilty verdict for sure this time! Please...\n???:\n... I suppose if I must. I need that acquittal more than anything else, after all.\nPhoenix:\n...Please... Please let Maya say something! I want to hear she's alright!\n???:\nAlright... hissssss... then... hisssssss... ssssssssss... ssss... a little... sssssss...\nPhoenix:\n(What is with this static all of a sudden...!) Hello!? Hello!?\n???:\nIt seems... ssssss... hisss... sssss... bad... sssssss... hisssssssssss... ssssssssss... connect...sssssssssssss...\nPhoenix:\n(Dammit! Did the transceiver just suddenly break...!?)\n???:\nssssssssss... 'll excuse me... hisssssssssssssssss...\n...*beep*...\nPearl:\nWh-What happened...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know. All of a sudden, it became nothing but static.\nPearl:\nAaaah... Mystic Maya! Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\n(Why did the transceiver suddenly break like that...? I should probably have an electronics expert look at it... The sooner the better!)\nMarch 22Wright & Co. Law Offices\nGumshoe:\nHey! Welcome back, pal!

(Changed from [It's a rich-man's luxurious full course meal... out of a can, that is...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry you went through all the trouble to cook, but I don't have the time to eat.\nGumshoe:\nOops... Looks like you don't have a can opener, pal. (Changed from [Oh, hey... You don't have a can opener here, pal.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(You've got to be kidding... And here I thought he had already whipped something up.)\nGumshoe:\nOh, I know! There is one way I know how to be helpful! Ask me about anything you want, pal!

So what is \"electromagnetic interference\"...?\"\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Corrida's Hotel Room)\nGumshoe:\nThe transceiver...?\nPearl:\nOh, Mr. Nick! You should ask Mr. Scruffy Detective about that thing.\nGumshoe:\nWhat thing?\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah! This thing just up and broke all of a sudden!\nGumshoe:\nIt... It broke, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWhen I was talking to the kidnapper, it just suddenly broke into static... Look, it sounded like this.\n...*beep*...\nGumshoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nI don't hear any static, pal.\nPhoenix:\nH-Huh??\nPearl:\nMaybe it fixed itself?\nPhoenix:\nThat's strange... I'm sure it was making a loud static noise.\nGumshoe:\nHmm... Maybe...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe what?\nGumshoe:\nMaybe it was \"electromagnetic interference\", pal.\nPhoenix:\n\"Electromagnetic interference\"?\nPicture Card\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah! Do you know about this card?\nGumshoe:\nCard?\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth, for some reason, went pale the instant he saw this card.\nGumshoe:\nHey, I know what this is, pal!\nPhoenix:\nYou do?\nGumshoe:\nNo matter what way you look at it, I'd say it's a picture of a shell.\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm, that's it?\nGumshoe:\nOh yeah! That's right! Mr. Edgeworth really likes those cooked snail things. Um, what are they called again...? \"Escargot\" or something like that...?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I think we just solved the mystery of why Mr. Edgeworth's face turned pale, right!?\nPhoenix:\n(As I suspected, Gumshoe has no clue...)\nPhoenix:\nUm... So what is \"electromagnetic interference\"...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's something that happens when a radio wave gets mixed up with another signal, pal.\nPhoenix:\nOh, when you put it that way...\nPearl:\nI don't understand what you're talking about...\nGumshoe:\nLike for example, when a cell phone goes off next to a computer screen, the stuff on the screen gets kinda fuzzy and starts acting funny, right?\nPearl:\nHuh? ...\"Kom-pu-ter\"?\nGumshoe:\n... Um, it's like when you use the dryer next to the TV, and the screen starts looking weird.\nPearl:\nO-Oh, yes, the TV does do that! Hmm... Oh, so that's what you're talking about!\nPhoenix:\n(She seems amazingly happy at being able to understand this...)\nGumshoe:\nSo the room you were in when that interference to the transceiver happened... There's gotta be something there that's sending out very strong radio waves, pal! Something like... Hmm... Like a listening device or something.\nPhoenix:\nAh!\nGumshoe:\nHey, speaking of that! Where were you when it happened?\nPearl:\nWe were in Mr. Corrida's room... The scene of the murder!\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? That's it! I'm going to sneak into the precinct and get a bug sweeper! I'll meet you at the crime scene later, alright pal!?\nPhoenix:\nAh, wait! Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nOh yeah, baby! It's investigating time! I'm on fire, pal! My fingers are itching to go! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah!\nPearl:\nWe should be going too, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nAlright, let's go!\nExamine\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk.

You're finally here, pal!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry to keep you waiting.\nPearl:\nDo you have the... um... \"bug sweeper\"?\nGumshoe:\nUm, well, you see... I got busted trying to sneak in, pal. Then suddenly, I'm staring at the precinct doors. ...From the outside, I mean. So yeah... I couldn't get one of the police bug sweepers...\nPhoenix:\n... What do you mean you couldn't get it!? We need that item!\nGumshoe:\nHey, hey, calm down, pal. I didn't say I didn't get one, just not the police's.\nPearl:\nWow... So this is a \"bug sweeper\"...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks a little... broken.\nGumshoe:\nHey, this was made when I was in elementary school, pal.\nPhoenix:\nOh? By who?\nGumshoe:\nMe, of course! Ah, seeing this sure brings back memories...\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nHey, don't look down on it, pal! Sure, it looks a little beat up... (Changed from [Hey, don't look down on it, pal! Sure, it looks a little run down...] in the original release) But I put my heart and soul into building this puppy here!\nPearl:\nYour heart and soul...?\nGumshoe:\nIt'll work! Trust me, pal, it'll do the job! But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nBut you can't set the sensitivity... So it's going to beep at anything that gives off electromagnetic waves.\nPearl:\nBut isn't it better that way?\nGumshoe:\nOh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho! Well, anyway, since I brought it all this way, might as well give it a whirl, right pal?\nPhoenix:\n(I'm getting that sinking feeling again...)\nGumshoe:\nOK, now I'll tell you how to use this baby! There's a listening device or some other sort of bug hidden in this room, pal.\nPearl:\nSo we're going to find it, right?\nGumshoe:\nRight. Now, first, let's turn the sweeper on. Next, move the sweeper around to give the room a real thorough lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the sweeper and take a real good look around the room with it, pal.] in the original release) The sweeper'll let you know how strong of a signal it's picking up, so keep an eye on it, OK? (Changed from [You can see how strong the radio waves are in an area by looking at the CHECK gauge.] in the original release) Once you find something that's giving off a lot of radio waves...

(Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the thing a long hard stare.] in the original release) There's a lot of things here that's going to give off radio waves, so let's take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Alright! I'm going to go stand outside and keep an eye out. Give me a yell if you find the bug. Got it, pal!?\nBug sweeper\nCalculator\nPhoenix:\nIt's a plain old calculator.\nPearl:\nIt says \"50\" on it. Maybe he was calculating his allowance?\nPhoenix:\n(A whole 50 cents?? Um, maybe if he was a spirit medium...)\nDryer\nPhoenix:\nAnd here we have a dryer... Nothing unusual here, I think.\nPearl:\nA dryer...? Oh! if you use it next to a TV, it'll make the screen look all weird right?\nPhoenix:\n...Y-Yeah.\nPearl:\nAnd when that happens, it's called \"electromagnetic interference\", right!?\nPhoenix:\nHey, good memory Pearls!\nPearl:\nI will never forget it for the rest of my life!\nClock bear\nPhoenix:\nWell, it certainly looks like an alarm clock.\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong? Why do you look troubled?\nPhoenix:\nI just can't imagine the listening device being inside this alarm clock. It just, um, sort of reminded me of something that happened a long time ago...\nPearl:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\nWell, anyway, it looks like the listening device isn't in here.\nBox next to clock bear\nPearl:\nWow, there's a really delicious loaf of bread in here!\nPhoenix:\nLooks like it's been on \"keep warm\" all this time since the murder.\nPearl:\nWell, Mr. Scruffy Detective always says, \"Got to keep the trail and crime scene warm.\"\nPhoenix:\n(I think the \"keep warm\" in that case is a little more metaphorical...)\nVideo camera\nPearl:\nWhat's this?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a small video camera. ...No listening device in this gizmo.\nPearl:\nEveryone's trying to make everything smaller and smaller lately, aren't they Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what it seems like.\nPearl:\nBut! I want to grow bigger and bigger!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, eating only vegetables isn't going to help you there. You have to eat meat too...)\nRemote control\nPhoenix:\nIt's the TV's remote control. But it doesn't look like the listening device is in here.\nPearl:\nUm, so I was thinking... I wonder if a TV remote works on other things... Like... Could I make you change your expressions like TV channels? Zap!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey! (Hmm, but if I could... Ooh, the people I would give the ol' mute button to!) Well, I don't think it's going to work on me... Why don't we try it on Maya tomorrow, OK?\nPearl:\n... OK!\nLaptop\nPhoenix:\nThere's no listening device in that notebook computer, huh.\nPearl:\nUmm... What's a \"notebook computer\"...?\nPhoenix:\n... Do you know what a \"notebook\" is?\nPearl:\nYes! It's a small book with paper that you can write on! ...So?\nPhoenix:\nWell, that thing is like a notebook in a way. It's basically a small laptop.\nPearl:\nUmm... Mr. Nick... What's a \"laptop\"...?\nRefrigerator\nPearl:\nThis is a... a refrigerator, right?\nPhoenix:\nI really don't think the listening device is in something like this.\nPearl:\nBecause it's filled with nothing but healty vegetable juices, right!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah, sure. (What does that have to do with listening devices?)\nCoffee pot\nPearl:\nWhat's this? It sort of looks like a hot water pot, but...\nPhoenix:\nOh, well, it's kind of like a hot water pot, I guess. But instead of hot water, coffee comes out.\nPearl:\nReally!? Th-This pot can do that!? ... Um, is there a pot that orange juice comes out of...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't think there's anything like that, Pearls. Sorry.\nWater pot\nPearl:\nOh, the water in this hot water pot has run out! I'll go get more water for it!\nPhoenix:\nO-OK. Sounds good. (Looks like she's forgotten all about looking for the listening device...)\nLarge bear near coffee machine\nLeads to:\n\"This is... This is just a giant stuffed teddy bear, right?\"\nAir conditioner\nPhoenix:\nWell, the listening device isn't in the air conditioner.\nPearl:\nAah! Yuck! This air filter is covered in dust and dirt...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nPearl:\n... Come on, Mr. Nick! Let's wash it!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if being a neat freak makes even the tiniest dust bunny look colossal...?)\nPearl:\n...What?\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh, nothing.\nTV\nPhoenix:\nI don't really think the listening device is in the TV of all places.\nPearl:\nLooks like the TV was left on, and it's now showing an old samurai movie.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. This channel plays all sorts of international movies, as well as domestic ones.\nPearl:\nYou know, every time I watch one of these old movies, I always think, \"Wow, these Japanese stars are really good at English!\"\nPhoenix:\n...Um, yeah.\nPearl:\nWhen I grow up, I want to study Japanese!\nPhoenix:\n(I should probably keep my mouth shut here, and not destroy her dream...)\nLamps\nPhoenix:\nLamp, check. Listening device... nope.\nPearl:\nThere are a lot of lamps in this room, aren't there Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPearl:\nAnd they're all on. You shouldn't do that, Mr. Nick. Don't you know that's wasteful?\nPhoenix:\n...Ah, yeah... I'll be more conscientious from now on. Sorry.\nCell phone\nPhoenix:\nA cell phone... Nope, no bugs in here.\nPearl:\nA \"cell phone\"...?\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!? Don't tell me you don't know what a cell phone is!\nPearl:\n...I'm sorry. I've never seen one before...\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, my cell phone couldn't get any reception while I was staying in Kurain Village... And Pearls has never lived outside of that village, so... Well, I guess I can't say it's impossible to live without one...)\nLandline phone\nPhoenix:\nWell, the phone is the most common place for a \"listening device\", I'd say. But, let's take the receiver apart first before we get ahead of ourselves here.\nPearl:\nWow, you know a lot about electronics, don't you Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know tons. Especially when it comes to taking them apart. It's my specialty. (I'll leave the fixing part up to Gumshoe...)\nPearl:\nSo...? Is there a \"listening device\" in there?\nPhoenix:\n...No. (And I really thought it had to be in the phone too...)\nBear between the two sofas\nPearl:\nAh, what a lovely bear...\n*GROOOOOOOOOOOOWL!*\nPearl:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!\nPhoenix:\nAh, this must be one of those fancy bear-shaped toy robots.\nPearl:\nI-It's a robot!? It's a REAL robot!?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, it's a real one.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nPearl:\nH-How many horse-powers is it? How many horsies!?\nPhoenix:\nHorsies...? ...\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well, look, it's a bear, so... uh...\nPearl:\nUm...\nRadio\nPearl:\nThe radio is on and playing something. Oh! It's \"Kids' Question Corner\"!\n\"Professor! Professor! Why is the Earth round?\"\nPearl:\n... Yes, why is it, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n... Why don't you listen to the radio program a little more, Pearls?\nPearl:\nThis is... This is just a giant stuffed teddy bear, right? It's the biggest one I have ever seen!\nGumshoe:\nHey! So did you guys find it yet? The listening device, I mean...\nPearl:\nNo, not yet. But this bear's eye is...\nGumshoe:\nLet's see, let's see... A perfectly normal stuffed bear with some really strong radio waves... Sounds like you found the device to me, pal. Let's dig this big fella's eye out and see what we've got.\nPearl:\nN-No! You can't! Such... Such a violent act...\nGumshoe:\nOomph! *rip!*\nPearl:\nNoooooooooo!\nGumshoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's!\nGumshoe:\nIt's a miniature camera... And it looks like there's more. There's a... transmitter, and a timer.\nPhoenix:\nA whattawhatta-mitter?\nGumshoe:\nA transmitter, pal.\nPearl:\nOh... Is this more of that \"high tech\" stuff...?\nTalk\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nSo this tiny thing is a camera...?\nGumshoe:\nYup. It's a pinhole CCD camera, pal. It's a small, high-grade video camera mostly used in security systems.\nPhoenix:\nSo it's a video camera...\nGumshoe:\nIt runs on a battery, which comes with it in a set.\nPhoenix:\nBut... there's no video tape in this camera...\nGumshoe:\nThis is only the camera part here, pal. The tape recorder with the tape inside it is somewhere else.\nPearl:\nSomewhere else?\nGumshoe:\nThe footage is changed into radio waves and then it's sent to that recorder.\nPearl:\nSo... It's sort of like a TV broadcast, isn't it?\nGumshoe:\nHey, you know, you're right!\nSpy Camera added to the Court Record.\nCamera (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo this tiny thing is a camera...?\nGumshoe:\nYup.

It's like a video version of a listening device, pal.\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's attached to a small, clock-like thing...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that's a timer, pal. You can set it to turn the camera on and record at a certain time with it.\nPearl:\nYou can set it for a certain time...?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Let's see... This looks like it was set to start at 8 PM and go for one hour.\nPhoenix:\nEight PM? (That was the time the award ceremony ended!)\nGumshoe:\nThere's no date set, so it's been recording every night, I'd guess.\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Detective! How long has this bear been here...?\nGumshoe:\nUm, I'm pretty sure it's been here since the night of the murder.\nPearl:\nThen... Then maybe...\nGumshoe:\nMaybe this camera caught the murder on tape!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nGumshoe:\nAnd if you think about the angle the bear is at... It's bound to have had a clear shot of the whole crime, pal!\nTransmitter added to the Court Record.\nTransmitter (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo... what is a \"transmitter\"?\nGumshoe:\nIt's a device that sends footage the camera took to a specific destination.

It's pretty big, so it stands out pretty well in my mind.\nPhoenix:\nBut... who gave Mr. Corrida this present?\nGumshoe:\nI, ah, don't know, pal. But! This means that someone out there's got a video of what happened here that night!\nPearl:\nIsn't there any way we can find out who that person is?\nGumshoe:\nIt's impossible, pal. Radio waves can be sent almost anywhere, so there's no real way to find out...\nPearl:\nOh... *sniffle*\nPhoenix:\n(Is there really no way to find out...?)\nStuffed Bear added to the Court Record.\nStuffed bear (subsequent times)\nPearl:\nSo there was a camera... in this bear's eye...\nPhoenix:\nAnd it was disguised as a present.\nGumshoe:\nAnd I'm sure it was here on the night of the murder, pal.

Ho ho ho ho! Oh, that's great. But you know, no matter how strange I may seem, at least my jokes don't make you cringe. Right, pal?\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... Yeah, you keep on thinking that...)\nSpy Camera\nPearl:\nIt's a really tiiiiny camera.\nGumshoe:\nA camera this size lasts about 3 hours with a fresh battery pack, pal.\nPhoenix:\nBut what would something like this be doing in...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'd say taking a secret video of the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(Which means... Someone knew there was going to be a murder here!)\nTransmitter\nGumshoe:\nThis device looks like it was made by the criminal themselves. If it's only sending images, then I'd say it'd last about 80 hours, pal.\nPearl:\nYou know a lot about these things, don't you Mr. Detective? Is spying on people a hobby of yours...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, no... I mean... You're making me embarrassed, putting me on the spot like this.\nPhoenix:\n(Why should he be embarrassed? Is there something I'm not getting here...?)\nStuffed Bear\nPearl:\nThe bear is really lovely, isn't it? It's so soft and fuzzy, and the face is really well-made...\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess when you compare it to all the other presents, it is well-made.)\nGumshoe:\nYeah, but I don't think the bear itself is a clue to this case at all.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nGumshoe:\n... ...I got it!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal. Let me borrow this mini camera for a bit!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you going to do?\nGumshoe:\nI'm going to go around to the electronic shops and see if I can find out who bought this!\nPhoenix:\nB-But that's impossible! I mean, it's already 9 PM!\nGumshoe:\nLeave it to me! Even if I have to search all night, I'll find your man, pal!\nSpy Camera and Transmitter given to Detective Gumshoe.\nGumshoe:\nOh yeah, baby! It's investigating time! I'm on fire, pal! My fingers are itching to go! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah!\nPearl:\n...He's gone.\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah.\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Scruffy Detective sure is a nice man. He's pushing himself so hard, all for Mystic Maya's sake...\n???:\nIt's a mystery how you always manage to do things in the most inefficient ways, Wright. (Changed from [...You always manage to do things in the most ineffective ways.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Ack!)\nEdgeworth:\nYou'll have to excuse me. I heard your conversation just now.\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth! What are you doing here!?\nEdgeworth:\nA rescue team has been created and deployed. I can't say I'm optimistic... but we have to move forward, one step at a time.\nPhoenix:\nI-I see... Thanks.\nEdgeworth:\nDon't thank me yet. We still have to find her.\nPearl:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... So, there was a spy camera hidden inside this stuffed animal, huh? You are one lucky man, Wright.\nPhoenix:\n?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know this stuffed bear, little girl?\nPearl:\nUm... I have no idea!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... Of course not. The maker of this bear is a very expensive, luxury brand from overseas. It's completely hand-made, and only a small number of these are exported here. (Changed from [It's completely hand-made and there are very few that are exported here.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nWh-What?\nEdgeworth:\nThe camera and transmitter that scatterbrained detective took with him are dead ends. Things like those can be bought anywhere... However, this bear is different. By tracking how it got into this country, this bear can tell us who the buyer is.\nPearl:\nC-Can you really do that!? Mr. Nick, can he really?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, I guess so...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... It's 9 PM. I think I can still make it in time.\nPhoenix:\n?\nEdgeworth:\nI'll be taking this for now. I'm sure you have other things you have to do.\nStuffed Bear snatched up by Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nSee you soon, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you doing this...?\nEdgeworth:\n... I have no interest in explaining myself to someone who cannot comprehend. But besides that, Wright. Until court reconvenes tomorrow, you should concern yourself with this question: \"Who was the person that murdered Juan Corrida?\"\nPhoenix:\nThe \"real killer\"...\nEdgeworth:\nDo you really still think it was Adrian Andrews?\nPhoenix:\nTo be honest... I don't know anymore.\nEdgeworth:\n... You still have a little time left... Find the truth, Wright. Everything begins with the truth.\nPhoenix:\n(Juan Corrida's real killer... Ms. Andrews' past... The kidnapper whose sole condition is an acquittal for Mr. Engarde... And... this card. Shelly de Killer...) ...Maya. The only way I can save you now, is to find all the answers to this case tonight! I don't understand what your real intentions are, Edgeworth... but as you said, all I can do for now is find the truth!\nTo be continued.\nMarch 22, 9:14 PMGatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nIt's past 9:00 PM already, isn't it? I wonder... I wonder if Mr. Edgeworth has already found Mystic Maya...?\nPhoenix:\n(These things take time. I'd say probably not...) The police are professionals, Pearls. They'll find her, so don't you worry. And if we can win a not guilty verdict tomorrow... then everything will be OK.\nPearl:\nY-You're right... ...\nTalk\nThe real killer\nPhoenix:\nSo the real person who killed Mr. Corrida was...\nPearl:\nThat assassin... Mr. Shelly de Killer, right?\nPhoenix:\nAnd the card Ms. Andrews found at the crime scene seems to be proof of that. But if that's the case, then a new question comes to mind. Who was the one that hired De Killer to begin with? Who is his client?\nPearl:\nYou mean... Who asked for the murder...?\nPhoenix:\nThat person didn't want to dirty their own hands in blood, but whoever this client is, they're still a killer.\nPearl:\n...\nThe assassin's client\nPearl:\nWho... Who could have hired the assassin? Do you think it was Ms. Andrews...?\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder... But if she was the client... then why go through the effort to stab the knife into the corpse herself...?)\nPearl:\nBut if Ms. Andrews wasn't the client... Then... No, it can't be...\nPhoenix:\n(...Matt Engarde himself...?)\nWas it Matt? (appears after \"The real killer\" and \"The assassin's client\")\nPearl:\nIf Mr. Engarde really did hire the assassin...\nPhoenix:\nThen he is not innocent at all. Far from it, he would be guilty of the crime.\nPearl:\nB-But it can't be Mr. Engarde, right!? I mean, when we first talked with him...\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Did you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?\nEngarde:\n... Alright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't see any Psyche-Locks at that time... Actually... That reminds me...)\nPearl:\nDid you remember something, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, something Ms. Andrews said at the trial today. She said something interesting.\nSomething interesting (appears after \"Was it Matt?\")\nPearl:\nUm... So what is this \"interesting thing\"?\nPhoenix:\nOh, that's right. You didn't hear it, did you Pearls?\nAndrews:\nJuan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway.\nAndrews:\nIt looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde's \"secret\"...!? Wh-What is this secret...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know yet. But for now, let's think about it this way. Mr. Corrida was going to reveal this \"secret\". That means... Mr. Engarde had plenty of motive to have Mr. Corrida silenced. ... (Which means we have to meet with Mr. Engarde. There's no way around it now.)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPearl:\nI... I believe in your lawyer powers, Mr. Nick. I know you can bring us a miracle.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm guessing by \"miracle\", she means a not guilty verdict... And she wouldn't be wrong either. It will take a miracle to pull this one off.)\nRadio Transceiver\nPearl:\nWhy... Why did the kidnapper have to take Mystic Maya...? Why couldn't he have taken me instead!?\nPhoenix:\nStop it, Pearls! Don't say things like that! If that had happened, then Maya would be hurting, I'm sure of it. Just like how you are hurting now, Pearls.\nPearl:\nY-You're right...\nMaya Fey profile\nPearl:\nOne more day...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... If we can bring the trial to its end, she'll be back. Don't worry.\nPearl:\nI decided I won't cry anymore, Mr. Nick. You're so brave and holding strong for Mystic Maya, so I have to do the same.\nPearl Fey profile\nPearl:\nIf only I had studied harder during my training... I could be a bigger help to you, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nAh, don't worry about it. Really. Pearls, you're doing a great job...\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Is there a waterfall around here!? I feel that I must be made new under the rushing spring waters!\nPhoenix:\nSorry, Pearls... The only body of water around here is a lake.\nPearl:\nOh... Thanks anyway...\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPearl:\nThis is the first time I've ever met someone who loves to eat instant noodles.\nPhoenix:\n(Something tells me Gumshoe isn't eating them because he genuinely likes them, but...)\nPearl:\nHe's working so hard, all for Mystic Maya's sake... I'm going to get him lots and lots of instant noodles as a thank your present!\nJuan Corrida profile\nPearl:\nUm... Is it really that important to be the Master of all the Stars? So important that you try to find your friends' weaknesses, and then expose them...?\nPhoenix:\nI... I wouldn't know...\nMatt Engarde profile\nPearl:\nI-Is it really alright for us to trust him? This person... Mr. Engarde...?\nPhoenix:\n... (I-I don't know... I can't even answer that for myself. We have to go see him one more time! That's the only way to know for sure!)\nSecurity Lady profile\nPearl:\nUm... I was wondering if that old lady is really a person from Earth. I mean, maybe she's really from waaaaaay out in outer space...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, actually, I was thinking the same exact thing. She's too strange to be from Earth.\nAdrian Andrews profile\nPearl:\nWhy did Ms. Andrews... Why did she frame Mr. Engarde, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(She has some sort of grudge against Mr. Engarde... But why is that? That's something we still have to figure out...) Let's go ask her, OK?\nCeleste Inpax profile\nPearl:\nThis person was Ms. Andrews' mentor... And she... killed herself, right?\nPhoenix:\n(Right. And Mr. Corrida hid Ms. Inpax's suicide note... So to get it back, Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... But the thing is, where is that suicide note now?)\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelHallway\nPearl:\nWow, it's really getting late, isn't it Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. It's past 9:00 PM already. But we still have some things to prepare for tomorrow's trial. (There's still the matter of this \"secret\" Mr. Corrida held about Mr. Engarde... And Ms. Andrews' real intentions. These are two things I must know tonight!)\nPearl:\nBut aren't visiting hours over at the detention center?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I'm sure we'll think of something, Pearls. Don't you worry.\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nOldbag:\n...\nPhoenix:\nHey! Wait!\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, whippersnapper!? All I know is nothing that has anything to do with you is ever good! Like just now. I was handed this strange device for who knows what reason. And I was told to use it to search the whole hotel.\nPhoenix:\nThat's... the bug sweeper, isn't it? (The one Gumshoe made...)\nOldbag:\nI don't know and frankly, I don't care. But the request came from Edgey-poo, so...\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth...?\nOldbag:\nAnd he said,\nEdgeworth:\n\"If you feel angry, direct your anger at that unsophisticated lawyer.\"\nOldbag:\nSo, I'm going to feel free to direct all my anger towards you!\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... Gee, thanks a bundle, Edgeworth! What a pal you are!)\nExamine\nTables at back\nPhoenix:\nThey haven't cleaned up all the food yet.\nOldbag:\nDon't you touch it without permission! I brought a lunch box today, so I could pack it.\nPearl:\nUm... But... Hasn't the food been out for two days already?\nOldbag:\nWhen it's in your stomach, it's all the same!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, the digestive powers of an alien are wondrous...)\nFront table\nPearl:\nI want to eat a meal with Mystic Maya again...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, me too...\nPearl:\nWhenever I watch Mystic Maya eat like she does... It makes me happy about eating, and then I can eat a lot.\nPhoenix:\nWell, then... How about after we wrap up this case, we all go out for a huge twenty-course feast!\nOldbag:\nMy mind's like a steel trap, so I'm going to hold you to that!\nPhoenix:\n(I was NOT talking to you!)\nTalk\nBug sweeper\nOldbag:\nThis is absolutely top secret, so you had better keep it to yourselves! I heard they found a spy camera hidden in one of the presents!\nPhoenix:\nHmm, very interesting.\nOldbag:\nI'm sure it was... you know... It was to catch poor Juan in the middle of a scandalous \"meeting\"!\nPearl:\n\"Scandalous\"...? What's that?\nOldbag:\nIt means... Well, you know, that gossip that's been going around about my dear Juan.\nPhoenix:\nOh... You mean that thing about Ms. Andrews. (But I'm sure she must've had some reason for getting close to Mr. Corrida...)\nOldbag:\nI'll let you in on another secret, young'un. I know who planted that spy camera! It was that obnoxious, puffy-haired photographer girl! The nerve of some people! Spying on people by herself! As if I wouldn't want to see it for myself too!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow! The alien actually admitted her true intentions for a change!)\nOldbag:\nI don't know what you're thinking exactly, but I can bet that it's nothing good!!\nPhoenix:\n(But I didn't say anything...)\nJuan and Adrian\nOldbag:\nSo you want to know about Juan and that manager, right? Actually, as I hear it, they were something of a refreshing pair, those two.\nPhoenix:\nOh?\nOldbag:\nI tell you, Juan really welcomed that manager with open arms, I heard.\nPearl:\nThat \"manager\"...? Who are you talking about?\nOldbag:\nYou don't know? That manager woman Juan had. It's a shame she killed herself, though...\nPhoenix:\nOh, you're talking about Ms. Celeste Inpax... Ms. Andrews' mentor, right?\nOldbag:\nYes, yes, that's the one! That Celeste girl. She was supposed to get married, you know.\nPhoenix:\nM-Married? You mean... to Mr. Corrida?\nOldbag:\n*sigh* Really, you young kids today don't know anything, do you? That girl Celeste killed herself three days after their marriage announcement!\nPhoenix:\n(Three days after their marriage announcement!? What in the...!?)\nCeleste's suicide (appears after \"Juan and Adrian\")\nPearl:\nWhy would Ms. Inpax want to kill herself!? She was going to get married!\nOldbag:\nWell, that's because... she was thrown away, you see, by Juan.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nPearl:\nB-But... They were going to get married, right? They promised each other, right?\nOldbag:\nThey held a grand announcement session... But... Three days later... Juan suddenly cancelled their marriage.\nPhoenix:\nI-Is that true?\nOldbag:\nIt was in the weekly magazines.\nPearl:\nB-But why!? Why did he do that!?\nOldbag:\nThat was not in the magazines, unfortunately.\nPhoenix:\n...I see.\nOldbag:\nThat night after Juan called off the wedding, that manager, Celeste, killed herself.\nPhoenix:\nHow terrible...\nPearl:\nI wonder what happened between those two...?\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPhoenix:\nOn that night, there must've been at least a few hundred people here. Hmm... I guess the police are done with their questioning and investigating. It looks like things here in the lobby have finally calmed down.\nExamine\nSecond floor\nPhoenix:\nA lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. When the murder happened, it was abuzz with people running back and forth... But now since things have quieted down, it actually feels more eerie than before.\nMarch 22Engarde MansionLiving Room\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like no one is around...\nPearl:\nUm, what happened to that person with the stuffed teddy face...?\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, she must mean that butler with the stitches in his face.)\nPearl:\nShoooooe!\nShoe:\nMeow.\nPearl:\nOh, there you are. I guess you're still awake, huh Shoe?\nShoe:\nMeow.\nPearl:\nHee hee, come on, let's play.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that butler, Mr. Doe, is already asleep or not...)\nMarch 22Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPearl:\nIt doesn't look like Mr. Scruffy Detective is here.\nPhoenix:\nWell, he's out there with that camera asking around at all the electronic stores.\nPearl:\nThen, I'll make some salad for him for dinner.\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like Pearls really appreciates what Gumshoe is doing for us...)\nPearl:\n...Um, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nHm? Yes?\nPearl:\nWhere is the lettuce?\nPhoenix:\n...I don't think I've ever bought lettuce before.\nPearl:\n... Aww, I guess I have to give up on making a salad, then.\nPhoenix:\n(Guess the lack of lettuce is kind of a problem.)\nExamine\nCharley the plant\nPearl:\nOh! I'll water it!\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK... Gumshoe already gave it more than plenty earlier...\nPearl:\n...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...)\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh, I'll wipe it some more and make it super shiny! ...The wiping cloth... Where are you, Mr. wiping cloth...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's fine. Really. If you wipe it any more, it'll be so shiny I'll be using it as a mirror.\nMarch 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nVisiting hours ended a few hours ago. Looks like we're not going to get a chance to talk with Mr. Engarde tonight...\nPearl:\nB-But... Isn't what we have to ask very important?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, but I don't think that matters to the guard...)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nVisiting hours ended hours ago, so what's the camera watching over now?\nPearl:\nMaybe it's watching the Mr. Policeman who's standing over there.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think that's it...)\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nVisiting hours ended hours ago, so what's he watching over now?\nPearl:\nMaybe he did something bad and he's standing there as punishment.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think that's it...)\nMarch 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nPearl:\nIt feels sort of tense in here, doesn't it Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it does. I wonder if something happened...?)\nChief:\nYou're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, right?\nPhoenix:\nAh, yes sir.\nChief:\nWell, we've finally found just the person we've been looking for. A real decisive witness.\nPhoenix:\nA \"decisive witness\"? You mean for Mr. Engarde's case?\nChief:\nWe're taking the witness's statement right now. Gotta hand it to Mr. Edgeworth.\nPhoenix:\n(What's Edgeworth up to now...?)\nPearl:\nWh-Who is this witness?\nChief:\nI think you know this person quite well, Mr. Lawyer.\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(Between the kidnapper's demand and now this... I can't see any way to win here!)\nChief:\nOh, yeah... Mr. Edgeworth wanted me to tell you something.\nPhoenix:\nHe did?\nChief:\nEven though visiting hours are long over at the detention center, he wanted me to grant you special permission, so there you go.\nPearl:\nWhat!? (Changed from [Eh!?] in the original release)\nChief:\nI've already called them so they know. Go on, go talk to your heart's content.\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much.\nPearl:\nThis is such good news, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Go talk to your heart's content\"? It sounds like the police are pretty sure they have tomorrow's trial in the bag.)\nExamine\nDetective on left\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.\nDetective:\n\"It seems as though my true face has been revealed... I was an elite businessman who made deals with the entire world! I was the young successor and CEO of a colossal corporate conglomeration! But my real self is that of a regular everyday policeman!\"\nPhoenix:\n... Stop doing image training, and get yourself out there in the field!!\nChief\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.\nChief:\nWhaaat!? \"The real killer in the Corrida murder is an assassin...\"!? This must be someone's idea of a joke. I can't believe this garbage!\nPhoenix:\n(Have a little more faith in your own subordinates!)\nBlue Badger\nChief:\nThis mascot here is the \"Blue Badger\". I made him, you know. I'm finally gonna show him off to the Chief of Police tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nWow, that's really something.\nChief:\nYou have no idea how much time and effort I invested into him to get this far... But my hopes for this little guy go far beyond just this precinct, yessiree. I'll get him deployed to every precinct in the nation. Just you wait.\nPearl:\nI wish you luck, sir.\nAfter clearing \"Something interesting\" Talk option in Gatewater Hotel - Corrida's Hotel Room, clearing \"Celeste's suicide\" Talk option in Gatewater Hotel - Hotel Lobby, and visiting Criminal Affairs Dept.:\nMarch 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure they must have transferred Ms. Andrews here by now... So that means that both Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews are in this detention center. Now then, whose story do I want to hear?)\nMatt Engarde\nEngarde:\nDude! It's Mr. Wright! I hope you can get me off the hook tomorrow. I'm counting on you!\nPhoenix:\nI... hope so too... (Edgeworth just dropped a bombshell on me by saying... (Changed from [Edgeworth just dropped a bombshell on me and said...] in the original release) that Juan Corrida was killed by an assassin, and that the assassin's client is... (Changed from [that Juan Corrida was killed by an assassin, and that assassin's client is...] in the original release) this man... Matt Engarde...)\nEngarde:\nWhat's wrong?\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. Engarde. There is something I must know with one hundred percent certainty.\nEngarde:\nHmm, you seem kinda different. You're totally not like your usual lawyer dude self.\nExamine\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitor's the visitor's room. He's sleeping standing up. The night's pretty long, and he probably got tired. Hmm... I hope he doesn't fall over...\nTalk\nMatt's secret\nPhoenix:\nUm, about the \"press conference\"...\nEngarde:\nYou mean the one where Juan was gonna dress up as the Nickel Samurai?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I heard a little more about it from Ms. Andrews.\nAndrews:\nIt looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nCould you please fill me in on what this \"secret\" is? Please?\n5 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(I knew this was coming...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick? D-Don't tell me...\nPhoenix:\n(Psyche-Locks...)

What is this \"secret\"!?\n5 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nEngarde:\nHmm... Well... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna consult my lawyer, OK?\nPhone:\n............\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nH-Hello? This is Phoenix Wright.\nEngarde:\nOh, hey Mr. Lawyer dude. Sorry, but you know dude, you totally don't have any idea. And I really didn't care at all about what Juan was up to, OK?\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nEngarde:\nSo, it's like that.\nPhoenix:\n... (Looks like I have no choice but to remove those Psyche-Locks...)\nJuan and Adrian\nPhoenix:\nDid you know about Mr. Corrida and Ms. Andrews' relationship...?\nEngarde:\nWell, it's all over the tabloids, dude. Ah, but I don't know any of the details, if that's what you mean. Look, how many times do I have to tell you? I don't care what Juan did with his life.\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews... She had a purpose in mind when she started seeing Mr. Corrida. Her mentor was Mr. Corrida's manager... and Ms. Andrews was going to get Ms. Celeste Inpax's suicide note from him.\nEngarde:\nCeleste...\nPhoenix:\nDoes that jog any memories...?\nEngarde:\n... Dude, I suddenly just got totally hungry. You up for a pizza? My treat.\nEngarde:\n... ...\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? What's a \"pea-za\"? Is it a kind of pea, like green peas?\nPhoenix:\nLet's go eat one later, OK?\nEngarde:\n...Argh, I got cut off by the pizza dude at the shop.\nPhoenix:\nThat's too bad...\nEngarde:\nWell, how about we get our minds off of this topic and talk about something else, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde... Are you connected to Ms. Inpax's suicide in some way...?)\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\nThat Juan... Posing as someone else and trying to hold a press conference...! And the person who set it all up was Adrian, wasn't it?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what I heard.\nEngarde:\nArgh... I can't believe... Why would she do such a thing, dude!?\nRadio Transceiver\nEngarde:\nThat's a very nice transceiver, dude. I'm kind of an expert in gadgety things...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does what he just said give me a sinking feeling?)\nPearl:\n?\nGuitar Case\nEngarde:\nHis signature item was a guitar. Hah! I mean, dude, what kind of ninja carries a guitar!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, I'm not someone who would know...\nEngarde:\nDude, it's such a kid thing to do. I mean, just my opinion and all.\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't your show a kid's show too?)\nCrime Photo\nEngarde:\nHe was a bit of a talentless hack when he was alive... But who knew he could play dead so well? Wouldn't you agree?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, that's because he really IS dead!\nEngarde:\nAnd quite pitifully indeed, yes?\nJammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo\nEngarde:\nThat Adrian... I never thought she'd go this far to frame me for the crime... I mean, what does she have against me? Dude, I don't get it.\nPhoenix:\nThat's something I would like to know too. Do you have any ideas at all? Even the slightest clue?\nEngarde:\nHuh!? What!? Me!? D-Don't be silly, Mr. Lawyer dude! How am I supposed to know something like that?\nSuicide Report or Celeste Inpax profile\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. Engarde?\nEngarde:\nDude, I know I asked you to be my lawyer and all... But I don't think I have to tell you anything and everything.\nPhoenix:\nUm... What do you mean by that?\nEngarde:\nIt just means I don't have to tell you anything and everything, dude.\nPearl:\n...\nAttempted Suicide Report\nPhoenix:\nUm, about this...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! You can't!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews said she doesn't want anyone to know about that, remember?\nEngarde:\nWhat's that?\nPhoenix:\nOh, this? Um... Nothing. It's nothing, really.\nPicture Card\nPhoenix:\n(... I'm kind of scared to show him this card...)\nEngarde:\nWhat's wrong, dude?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um... So about this picture card... Have you ever seen this before?\nEngarde:\n...? Nope, never saw it before in my life, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think he's lying... Or is he...? Then again, he looked like he gasped just now... Maybe I'm seeing things...?)\nEngarde:\n?\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nIt's true we debuted at the same time... so that's why people were always comparing us. But I totally didn't care what people were saying because he wasn't even close, dude. I mean, I won every contest we ever had, hands down!\nAdrian Andrews profile\nEngarde:\nI don't get it... Why would she want to frame me...? I mean, I've never done anything to her, dude...\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde sounds pretty sincere and he seems trustworthy... So I have to find out what Ms. Andrews' real intentions are!)\nJohn Doe profile\nPhoenix:\nAbout this person...\nEngarde:\n...H-He's...\nPearl:\nHe is your butler, Mr. Doe, right? We met him at your mansion.\nEngarde:\nOh... Yes, that's right. He's a pretty cool dude who can do lots of things. He takes real good care of me.\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nCould you please take a look at this...? I know it may not seem important to you...\nEngarde:\nWell, if it's not important, then I'd rather be in bed. If I don't get my 12 hours of beauty sleep, my skin's gonna wrinkle up like a prune, dude.\nPearl:\nYou know, he's right Mr. Nick. Your skin's kind of drying up here and there.\nPhoenix:\n(I swear... After this case is over, I'm going to get lots and lots of sleep...)\nAdrian Andrews\nAndrews:\n..Oh, it's you.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry to be visiting at such a late hour. But there are a few questions I absolutely have to ask you tonight.\nAndrews:\nMe? I thought your client was Matt.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure Ms. Andrews knows something... She can't be clueless about this \"secret\" Mr. Corrida had on Mr. Engarde...)\nAndrews:\n...\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nI'd like to ask you about Matt Engarde, if you don't mind...\nAndrews:\nMr. Wright... You still don't know, do you? The real him, I mean...\nPhoenix:\n... You seem to bear a lot of resentment towards Mr. Engarde. If that's the case, then why did you become his manager? And why would you become intimate with his rival?\nAndrews:\n... That... has nothing to do with this case. Nothing.\nCeleste Inpax\nPhoenix:\nAbout Ms. Celeste Inpax...\nAndrews:\nI had finally put her death behind me... And now, thanks to you, it's all come back to the surface.\nPhoenix:\nI... I'm sorry.\nAndrews:\nYes, I was shocked by her suicide. And it's true that when I heard the rumor that Juan was the one who had hidden her suicide note, I began to draw close to him. I wanted to get her suicide note back... and to burn it.\nPhoenix:\nYou wanted to \"burn it\"? But why?\nAndrews:\nI didn't want it to spread like just another piece of gossip. But... I never held any murderous intent towards Juan. I would never do something so stupid.\nPhoenix:\n(The suicide note, huh...? I wonder what it said?)\nWhy frame him? (appears after \"Matt Engarde\" and \"Celeste Inpax\")\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you try to frame Mr. Engarde?\nAndrews:\nThat's simple. Because he's the killer, that's why. Isn't it the duty of every good citizen to inform the police?\nPearl:\nB-But... there had to be another way.\nPhoenix:\nThe police are excellent at doing their job, so they'd figure it out, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, they're so good that they couldn't figure out the real truth behind Celeste's death.\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews...\nPhoenix:\nWell, um, I know you're not the type of person to do something without a reason, so please, tell me why you did what you did...\nAndrews:\n...Revenge.\nPearl:\nHuh...? Did you say something just now...?\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nPhoenix:\n(A Psyche-Lock, huh...)\nAndrews:\nDon't you understand yet? You're not my lawyer. To be honest, you're more like my enemy.\nPearl:\nBut...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure I just heard Ms. Andrews say, \"Revenge\".)\nWhy frame him? (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you frame Mr. Engarde...?\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nAndrews:\nHmm, I wonder why...? I don't really know myself. When I realized what I was doing, I had already stabbed the knife into the body.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm almost sure that just now... Ms. Andrews muttered, \"Revenge\" to herself.)\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nAndrews:\nI was the one who organized the whole press conference. Juan wanted to deal the most damage possible to Matt's career. And that's why he was killed. It's quite simply a story of cause and effect, yes?\nMagazine Clipping\nAndrews:\nIt appears to me that rumor was started by Juan himself.\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida...? But...\nAndrews:\nI'm Matt's manager, remember. I think he wanted to embarrass Matt through his relationship with me.\nPearl:\nBut... But didn't Mr. Corrida like you...!?\nAndrews:\nThere weren't any feelings of love between us. For me, it was about getting Celeste's suicide note... For him, it was about wounding Matt's pride. That's all it was.\nPearl:\nThat's... That's...\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls is in shock. She sees just how cruel the world can really be.)\nGuitar Case\nPhoenix:\nSo there was a Nickel Samurai costume inside of this case, correct?\nAndrews:\nYes, there was. I even personally carried it here from the studio. I always thought it was such a childish thing to dress up and wear a costume like that, but I never thought that I would wind up using it myself that night.\nWine Glass\nAndrews:\nWhen I was pouring that glass of juice... I honestly had no idea that Juan was dead...\nPearl:\nI see...\nAndrews:\nI really am a terrible woman, aren't I? One moment, I'm thinking of looking after him, and the next, I'm stabbing him in the chest with a knife.\nCrime Photo\nPhoenix:\nAbout this photo...\nAndrews:\nThe person who stabbed the body and opened the guitar case was me.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that was so you could get the Nickel Samurai's costume out so you could wear it...?\nAndrews:\nI thought I had executed that part quite well. But you showed me differently. You are a formidable lawyer, Mr. Wright.\nJammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo\nAndrews:\nYou know... There was only one thought running through my head at that time. \"With this, I can finally expose Matt's true nature to the world.\"\nPhoenix:\n(His \"true nature\"...? I wonder why she's saying that, but not telling me what his true nature is? If it were me, I think I'd be happy to finally get that kind of thing off my chest.)\nSuicide Report\nAndrews:\nI don't care what the reason was... It's unforgivable that he hid Celeste's suicide note.\nPhoenix:\nBut you don't have any proof that she left a suicide note behind, right?\nAndrews:\nCeleste... She always believed there was a right way and a wrong way to do anything. She would have left a note. I... I wholly believe that.\nAttempted Suicide Report\nAndrews:\nS-Stop it! I don't want to remember the hopelessness and the despair I felt back then!\nPearl:\nHurry up and put that away, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm so sorry!\nPicture Card\nAndrews:\nIt was near Juan's dead body. I... I noticed it when I went to fill the glass. And then when I realized that Juan was dead... I completely panicked. That's when I must have unconsciously picked this card up and put it into my pocket. As for why...? I simply don't know.\nWill Powers profile\nAndrews:\nThat's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be.\nPhoenix:\n(Urk... What a horrible thing to say...)\nAndrews:\n...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright.\nJuan Corrida profile\nAndrews:\nHe is a very prideful man... Or rather, was. He absolutely had to compete with Matt in everything, no matter what it was. He really was such an idiot.\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nWell, I guess maybe all stars are like that. Never giving any thought to other people's feelings.\nMatt Engarde profile\nAndrews:\n...\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nThat things have come to this... I have nothing left to say about that man. Not one word.\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAndrews:\nI hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nCeleste Inpax profile\nAndrews:\nCeleste... was my mentor. She was a strong woman... She wouldn't kill herself over any old trifling matter...\nPearl:\nS-So... You have some ideas of why she killed herself...?\nAndrews:\nYes, I suppose...\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, I'd like to ask you about this...\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...)\nDetention Center (subsequent visits, before clearing all Talk options in Wright & Co.

Uh, you see, I got roped into this somehow...\nPearl:\nWhat??\nPowers:\nAnd now I'm going to testify at tomorrow's trial.\nPhoenix:\n(So the decisive witness... is Mr. Powers?)\nPowers:\nI was talking with a detective until a little while ago, and I was on my way home... When all of a sudden, \"You there! You're under arrest!\" And I was brought back here.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh.\nPowers:\nThey said my face and whole self in general looked \"suspicious\" or something.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Well, I guess I can see how they thought you looked suspicious...)\nPowers:\n*sigh* I'm just a normal guy on an exercise show for kids... Is that a crime??\nExamine\nDetective on left\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.\nDetective:\n\"...I... I'm sorry, everyone. I've lied to you all...

What are you going to talk about?\nPowers:\nAh, I really don't know yet... But it sounds like I saw something pretty important from what they tell me.\nPhoenix:\nYou saw something important? What was it?\nPowers:\nAh, well, the detective told me not to talk about it. \"You can't tell anyone, and especially not that lawyer,\" he said.\nPearl:\nWho do you think is \"that lawyer\" the detective was talking about...?\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to take a wild guess and say it's me.\nPowers:\n...Y-Yeah, you got it.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mystic Maya and myself are your only two allies in this whole world, but it's alright!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch... I don't really have a lot of friends, do I...?)\nMatt Engarde\nPowers:\nThis is going to do a lot of damage to Matt, you know. Because he's got that \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" image going.\nPhoenix:\nBut what is he really like?\nPowers:\nWell, let's see. Matt's always been kind of a \"player\" with women... He would never really turn a pretty face away, if you know what I mean... He'd always say, \"It's just a game\" to justify himself.\nPearl:\nWhat!? H-How horrible! That's unforgivable!\nPowers:\nOww. S-Sorry. Didn't mean to offend you. But you know, he said once that, \"There's only one person in the world who won't swoon over me.\"\nPhoenix:\nOne person who wouldn't swoon over him?\nPowers:\nHis manager, you know. Ms. Adrian Andrews.\nPhoenix:\n(Why is Mr. Powers suddenly looking kind of... energetic?)\nGossip\nPowers:\nAh, you see, I'm actually a sucker for gossip. I mean, celebrities and their world have this dazzling sort of image, right?\nPhoenix:\nA dazzling sort of image? But aren't you a part of that dazzle, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nNo, I'm more of a hairy, sweaty, smelly, brutish kind of guy, you see. But it's OK, really. I get to hear plenty of gossip about a lot of the other stars around me as things happen.\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's true.\nPowers:\nOh, hey! So did you hear about this yet? About Ms. Andrews' mentor and her suicide...?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Ms. Inpax?\nPearl:\nWe heard something about how her wedding was cancelled...\nPowers:\nYeah, that's what I'm talking about! I thought about it a little the other day! About that mysterious death! Hey, Mr. Wright! Why don't you ask me about that!? Go on, go ahead!\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Powers is so charged up his skin is practically glowing with electricity...)\nCeleste's suicide (appears after \"Gossip\")\nPowers:\nHey, so have you heard this? Celeste left a suicide note! And they say that Juan went and hid it...\nPhoenix:\nWe heard about that in court today. (But there wasn't any actual proof that she had left a note...)\nPowers:\nWell, this is what I think. I think that something bad was written on that note. Something bad for Juan, that is.\nPearl:\nSomething bad for Mr. Corrida?\nPhoenix:\nWhy do you figure so?\nPowers:\nWell, before she died, Celeste talked with a few of her friends. And she said, \"It looks like I got caught up with a truly insidious man...\" (Changed from [And she said, 'It looks like I may have been caught by an insidious man...'] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nA \"truly insidious man\"...? Did she mean Mr. Corrida by that? (Changed from [An 'insidious man'...? Did she mean Mr. Corrida by that?] in the original release)\nPowers:\nWell, there's no one else that fits the bill, right? And that would be reason enough for him to hide the suicide note!\nPhoenix:\nI see... Well, that's some good info. Thank you.\nPowers:\nY-You're welcome!\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews; they're both at the detention center right now. There are still things I don't understand or know about, I'm sure... I have to get the two of them to tell me everything!)\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nPowers:\nUm... That kidnapper... Has he said anything since then...?\nPhoenix:\nWell... He tried, but there was a lot of interference.\nPowers:\nI see...\nPhoenix:\n(That radio interference... Who would've thought it was caused by a spy camera?)\nMagazine Clipping\nPowers:\nHey! That article! Is that from \"Gossip Land\"?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I guess so.\nPowers:\nAh, you too? I absolutely love this magazine!\nPhoenix:\nUm... \"You too\"...?\nPowers:\nOh, they wrote a little something about me once! \"Steel Samurai's Midnight Dine and Dash\".\nPearl:\nDine and dash...?\nPowers:\nI bought ten copies of that issue, you know.\nPhoenix:\n(Do you think we could somehow get back to THIS article...?)\nGuitar Case\nPowers:\nThe Jammin' Ninja made me want a bright red guitar, you know. I wanted to be cool like him, so I went out and bought one.\nPhoenix:\nOh... That's nice...\nPowers:\nAh, but you don't understand. I can't get a single sound to come out of it. Because I sort of tripped on it and crushed it... the day after I bought it.\nWine Glass, Crime Photo, Jammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo\nPowers:\nI can't believe Ms. Andrews tried to frame Matt... Those two have such a strange relationship with each other, don't they?\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Mr. Powers is just as in the dark about things as I am. I guess I don't have a choice other than to go talk to the two of them myself.)\nAdrian Andrews profile\nPowers:\nHey, that's Ms. Andrews! She's Matt's manager.

Here's the thing. I don't really KNOW her know her... you know? Ah!

He told me, \"I'm sure I sold the bear to Mr. Engarde.\" I mean, the clerk even got Mr. Engarde's autograph out of it, pal.

Th-This can't be!)\nCredit Card Receipt added to the Court Record.\nStuffed bear (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure you heard right!? That the person who bought this bear was...\nGumshoe:\nI heard it from the department store clerk, pal. This is the credit card receipt for the purchase. It's for $3,800, pal. That's an exact match to the price of that stuffed bear.\nPhoenix:\nA receipt...? That's all you have?\nGumshoe:\nNah, it's not just the receipt, pal. The store clerk said so himself. He told me, \"I'm sure I sold the bear to Mr. Engarde.\" I mean, the clerk even got Mr. Engarde's autograph out of it, pal. So I'm sure the person that bought the stuffed bear was Mr. Engarde himself!\nPhoenix:\n(My... My sight is failing me... Th-This can't be!)\nSpy camera\nPhoenix:\nSo what about the spy camera we found...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, that was a dead end, pal. I mean, you can get this kind of thing from anywhere. But for now, I guess I can give these back to you for you to file away into evidence.\nSpy Camera, Transmitter, and Stuffed Bear refiled into the Court Record.\nSpy camera (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo what about the spy camera we found...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, that was a dead end, pal. I mean, you can get this kind of thing from anywhere. But for now, I guess I can give these back to you for you to file away into evidence.\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nGumshoe:\nHave you heard anything from the kidnapper...?\nPhoenix:\nNope. Not a word since we were cut off by the radio interference.\nGumshoe:\nWell, we know his goal is to get an acquittal for Matt Engarde... So, I don't think he'll hurt Maya, because that's not going to help him at all. Come on! We can't lose hope, pal!\nPearl:\nY-Yeah!\nTransmitter, Stuffed Bear, or Spy Camera\nGumshoe:\nThat Engarde... What was he thinking?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean setting the spy camera up in the victim's room...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah! And it was recording at the time of the murder too, pal. Don't you find that just a tad suspicious? It doesn't sound like a coincidence to me...\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nAh! I mean, don't mind me! I didn't mean it that way, pal...\nPhoenix:\n(Then what \"way\" did you mean it?)\nAdrian Andrews profile\nGumshoe:\nMy impression of her has totally changed, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I wonder what she is doing right now...?\nGumshoe:\nI'm sure she's still being questioned. She sure got herself into quite a big mess trying to frame Mr. Engarde. She'll probably be spending the night at the detention center...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, that's right. She's still at the detention center.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nGumshoe:\nI know you don't want to give up, pal...\nPhoenix:\n(I never thought... I didn't think it was possible... The person who put the spy camera in Juan Corrida's room was Matt Engarde!)\nPearl:\nWhy... Why would Mr. Engarde do something like this!?\nGumshoe:\nI bet it was to catch Ms. Andrews and Mr. Corrida in one of their rendezvous.\nPhoenix:\n\"I bet\" is not good enough for me. I have to know the absolute truth behind this camera.\nGumshoe:\nAre you going to see him? Mr. Engarde, I mean.\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nPearl:\nI'm... I'm scared, Mr. Nick. I wonder... I wonder what we will find out next...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm scared myself, but I have to put on a good face for Pearls... Matt Engarde! What in the world have you done!?)\nCorrida's Hotel Room\nPresent\nSpy Camera or Transmitter\nPearl:\nI've learned a lot of things during this case. For example, if you want to spy on someone, there are devices like this you can use.\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's not really a device for the purpose of spying. The way any device is used is decided by the people who use them.\nPearl:\n...\nStuffed Bear\nPearl:\nPoor teddy... I feel bad for it. Its eye was... It was... And all for the criminal's mean plan...\nPhoenix:\n(This bear... It's an expensive luxury brand from overseas.) But it's OK, Pearls. Now it's helping us by giving us a clue... It's telling us who the real culprit is so we can get some justice.\nDetention Center (after clearing all Talk options in Wright & Co. Law Offices)\nEngarde:\nYou're working really late, you know. It's already past 10:00 PM, dude.\nPhoenix:\nI think it's time you told me the truth.\nEngarde:\n... Relax. Don't you know that \"ignorance is bliss\"? But if you really want to know, let's talk.\nTalk\nMatt's secret (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nEngarde:\nWell done, Mr. Wright. I bet it wasn't easy to gather as much information as you have.\nPhoenix:\nYou really... So you were Shelly de Killer's client!?\nEngarde:\nYou don't really think I would dirty my own hands in this, do you?\nPearl:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nEngarde:\nAnd that woman... Adrian was quite brave herself. Trying to stick the crime on me -- I didn't think she had it in her. But all I care about is that Juan is dead. Isn't that right, Mister Lawyer?\nPearl:\nTh-That's... You're lying!! What a terrible...!\nEngarde:\nIt's way past your bedtime... little girl. Go on, and let us grown-ups talk about more... adult things.\nPearl:\nBut why!? Why did you hide the video camera and...\nEngarde:\n... A weakling soon believes the words of others... just like that pathetic Adrian.\nPhoenix:\n(He knew about Ms. Andrews' secret...?)\nEngarde:\nBut I'm no weakling. I don't believe anyone... least of all assassins.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\nEngarde:\nOh, come now, Mr. Wright. Assassins aren't above blackmail. They turn their clients into cashcows by holding the sinful deed over their heads. And a superstar like me, how much do you think I'm worth? Care to guess?\nPearl:\nAnd... And that's why...?\nEngarde:\nYes, that's where the video comes in. It's got his face and the crime scene recorded on it, preserved for all time. With that, I can keep him at bay, and even blackmail him if I want. That's right. That video is my \"insurance\"... Isn't that what they call it, Mr. Wright?\nPearl:\nWhy would you do something so wrong...?\nEngarde:\nBecause I'm a grown-up, and I can. Good enough of an answer for you, little girl?\nMotive for murder (appears after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nPearl:\nWhy!? Why would you kill Mr. Corrida...?\nEngarde:\nBecause he was about to sling so much dung onto my beautiful public image. Scandals are a little annoying, aren't they?\nPhoenix:\nThis is all because of that press conference, isn't it...?\nPearl:\nIf Mr. Corrida had been able to give it, then Mr. Engarde's secret would've...\nEngarde:\nAh, well, that's what we call \"taking advantage of the situation\", you know? I had no interest in doing it, really, but bit by bit, it crept up on me. And then the situation just presented itself perfectly... \"How beautiful,\" I thought.\nPearl:\nAnd that's... That's how Mr. Corrida ended up dead...\nEngarde:\nLet me tell you something. I'm not like Adrian. I don't depend on anyone. People are simply things to be used. Used and thrown away. Put on a sweet, innocent face, and people will swallow anything you feed them. Adrian fell for it. The assassin too. Oh, and how can I forget. Even you fell for it, Mister Lawyer! Everyone, all working their butts off for me, Matt Engarde!\nPearl:\n...\nEngarde:\nAww, did that leave you speechless? What a shame.\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nPhoenix:\n5 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- Matt's Secret --\nPhoenix:\nNow, let's hear what this \"secret\" of yours is. What if Mr. Corrida had been successful in his plan? What would he have disclosed...?\nEngarde:\nI told you before, dude. I don't know! I don't know anything about Juan, OK? Look, Mr. Wright. I can keep on saying it until I'm blue in the face, but... I totally didn't pay Juan any attention the whole time that night! I mean, come on! I was in the middle of a nap!\nPhoenix:\nDon't lie to me.\nEngarde:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nI know you paid close attention to Mr. Corrida, especially on that night!\nPresent Spy Camera or Transmitter\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSomeone used this camera to secretly film Mr. Corrida's room the night of the murder.\nEngarde:\n...\"Secretly film\"...? What?\nPhoenix:\nAnd then sent the images the camera took with this transmitter.\nEngarde:\nWow... But dude, where was this camera you're talking about hidden?\nPresent Stuffed Bear\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The spy camera was hidden in this bear's eye!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEngarde:\nMr. Lawyer dude, I'm really tired...\nPhoenix:\nI know...\nEngarde:\nBut dude, you look even more tired than me. Why don't we call it quits for today and get some sleep? How does that sound?\nPhoenix:\nWhat made you say that all of a sudden?\nEngarde:\nWell, you're here showing me stuff that doesn't make any sense.\nPhoenix:\nOh, oops. (I guess I really must be tired...) But I'm not giving up just yet.\nLeads back to:\n\"Someone used this camera to secretly film Mr. Corrida's room the night of the murder.\"\nPhoenix:\nThe spy camera was hidden in this bear's eye!\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nA bear that was supposed to be a present from a fan!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nLeads to:\n\"...Hmph.\"\nPresent Stuffed Bear\nPhoenix:\nThis bear was in Mr. Corrida's room on the night of the murder. A bear that was supposed to be a present from a fan!\nEngarde:\nSo? It's a present, dude. It actually looks kinda classy, if you know what I mean.\nPhoenix:\nYes, I hear it's quite expensive. Which is why it is very odd that this gadget was found inside this bear!\nPresent Spy Camera or Transmitter\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This is a very small video camera.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEngarde:\nMr. Lawyer dude, I'm really tired...\nPhoenix:\nI know...\nEngarde:\nBut dude, you look even more tired than me.

And it was hidden inside this bear's eye.\nEngarde:\n...Maybe it's a really curious bear...?\nPhoenix:\nWell, whatever this \"bear\" saw was sent somewhere using this transmitter. Which means... Someone, on the night of the murder, was secretly filming Mr. Corrida's room!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nLeads to:\n\"...Hmph.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWell, Mr. Engarde?\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec.

Aha ha ha ha *snort!*\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe he can be so flippant at a time like this...) Um, Mr. Engarde... I don't think you need to snort while you laugh. Really.\nLeads back to:\n\"I know you paid close attention to Mr. Corrida, especially on that night!\"\nEngarde:\n...Hmph. I guess Juan had a few of those kinds of fans too, huh dude?\nPhoenix:\nActually, I wouldn't say this bear was a present from a \"fan\".\nEngarde:\n... Hmm... You sure, dude?

Don't you know this bear from somewhere...?\nEngarde:\nI don't think I've ever met Mr. Bear before, dude.\nPhoenix:\nAww, but he says he knows you. How could you forget such a great friend?\nEngarde:\n... What else did the bear tell you?\nPhoenix:\nHe says that the one who put the camera in his eye was you, Mr. Engarde.\nEngarde:\n... If I didn't know how you work in court, I'd think I was in some serious trouble. Come on... This is all a joke, right dude? You're just pulling my leg.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like you're not ready to give up your secret yet.\nEngarde:\nWell, do you have any proof you want to show me first?\nPhoenix:\nHere is proof that it was you who put the camera inside the bear:\nPresent Credit Card Receipt\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I have here, one credit card receipt, Mr. Engarde.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWell, come on, Mr. Engarde!\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec.

So close and yet so far!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Looks like you're not ready to give up your secret yet.\"\nPhoenix:\nI have here, one credit card receipt, Mr. Engarde. It's from when YOU bought that stuffed bear!\nEngarde:\nDude, all you can tell from this is that I spent $3,800. I go to that department store all the time, OK? This $3,800... This could be the toothbrush I bought that one time.\nPhoenix:\nA-A THIRTY-EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR TOOTHBRUSH!?\nEngarde:\n...It's ivory... And it's got elephant hair for bristles...\nPhoenix:\n(Eww... Elephant hair? Is that what rich people use nowadays...?) Anyway! The store clerk clearly remembers you and your purchase. After all, you even gave him an autograph, did you not!?\nEngarde:\n... Dude... You should've said that earlier.\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nEngarde:\n... Um, so can I ask you one thing?\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nEngarde:\nYou're my lawyer, right dude?

Hey, let's stop talking about this, OK?\nPhoenix:\nNo, not yet. I haven't asked why you set the camera up yet.\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd what your \"secret\" is. Of course, it would be strictly confidential...\nEngarde:\nSo...? What are you going to do now?\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to find out what I want to know... because I must.

Isn't that right!?\nEngarde:\n... ...Dude, you can be such a moron.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEngarde:\nOh man, Mr. Lawyer dude, that kind of scandal... That's the good stuff! That's what we in the industry call \"juicy\"!\nPhoenix:\n...The \"good stuff\"...? \"Juicy\"...?\nEngarde:\nLook, we can get publicity without spending a penny with that kind of stuff. I mean, if people stopped paying attention to us, then it'd be the end, dude.\nPhoenix:\n... Too bad that wasn't your intention.\nEngarde:\nWhat are you talking about?\nPhoenix:\nI wish your reason for spying was something so innocent. But it wasn't. You didn't spy on Mr. Corrida because of Ms. Andrews... Then there's only one reason I can think of for you to do such a thing.\nEngarde:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nThe real reason you set up that camera in Mr. Corrida's room was...\nPresent Picture Card\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Wh-What is this card...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEngarde:\n...If I really wanted to set up a spy camera... I wouldn't have set it up in Juan's room. It would be in your office, dude.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? My office...?\nEngarde:\nWell, dude, you're always saying really absurd things, right?

I'm sure Mr. Bear will talk with you about as much as I will, which is not at all.\nPhoenix:\nUm...

I'm finally starting to get to the truth! I can't afford to make any more mistakes now...) Mr. Matt Engarde. I know why you know Mr. de Killer.

To expose Shelly de Killer's fiendish plot!\nEngarde:\n...I... ...Okay... If that's what you think, then whatever, dude.\nPhoenix:\n... (I get the feeling that wasn't quite it...) S-Sorry.

You knew exactly what was going to happen in that room!\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nSo... How? How would you know something like that...? It's because you're his client. That's why. You hired Shelly de Killer to assassinate Mr. Juan Corrida! The real mastermind behind this whole murder is... You, Matt Engarde!\nEngarde:\n... ... ... ...*sigh* And here I was, trying to be a good boy for you, dude.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEngarde:\nI thought if you didn't know, you'd be able to do your job without feeling bad.

You've grown awfully quiet...\nPhoenix:\nH-How could I have been so deceived by you all this time? When we first met, I asked if you had killed Juan Corrida... And you answered very clearly that you hadn't killed anyone.\nEngarde:\nHey now. I never told you any lies. The person who did the killing was that De Killer guy, right? All I'm guilty of is taking a catnap in my room.\nPhoenix:\nYou... You... You killed Mr. Corrida!\nEngarde:\nHahaha. I dare you to say that in court tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nGrr...\nEngarde:\nAww, but too bad. You can't. You're my lawyer, after all. Aren't you?\nPhoenix:\n...\nEngarde:\nYou could always drop my case and refuse to represent me. How does that sound? Aww, but you can't, can you? That would be the one thing you absolutely can't do.\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya...!\nEngarde:\nYou wouldn't want to test De Killer. He's a man of his word, or so I hear. You could end up getting a certain friend of yours rubbed out if you lose.\nPhoenix:\n...Y...You... scoundrel...\nEngarde:\nSo if I were you, Mr. Wright, esquire, I think I would give it my all tomorrow. Remember, everyone likes a happy win-win resolution.\nPhoenix:\nI... I'll get you for this!\nEngarde:\nThat's such a clich\u00e9 phrase. Juan said something just like that, if memory serves. Of course... Well, we all know how well things turned out for him, don't we? Good night, Mister Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... Maya, what am I supposed to do!?)\n???:\n... And now... Now you've finally found it.\nEdgeworth:\nThe starting line of this case.\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nI don't care for the horrid atmosphere here.

We can't do that...\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right... He's holding Maya hostage...\nPhoenix:\n... What... What should I do...?\nEdgeworth:\n... That's not something I can answer for you.\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nWright... Only you can decide where to go from here. One year ago... At that time, I didn't truly understand what a \"prosecutor\" was. And that is why... I had to leave the Prosecutor's Office. I felt that I couldn't stand in a court of law until I knew what a prosecutor really was. And now, Wright... It's your turn.\nPhoenix:\nMy... turn?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this thing called a \"lawyer\"? What can you do as one? You must find the answer... And you must find it on your own.\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nI'm a lawyer... But to fight for someone who is clearly a killer... Matt Engarde... That man is really... Argh!\nEdgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter who, every person deserves a proper defense and a fair trial. Isn't that the basis of our judicial system?\nPhoenix:\n\"Proper defense\"? But what exactly is that? Is it where a lawyer forcibly and blindly gets an acquittal through shouting and trickery?\nEdgeworth:\n...*sigh* Ironic that you of all people should say such a thing. Isn't that exactly how you have fought for your clients up until now?\nPhoenix:\nUh... W-Well, that may be true, but... But that's... That's because I've believed my clients to be innocent from the bottom of my heart! But if I were to get Engarde an acquittal... That... That isn't a proper defense at all!\nMaya's situation\nPhoenix:\nI became a lawyer because I thought... I thought I could save people who were suffering and in pain...\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\nBut... When I look at this mess we're in... I can't even protect the person closest to me. Even if I win the case, I still lose in the end... I just don't know what to do!\nEdgeworth:\n... Wright. Would you get a hold of yourself? You have it all wrong.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nWe aren't some sort of heroes. We're only human, you and I. You want to \"save someone\"? That's something easier said than done, wouldn't you say?\nPearl:\nTh-That's...\nEdgeworth:\nYou are a defense lawyer. You can't run away from that. You can only fight. That's all you can do.\nWhy fight?

You fight to the very end, even when you know the truth is not with you. But I'm not like you. I can't fight for a false verdict -- for a man I clearly know to be guilty!\nEdgeworth:\n... Franziska... She fights for herself. The only thing she fights for is her perfect win record. That's all.\nPhoenix:\nAnd!? Isn't that the same as you!? Isn't that why you ran away a year ago? Because your precious win record was destroyed!? You are so petty!\nEdgeworth:\n... I see... Now I understand why you despise me so. However, you are mistaken.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you...?\nEdgeworth:\nThanks to you, when you sealed off my path to a perfect win record... I began to realize the error of my ways. I realized that things such as a perfect record were meaningless.\nPearl:\nWhat!? (Changed from [Eh!?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nI don't believe you. Are you saying that is why you left the Prosecutor's Office? But then, why? Why are you here now?\nEdgeworth:\nThe answer to that... is something you will find out on your own. I have faith you will see it before the verdict is read tomorrow. But if you can't, then you will be powerless to change the ending of this story.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! The transceiver!\n...*beep*...\n???:\nI'm sorry for what happened earlier. Well then, Mr. Attorney. Do you wager you can obtain an acquittal tomorrow?\nPhoenix:\n...\n???:\nMy, my. What is the matter, Mr. Attorney? I don't sense your usual anger this time.\nPhoenix:\n...Tell me. Please. Why are you holding Maya hostage for Mr. Engarde's sake? Why are you... Why are you doing this for that cold-blooded killer!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright...\n???:\n... Please don't misunderstand things. He is my client.\nPhoenix:\nDon't toy with me! A man who hires an assassin is just as much of a killer himself!\n???:\n... ...I believe you were asking me for a reason as to why I am doing what I am...\nPhoenix:\n...Y-Yeah.\n???:\nThis is what I like to call my \"aftercare\".\nPhoenix:\nWh-What the heck is \"aftercare\"?\n???:\nMy name carries a certain amount of honor and dignity, Mr. Attorney. I take great care to insure that no suspicion falls upon my clients for my handiwork. That is what is called \"client relations\" and it is a part of an assassin's duty.\nPhoenix:\nAn assassin's... \"duty\"...?\n???:\nWe were unlucky this time and my client was arrested as a suspect. As a result, I did what I had to do to enlist your expert help, Mr. Attorney. And to ensure that you would do everything in your power to the very end.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is your name!?\n???:\nI believe I told you once before, however...\nPhoenix:\nYou did... But...\n???:\nMy name is... De Killer. Shelly de Killer.\nEdgeworth:\nY-You're Shelly de Killer!?\nde Killer:\nPlease keep in mind you do not have much space to maneuver with me. As a De Killer, I always finish what I set out to do.

Oh, that... It sounded like a cat.\nPearl:\n...A cat?\nPhoenix:\n(It can't be... that cat... Can it...?)\nPearl:\nWhat is it...?\nPhoenix:\nI think... I know where Shelly de Killer is holding Maya hostage! Edgeworth! Have all police units head for Engarde Mansion immediately!\nEdgeworth:\n...! Alright. You hurry over as well, then!\nPhoenix:\nDon't lose hope yet, Pearls!

Matt Engarde is refusing to meet with you.\nPhoenix:\n...I see.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess I don't really have anything left to talk to him about anyway...)\nPearl:\nShall we listen to what Ms. Andrews has to say...?\nMarch 22Engarde MansionLiving Room\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nPearl:\nPlease answer us! Mystic Mayaaaa!\nEdgeworth:\nWe have this area completely surrounded. There is no way for him to escape. Assuming he's still in the area...\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe it... That butler... All this time, he was De Killer...\nEdgeworth:\nHe and Engarde were working together all this time. I'm sure they had worked out a contingency plan ahead of time.\nExamine\nFireplace\nPhoenix:\nThis is the first time I've seen such a large fireplace.\nEdgeworth:\nI don't particularly care for large fireplaces. They remind me of my youth.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder, if memory serves, if it's because of that rich aunt he had?) Don't tell me you're still stuck on that incident...?\nEdgeworth:\nDon't take this personally, but I really do not wish to remember anything from that time in my life.\nMotorcycle\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems that Engarde was quite famous, even as a motorcycle racer.\nPhoenix:\nGenerally when a star like him tries to do something like that, they fail, but...\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems Engarde is no ordinary man.\nLounge set\nEdgeworth:\nThat Engarde... This is probably where he conducted business with De Killer.\nPhoenix:\nYeah...\nEdgeworth:\nShelly de Killer values his client relations more than anything else. So I'm sure he must meet with his clients in person to talk about any transactions.\nMasks\nEdgeworth:\nIt's Engarde's personal collection. I'd say it's a hobby of his to collect prop masks of shows related to his own.\nPhoenix:\nYou seem to know all sorts of details about Matt Engarde... Almost too many details...\nEdgeworth:\nHe's the defendant in this case. Of course I would know about him.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah... I guess that makes sense...\nDoorway behind railing\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like there's another room in the back.\nEdgeworth:\nLeave that to us. I'm sure the investigation team is already doing its job in there.\nDoor\nPearl:\nThere's a small door at the bottom of this bigger door, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nI bet it's for the cat to use.\nPearl:\nOh, you mean Shoe.\nBear figurine\nLeads to:\n\"Oh, it's a figurine of a bear!\"\nPearl:\nOh, it's a figurine of a bear!

Why would something like this be here...?\nEdgeworth:\nWright, look down. There's a little pet door installed here.\nPearl:\nAh, I'm sure that's for Shoe...\nPhoenix:\nDo you think that this... came through that little door...?\nEdgeworth:\nUmph! This door... It's locked!\nPhoenix:\nWell, I'm pretty used to breaking doors down by now. Let's go, Edgeworth!\n*SLAM* *SLAM* *CRASH!*\nPrivate Lounge\nPhoenix:\nArgh! There's no one here!\nEdgeworth:\nFrom the looks of this room, I would say this is Engarde's private lounge. ...Look at this, Wright!\nPhoenix:\nAn antennae for sending and receiving radio signals and a VCR... Check inside the deck! If there's a tape, it would be an important piece of evidence! (If we're lucky, it'll have the moment the crime was committed recorded on it!)\nEdgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but... The tape deck is empty. There's no tape to be found.\nPearl:\nNo...\nEdgeworth:\nBut there's no mistake that someone used this to record something. It looks like someone took the tape we're looking for, and escaped with it...\nExamine\nTV\nPhoenix:\nA huge television and speakers loom largely here. I'm sure if Maya saw this, she'd say,\nMaya:\n\"I would die a happy Samurai fan if I could see the Nickel Samurai on a TV like this!\"\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's what she'd say... ... Ack! I can't believe I just made a joke about Maya, all things considered...\nSatellite dish\nPhoenix:\nIt's a VCR and an antennae. The footage that the spy camera took at the scene of the crime... was beamed here and recorded on tape.\nPearl:\nIf only we had that tape, it would have been really helpful...\nComputer\nPhoenix:\nIt's Engarde's computer. Maya... Why couldn't you have used this to get help?\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Where's... Where's the power switch!?\nPhoenix:\n... (Oh, I get it... So that's what happened. She couldn't find the power switch...)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nIt's a very small table. I bet we could barely squeeze 3 Pearls on there.\nPearl:\nBut I wouldn't sit on a table to begin with, Mr. Nick...\nSofa\nPhoenix:\nWhat a spacious sofa. I bet 10 Pearls would fit on here.\nPearl:\nUm, I don't think 10 of me would fit, Mr. Nick...\nVideo tapes\nPhoenix:\nI can't read all the labels, but this is a very large collection of video tapes. Looks like Engarde taped all of his own shows...\nDoor\nPearl:\nThere's a little door for Shoe in this big door.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure Maya used this door to shove this out there... I'm sure it was her! (Every time you give me some piece of evidence, it's always the most crucial piece. This time too, I'm sure...)\nWine Cellar\nPhoenix:\n... (We've searched all over, but it looks like he got away...)\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry. It looks like he slipped out of our grasp this time.\nPhoenix:\nAnd now... we've lost our only lead.\nEdgeworth:\nDon't give up yet. That little girl is looking to you to be her pillar.\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, you're right.\nEdgeworth:\nWe're close, I can tell. We've already set up checkpoints along every route leading out of this district. Leave the rest to us.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya...)\nExamine\nBottles\nPearl:\nWow... I've never seen so many bottles all in one place before.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess when you're a star, you have so much money you can buy anything you want.\nBoxes\nPhoenix:\nThe light doesn't filter in all the way, so it's hard to see. It looks like there are crates and cardboard boxes tied up with wire here.\nDoor\nPearl:\nIt's a pretty heavy door, isn't it? I can't open it by myself. Please don't shut me in here by accident, OK Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(If I were locked in a place like this... I'd be plenty scared too. Trust me.)\nPhoto frame\nLeads to:\n\"This looks like a picture of Ms. Inpax...\"\nPhoenix:\nThis looks like a picture of Ms. Inpax... (\"With love... Celeste\")\nPearl:\nMs. Inpax?

Hmm, this might be a clue...)\nCeleste's Photo added to the Court Record.\nPearl:\nAh!\nPhoenix:\nWhat's wrong, Pearls?\nPearl:\nP-Please let me see that picture frame!\nPhoenix:\n(Huh?

Why the blank stare?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, nothing.\nEdgeworth:\nWe've searched the house, and this is the last room. It looks like he eluded us.\nPhoenix:\n...Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nYes?\nPhoenix:\nAs far as clues go, I think this is about all I'm going to get.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nBut I'm still short one last thing...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what is that?\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Andrews' Psyche-Lock... If I could just find out what secret she's holding... Then I think I stand a chance in court tomorrow... To blow this case wide open and expose the truth.)\nEdgeworth:\nI think I know what you're thinking. I'll contact the detention center.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Thanks, Edgeworth. Well, let's go Pearls. It's time to open that last lock.\nMarch 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nAndrews:\nGood evening, Mr. Wright. ... What's wrong? You look ill...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews. I have come to remove your Psyche-Lock.\nAndrews:\nPsyche-Lock...?\nPhoenix:\nI want to know, and you will tell me... ...your secret.\nAndrews:\nFine, go ahead. Try to break me, if you can.\nTalk\nWhy frame him? (after breaking Psyche-Lock)\nAndrews:\nCeleste... She was supposed to get married to Juan.\nPhoenix:\nYes... But I heard that it didn't work out.\nPearl:\nBecause Mr. Corrida didn't want to get married to her anymore, right...?\nAndrews:\nYes... Because of Matt.\nPearl:\nB-Because of Mr. Engarde? What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\n(I think I can see where this is going.)\nAndrews:\nCeleste... She was Matt's manager a long time ago. She was the happiest woman in the world at that time. I was working part-time back then, and I often saw the two of them together.\nPhoenix:\nSo that's why... \"With love... Celeste\" is written on the frame of that picture.\nPearl:\nThey were a couple, weren't they?\nAndrews:\nIt wasn't anything as splendid as that. Celeste was being used; toyed with until she was... thrown away.\nPearl:\nThat's so horrible...\nAndrews:\nMatt's entire image is built around how nice and wonderful of a man he is. A scandal would have destroyed that. Which is why Celeste, in her kindness, moved over to Worldwide Studios. And that is where she met Juan. She seemed really happy with him; even happier than when she was with Matt. Celeste and Juan were such a good match that they were even planning to get married. And then it was suddenly called off. On the night Juan called their marriage off, Celeste... She killed herself. And that's why I framed Matt. It was revenge for Celeste and for myself.\nRevenge (appears after \"Why frame him?\")\nLeads to:\n\"I'm sure even you can guess why Juan called the wedding off, right?\"\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nPhoenix:\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\n-- Why Frame Him? --\nPhoenix:\nCan you please tell me why you framed Mr. Engarde for the murder?\nAndrews:\nI've already told you countless times. It's because I thought Matt was the killer.\nPhoenix:\n(No, that's not it! I know you have a personal reason to dislike Mr. Engarde.) Ms. Andrews. You may think I didn't hear it, but I know you said something earlier. You said, \"Revenge.\"\nAndrews:\nSo you are saying I was taking my revenge out on Matt, and that's why? Wh-What an absurd idea. I... I don't have anything I want to take revenge for.\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Andrews... A woman who lives by being dependent on other people...) (Changed from [Ms. Andrews...

And that is Ms. Inpax's suicide.\nAndrews:\nWh-What are you trying to say? Celeste was Juan's manager.\nPhoenix:\n...\nAndrews:\nOn top of that, the one who hid her suicide note was also Juan. What does all this have to do with Matt?\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. You haven't mentioned him... Yet. But for you to hate Mr. Engarde... It would mean that he must have had some relation to Ms. Inpax and her suicide.\nAndrews:\nCan you explain to me this \"relation\" between Celeste and Matt!?\nPresent Celeste's Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This... This is a photo of Ms. Inpax, correct?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nAndrews:\nThat's it?\nPhoenix:\nYes...\nAndrews:\nAnd what sort of relation is this supposed to explain?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde's...\nAndrews:\nBefore you start, Mr. Wright, perhaps I should first request to see proof that your brain is wired correctly.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. I can't afford to mess up something as big as this! I need evidence that clearly shows a connection between Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde. If I can find that, I can finally get the real story!)\nAndrews:\nI wonder if you'd like to try again, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"Can you explain to me this \"relation\" between Celeste and Matt!?\"\nPhoenix:\nThis... This is a photo of Ms. Inpax, correct? She looks younger than when she passed away though.\nAndrews:\n...W...\nPhoenix:\n\"With love... Celeste\". This is Ms. Inpax's handwriting, isn't it?\nAndrews:\n... Where did you find this...? No, that's alright. It was a rhetorical question...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it is. I found this at Mr. Engarde's mansion.\nAndrews:\n... ...And after all this time... My last remaining secret has been revealed...\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nAndrews:\nI'm sure even you can guess why Juan called the wedding off, right? Matt \"confessed\" to Juan... about his relationship with Celeste.\nPhoenix:\nI see... So that's what happened.\nPearl:\nBut... Then why did Mr. Corrida have to call off the wedding!? I don't understand at all...\nAndrews:\nIt was probably because of his worthless male pride. Juan and Matt were always fierce rivals. Matt waited for the wedding announcement and then unleashed the truth on Juan. He was aiming for when it would hurt Juan the most.\nPearl:\nPoor Ms. Inpax!\nAndrews:\n...That wasn't the end of it. That day, I'm almost certain that Celeste left a suicide note behind. And in that note, she left a detailed account of Matt's various misdeeds, and... So that she would never again be hurt by Matt, she chose... to die. Then, when Juan discovered her body, he hid her note.\nPearl:\nB-But why would he do that!?\nAndrews:\nIt's simple. Juan realized that note was a powerful weapon against Matt. And it would be especially damaging to his \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" image. In any case... With his pride hurt, Juan sought revenge.\nPhoenix:\nRevenge... There's that word again.\nAndrews:\nJuan wanted to publicly disclose the contents of that suicide note. At a time that would cause Matt the most damage, of course.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that was at the press conference after the stage show...\nAndrews:\nI know all about it, because I heard it all from Juan. It was so I could find out about all this that I drew close to Juan to begin with. They're quite a pair of hideous monsters, aren't they? Even Celeste's death was something for them to use in their game. That night, when I found Juan's body, it was only natural that I thought the murderer was Matt. Those two were always spying on one another, after all. As for me, I was frantically searching for Celeste's suicide note. I wanted to destroy it before it ever went public. I was going to burn it. I had even brought a lighter. But... I couldn't find the suicide note... And that's when revenge crossed my mind. Yes, I was going to bring to them my own kind of cruel revenge. Celeste was killed by those two monsters. So when I stabbed Juan's body with that knife... I didn't feel a single shred of guilt.\nPearl:\n...!\nAndrews:\n... And that's all I have to say.\nPhoenix:\n...\nAndrews:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Even knowing all this, are you still going to help that... \"man\"?\nPhoenix:\n... I... I'm a lawyer...\nAndrews:\nI see. What a foul profession.\nPhoenix:\n... Thank you very much for your time and for talking with me.\nAndrews:\nIt was no big deal. I couldn't sleep anyway.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't sleep either...

So for now, please kindly cooperate and continue with your testimony.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry...\nJudge:\nSo, you went to the defendant's room. And then?\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, wait a minute! When and how did I suddenly turn into the bad guy here??)Powers:\nMatt was standing there in front of his room, still in his Nickel Samurai costume.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure that was Matt Engarde?\nPowers:\nYeah, I'm sure. He wasn't wearing the Nickel Samurai mask then.\nPhoenix:\n(If that's the case, then he really can't be mistaken...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnd? What was the defendant doing, standing in front of his own room?Powers:\nHe was talking with someone. At first, I thought it was the bellboy.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"At first\"? What do you mean by that?\nPowers:\nWell, he was in a bellboy-ish uniform and he had a bottle of juice on a tray.\nPhoenix:\n...Sounds like an ordinary bellboy to me.\nPowers:\nUm, yeah, but... I didn't think he was a normal bellboy.\nPhoenix:\nAnd why was that?\nPowers:\nUm... Why did I think that, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nH-How am I supposed to know!?\nPowers:\nSorry, but I can't remember right now. ...Sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I'm going to have to wait patiently on this one...)Press (after pressing fourth statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"At first\"?

(...Hey, wait a second...) Actually, Mr. Powers, only a few minutes ago, you stated:\n\n\nPowers:\nUm... You know, I did feel something weird. I think it was because Matt... Well, he gave the bellboy a tip.\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCould it be that you felt something \"strange\" about the tip-giving incident itself...?\nPowers:\n... AH! Yeah! That's it! You really know your job!\nJudge:\nHmm... Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nThis bellboy... He wasn't an ordinary one, was he...?\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps we should let the witness tell us.\nJudge:\nVery well. Mr. Powers. Please amend your testimony.\nPowers:\nYou mean about the bellboy, right?\nChanges statement from \"He was talking with someone. At first, I thought it was the bellboy.\" to \"Matt gave the bellboy a tip.\"Powers:\nMatt gave the bellboy a tip.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo he gave the bellboy a tip. What's so strange about that?\nPowers:\nAh, well, you see, Matt's not a poor penny-pincher like me. I was trying to figure out how much it was because the tip really shocked me.\nPhoenix:\n\"How much it was\"...?\nPowers:\nBut that's when something even more surprising happened! The bellboy was putting the tip he got in his pocket. And that's when I got my first good look at the guy's face... I was really shocked!\nJudge:\nHmm... I'm afraid I don't follow at all.\nPhoenix:\n(It sounds like Mr. Powers was surprised twice by this event. I wonder which of his shocking moments I should ask about...?)\n\n\n\nThe bellboy's face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was so shocking about the bellboy's face, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nWell, he wasn't exactly a \"boy\"... more like an old \"gramps\"...\nJudge:\nAhem! I hope you know that discrimination towards old men is a no-no in my court!\nPowers:\nNo, no, that's not what I meant at all! In the smack middle of the guy's face, there was a line of stitches!\nJudge:\nA line of stitches...?\nPowers:\nYeah! And it went straight from the tippy top of his head to the bottom of his chin! Almost like if that thread snapped, all the stuff in his head would come spilling out.\nPhoenix:\n... Ah! (He was there... At Engarde's house... He was that BUTLER!)\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nA-Ah, nothing, Your Honor! (So that means Engarde was talking with De Killer then. If that fact were to be exposed, Engarde would be declared guilty in a blink!)\nMia:\nPhoenix, you have to play dumb here! Pretend you don't know anything!\nPhoenix:\nYes, Chief!\nJudge:\nYou sure you don't have something you would like to say, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Umm... What did you just say, Your Honor?\nJudge:\n... Nothing, Mr. Wright. Nothing. We're just going around and around in circles. Now then, Mr. Powers. Please continue with your testimony.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nEngarde's tip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The defendant is a huge star.

The bellboy just wanted to say congrats.\nPhoenix:\nNow, while you were watching the two of them, did you notice anything strange?\nPowers:\nUm... You know, I did feel something weird. I think it was because Matt... Well, he gave the bellboy a tip.\nPhoenix:\nA tip? (But that's a perfectly normal thing to do...)\nJudge:\nSo, how long did you watch the two of them?\nPowers:\nAh, not more than a minute or two, I think.Powers:\nI had guests with me that night, and I couldn't make them wait for me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo who are these \"guests\" you're talking about?\nPowers:\nYou guys, of course. You and Maya and little Pearl. I thought it would be really rude since I invited you guys, if I disappeared on you... So I went back to my seat pretty soon after seeing Matt in the hallway.\nPhoenix:\n(This is like squeezing water from a stone... It's probably pointless to press further...)Mia:\nDo you remember this incident? Did Mr. Powers leave his seat that night?Phoenix:\nI don't remember that happening at all. Maya was making such a racket in her hyper state... I ended up focusing on her.Mia:\n...I see. In any case, from his story, he probably wasn't gone for very long.Phoenix:\nThe defendant is a huge star. He can afford to give generous tips, wouldn't you agree?Powers:\nUm, sure. But giving him that much was maybe a little too much, I think...Phoenix:\n(\"A little too much\"...?)Edgeworth:\nWould you please clarify for the court, about how much would you say the defendant gave to the bellboy?Powers:\nHonestly, I don't know. I can't even begin to guess.Judge:\nAnd why is that?Powers:\nBecause he gave the bellboy a really, really fat roll of cash.Phoenix:\nA ROLL OF CASH!?Judge:\nAh, well... How interesting... That certainly was a very generous tip, wasn't it?Edgeworth:\nA very fat roll of cash... That can hardly be called a \"tip\", Your Honor!Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(The judge is beginning to look awfully suspicious of us...)Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant is a superstar! That kind of tip is typical fare for people like him!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAre you saying that all superstars are super-spenders!? If I could receive large rolls of cash by simply bringing people things on trays... Then why on Earth would I stand around here prosecuting!?\nPhoenix:\n(He's got a point... I don't even get paid, let alone rolls of cash for all my hard work.)\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm, so supposing that roll of cash was not a tip...\"Wait and see\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing I can really object to here.

So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!\nI mean...Edgeworth:\nThank you very much. That is all we need for now.Powers:\nHuh? But I'm not done. There's still more...Edgeworth:\nLet us first establish that the bellboy was truly Mr. de Killer. Then we shall see.Judge:\nHmm... So the bellboy came out of the victim's room... And if that bellboy really was the assassin... Then, I think the answer is fairly obvious.Edgeworth:\nThat would be correct, Your Honor. Well, Mr. Wright. I believe it's your turn... to entertain and make us laugh.Phoenix:\nHa. Ha. Ha. Ha.Mia:\nThis is no laughing matter!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Second Time --Powers:\nThis time, I was in that hallway because I had to go to the bathroom!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what time was it?\nPowers:\nAh, well, I don't remember. The award ceremony ended around 8 PM, right? ...And I went to Matt's room pretty soon after that... And then I came back... And then I went to the bathroom... ... So I guess maybe it was around 8:10 PM by that time?\nJudge:\nYou're not one for details, are you Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nS-Sorry... I thought I could maybe catch Matt and say my congrats...Powers:\nAnd that's when that bellboy I saw earlier came out of the room!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it was the same bellboy?\nPowers:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nAnd how could you tell? All the bellboys wear the same uniform, after all!\nPowers:\nBut, you see... Well, he had those stitches in his face.\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nPowers:\nSo I'm sure it's the same guy that was talking with Matt.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nSo which room did the bellboy come out of?Powers:\nOf course, when I say \"room\", I mean Juan Corrida's room!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe victim's room, huh...?\nPowers:\nYeah. The one with all the really pretty flowers and teddy bears. It was Juan's room alright!\nPhoenix:\n(Words cannot describe how screwed I am...)\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Let's continue with the testimony, shall we?Powers:\nNow that I think about it, that bellboy did seem kinda out of place!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... so what exactly was so \"out of place\" about him?\nEdgeworth:\nWright, Wright, Wright. Why the insipid grin?\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe because I have no idea what damaging thing he's going to say next...?)\nPowers:\nUm, well, the bellboy was empty-handed.\nPhoenix:\nEmpty-handed?\nPowers:\nThat bellboy was one of those room-service people, right? But he wasn't pushing a cart and he wasn't holding a tray either! You'd call that \"a little strange\" too, wouldn't you?\nJudge:\nHmm... I agree that it is a bit strange, Mr. Powers.\nPhoenix:\n(But is it really that unusual for a bellboy to be empty-handed? What should I do? Should I let Mr. Powers' testimony slide or...?)\n\n\n\nLet it slide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. I think it's pretty unusual too.\nPowers:\nAh, I thought you might think so!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. There's no need to say anything when the defense gives up without a fight. Let's move on.\nJudge:\nAnyway, Mr. Powers. You thought the bellboy was a little suspicious, correct?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nTry to pull a fast one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is nothing strange or unusual about an empty-handed bellboy!\nPowers:\nBut there really, really is!\nPhoenix:\nThere really, really isn't!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf you two are done being schoolchildren... Bellboys are for room service. There is no reason for them to be empty-handed, ever. Your Honor! I ask that the witness' previous statement be supplanted with this new one.\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... Edgeworth... Are you going to do whatever you can to make the bellboy look suspicious?)\nJudge:\nI see. Very well, this court recognizes and grants the prosecution's request. Mr. Powers, if you could amend your testimony, please.\nPowers:\nY-Yes, sir.\nChanges statement from \"Now that I think about it, that bellboy did seem kinda out of place!\" to \"I thought it was kinda strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed!\"Powers:\nI thought it was kinda strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're saying that it's suspicious for him to be empty-handed?\nPowers:\nYeah, really suspicious. I mean, when I first saw that bellboy, he was holding a tray in his hand! And there was a bottle of juice and a wine glass on it!\nPhoenix:\nJuice...? What kind of juice was it?\nPowers:\nUm, I'm pretty sure it was tomato juice...\nMia:\nIf we could come up with some sort of reason as to why he would come out empty-handed, some sort of proof, then I think we can dodge the bullet on this one for now.\nPhoenix:\nProof, huh? (Sounds like another job for the Court Record!)Present Wine Glass or Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Powers.\"Powers:\nYeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't be so quick to judge!\nPowers:\nAh, but it's kind of a Powers family thing. \"Think of every person as a thief\".\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess a thief and an assassin are both sneaky and silent...)\nMia:\nThat's not the point, Phoenix.Mia:\nIn any case, if that bellboy was the assassin, it would be very bad for us.Phoenix:\nBut... he really is the assassin, you know?Mia:\nYes... But. You can't give in yet. If you want to prolong this trial for as long as possible, you're going to have to pull some cheap tricks on this one.\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Pearl Fey\nDescription: Maya's cousin.

The moment you've all been waiting for! Who will be this year's Grand Prix Champion? Who will be our \"Hero of Heroes\"!? Will it be last year's runner-up, Jammin' Ninja!? Or maybe Captain Saipan all the way from the lovely tropical island of Saipan!? I see the students of a certain Starry School are raring to win! And Global Hero Onyankopon doesn't want to go home without the prize! We hope Lady Luck is with all our heroes tonight! And now! The winner of the third annual Hero of Heroes Grand Prix... IS ME!!\nWhoooooooooa! The true hero of the night has appeared in our midst! It looks like this year's Grand Prix goes to this fantastic warrior! The Nickel Samurai! Too bad, Jammin' Ninja. Looks like the title eluded you again this year!\nMarch 20, 7:42 PMGatewater HotelViola Hall\nMaya:\nAlright! Yes! Did you hear that, Nick!? Did you!? The Nickel Samurai! He did it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.\nPowers:\nAh, I'm proud of the guy for doing the series justice.\nPearl:\nU-Um... So the person everyone was cheering for... I guess he got the prize?\nMaya:\nYup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? \"The Nickel Samurai\"!\nPearl:\nNo. Every Sunday, I only watch the Educational Channel's \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nOK, that's it! From now on, it's \"The Nickel Samurai\"! All the kids watch it!\nPearl:\nDo you like \"The Nickel Samurai\" too, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nNah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. But I do like \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nHey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed to watch it anymore! You're supposed to act your age and have interests that match. ...It's very important.\nMaya:\nAw, give it a rest, Pearly!\nPowers:\nLooks like I made the right choice in inviting everyone here. I'm glad you're all having a good time.\nMaya:\nAaaaah... It's like a dream!\nPowers:\nToo bad for the Jammin' Ninja, though. Last year, he lost to The Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo. I thought this might be his year...\nMaya:\nYeah... Oh, hey, did anyone else think that the Jammin' Ninja was a bit different today?\nPearl:\nDifferent? What do you mean?\nMaya:\nUm, well, he wasn't carrying his bright red guitar.\nPowers:\nHey, you're right! Strange he'd walk around without his signature guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh* I will never understand these people and their shows...) Anyway, Mr. Powers, thank you very much for tonight.\nPowers:\nA-Aw, it was nothing... I owe you one, so it's just my way of saying thanks.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! It's time to get going to the lobby! There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.\nPowers:\nAnd then, I heard there's going to be a press conference after that.\nPhoenix:\nA press conference? Is he going to make a speech about winning this year's prize?\nPowers:\nUh, well, not exactly... Something about the Nickel Samurai confessing something.\nPhoenix:\nConfessing...? Sounds pretty serious.\nMaya:\nArgh! Nick! COME ON! You don't want us to be the last ones there, do you!?\nPearl:\nYeah, Mr. Nick! Do you!?\nPhoenix:\n(Why me...? The show doesn't even start for another 20 minutes...)\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there.\nPowers:\nAnd behind those doors is an equally grand lobby.\nPearl:\nShall we go and take a look, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nHey, wait up! This grand dessert is calling to me... It's saying, \"Eat me now!\"\nWalls or ceiling\nPhoenix:\nThis sure is one luxurious hotel. Almost to the point of gaudy, with how it blends together everything \"fancy\" imaginable. (Speaking of fancy, didn't that bellboy give me something like that last year?)\nChandelier\nMaya:\nThat chandelier is really something, isn't it?\nPearl:\nI thought it was a kind of space ship...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. How about we get one of these for the office?\nPhoenix:\nOne of those hanging from our poor, weak ceiling? I don't think so.\nTables at back\nMaya:\nIf this is all a dream, I don't ever want to wake up! And all the directors and stars that were here to see the heroes, wow.\nPhoenix:\nI had no idea who most of them were.\nPearl:\nNeither did I.\nMaya:\nNick, you've got to cut that \"news only\" habit out. Your new show is going to be \"The Nickel Samurai!\" Every Sunday morning at 8! Oh, I know! We can watch it together starting next week! I'll come wake you up extra early to make sure, OK?\nPhoenix:\nAh, I'm fine... You know, you really don't have to on my account...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second.\nMaya:\nWell, shows like that are guaranteed to be good, you know?\nFront table\nMaya:\nWhat can I say? This is a really high-class hotel!\nPearl:\nI've never eaten this kind of salad before.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nMaya:\nDon't worry! Any leftovers belong in my happily awaiting stomach anyway!\nPhoenix:\nYou're such a glutton, Maya.\nPowers:\nAh, I lose this one to Maya. You sure can eat.\nMaya:\nWell, a growing girl needs her nutrients!\nPhoenix:\n(A growing girl? Exactly how big do you plan on getting...?)\nTalk\nWill Powers\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much for inviting us today.\nPowers:\nAww, it was nothing really. Guys like us don't get to come to a place like this often, so I thought I'd invite you all.\nMaya:\nHey, Mr. Powers! What have you been up to lately?\nPowers:\nWell, since \"The Pink Princess\" successfully wrapped up last month, I've been on a kid's exercise show... ...while wearing a rabbit mask over my face...\nMaya:\nOh, I see.\nPowers:\nI'm still really sorry about all the headaches I caused you that time, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nAh, well. What's done is done, so let's forget about it. (This is Will Powers. He's an action star. His popularity exploded when he was the Steel Samurai. And he was the first case Maya worked on with me.)\nMaya:\nIt's too bad you look scary, or people'd know you're a real softy who's good with kids. (Changed from [You can't tell by looking at you, but you're a really nice guy with a love of kids.] in the original release)\nPowers:\nUm, thanks. (Changed from [Ah, thanks.] in the original release)\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe they're going to make a movie based on the Nickel Samurai.\nMaya:\nI can't believe it either, but for a different reason!\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai. An epic story of one hero in a desperate fight against his arch-enemy, the Evil Magistrate in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo. And last year, they started a new series, \"The Nickel Samurai\". The new series seems to be a hit with the kids, too.\nPowers:\nI'm really attached to the Steel Samurai as a show, (Changed from [The Steel Samurai is a show I have a lot of strong feelings for,] in the original release) so I was hoping that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one... (Changed from [so I hoped that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nYeah, it's too bad... It'd been [sic] awesome to see you with the new actor, Matt Engarde. (Changed from [Yeah... It's too bad... It'd be great to see you on the show...] in the original release) He's super popular right now. (Changed from [With the new actor, Matt Engarde. He's super popular right now.] in the original release)\nPearl:\nMr. Un-gard...?\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Pearls doesn't know who he is.)\nMaya:\nThis year it's going to be the Nickel Samurai vs. the Jammin' Ninja at the box office!\nPhoenix:\n...Jammin' Ninja...? Who's that again?\nJammin' Ninja (appears after \"The Nickel Samurai\")\nPhoenix:\nSo who is this \"Jammin' Ninja\" again?\nMaya:\nHe's a hero, duh. His symbol is a bright red guitar he's always carrying.\nPhoenix:\n(A ninja who's always carrying around a bright red guitar...? How does that even work!?)\nMaya:\nWith a scarf around his neck and a guitar in hand, he rises to stardom in an ancient time.\nPhoenix:\nA ninja... Who becomes a star??\nMaya:\nYeah! A ninja who becomes a star!\nPowers:\nThere's a strong rivalry between the two of them. Global Studios' Nickel Samurai and Worldwide Studios' Jammin' Ninja. They even air at the same time.\nMaya:\nYou know what I heard? I heard those two don't get along at all. The Nickel Samurai's Engarde and the guy who plays the Jammin' Ninja, I mean.\nPhoenix:\n(The Nickel Samurai speaks French!? Oh, you mean Matt Engarde, the actor...) I guess even the world of heroes isn't a sparkling, happy place.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPowers:\nAh, I really owe you one. If it wasn't for you guys, I don't know what would've happened. What you did... It was a real tight spot I was in, and you fought so hard to get me out. I don't care what happens. I'll never forget everything you've done for me.\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo, you're going to study to become a lawyer too. Am I right or am I right?\nMaya:\nUmm...\nPowers:\nIt must be real tough. There's all those thick books with hard words you have to read...\nMaya:\nUh, um... Well...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, yeah. Mr. Powers doesn't know that Maya's a spirit medium...)\nMaya:\nI thought he'd be able to tell by my clothes.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he thinks that you've got some strange hobby on the side or something.\nMaya:\n...Hey, wait a sec. What's that's supposed to mean!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo are you Maya's little sister?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but no.\nPowers:\nOh, then you must be Mr. Wright's little sister!\nPearl:\nAgain, I'm sorry, but...\nPowers:\nThen... Whose little sister are you?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but I'm an only child.\nPowers:\nOh, I see... S-Sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(Pearl looks so sad... She looks really sorry too...)\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, they're all shocked because then they figure out who I am.\nMaya:\nHmm... Well, I don't think you look scary.\nPearl:\nMe either. I think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Those two are making Mr. Powers tear up...)\nAnything else\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Thanks for taking the time to take it out and show it to me, but I'm really sorry, I don't know a thing about it.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nPhoenix:\nWow, what is with this place? Looks like I've stumbled into Oz or something. Way in the back, there's a sign for the bathroom. Maybe I should visit it while I can before the show starts... (Changed from [I bet we have a little time to look around before the show starts...] in the original release)\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...? Could it be that there's an action star who has a soft spot for teddy bears...? ...Nah, can't be.\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". \"Juan Corrida\"... His name just sounds like a star's name. I've heard it before, but I don't know anything about him at all.\nEnd of hallway\nPhoenix:\nThere are toilets in each room in this hotel, but since all sorts of events are held here, there are bathrooms for people who aren't staying here to use as well. Perfect for people like me, who can't afford a stay here in the first place...\nFlowers on right\nPhoenix:\n\"To Mr. Engarde From the Global Studio Staff\" Ah, it'd be nice if lawyers got flowers too. Something like, \"To Mr. Wright From All Your Grateful Clients\".\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\". \"Matt Engarde\"... I've heard that name before. Oh, yeah. Maya's always yammering about him like the obsessed fan she is...\nViola Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Viola Hall and visiting Hallway)\nPowers:\nSounds like the post-ceremony show is about to start.\nMaya:\nAlright! I'm so pumped! I wonder if he's going to show off his special move today? \"Nickel Samurai Smelting!\"\nPowers:\nActually, what I'm interested in most is the press conference.\nMaya:\nYou mean the \"big confession\" the Nickel Samurai's going to make after the show? So what is it? Don't you know what it's about, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nUh, well, I'm not the Steel Samurai anymore, so I don't have any idea.\nMaya:\nBah.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Ah, so I guess you are all going to the press conference then?\nMaya:\nYeah, of course!\nPowers:\nIf that's the case, then here, take these tickets so you can get in.\nPress Conference Ticket added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much. Well, let's get going to the lobby.\nPearl:\nIt looks like it's over this way, Mr. Nick!\nMaya:\nOK! For great justice!\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPowers:\nThey called this so suddenly that something about it just seems off, you know?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the press conference?\nPowers:\nYeah. He said, \"There's something I'd like to confess if I win.\" I heard he faxed his request for a conference in to the office only yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nYesterday... (Yeah, that is kind of sudden.)\nPowers:\nBut I guess his manager set everything up somehow, so he was lucky.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Nice manager.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Only a really gaudy hotel would have such a large, gaudy lobby to match.\nPearl:\nAh, I think they're going to have the post-ceremony show over there.\nPhoenix:\nThey're using a compact stage, I see.\nMaya:\nOoh... I'm all ready to use my special \"Samurai Power\".\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks like she's ready to start a fight...)\nPA Notice:\nYour attention please, your attention please. The Nickel Samurai's Post-Ceremony Stage Show will not be held tonight due to unforeseen circumstances.\nMaya:\nWHAAAT!? WHYYYYY!?\nPhoenix:\nOww! You didn't have to pinch me! Pinch yourself if you don't believe it!\nPA Notice:\nWe are asking for everyone's cooperation at this time. So please stay where you are. ...This is a special request from the police.\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nP-Police? Did they just say the police?\nPowers:\nD-Do you want me to go check out what's going on?\nPhoenix:\nUm, wait, I'll come with you...\n???:\nFreeze! You two! Didn't you hear the announcement just now!? It just finished telling you not to move!\nMaya:\nTh-That voice... I've heard that voice somewhere before...\n???:\nHonestly, youth these days can't be bothered to listen to other people when they talk! Just the other day it was the same thing! There was a small footbridge with a sign next to it that said, \"Beware, Bridge Out!\" And along comes a snot-nosed little punk kid right up to the bridge. I tried to tell the boy the bridge was out and it was dangerous, but would he listen!? No, of course not! He said he'd be careful and only walk on the \"in\" part of the bridge since the \"out\" part is what was dangerous! I am not kidding you here! The kid said that and really meant it! WELL! I really let him have it then, and knocked him clear off of that bridge! Honestly, kids these days don't know right from wrong, I tell you!\nPowers:\nThis non-stop chatter...\nPhoenix:\nI-It can't be... ...Ms. Oldbag?\n???:\n...\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, you young whipper-snappers!? Do I know you!? ...Wait. YOU! You're Powers, aren't you!?\nPowers:\nY-Yeah. Um, about what happened back then...\nOldbag:\nYou didn't even get nominated this year, did you? (Changed from [You didn't get nominated last year either, did you?] in the original release) Oh, that's right. You're doing that children's exercise program, trying to play nice.\nPowers:\nAh, yeah, that's me. Thankfully I still have a job...\nOldbag:\nI love that show, and you're a hoot! You're the \"big brother\" character, right? Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You're that giant rabbit! (Changed from [Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You ended up with a rabbit face.] in the original release) What a work of art, but that's how it is, you know? I mean, if you didn't wear the mask, who knows how many TVs you'd break? Really, and shame on those kids exercising around you. They're getting what they deserve. This is why I thought you shouldn't be anywhere...\nPhoenix:\nUm... What are you doing here?\nOldbag:\nLook at my uniform and tell me you can't tell I'm a member of security!\nMaya:\nBut that outfit...\nOldbag:\nAnnoying, noisy brats get the blaster!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nSecond floor\nMaya:\nWow, it looks like there's a fancy restaurant on the second floor!\nPhoenix:\nYou STILL feel like eating?\nMaya:\nI mean, since we're here, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't pull the \"since we're here\" trick on me...)\nPearl:\nWhat a beautiful mansion. Do you live in this wonderful world every day, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, this is my first time in a place like this.\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to say these cameras were set up to cover the post-ceremony stage show.\nMaya:\nBut I wonder where everyone's gone, abandoning their cameras like this...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess something big must have happened...)\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage for the post-ceremony stage show.\nPowers:\nThere was supposed to be a press meeting after the show, but now...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like no one will hear what the Nickel Samurai had to confess after all.\nSeats\nMaya:\nWe're here, so we might as well take some pictures. OK, everyone, sit in a chair!\nPhoenix:\nBut we're all out of film...\nMaya:\nDon't worry about it. There's a zillion cameras over there we can borrow.\nPhoenix:\nHey, hey! You can't just go and \"borrow\" an expensive professional camera like that!\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nMaya:\nWhat incident? What did you do?\nOldbag:\nI didn't do anything, you young'un! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I plead the fifth.\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me!?\nOldbag:\nI thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.\nMaya:\nYou? A bodyguard?\nOldbag:\nFor your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles.\nMaya:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth?\nOldbag:\nBut...\nEdgeworth:\nThat sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me.\nOldbag:\nThat's what he said to me. What did I ever do to deserve that!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nWhat happened?\nMaya:\nUm... So, did something happen?\nOldbag:\nI don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those \"incidents\" happened again.\nPowers:\nA-An \"incident\"? Like a \"murder\" kind of \"incident\"?\nOldbag:\nMaybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, showers of blood are sure to follow. Bet you didn't know that! (Changed from [So wherever I go, a rain of blood will come pouring down. Bet you didn't know that!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUm, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake?\nOldbag:\nSilence, whippersnapper!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nThese eyes of mine are real pros now!\nPhoenix:\n\"Pros\"? Pros at doing what?\nOldbag:\nAt doing police work, of course! My eyes are like a hawk! And my professional eyes spot a messy incident! A messy, bloody incident! That's why I don't have time for you meddling kids and your petty little things!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\n...Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it? I don't like that devilish smile playing on your lips...\nMaya:\nLet's make like we're going to the bathroom, and check things out!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way. The police told us not go [sic] anywhere, remember?\nMaya:\nHuh!? How B-O-R-I-N-G! You're such a boring guy! You've got no motivation! No spirit!\nPearl:\nHuh? What? What's going on? Are you giving Mystic Maya trouble again, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Not you too, Pearls... Please don't stick your little nose into this one...)\nMaya:\nSo listen to this, Pearly. This one time at lawyer camp, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nO-OK! I get it! Let's go take a look.\nMaya:\nYay! I know you couldn't say no to me, Nick!\nPearl:\nThat's right. You'd walk over miles of hot coals for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That would be EVERY time we work a case together...)\nMaya:\nWell, what are we waiting for? Let's go already! You can come along too, Pearly.\nPearl:\nGoody! I get to come! I get to come!\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nThere's nothing really out of the ordinary here...\nPearl:\nAre you looking for the \"in-si-dent\" that the old lady was talking about? (Changed from [Are you looking for the 'something' that the old lady was talking about?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't look like it happened here. Well, we'd better go look somewhere else.\nMaya:\nAlright! Then, let's try...\nBellboy:\nExcuse me.\nMaya:\nAck!\nBellboy:\nAre you by chance, Ms. Maya Fey?\nMaya:\nUm, yeah... That's me.\nBellboy:\nYou have a phone call waiting for you at the front desk.\nMaya:\nA call? I wonder if it's someone from Kurain Village...\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mystic Maya?\nMaya:\nOh, nothing. You guys go on ahead and I'll be right there, OK? (Changed from [Oh, nothing. I'll just go on ahead to check it out, OK?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nOK.\nBellboy:\nRight this way, Ms. Fey.\nPearl:\nLet's go look somewhere else now, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, OK.\nPearl:\nThis is a little exciting... And a little scary...\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of.\nChandelier\nPearl:\nSo, that's called a \"shan-deh leer\", right?\nPhoenix:\nYup.\nPearl:\nWhat is that for? What does it do?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's for lighting up a room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? Can I look down now? My neck hurts...\nTables at the back\nPhoenix:\nThey haven't cleaned up all the food yet. There's a sad feeling hanging in the air now that the party is over...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nIt's a feast fit for a king!\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPearl:\nIt was the first time I ate that food. What was it called again? I think it started with \"key\". Key... Wee?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, a \"kiwi\".\nPearl:\nI don't know what to say. It's a sweet but sour fruit all in one.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nHotel Lobby\nExamine\nSecond floor\nPhoenix:\nA lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. But right now, the only thing filling this enormous room is anxiety about the murder. ...I really hope nothing else bad happens here...\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nThese cameras must belong to the press that came to cover the conference. They're all basically doing the same thing: staring at the empty stage.\nSeats\nPhoenix:\nSeats for the spectators of the post-ceremony show and the press conference. But it's too bad neither event is going to be held now.\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nPearl:\nUm, I guess you must have done something... um... \"deh-plor-ible\"...\nOldbag:\n\"Deplorable!?\" I would never do such a thing! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you!

TOLD. YOU. I get people the info they want! Which means that I've got a right to know!\nNope! Don't care who you are, pal, we're still investigating, so you can't go in!\nWhat's yer problem!? Just ya wait! It'll be all over the morning paper! \"Scruffy Detective's Secret Scandal Revealed!\" You'll see! I'll git ya back!\nPearl:\nThose two sound pretty serious...\nPhoenix:\n(That southern accent can only mean...)\nHey, Wright!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey... Lotta...\nLotta:\nCome on, do a gal a favor and tell this cop I'm just doin' my job and I've got rights...\nGumshoe:\nAh, YOU!\nPhoenix:\nAh... Detective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, help a guy out! Tell her that only the police are allowed here! This is the scene of a murder, so she should leave this to us pros...\nPearl:\nA... A murder!?\nGumshoe:\nAw, shoot! Me and my big mouth!\nLotta:\nSee! I knew it! My gut instinct told me so! I always trust my gut! A murder, it said! And that's what it is! A genuine murder!\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, wait...\nYeehaw, a murder! Of a big star, no less!\nGumshoe:\nOh, man... I'm in trouble now...\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nSo... Detective Gumshoe... A murder...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, no, that's not it. I got my facts mixed up for a second there, pal.\nPearl:\nU-Um... Mr. Nick? Is the dead person the Nickel Samurai...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Why do you ask?\nPearl:\nWell, Mystic Maya was rooting for him, so...\nGumshoe:\nIt wasn't the Nickel Samurai that got bumped. Actually, the Nickel Samurai is the one under suspicion of doing the bumping off...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nThe guy that died was this hero named the Jammin' Ninja, pal.\nPhoenix:\nThe Jammin' Ninja...\nLotta Hart\nPearl:\nUm, that woman with the big puffy hair that looks like cotton candy...\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Lotta?\nPearl:\nThat woman... She was there that time too, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat time?\nPearl:\n...When Mystic Maya did that channeling...\nPhoenix:\nOh, that time... Well, Lotta's a journalist, so that's why she was there.\nPearl:\nJer-nal-ist...\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like she was hanging around here before the murder happened.\nPhoenix:\n\"Hanging around\"...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, hiding in wait in front of the Jammin' Ninja's door, pal.\nPhoenix:\nB-But why would she...?\nGumshoe:\nShe wouldn't tell me, pal. Just said something about \"Gettin' my big scoop\"...\nPhoenix:\n(Scoop? What sort of news could she be after...?)\nThe victim (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nSo the victim was the Jammin' Ninja?\nPearl:\nMr. Jammin' Ninja...?\nGumshoe:\nHe was on a really popular rival TV show to \"The Nickel Samurai\".\nPearl:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nThe victim was the action star, Juan Corrida. He got a huge push and rode the express train to stardom. I mean, even I know who he is!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, even I recognize his face...)\nGumshoe:\nBut I heard lately that Matt Engarde's been taking the wind out of his sail. I'm telling you, pal, as far as who's popular, those two are hogging all the limelight.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess there's no space for Mr. Powers at all, huh... Poor guy...)\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde... Um... That's the Nickel Samurai, right...?\nGumshoe:\nYup. I mean, no! You've got to say it with more umph! \"The Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n...Anyway, so now that Juan Corrida's gone, that means Mr. Engarde has the whole stage to himself, wouldn't you say?\nGumshoe:\nI wouldn't bet on it, pal. We can't have that happen, you know?\nPhoenix:\n\"Can't have that happen\"? (What's that supposed to mean, I wonder...)\nArrested? (appears after presenting Matt Engarde profile)\nPhoenix:\nWh-Why was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's not something I can tell you. We just started the investigation, so we don't want any leaks.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like yet another \"Steel Samurai\" hero is in hot water...)\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick... If Mystic Maya knew about this...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know. She'd make me take this case... I know...\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI was really shocked by what happened to her in that one case. I didn't know she had such an awesome power!\nPearl:\nAwesome power...?\nGumshoe:\nI thought maybe I should do some self-improvement and take up a hobby. So I went out and bought some Morning Glory seeds and planted them, pal.\nPhoenix:\n...That's a good way to improve yourself.\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. Well, it's nothing really...\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nThat girl is number three on my \"People I've Seen A Lot Of Lately\" list.\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then who's number one...?\nGumshoe:\nAs if you need to ask. It's YOU, pal!\nPhoenix:\nA-Ah... So who's number two?\nGumshoe:\nMaya Fey. ...But it looks like she's not around this time.\nPearl:\nIt must be nice to be such good friends with each other, isn't it Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think that's the real meaning of Detective Gumshoe's list...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nI look good! I think I've lost some weight, pal!\nPhoenix:\nIt's only wishful thinking.\nGumshoe:\nWishful thinking, huh? ... In that case, I wishfully think I've lost some weight!\nPhoenix:\n(I wishfully think he might face the facts one day...)\nGumshoe:\nLately, I've been on the instant noodles only diet, pal!\nJuan Corrida profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm not a real fan of action shows or anything... But I know who Juan Corrida and Matt Engarde are.\nPhoenix:\nYou can't talk about one without talking about the other, I guess.\nGumshoe:\nThey even debuted around the same time. So they have this real fiery rivalry with each other. Kinda like you and me, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(I never knew he thought of me as a rival...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nThe Nickel Samurai! He really took the Grand Prix tonight!\nPhoenix:\nMaya's a big fan of his.\nGumshoe:\nReally? ...Oh, I'm sorry then.\nPearl:\nWhy are you sorry?\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde was just arrested, pal. ...On suspicion of murdering Juan Corrida.\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nAny evidence\nPhoenix:\nWould you take a look at this for me?\nGumshoe:\nListen, pal... I'm not leaking any info about the evidence to you this time. If I do, my salary's really gonna get it... And then I won't even be able to get those instant noodles down at the discount market!\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nDo you know this person?\nGumshoe:\nYou meet a lot of people as a detective, pal. So we make extra sure to not forget people because that's our job. ...Now, having said that, I don't remember ever seeing this person before.\nPearl:\nWhich means that you're kind of forgetful, aren't you Mr. Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThat's not what it means... Not exactly anyway...\nAfter clearing \"The victim\" and \"Arrested?\" Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Hallway:\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPowers:\nHey! So what's going on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Juan Corrida has been killed.\nPowers:\nWh-Wh-What!? Juan is... He's...!?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde.\nPowers:\nY-You're joking, right!?\nPhoenix:\nNope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja.\nPowers:\nOoogh... Not again... I feel sick.\nPearl:\n\"Again\"...?\nPhoenix:\n...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls.\nPowers:\nI still can't believe... No way... No way Matt would...\nPhoenix:\n(...? What's Mr. Powers got in his hand...?)\nPowers:\n...Oh, before I forget... This... This is for you, Mr. Wright. I got this from the bellboy that came by earlier.\nRadio Transceiver received from Mr. Powers.\nPhoenix:\n...For me...? But why?\nPowers:\nI don't know. All he said was it was for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney.\nTalk\nMatt and Juan\nPowers:\nMatt is the most energetic and active actor out there right now. The Nickel Samurai really sealed his place as a pop idol, but... he kept adding fuel to the fire of his rivalry with Juan anyway.\nPearl:\nMr. Juan... He's the Jammin' Ninja, right?\nPowers:\nThose two would butt heads over everything they could think of. But I'd say that Matt was the one who almost always came out on top.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess some people only know how to relate to others by butting heads like a ram...)\nPowers:\nJuan said that he'd take Matt on this time too, so he joined a rival TV show.\nPearl:\nAnd that was \"The Jammin' Ninja\"...?\nPowers:\nThe stylish Nickel Samurai and the burning Jammin' Ninja... Well, things turned messy real fast with those two using their shows for their \"war\". And the final tally... Look around... It's pretty obvious how things ended up.\nPhoenix:\n(Matt even won the Grand Prix this year... The final win over his rival, I guess...)\nPress conference\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde was going to hold a press conference, wasn't he?\nPowers:\nThat's what I heard. Though if you wanted to get technical about it, it was the Nickel Samurai's conference.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai's...?\nPowers:\nYeah. He was supposed to wear his costume and give the press conference that way.\nPhoenix:\nHe was going to be in costume...? But why? (Changed from [So he was supposed to be in-costume...? But why?] in the original release)\nPowers:\nI'm not sure... They don't keep me in the loop anymore.\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nPowers:\nIt was almost right after you guys left. An old man who's a bellboy at this hotel showed up.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when he told you to give this to me...?\nPowers:\nYeah...\nPhoenix:\n(Why... Why give me this transceiver...?)\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nHey, where did Maya go off to?\nPhoenix:\nShe got a phone call.\nPowers:\nOh yeah, that's right. She was heading for the front desk just now. She sure stands out in a crowd, doesn't she?\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, then they're all shocked because they figure out who I am...\nPearl:\nI think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Mr. Powers is getting teary eyed.)\nJuan Corrida profile\nPowers:\nHe debuted around the same time as Matt in everything, you know.\nPearl:\nReally?\nPowers:\nYeah, it started out small... First it was singing contests, then swimming competitions... Then it was bowling tournaments, and then it was who could throw the best New Year's parties... Juan was always trying to one-up Matt. But lately, those two were escalating to more and more dangerous things... I thought that no good would come of it all, so I began to worry.\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad Juan's story ended so soon...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nPowers:\nMatt's younger than me, but you can practically see his star potential.\nPearl:\nHis star po-ten-shial...?\nPowers:\nI got his autograph the other day.\nPhoenix:\n...Feels kind of wrong now, doesn't it?\nPowers:\nI don't care what people say! Matt didn't kill Juan! I know he didn't!\nAny other profile\nPowers:\nUmm... I'm honored you're asking me, But I have no idea who this person is. Umm... Sorry...\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPearl:\nUm... I was just wondering... Where's Mystic Maya? She's been gone a long time.\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, she was only going to answer a phone call...)\nPearl:\nMaybe she got lost. I'll take a quick look around for her.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nPearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I... I'm not sure... (It's coming from this transceiver...) (Changed from [Did this transceiver just...?] in the original release)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, hello? Wright here...\n???:\nIs this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney?\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are...!?\n???:\nYou don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMaya:\nHeeelp! Niiiiick!\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\nMaya...?\n???:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Wouldn't you agree that the more important issue is the fate of the girl?\nPhoenix:\n(Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?) Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?\n???:\nCome now. Don't fall apart on me yet.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This... No! This can't be!)\n???:\nNow that I have your attention, Mr. Attorney, I have a modest proposal for you. If you do what I require, then I will return to you your valuable \"item\" unharmed. ...What is this called again in your fancy lawyer terms?\nPhoenix:\n...\"Kidnapping for ransom\"...\n???:\nYes, that's it. This is a kidnapping.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nPhoenix:\n(M-My sight... Everything's fading away... Maya... Maya... Maya's been kidnapped!)\n???:\n...--re you there? Mr. Attorney, are you there? (Changed from [You there? Mr. Wright, are you there?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nH-How much!? How much do you want!?\n???:\nVery good, Mr. Attorney. I'm glad you have such a good grasp of the situation.\nPhoenix:\nHurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya--\n???:\nMoney is not what I seek.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\n???:\nWhat I want is a certain verdict. I would like a complete acquittal.\nPhoenix:\nComplete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!?\n???:\nI am not the person you will be representing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\n???:\nYou are currently at the Gatewater Hotel, are you not? And I know that a murder has just taken place there.\nPhoenix:\nJuan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde...\n???:\nYou are, as expected, quite on top of things, Mr. Attorney. Now then. What I want is very simple. I want you to obtain a complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nM-Matt Engarde? But why?\n???:\nHe did not kill anyone. I can attest to that. However...\nPhoenix:\nH-However!? However what!?\n???:\nHowever, someone is framing him for the murder. A very smart someone who is setting him up to take the fall...\nPhoenix:\n... (If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?)\n???:\nYou are, of course, at liberty to take me at my word or not. (Changed from [You are, of course, at liberty to believe me or not.] in the original release) However, there is one thing you can take as fact. Right now, your very precious \"item\" is with me, in my possession.\nMaya:\nMmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\n???:\nYou have two days. Of course, tonight, he will be in questioning with the police. But the trial is in two days. At that trial, you will win a not guilty verdict. Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nO-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!?\n???:\nYes, exactly. I don't believe I was wrong in choosing you, so don't let me down.\nPhoenix:\nAagh!\n???:\nOh, yes, that's right. Now that I am playing the role of the kidnapper, I can't pass up this chance to say, \"And don't even think about callin' the cops!\" ...Hmm, not great, but you get the idea.\nPhoenix:\nD-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!?\n???:\nAlright, I'll tell you that much. My name is... ...De Killer.\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Wh-Where is Mystic Maya!?\nPhoenix:\n...She's been kidnapped.\nPearl:\nN-No... ... It's all my fault! If only I had gone with Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault, Pearls.\nPearl:\nBut it is! It is! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nPowers:\nMr. Wright... I think we... I think we should tell the police what it's [sic] going on...!\nPhoenix:\n(No! We can't do that! If we do, who knows what will happen to Maya...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What about the detective we saw earlier...?\nPhoenix:\n(...Detective Gumshoe!) Yes, that's it! Wait here, and I'll be right back!\nPowers:\nAlright! I'll take care of Pearl while you're away!\nHallway\nGumshoe:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANSOM!?\nPhoenix:\nShhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nGumshoe:\nWait, the deal is \"complete acquittal\" in exchange for Maya, you mean...? Then this means Matt Engarde is obviously the killer, pal! No doubt about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent...\nGumshoe:\nYou really believe what a KIDNAPPER tells you, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd on top of everything else, there's all this evidence we keep finding.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nThe forensics team's having a field day back there. (Changed from [The guys with the eagle eyes are really lapping it up like they just caught a huge fish.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nGumshoe:\nBut it's strange. There's so much evidence that it feels like something's wrong.\nPhoenix:\nThere's too much evidence? Is that possible? (Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being \"set-up\"...?)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, looks like you won't be leaving here tonight, pal. Just sit tight and cooperate with the investigation. Tomorrow you can start yours.\nPhoenix:\n...A-Alright... (Isn't there another way...?)\nGumshoe:\nWe've also got to be careful about pushing the kidnapper the wrong way.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right...\nDate:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0???\nMaya:\nNnngh... Oww, my head... (Wh-Where... Where am I!? I wonder if I'm still in that hotel... Wh-What happened to me...?) Nick... Pearly! ... (Come on, you guys. This isn't funny anymore...)\n...*ka-click*...\n???:\nI see you have awoken.\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you!?\n???:\nMe? ...I am known as \"De Killer\".\nMaya:\n\"D-De Killer\"!? You mean like an \"ASSASSIN\"!? (I... I'm too young to die!)\n???:\nDon't worry. You are not my target. ...For now anyway.\nMaya:\nA-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nick! Nick! Where are you!? ...Help me...\n???:\nYes, that's right. Only one person can save you now, and that is Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\n...Huh? Wh-What? Nick... Nick's going to save me...?\n???:\nCalm down and be a good girl. Think of this as a business transaction.\nMaya:\nA... A business transaction?\n???:\nI am going to contact him now. I hope you'll cooperate and play your assigned role well.\nMaya:\n...Nick... What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearly... (Changed from [What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearls...] in the original release) ...Sis...\n???:\n... Is this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney? ... You don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMarch 21, 8:11 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPearl:\nGood morning!\nPhoenix:\nAh, morning, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mr. Nick! Come on! Let's hurry and go see Mr. Engarde!\nPhoenix:\nWe have to wait a bit, Pearls. Visiting hours don't start until 9 AM, so...\nPearl:\nOh, I see. Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I had gone with you... (Changed from [Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I went with you that time...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls... She's been like this since last night... We managed to get home somehow, yesterday evening... Thanks to Detective Gumshoe gently holding her by the hand and leading her here... But by the looks of it, I don't think Pearls got any sleep at all last night.)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mystic Maya... She's alright, right!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she's alright. Either way, I'm going to save her. You can trust me on that.\nPearl:\nPlease... Please... Help her...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm only able to stay this calm and collected... Because Pearls is doing the crying for the both of us...)\nExamine\nAnywhere\nPhoenix:\n...No matter where I look in this familiar space I call my office... No, I can't let my mind wander now! I don't have the time! I've got to get going on this case!\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPearl:\nUm... I have a thought...\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nPearl:\nYou're going to represent Mr. Engarde... aren't you?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I don't really seem to have a choice.\nPearl:\nUm, but what if... What if he... ...is the real murderer? What would you do then, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWould you fight to get a not guilty for a murderer to save Mystic Maya...?\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Let's talk to Mr. Engarde first, OK? ...We can think all the bad things we want, but it doesn't change a thing.\nPearl:\nY-Yeah, you're right... I'm sorry. I... I can't stop thinking about it...\nMaya's situation\nPhoenix:\nPearls... You're really worried about Maya, aren't you?\nPearl:\nI... I don't have anyone else left in this world.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean...?\nPearl:\nMy family's all gone...\nPhoenix:\n(...Her family...)\nPearl:\nMy father... He left my mother and the village behind and went away.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry...\nPearl:\nAnd... my mother... She did that thing... all for me...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nMystic Maya... She's like a sister to me... ... She is all I have left in this world...\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nPearls...?\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(She looks out of it... Maybe I should leave her alone...)\nMarch 21, 8:57 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(We couldn't wait for visiting hours to start, so Pearls and I came down here early... To visit one Nickel Samurai, charged with the murder of the Jammin' Ninja...)\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nG-Good morning. How are you today?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI know this situation might be a little tough for you...\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... We're...\nEngarde:\nOh, sorry dude...\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nI already signed up...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me...?\nEngarde:\nI already have life insurance. I signed up a long time ago cause my job is, you know...\nPhoenix:\n... Oh! No no no... We're not insurance salespeople!\nEngarde:\nReally...? Dude, I really don't need that right now either.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nFire extinguishers. I mean, this building isn't my house, so...\nPhoenix:\n... No no no... We're not here to sell you fire extinguishers either! I'm a lawyer. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nEngarde:\nA lawyer...? ... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my manager, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nThe Nickel Samurai sure is a strange person, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(I think \"strange\" is an understatement.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. You're just in time.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\nEngarde:\nYou're a lawyer dude, right? My manager's looking for a good one right now, so how about it?\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! This is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to make him let me take his case! I have to!)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera. Mr. Engarde keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nSorry to intrude, but I would like to ask you a few personal questions.\nEngarde:\nUm, that's OK, but dude, my autobiography's coming out soon, so... If I say stuff without the publisher's approval, then I'm gonna be in real hot water... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my publisher, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde is so lucky! He has so many people he can talk to.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... I don't know if he actually has anyone he can really talk to...)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. Like I thought, the publisher said it'd be \"real bad\" if I said anything, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(Does he have a mind of his own!?)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, I would like to ask you about the murder...\nEngarde:\nOh, are you covering this for a tabloid as a side job, dude? Um, um... Well, if you want my statement on this, you should ask through my staff...\nPhoenix:\nNo no no... I'm not asking on behalf of a tabloid...\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the president of the studio, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nIs he alright, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(If we're talking about Mr. Engarde's brain here, I wouldn't put my money on it.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. The studio president said, \"Even Neo Mt. Fuji itself knows that I'm not the murderer!\"\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? What's \"Neo Mt. Fuji\"...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a mountain in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo; the city the Nickel Samurai protects.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, this is an attorney's badge.\nEngarde:\nDude, I'm sorry, but I don't have the free time to be looking at things like that.\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nEngarde:\nI'm much too busy with Nickel Samurai stuff right now.\nEngarde:\nI don't have the time to take a lawyer's correspondence course...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does he believe I'm a salesman!? Insurance, then extinguishers... Now this!!)\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\n...? What's that?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a ticket for the press conference. You were going to give one after winning the Grand Prix, right?\nEngarde:\nHuh? Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. While you were in costume, no less. ([in costume] hyphenated in the original release)\nEngarde:\nUm, I never heard anything like that, dude. I only heard about the stage show. I always leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't know...? That's odd...)\nRadio Transceiver\nPearl:\n...Mr. Nick? What are you going to do with that?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know yet, but I figured I could at least show it to him...\nEngarde:\nIs that a transceiver? Hey, it looks like a real nice one, too.\nPhoenix:\nI got it as a \"present\" from someone.\nEngarde:\nHmm? Interesting.\nPhoenix:\nI've also been instructed to take your case.\nEngarde:\nIs that what you heard from the transceiver?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nEngarde:\nDude, that's terrible! Don't let some disembodied voice boss you around!\nPhoenix:\n(This coming from a man with a cell phone on his wrist...)\nWill Powers profile\nEngarde:\nI've seen him somewhere before... Is he a member of my fan club?\nPhoenix:\nThat's Mr. Powers. Isn't he supposed to be kind of like a mentor to you?\nEngarde:\nPowers...? Oh yeah! He's the guy on that kid's exercise program. I gave him an autograph just the other day.\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't see Mr. Powers as a mentor at all...)\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nMan, it's too bad he's dead...\nPhoenix:\nYou killed him... That's the most logical conclusion, don't you agree?\nEngarde:\nDude, what are you talking about!? You're making a huge mistake.\nPhoenix:\nIf that's such a mistake, then why did they issue an arrest warrant for you!?\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the guy in charge of this place, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nStars sure know a lot of people, don't they?\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that phone even really gets reception in here...)\nEngarde:\n...Um, I guess you're right about the warrant after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we might be making some progress here!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nEngarde:\nYeah... I'm such a handsome devil.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um, yeah...\nEngarde:\nAnd I'm way good at sports! Karate, tennis, judo, soccer, football, hockey, fencing... Dude, it's no wonder I'm so popular.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um, yeah... (You're also good at sitting in a jail cell, Mr. Popular.)\nAny other evidence\nEngarde:\nDude, I know I like to throw money around, but it's not like I buy anything and everything.\nPhoenix:\n(That's nice, because it's not up for sale anyway!)\nAny other profile\nEngarde:\nUm, dude, this person looks like a member of my fan club. Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the fan club president, OK? ... ...\nPhoenix:\nUm, \"dude\", you know what...? Forget I asked...\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Press Conference Ticket and Radio Transceiver:\nEngarde:\n... ...Well, dude, I think it's about time for me to get going.\nPhoenix:\nPlease, wait! ...I really need to take your case!\nEngarde:\nThere's always other people in need of a lawyer, right? Want me to introduce you to a few?\nPearl:\nPlease! Please let Mr. Nick represent you!\nEngarde:\nMan, oh man. Lawyers these days. Now you dudes use kids to pull in clients, too?\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't take me as your lawyer, then De Killer is going to...!\nEngarde:\n... Wait... What did you just say?\nPhoenix:\n\"De Killer\"...\nEngarde:\nD-De Killer!?\nPhoenix:\n(...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...)\nEngarde:\n... Alright, dude. I accept your terms.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEngarde:\nI'll let you represent me in court.\nPearl:\nW-We did it! We did it, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...)\nEngarde:\nGo ahead, ask me anything. I'll help out as much as I can...\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nEngarde:\nMan, I thank my lucky stars that people know my name.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're quite the hero, and you're in the national spotlight.\nPearl:\nI didn't know who he is... Does that mean I'm not a good citizen...?\nEngarde:\nAh, it's really great to be the Nickel Samurai. Dude, lately, I just keep on getting more and more popular.\nPhoenix:\n(True enough... \"The Nickel Samurai\" is very popular among high schoolers and secretaries right now. I guess Mr. Engarde has a way of catching the eyes of women...)\nEngarde:\nDo you know my motto? \"Refreshing like a spring breeze.\" That's what I am.\nPearl:\nA spring breeze...\nEngarde:\nThat's why this kind of scandal is disastrous, dude. I mean, even if I get out of here tomorrow, it's still gonna look bad.\nPhoenix:\n(But everyone loves a good scandal...) (Changed from [Everyone loves a good scandal...] in the original release)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me about your activities last night?\nEngarde:\nAfter I got the award, I took a break and went back to my room. I had that post-ceremony stage show to do. So I was in my Nickel Samurai costume.\nPhoenix:\nAnd you were alone the entire time?\nEngarde:\nMy manager was running around being busy, so yeah.\nPhoenix:\nBecause of the press conference you were supposed to have after the show?\nEngarde:\nI told you, dude. I have no idea about any press conference, alright?\nPhoenix:\n(That's strange... I thought the Nickel Samurai was going to confess something...)\nEngarde:\nAnyway, when I was leaving my room, that's when I noticed it was kinda noisy...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida was already dead at that time...?\nEngarde:\nYeah, that's what I gathered anyway from my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm beginning to gather that this guy can't do a thing on his own...) (Changed from [With the way he's always talking about his manager, it's as if she runs his life.] in the original release)\nEngarde:\nAnd that's when the detective in the green coat showed up. He searched me... And then, out of the blue, the dude arrested me.\nThe victim (appears after \"Matt Engarde\")\nPhoenix:\nAbout you and the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida, what sort of...\nEngarde:\nThat's got nothing to do with anything, dude. Man, with that face of his, you can't even tell he's the same age as me. And he wanted to try making a \"Jammin' Ninja\" movie, even though we all know it'd fail.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai still won in the end, right?\nEngarde:\nYeah. I took the Grand Prix by storm. So why would I, the winner, have any reason to kill the guy anyway? Dude, you'd think it'd be the other way around, you know?\nThe charge of murder (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know why you were arrested?\nEngarde:\nI guess maybe my full body search went badly.\nPhoenix:\nDid they find something on you?\nEngarde:\nThey found a button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nPhoenix:\nA button...?\nEngarde:\nI don't get it either. It was caught in the pleats of my samurai pants, or \"hakama\".\nPearl:\nAaah!\nEngarde:\nDude, I really think someone planted it there though. I'm serious.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that's what really happened...?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nPearl:\nLet's ask one last thing. Let's test Mr. Engarde to see if he really is innocent or not...\nPhoenix:\nW-We can do that...?\nPearl:\nYes. If you use this...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's Magatama!)\nPearl:\nHe won't be able to hide any secrets from you, Mr. Nick. I'm sure of it.\nPhoenix:\n(I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly.\nEngarde:\nWhat is it, dude?\nPhoenix:\nDid you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nPlease put the phone away and answer this question yourself.\nEngarde:\nAlright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWell, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nNothing. Not a chain or lock in sight.\nPearl:\nWhich means... I think it is alright to trust him.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.)\nEngarde:\nUm... The trial's tomorrow, right? I'm counting on you, dude.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 21, 11:34 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWell, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important...\nPearl:\nSo! So now what should we do!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer.\nPearl:\nOK! Then let's start looking!\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Actually, the crime happened at the recently completed hotel in the center of town, the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. ...Just how far are they going to expand their empire...?\nCharley the plant\nPearl:\nOh! I'll water it!\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK... I already did that...\nPearl:\n...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...)\nPoster\nPearl:\nThis is the Nickel Samurai... right?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's right.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!?\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.\nPearl:\nOh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either...\nPhoenix:\nI-It's OK, Pearls. Really.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh! I cleaned it up some more for you last night! ...Because I couldn't sleep...\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSince there were no Psyche-Locks, then that means we can trust Mr. Engarde to be innocent.\nPearl:\nI really feel much better knowing that. Ever since last night, I was so worried that I kept wondering... \"What if he is the real killer...? What then...?\"\nAny ideas\nPhoenix:\nHey, I have something I want to ask you, Pearls.\nPearl:\nOK, what is it?\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you so interested in how Maya and I get along? I mean, she and I don't have anything special go--\nPearl:\nHuh!? Wh-What do you mean!? B-But I thought... I thought you and Mystic Maya were... I-I've been mistaken all this time!? No way...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aaaah! She really wasn't kidding! Pearls actually believes Maya and I are... ...Maybe I should've just left it alone...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Stop it! Don't hide your true feelings from me!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! She slapped me!!)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPearl:\nThat's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nI guess?\nPearl:\nI feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...)\nMaya Fey profile\nPearl:\nOh, Mystic Maya... I wonder if you're alright...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure she's OK. We have to be patient for just one more day. I'm sure we can save her. Trust me.\nPearl:\nIf there's anything I can do, please tell me, OK!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPearl:\nTo tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me.\nPhoenix:\nI think your hair now suits you perfectly.\nPearl:\nR-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget*\nPhoenix:\n*fidget, fidget*\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPearl:\nI'm sure that Mr. Detective would be our ally if we asked!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I think so too. (Looking back, we've known each other for a while now... He's always been trustworthy... A bit \"off\", but still trustworthy. What a paradox.)\nWill Powers profile\nPearl:\nHe's a really kind and nice old man, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is really perceptive when it comes to people... But what does she mean by \"old man\"...?) Hey, Pearls? What about me...?\nPearl:\nWhat about you, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, I don't think I want to hear this...)\nAnything else\nPearl:\nUm, there are still so many things in this world that I don't understand yet. ...Honestly, I still don't have enough training.\nPhoenix:\nAh, no, it's OK. I don't have any ideas myself...\nPearl:\nI'm sorry. I'm really sorry!\nMarch 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEngarde:\nAh, the lawyer dude. So what did you find out?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... I'm still in the middle of investigating...\nEngarde:\nI see. ...But I've already told you everything I know, dude.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\nDude, like I told you, I don't know anything about that press conference. I leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(...This is harder than pulling bass from a river...)\nRadio Transceiver\nEngarde:\nSo, why are you carrying around that transceiver...?\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about it.\nEngarde:\nAnd why do you do everything it tells you to do? You know, the messages it sends you, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, he probably doesn't have anything to do with Maya's kidnapping.) ...That's a secret.\nEngarde:\nOK, whatever, dude.\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nLook, dude, I didn't kill him. I mean, the Nickel Samurai kicked the Jammin' Ninja's butt, right? So it's not like I felt threatened by the likes of him.\nPearl:\nBeing rivals sounds like a sad way to relate to another person...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nOldbag:\nHey! What do you think you're doing!? You can't come in without...\nPearl:\nGood morning.\nOldbag:\nHold on, it's YOU! What is going on around here!?\nPhoenix:\nU-Uh... Um...\nOldbag:\nI heard poor Juan was killed. Is that true!? It's a bad rerun is what this is. Another \"Steel Samurai\" doing the most evil of deeds.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you know... That's not entirely...\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know that I was a huge fan of Juan's! Why, oh why, do all the stars I'm interested in drop one by one like flies!? It's always been that way! Ever since I was a little girl in elementary school! The class hamster was fine until it was my turn to clean its cage, and then it died! The other kids started calling me the \"Queen Reaper\". I swear that's what they dubbed me! \"Whoever you name in your evil spell dies within three minutes,\" they would taunt.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened...\nOldbag:\nHmph! Don't push me, boy!\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? I... Um... I couldn't hear everything she said... because she was talking too fast...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...?\nOldbag:\nDon't boss me around, you spiky-haired, smarty-pants!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but...\nPearl:\n...Even Mr. Engarde himself didn't seem to know, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(How does the person who's supposed to give a conference not know about it...?)\nTalk\nThe victim\nOldbag:\nMy dear Hammer died a year ago in that dreadful murder. And only recently did I finally find a star that makes this heart go *badump* again.\nPhoenix:\n...I don't know what to say...\nOldbag:\nI ask you, why does every star I cheer for always ends [sic] up kicking the bucket?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nI'd watch your words! No one's going to get away with saying anything bad about my Juan!\nPhoenix:\nBut I haven't said anything...\nOldbag:\nWell, I don't believe a word that woman says anyway!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What woman?\nOldbag:\nThat irritating, backwater girl with the afro and the horrible country accent. I mean, what is that manner of speaking supposed to be? And why does she never stop? Honestly, women these days. They don't know the meaning of the word \"modesty\". When I was a young maiden, I was so beautiful even the flowers of the field blushed. But despite this, I pressed flowers, or read the stars, or wrote beautiful love poems or\nPhoenix:\n...Pearls? Are you thirsty?\nPearl:\nUm, a little.\nPhoenix:\nOK. I'll go get you some juice or something.\nPearl:\nTh-Thank you very much.\nOldbag:\nHey! Are you paying attention!? Young'uns today!\nPhoenix:\n(So I'm guessing Ms. Oldbag heard everything from Lotta...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nI want to ask you about what happened around the time of the murder...\nOldbag:\nAh, I don't know anything about that. I was here getting ready.\nPhoenix:\nGetting ready? For what...?\nOldbag:\nThe show, of course! ...Well, and the press conference afterwards.\nPhoenix:\n(Cue mysterious music for the magical press conference.)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I don't know anything about the murder.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see...\nOldbag:\n... But.\nPhoenix:\n?\nOldbag:\nBut if you're talking about what I saw, that's different. I saw it very clearly!\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nOldbag:\nI saw the most important moment of the night!\nWhat you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nTh-The most important moment!? You don't mean...!?\nOldbag:\nOh, so now you treat me with respect, you disrespectful child. When you speak to your elders, you should always be polite. Really, kids today.\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see!?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nOldbag:\nThe murder last night was gruesome, wasn't it? But then, what murder isn't?\nPhoenix:\n(Please don't stray onto another tangent... Please...)\nOldbag:\nIf you want to hear more, then show your respect and bring this lady a present!\nWhat you witnessed (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see on the night of the murder!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPearl:\nP-Please! Mystic Maya's life is...\nOldbag:\nAh, but you haven't given me my present yet. ...Hmm... Let's see... I'll only tell it to you if you can bring me Juan's autograph!\nPhoenix:\n(What an unreasonable request... You might as well have asked for the moon!)\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nI don't have anything to say to delinquents like you!\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr... She's clamming up like the old clam she is...)\nPearl:\nPlease! Anything would be helpful!\nOldbag:\nWell then, how about I tell you my measurements?\nPhoenix:\n...Um... No, that's okay... Really.\nPearl:\nShe really doesn't like you, does she Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI know, I know...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like the investigation is still in full swing. The hotel staff and the police are running around like a bunch of headless chickens.\nPearl:\nI wonder if we can do any investigating of our own in this kind of atmosphere...\nPhoenix:\n...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess.\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of, only to disappear... ...If only we had all gone together...\nChandelier\nPearl:\nThat is such a beautiful sight.\nPhoenix:\nThe chandelier?\nPearl:\nYes. But I can't believe it... I can't believe that such a terrible murder happened under such beautiful lights... It's shocking.\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was held on that stage just last night. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nWe ate at this table last night, didn't we?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nPearl:\nI was really happy then.\nPhoenix:\n(I wish I could make you smile again... Even for a second...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHallway\nLotta:\nHey! Yer here! Been waitin' for ya, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nLotta...\nLotta:\nHey! Mr. Cop fella! The thief's showed his face!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!?\nLotta:\nArrest him! Put him on trial! Find him guilty! Give him the death penalty!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong, Lotta!? Are you feeling alright?\nLotta:\nLooked here and there and up and down the mountain, but it ain't here! So why don'tcha just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep! (Changed from [So why don't ya just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep!] in the original release)\nPearl:\nUm, what are you looking for...?\nLotta:\nMy CAMERA! C-A-M-E-R-A! It's my life blood! I'm gonna die without my $700 camera!!\nPhoenix:\nY-Your camera...?\nLotta:\nLook, don't lots of people say the criminal always goes back to the scene of the crime!? And lookie lookie, here ya are!\nPhoenix:\nYep. Here I am... Faced with a Lotta trouble.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...?\nLotta:\nI didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nLotta:\nYeah, that's what I thought too, so I was a nice enough gal to lend a helpin' hand! ...Secretly, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(I have a feeling one of these days, I'm going to end up defending her in court...)\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\".\nLotta:\nSo that's the scene of the murder, I reckon. I thought somethin' had gone on that night, but I didn't never think it was murder.\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\".\nPearl:\nSo Mr. Engarde was here during his break, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what he claims. (Hmm... The crime scene... If he had wanted to get to Mr. Corrida's room... He would have had to pass through this hallway.)\nTalk\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!\nPearl:\nHuh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?\nLotta:\nI had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon. I made this itty-bitty scratch on it and the manager got all huffed up in the face... He gave me his talkin' to and was real mean about it too. He done made me cry at that!\nPearl:\nWhen did you lose your camera?\nLotta:\nLast night, after the murder happened. Musta been when I was busy runnin' around lookin' into things! That's when I lost sight of my dear, darlin' expensive sweetie!\nPhoenix:\nLotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours?\nLotta:\nI don't rightly know. I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?)\nLotta's Camera added to the Court Record.\nCamera (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!\nPearl:\nHuh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?\nLotta:\nI had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon.

I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nLotta, please tell me what you know about what happened at the time of the murder.\nLotta:\nWell, from before the ceremony last night, I was hangin' around here in this area. Yeah, actually I was here until around the time Mr. Engarde was arrested.\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you doing here...?\nLotta:\nYou sure you went to school, City Boy? Wherever Lotta Hart goes, there's a story to be found! A big scoop to be had!\nPhoenix:\nA big scoop...?\nLotta:\nI told ya before. I'm gonna be the best tabloid photographer the world's ever seen! Reckon course that means I'm always lookin' for the perfect shot!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what \"scoop\" she was after this time...?)\nLotta:\nAlthough, I was also on the look out for the other stars that were here, so... maybe I wasn't here the entire time...\nBig scoop (appears after \"Camera\" and \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nLotta... Are you sure you weren't here the entire time? So you could take a picture for your big scoop?\nLotta:\nWell... Maybe I was. But that's what real journalists do! I got some juicy inside info, so I thought to myself, why not get a picture for proof?\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of story was it that you would hang around here...?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nOops, sorry, Mr. Lawyer. Can't be tellin' you that. Trade secret, ya know?\nPhoenix:\n(Not again... Why does everyone have something to hide...?)\nPearl:\nWe've been stopped, haven't we?\nLotta:\nHa ha, yeah! Take that, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here is happy... Ms. Lotta and your \"I rule!\" smile...)\nBig scoop (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou were on the hunt for your big scoop last night?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nIt's just a bunch of tabloid photos. They ain't got nothing to do with the murder.\nPearl:\nIt looks like we have no choice but to remove the Psyche-Locks.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I guess so.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nLotta:\nHey, what's that? ...A press conference ticket? How come I ain't got myself one of them!?\nPhoenix:\nP-Please don't direct your anger at me...\nLotta:\nWhy in tarnations wasn't I invited to that!? How come someone on the bottom of the popularity chart like you got the info, but not me!? Info like that is worth nothin' to ya, am I right or what!?\nPhoenix:\n(...Is that the kind of person she thinks I am...?)\nPearl:\nAre you going to stand there and take that, Mr. Nick!?\nLotta's Camera\nLotta:\nNngh... And I just bought that camera... Who did it!? The thievin' rascal!\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't look straight at me while you're saying that...\nLotta:\nWhen I find the bugger who went and done this, they're gonna pay with a bullet!\nPhoenix:\n(And if you do that, don't expect me to defend you...)\nMaya Fey profile\nLotta:\nNow that I think about it, she isn't with y'all today, is she...?\nPearl:\nUm...\nLotta:\nShe's a spunky one! You shouldn't have been lettin' her outta yer sight. Who knows what she's up to now...\nPhoenix:\n(Like you're one to talk...)\nPearl:\n...\nPearl Fey profile\nLotta:\nAh, just wanna say sorry to ya.\nPearl:\nFor...?\nLotta:\nWell, I really, absolutely thought you were the murderer.\nPearl:\n...Huh?\nLotta:\nYou know... Last time, that thing with Maya Fey...\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!? But why!?\nLotta:\nI mean, you were all worked up, ya know?\nPearl:\n*sniffle* ...Meanie...\nPhoenix:\nLotta, that was very insensitive of you!\nLotta Hart profile\nLotta:\nThis kind of hairstyle is pretty hard to get, ya know. Hard to care for too. Just the other day, I ran my hand through my hair to fix it up, and suddenly, out pops this dollar coin! That's gotta be like hittin' the jackpot!\nPearl:\nWow, that's really lucky!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* What a deep conversation that was...)\nJuan Corrida or Matt Engarde profile\nLotta:\nI don't really care for 'em \"heroes\" or whatnot.\nPearl:\nOh, I see...\nLotta:\nAnd shows they got for kids, those adventures are just plain ol' borin'! Now, adults. We get more caught up in messy, sticky, real situations! ...Even me...\nPearl:\nO-Oh...\nLotta:\nSounds like the tyke's gettin' what I'm goin' with this!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a sec here! Don't go around getting her mixed up in things like that!\nSecurity Lady profile\nLotta:\nThis old granny? Ah, she kept on glarin' at me with those eyes of hers. As if it's my fault. Kept babblin' how she won't forgive people who write \"trash\" about her Juan... ...Ah, yeah, we sorta got into a little fight, ya know...\nPhoenix:\n(A \"little\" fight? Knowing those two, it was probably more of a blabbering contest.)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know anything...\nLotta:\n...*sigh*... I've told ya how many times now? I'm a journalist. I've got so much info runnin' laps in my head I forget things here and there!\nPearl:\nPlease don't get so worked up over this...\nLotta:\nHah! I don't care if ya beg me! \"Be extra tough on kids!\" That's this gal's motto on learnin' youngsters.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nUm... Where are we?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room.\n???:\nMay I help you with something?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... We're...\n???:\nYou're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail.\nPhoenix:\nUm... How did you know I'm his lawyer...?\n???:\nYou were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer.\nPearl:\nWow...\n???:\nIt's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either.\nPearl:\nIt's really not the time to be showing off, Mr. Nick.\nAndrews:\nI am Adrian Andrews. I hate to waste time, so let's get down to business.\nPhoenix:\nA-Alright... (She may be of small stature, but appearances can be deceiving...)\nExamine\nRed suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's probably Mr. Engarde's suitcase. For someone who was only going to be here for the award show, this is a lot of stuff. Looks like he has about three days' worth of clothes in here.\nPearl:\nStars really are different from us, aren't they...?\nBedroom\nPhoenix:\nThat's the bedroom over there.\nPearl:\nThat's a bed...? Wow, they have really big beds here!\nSofa\nPhoenix:\nThere's some samurai-looking clothes on the sofa here.\nPearl:\nUm, I think that jacket looking thing is called a \"happi\".\nPhoenix:\n(Whatever it is, I'm sure something like that would make a great souvenir. Maya would be absolutely thrilled...)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nLooks like dishes left over from dinner... A dinner for two, at that.\nPearl:\nI'm sure they're Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews' plates.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they had T-bone steaks... What's with Global Studios and T-bone steaks...?\nPlate on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a giant bone sitting on the plate.\nPearl:\nI... I don't really like meat...\nPhoenix:\n(...? There's something... weird about this plate... I just wish I could put my finger on what it is...)\nTalk\nNight of the murder\nAndrews:\nI assume the first thing you need to know is what everyone was doing that night, correct?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, that is correct.\nAndrews:\nThen I will tell you. Before the award ceremony, I had dinner with Mr. Engarde. In this very room, I might add.\nPhoenix:\n\"Dinner\"? What did you eat?\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate to waste time with trifling details. If you took a look at the table yourself, you wouldn't need to ask me.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet she's a lot of fun at parties...)\nAndrews:\nWhen the award show was starting, I headed for Viola Hall.\nPhoenix:\nAnd after the show ended, you came back to this room...?\nAndrews:\nNo, I had some small errands to run. I helped with the preparations in the lobby.\nPhoenix:\nOh... (Preparations for the post-ceremony show, I guess...)\nAndrews:\nWhen it was time for the post-ceremony show, I came back to call for Mr. Engarde. After that, I went to visit Mr. Corrida...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you found his body, isn't it?\nAndrews:\n...\nPearl:\nYou really held strong through everything...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... She does seem to be mentally tough as nails...)\nRelation to Engarde\nPhoenix:\nUm, so... About you and...\nAndrews:\nStop right there. You aren't seriously about to ask how Mr. Engarde and I are related, are you? (Changed from [Don't expect me to believe you have been talking to me without knowing how we relate.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nAndrews:\nI have no idea how he could chose [sic] you as his lawyer. (Changed from [I have no idea why Mr. Engarde chose you as his lawyer.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Why did she have to go and say something like that...?)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Calm down and hang in there. I'll give you a shoulder rub to relieve your stress later, alright?\nAndrews:\nI already gave you my name earlier, but I'll add that I'm Mr. Engarde's manager.\nPhoenix:\nHis manager... Speaking of managers, did the victim, Mr. Corrida have one?\nAndrews:\nNo, he did not.\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't?\nAndrews:\nGlobal Studios has a very different policy from Worldwide Studios in that Worldwide Studios does not assign individual managers to their stars.\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nAndrews:\nThis industry is very ruthless and unforgiving. Actually, you look quite ruthless and unforgiving yourself to your poor partner. Dragging a little girl like her to places like this. Honestly.\nPearl:\nYou're wrong! I... I'm doing this to help Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Calm down and hang in there. I'll buy you a juice later, alright?\nPearl:\nNngh...\nMotive for murder (appears after presenting Juan Corrida profile)\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any ideas?\nAndrews:\nAs to...?\nPhoenix:\nAs to why Mr. Corrida was murdered?\nAndrews:\nWhy would you ask me about such a thing...?\nPhoenix:\nI'm just doing my job. So, do you have any ideas?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nSorry, but there's nothing more I have to add to this conversation.\nPearl:\nIs it a Psyche-Lock, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYes... There's getting to be more and more of these lately.\nMotive for murder (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou know something, don't you? About why Mr. Corrida was murdered...\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nAndrews:\nWhy are you asking me? Don't tell me you can see inside my heart.\nPhoenix:\n(No, but I can see the locks you have on your psyche.)\nPearl:\nIf you don't remove her locks...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it's worthless to even ask...)\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one taking care of the arrangements for this press conference, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, that's right.\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Engarde said he \"didn't know\" about it.\nAndrews:\n... Is that what he said...?\nPearl:\nHuh...?\nAndrews:\nActually, I didn't know all the details either. It was a request from the publicity department. All I did was help out and do what I was asked.\nPearl:\nOh... I see.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder about that... I wouldn't take her to be the type of person to do something without knowing the details.)\nWill Powers profile\nAndrews:\nThat's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be.\nPhoenix:\n(Urk... What a horrible thing to say...)\nAndrews:\n...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? For a second, her face twisted in pain...)\nPearl:\nI wonder if something happened to Ms. Andrews...\nJuan Corrida profile\nPhoenix:\nDid you know the victim, Mr. Corrida?\nAndrews:\nYes, I knew him. The world is such a small place, after all.\nPearl:\nDid you know about his rivalry with the Nickel Samurai?\nAndrews:\nHonestly, they were like children when it came to that. Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most trivial things. (Changed from [Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most uninteresting things.] in the original release) ... If either one of them wasn't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die. (Changed from [If either one of them weren't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n! (...I've got a hunch that this woman knows more than she's letting on... She must know why Juan Corrida was killed!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nAndrews:\nI asked to become Mr. Engarde's manager. He's a pleasure to manage with his nice disposition.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Mr. Engarde does seem like a rather weak-willed man; always doing as he's told...)\nPearl:\nHe's always saying, \"my manager,\" right Mr. Nick?\nAndrews:\n...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAndrews:\nI hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... (Take away that layer of sarcasm and she really does seem to hate herself...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, I'd like to ask you about this...\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Where are we...?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Juan Corrida's room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Corrida...?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim... Which makes this the crime scene, too.\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's you! So!? What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!?\nPhoenix:\nNot yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there?\nPhoenix:\n(I just want Maya to be alright...)\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nWe don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal.\nPhoenix:\nCan you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...?\nGumshoe:\nJust this once... \"Special circumstances\" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here.\nPhoenix:\nThank you.\nGumshoe:\nOh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy.\nPearl:\nWow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you!\nGumshoe:\nHa ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I got a map!\nPhoenix:\nThat's great, Pearls!\nPearl:\n... Um... But Mr. Nick, I can't read what it says...\nHotel Guidemap added to the Court Record.\nExamine\nRefrigerator\nPhoenix:\nThere are all sorts of things in this refrigerator...\nPearl:\nThe carrot juice bottle and the tomato juice bottle are both empty...\nPhoenix:\nEmpty...? (It's too much of a hassle to throw them away, I guess.) They're all vegetable juices. I guess he must've been a real health nut.\nPearl:\n...Oh! There's a beet, some ketchup, and a bottle of strawberry jam too!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe red was his favorite color...?\nStuffed bears\nPearl:\nWow, there are a lot of bears!\nPhoenix:\n(Alarm clock ones, collector's editions, stuffed teddies, plastic models... It's pretty overwhelming... Is there a kind of bear he doesn't have...?)\nPearl:\nThere's even a few in the trash can...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I get the feeling maybe the guy didn't really like bears.\nPearl:\nPoor teddies...\nIt's hard to \"bear\" with all these problems... Growl! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n... (I don't think I want to \"bear\" with the trauma the last case caused me...)\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mr. Nick?\nDesk\nPearl:\nHmph! It's so messy here!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls really likes things neat and tidy, I take it...)\nPearl:\nThere are a lot of electronic things in here that I've never seen before. Hey, Mr. Nick! Tell me what they are, pretty please?\nPhoenix:\nOK. That over there is a \"watch\". You wear it on your wrist.\nPearl:\n... I know what a watch is...\nPhoenix:\n(Oops. For a second there, I forgot I was talking with Pearls, not Maya...)\nBlue suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's a suitcase. There are so many things in it that I bet it barely closes. There's his clothes, a dryer, an electric shaver, a calculator...\nPearl:\nDo all stars pack too much stuff like Mr. Corrida?\nTable on right\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Mr. Corrida had dinner last night.\nPearl:\nThis bottle... It's tomato juice.\nPhoenix:\n(We had a lot of food at the award show last night... But I wonder if the stars had gone onstage after only eating a meager meal like this...)\nBedroom\nPearl:\nSo that's a bed, right?\nPhoenix:\nYup. It's big, but it's a bed.\nPearl:\nAaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft!\nPhoenix:\n(Big beds must be a rarity for her...)\nScattered items near guitar case\nPhoenix:\nBottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.\nPearl:\nWhat's this glass fragment from...?\nPhoenix:\nA flower vase maybe? There are flowers on the floor, but I don't know what they are.\nPearl:\nYou don't know much about flowers, do you Mr. Nick?\nGuitar case\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.\nPearl:\nThat's strange. The guitar is not here...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he forgot to bring it to the show?\nPearl:\nBut Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item...\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid...\nPearl:\nYeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nGuitar Case added to the Court Record.\nGuitar case (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.\nPearl:\nThat's strange. The guitar is not here...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he forgot to bring it to the show?\nPearl:\nBut Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item...\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid...\nPearl:\nYeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nWine glass\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nPearl:\nBut doesn't it seem weird?\nPhoenix:\n...What seems weird?\nPearl:\nI mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor.\nPhoenix:\n... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)\nPearl:\nWhy is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?\nWine Glass added to the Court Record.\nWine glass (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nPearl:\nBut doesn't it seem weird?\nPhoenix:\n...What seems weird?\nPearl:\nI mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor.\nPhoenix:\n... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)\nPearl:\nWhy is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?\nTalk\nCause of death\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what was the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nWell, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal. (Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIt should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Here's a picture.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a knife in his chest.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal, that's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was stabbed to death...)\nGumshoe:\nThey're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now.\nPhoenix:\nThere were fingerprints on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nYup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nCause of death (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what was the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nWell, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal. (Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIt should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Here's a picture.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a knife in his chest.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal, that's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was stabbed to death...)\nGumshoe:\nThey're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now.\nPhoenix:\nThere were fingerprints on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nYup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nReason for arrest\nPhoenix:\nWhy was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nBecause we had evidence on him.\nPearl:\nEvidence...?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the victim, Juan Corrida, really put up a big fight.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, one look at the crime scene and you can tell. There's signs of a struggle everywhere.\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah. During the fight, his button came off...\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde said something about a button... Something like, one of the Jammin' Ninja's buttons got caught in his \"hakama\"...)\nGumshoe:\nBut that's not all...\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nThere was a witness, pal.\nPhoenix:\nA witness!? Wh-Who is it!?\nGumshoe:\nThat lady... Ms. Oldbag.\nPhoenix:\n(Please... Anyone but her!)\nGumshoe:\nThe prosecution has plenty of evidence to make a solid case... Not to mention there's something around where the vic was that's a little off. (Changed from [Not to mention there's something at the crime scene that was a little off.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nSomething that's a little off...? As in...? (Changed from [Something that was a little off...? As in...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nAs in, that's for you to figure out, pal!\nPearl:\nAlright, let's try to figure it out, Mr. Nick!\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nGumshoe:\nThat's your \"present\" from the kidnapper, huh? While you're talking, it sends and receives radio waves... If we could trace that...\nPearl:\nYeah! We could use it to find out where the bad guy is!\nPhoenix:\n(It uses radio waves, huh?)\nGumshoe:\nI got it! I'll go find a radio scanner, and let you borrow it, pal!\nGuitar Case\nPhoenix:\nWhat can you tell me about this guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nOh, that. This is just what I heard, pal, but that's the Jammin' Ninja's signature item.\nPhoenix:\nThe guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nNo, not that! What do you take me as? I mean the guitar inside, of course!\nPearl:\nBut... The guitar is missing.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, we looked for it too. It's not normal for a person to forget to bring their most famous item to an award show.\nPhoenix:\n(It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...)\nWine Glass\nPhoenix:\nSo about this wine glass...\nGumshoe:\nAh, so you noticed it, pal. The whole crime scene was a mess, but this glass was the only thing that was untouched.\nPhoenix:\nYou noticed that too, Detective Gumshoe...?\nGumshoe:\nNo, actually Ms. von Karma noticed it first.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Pearls noticed it before me too... Hey, wait a minute. So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's here at the hotel...? (Changed from [So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's coming here...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah, she's around. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal. (Changed from [Yeah, she's coming. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal.] in the original release) Especially if she catches you in here. (Changed from [I think it'd be best if you didn't bump into her here.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou can bet the instant I see her, I'll be running the 1,000 meter dash.\nCrime Photo\nGumshoe:\nYou look at this photo and you can't help it. It makes you want to say, \"I can't believe this is the scene of a murder.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Stabbed with a knife after a struggle... A clue is sleeping in this photo somewhere... I know it.)\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm sorry.\nPhoenix:\n...For what?\nGumshoe:\nI really want to help you look for her, pal.\nPearl:\nMr. Detective...\nGumshoe:\nIf anything happens, let me know, OK? I want to help in any way I can!\nPearl Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, little missy. Listen good, OK?\nPearl:\nOK. What is it?\nGumshoe:\nDon't ever pick up a whip, OK? Don't even think about it.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nGumshoe:\nIf you ever find yourself thinking you want one, try to make due with a good slap to the face. Got that? Slap the person in the face. Promise me, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(Personal experience tells me Gumshoe should be careful what he wishes for...)\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nIf I had a choice, she would be number three on my list of people I don't want to see.\nPhoenix:\n...Because I'm in the number one spot?\nGumshoe:\nDon't get all high and mighty on me here. You've taken a tumble into second place, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really? Then who's in first...?\nGumshoe:\nMs. von Karma's miles and miles ahead of you in this race.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh...\nGumshoe:\nShe's really scary... Right now... M-Ms. von Karma... You really don't...\nPhoenix:\n(He's so scared of her that he's whispering now...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, why don't we let bygones be bygones, pal? Look, this guy is guilty. A buck says so.\nPhoenix:\nOne dollar...? Sure you're not talking about Pearls' allowance money?\nGumshoe:\nI... I can't bet any more than that... My salary... It's...\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't matter what we think... I still have to defend Mr. Engarde in court or else!)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick...\nSecurity Lady profile\nGumshoe:\nI thought she was an alien from outer space.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, probably because she's wearing that strange helmet.\nGumshoe:\nNah, even with her helmet off, I thought she was an alien, pal.\nPhoenix:\n... I think that's probably best kept to yourself, if you know what I mean...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nGumshoe:\nShe's Mr. Engarde's manager, right? No matter what I do, I really stink at talking with people like her. As soon as I open my mouth, I get all flustered. See, she's one of those women with a brain. She's someone who \"gets things done\".\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she does give that sort of impression, like she's got it all together.\nGumshoe:\nCompared to her, you can easily tell I'm a \"can't do anything right\" kind of guy. That's why I get all nervous and start messing up.\nPhoenix:\n(I feel sort of bad for him...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you know about this?\nGumshoe:\nUm... There's nothing special I can tell you about this, pal. Look pal, we don't have a lot of time. Why don't you show me something more important? If Ms. von Karma saw me here like this... I'd have to switch sides real fast...\nAfter clearing all Talk options, examining guitar case, and presenting Wine Glass:\n...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*...\nPearl:\nWh-What's that beeping noise, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I've heard this sound somewhere before...)\nGumshoe:\nIt's Ms. von Karma...\nPearl:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nFor some reason, whenever I hear that sound, she pops out of nowhere and whips me! (Changed from [Whenever I hear that sound, for some reason, she pops out of nowhere and whips me!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, that's exactly what happen [sic] the last time...) (Changed from [Come to think of it, that did happen the last time...] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nS-Sorry! I've gotta make myself scarce! Later, pal! Eowww!\nvon Karma:\nAt last, you reveal your true nature... Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(*gulp* Would it be too much to ask for you to be nice to me for a change...?)\nvon Karma:\nSo you're the type to steal information from pitifully hopeless detectives! That's very dishonorable of you!\nPhoenix:\n(Owww!)\nvon Karma:\nHey! Don't you dare run away, Scruffy McTrenchcoat!\nGumshoe:\nAh!\nvon Karma:\nI didn't think the detectives of this country could be this pitiful...\nGumshoe:\nUwaah!\nvon Karma:\nDetective! Come over here for a second!\nGumshoe:\nYeooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!\nvon Karma:\n...Hmph. I feel better knowing at least you were man enough to face your punishment.\nPhoenix:\n(He was so scared, he just froze up on the spot...)\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright! You... You have soiled my perfect prosecution record. I'll never forget that. This time... Victory is mine!\nPhoenix:\n... Victory is yours? Is that all this means to you...?\nvon Karma:\nWh-What...!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nvon Karma:\n... H-Hmph! Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin. (Changed from [Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!\nvon Karma:\nThis isn't over yet... I swear on my family's honor!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! What did she throw at me NOW...!? (Changed from [Ow! Now what did she throw at me...!?] in the original release) What is this...?)\nGumshoe:\n...Well, I guess this means I've gotta get back to the precinct now, pal. If you ever need me, come down to the Criminal Affairs Department, alright? And if you can, try not to let Ms. von Karma see you...\nExamine\nPaper on desk\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, what's this piece of paper...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's called an \"autograph\".\nPearl:\nAuto-graff?\nPhoenix:\nIt's got Mr. Corrida's name written on it, so it's his autograph.\nPearl:\nI can't read it at all. To be honest, I've never seen writing that looks like this.\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's a special way of writing called \"cursive\". Look here. See how it says, \"To my dearest Wendy\" in more normal letters here?\nPearl:\nTh-This sloppy, unreadable writing! It's crazy and cruel to give this to someone!\nPhoenix:\n(Hold on...)\nPearl:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nWendy... I've heard that name somewhere before...\nMr. Corrida's Autograph added to the Court Record.\nAfter visiting Enguarde's Hotel Room:\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPowers:\nOh, Mr. Wright! How are you?\nPhoenix:\nAh, Mr. Powers. Have you been here the entire time?\nPowers:\nYeah. People connected to the murder aren't allowed to go home, let alone leave...\nTalk\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me a little more about the Nickel Samurai TV show?\nPowers:\nOK. \"The Nickel Samurai\" is an action hero program aimed towards kids. It's the sequel to \"The Steel Samurai\".\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nPowers:\nThis time, there are three Samurai Brothers: Aluminum Samurai, Tin Samurai... And of course, the Nickel Samurai. It's a love \"Y\" in Neo Olde Tokyo!\nPhoenix:\nI see... ... W-Wait... A love what...?\nPowers:\nA love \"Y\". This girl, Sayo, works at a tea shop and all three guys fall for her at the same time.\nPhoenix:\nOh... I guess the \"Y\" shape is like the 3 brothers colliding over this one girl?\nPowers:\nAnyway, Sayo is actually the daughter of the evil Strawberry Clan's leader!\nPhoenix:\nSounds like an unusual situation. Like Romeo and Juliet... times three.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah... Strange thing is, this sort of forbidden love story is really big with the office ladies.\nPearl:\nUm...\nPowers:\nYes, Pearl?\nPearl:\nWh-What happens next!? I want to know! Ms. Sayo... Does Ms. Sayo fall in love? She does, doesn't she?\nPowers:\nEvery Sunday at 8 AM.\nPearl:\nI'm going to stop watching \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\" starting this week!\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe she's really considering it!)\nJammin' Ninja\nPhoenix:\nSo what's the \"Jammin' Ninja\" TV show like?\nPowers:\nIt started from a remake of an old movie, to tell you the truth. The Jammin' Ninja is, like the Samurai shows, aimed towards kids. It's the story of a ninja who can't climb a wall, but became a big pop star.\nPhoenix:\n...Uh, what?\nPowers:\nHe was a really lousy ninja. Absolutely couldn't do any ninja things right at all. But boy could he sing! With his trusty bright red guitar in hand, he took the ancient world by storm.\nPhoenix:\nA... A ninja... With a bright red guitar...!?\nPowers:\nAnd then, the final fight in front of his beloved Princess Misola! \"Jammin' versus the Muromachi Five!\" Suddenly! Our brave hero catches a not so Jammin' cold the night before Battle 3!\nPhoenix:\nAww, that's too bad for him...\nPowers:\nY-Yeah... But this kind of pop music-based love story is something high school girls really like.\nPearl:\nUm...\nPowers:\nYes, Pearl?\nPearl:\nWh-What happens next!? I want to know!\nPearl:\nJammin'... The Jammin' Ninja! Will he be able to sing!? What about Princess Misola!?\nPowers:\nEvery Sunday at 8 AM.\nPearl:\nUmm... Which show should I watch...? Hmm...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe she's really  considering it!)\nThe gossip on Adrian (appears after presenting Adrian Andrews profile)\nPhoenix:\nWould you mind telling me about this \"gossip\"?\nPowers:\nAh, so you ARE interested in it! I figured you would be! (Changed from [Ah, so you're interested in it too!

Which means if we're talking about a certain manager with the initials A. A....\nPhoenix:\n... Adrian Andrews...?\nPowers:\nY-Yes, exactly! This is big news!!\nPhoenix:\n(But... It seems kind of odd.

And I didn't suspect a thing because he looked like such a normal old man...\nPhoenix:\n(Old man, huh...)\nGuitar Case\nPowers:\nThat guitar case... That was Juan's...\nPhoenix:\nI'm guessing you've seen this case before?\nPowers:\nIt's pretty famous by now. It stands out because it holds THE bright red guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(The bright red guitar... The Jammin' Ninja's signature item.)\nPearl:\nBut if the guitar is so important, how could he forget it for the award ceremony?\nPhoenix:\n(That does seem a little strange...)\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nI...

I saw him coming out of Juan's room.\nPhoenix:\nYou're kidding!\nPearl:\nOh no!\nOldbag:\nIt was about ten minutes before Juan's body was discovered. It was just a coincidence. I was on my way to the toilet, minding my own business.\nPhoenix:\nAnd...? Did you tell that to the police?\nOldbag:\nWell, of course! I thought I could get a gift certificate or two out of it, maybe more.\nPearl:\nGift certificate...?\nOldbag:\nI've been recruited again for that part at the trial. You know, the trial tomorrow? This time, you're gonna get it! I'm gonna work hard to get your client pronounced guilty!\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Engarde hasn't done anything bad...\nOldbag:\nI don't care about details like that!

But why...?\nOldbag:\nI thought lawyers were smart! It was to create a scandal to make Juan lose face! That girl drove Juan into a scandal that dragged his reputation through the mud!\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like a pretty standard definition of a scandal to me...) Why do you know about that anyway, Ms. Oldbag?\nOldbag:\nI'm one of Juan's biggest fans! I'm always out there gathering information!

The ceremony started at 6 PM. It ended around 8 PM... and then there was a short break. A special post-ceremony show was supposed to start in the lobby 30 minutes later.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when the victim's body was found, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nWhich is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period.\nJudge:\nHmm...

She's a really pretty lady... sir.\nJudge:\nAh, so she's a pretty lady... I wonder if she will grace us with her presence...\nGumshoe:\nWhen the post-ceremony show was about to start, she went to get Mr. Engarde. After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir.\nJudge:\nI see... And that's when she found the victim's body...\nGumshoe:\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo.

The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir.\nJudge:\nSo you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar.\nPhoenix:\nSo that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nMia:\nOur first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.\nPhoenix:\nBut there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...\nMia:\nMaybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.\nPhoenix:\nIf you say so...\nMia:\nOf course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?\nAfter pressing third, fourth, and fifth statements:\nEdgeworth:\nI believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nWhich brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...?

Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Why Arrest Engarde? --\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!\nJudge:\nHmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.\nGumshoe:\nIt was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.\nKnife added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\n...And there's this button.\nJudge:\nThat was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nJammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nAll of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?\nPhoenix:\nHmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!\nEdgeworth:\nYou can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.\nPhoenix:\nGrrrrrrrrr...\nCross Examination\n-- Why Arrest Engarde? --\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown.\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end...\nJudge:\nThat is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls!\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah, I guess, but...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all!\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUm, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nDetective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired.\nGumshoe:\nEh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's...\nEdgeworth:\nI look forward to your pension negotiations.\nGumshoe:\nN-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony.\nGumshoe:\n*sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too...\nEdgeworth:\nDetective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)\nGumshoe:\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any proof that button belonged to the victim?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nOh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\".\nGumshoe:\nHuh? But can't you tell by just looking at it?\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nA-And the victim's blood is on it.\nPhoenix:\nAnyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward.\nGumshoe:\n... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Thread.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nThe button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal!\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nMia:\nThat's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.\nGumshoe:\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhen was this button found?\nGumshoe:\nPretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder...\nEdgeworth:\nThe police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people...\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)\nGumshoe:\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHow were the fingerprints arranged on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nBy examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...?\nGumshoe:\nOh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe the bumbling of this department...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?\nGumshoe:\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife!\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...)\nMia:\n...Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nThere's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.\nPresent Knife\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"\nPhoenix:\n(A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)\nMia:\nBe grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.\nPhoenix:\nWe're still in a world of trouble...\nMia:\nWell, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nWait a second!\nGumshoe:\nWh-What?\nPhoenix:\nSo the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The defendant...\nPhoenix:\n...Did not buy this knife.\nGumshoe:\nH-Huh!?\nPhoenix:\nTake a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.\nGumshoe:\n...Huh?\nJudge:\nIt has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...\nGumshoe:\n\"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.\nPhoenix:\nThat's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.\nGumshoe:\n... Uh oh.\nPhoenix:\nThe murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!\nJudge:\nYes, that is very true! This is a very big...\nEdgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...\nJudge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nI think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.\nPhoenix:\nH-How so!?\nEdgeworth:\nI admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.\nGumshoe:\n...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*\nEdgeworth:\nThe question is... Where did this knife come from?\nJudge:\nWh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.\nJudge:\nThere is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?\nEdgeworth:\nIf it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.\nJudge:\nAmazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.\nMia:\nIt seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...\nPhoenix:\n(This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)\nJudge:\nA murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.\nEdgeworth:\nI can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.\nPhoenix:\n(Evidence not yet shown...?)\nMia:\nHe means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.\nJudge:\nWhat does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well...\nMia:\nPhoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...\nPhoenix:\n(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?\nActually, I do.\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"\nNo, not right now.\nPhoenix:\n(This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.)\nJudge:\nLooks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means this court is adjourned.\nMia:\nPhoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!)\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"\nPhoenix:\nThere's one...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nOne piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.\nPhoenix:\n(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)\nJudge:\nYou may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?\nPresent Wine Glass\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong.\nJudge:\nI can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nI am a man of my word, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penalty\nJudge:\nThis... is a wine glass, is it not?\nPhoenix:\nPlease look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, yes, I see your point.\nPhoenix:\nHowever! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!\nJudge:\n...\nGumshoe:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nW-Well? What do you all have to say...?\nJudge:\nAh, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!\nJudge:\nYou can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is it, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nYour opinion...\nEdgeworth:\n...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.\nPhoenix:\n...What!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.\nJudge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)\nIt's possible.\nPhoenix:\n(It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...)\nMia:\nYou can't think like that, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nRight now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(So in other words, push as far as we can go...)\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"\nThere's no way.\nPhoenix:\n(If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!)\nMia:\nThey just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough!\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"\nPhoenix:\nThe defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!\nJudge:\nHmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?\nPhoenix:\n(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)\nEdgeworth:\nUnlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nEdgeworth:\nYou're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?\nPhoenix:\nTh-Then...\nEdgeworth:\nOf course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.\nPhoenix:\nFingerprints...\nEdgeworth:\nThere were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.\nJudge:\nOnly one? Well, whose were they!?\nEdgeworth:\nThey were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!?\nWine Glass updated in the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nThat is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.\nJudge:\nHmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.\nPhoenix:\nGrrr!\nEdgeworth:\nI've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!\nJudge:\nW-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.\nPhoenix:\n\"Another witness\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!\nMia:\nWhat in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, witness, please state your name and occupation...\nOldbag:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nEdgeworth:\nUurrngh!\nOldbag:\n...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!\nEdgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr...\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)\nOldbag:\nOh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!\nEdgeworth:\nI saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?\nOldbag:\nI tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.\nJudge:\nMs... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nJudge:\nOof!\nOldbag:\nShush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!\nJudge:\nYes, madam.\nEdgeworth:\nNo no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.\nOldbag:\nIt's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?\nOldbag:\nIt was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!\nJudge:\nYou mean... You were a fan of the victim?\nOldbag:\nLook, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!\nPhoenix:\n(Um... But those two were the same age...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.\nEdgeworth:\nVery well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.\nOldbag:\nLeave it to me, Edgey-poo!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What You Witnessed --\nOldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!\nJudge:\nHmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...\nOldbag:\nSee! It has to be him! He's the murderer!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- What You Witnessed --\nOldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what was your post on that night?\nOldbag:\nThe lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...)\nOldbag:\nBesides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?\nOldbag:\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSomething you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that?\nOldbag:\nIt's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course.\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Gossip\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nIf this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony.\nMia:\nIt looks like we shouldn't force it right now.\nJudge:\nHmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?\nOldbag:\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room?\nOldbag:\nI have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am!\nJudge:\n...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?\nOldbag:\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWho in the world was that!?\nOldbag:\nI'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was...\nJudge:\nYes...? He was...?\nOldbag:\n... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...)\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.\nOldbag:\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release))\nThe person's face\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's face in more detail!\nOldbag:\nYou don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth!\nPhoenix:\nHis teeth were... shining?\nOldbag:\nWell, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie.\nPhoenix:\n... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!?\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nIt was not important.\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nIt was very important.\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nWhat the person was carrying\nPhoenix:\nWhat was the man you saw carrying?\nOldbag:\nIn which hand? His right or his left?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nAh, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand?\nOldbag:\nAh, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand.\nPhoenix:\nThen how about his left?\nOldbag:\nEmpty.\nPhoenix:\n... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nIt was not important.\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nIt was very important.\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nThe person's clothes\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's clothes in more detail!\nOldbag:\nWhat a troublesome man you are. Really, as if something like that matters.\nPhoenix:\nBut it does.\nOldbag:\nUm... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat thing?\nOldbag:\nThat gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...)\nOldbag:\nThat thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!!\nPhoenix:\nUm, right...\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nIt was not important.\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nIt was very important.\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nDon't you see it, Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! I request what the witness said about the jacket be appended to her testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't quite see where you're going with this, but alright. Witness, please...\nOldbag:\nAh well, I don't like to badmouth anyone without reason, but if I must...\nAdds statement \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\"\nPress (after adding statement)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I'm going to have to press a little harder on this one... There's got to be some sort of huge contradiction I can find here...)\nOldbag:\nHe was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure the defendant was wearing a racing jacket?\nOldbag:\nWhat do you think? It's not like I've seen him in anything other than that horrible thing. I'm sure he was wearing it!\nPhoenix:\n(She is so sure of herself that it's to the point of self-absorption...)\nPresent Jammin' Ninja's Button\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag...\"\nMia:\nShe may not remember things or be mistaken here and there, but I don't think she's lying.\nPhoenix:\nThat's bad for us. Really bad.\nMia:\nBut, that's how the human mind is. It also has the tendency to jump off-topic. She's strayed onto a few interesting side-topics this time too, hasn't she? But that's what makes her a sweet old lady, right?\nPhoenix:\n(That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag...\nOldbag:\nWhat!? Don't say my name for no reason!\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what this is?\nOldbag:\nAaaah! It's button number 2 on the Jammin' Ninja's costume!\nPhoenix:\n(Now I KNOW she's an obsessed fan... She identified it in a single glance!)\nOldbag:\nGive it here! Give it here! If you don't give it to me, I'll punish you with this!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.\nOldbag:\nSee! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!\nPhoenix:\nIt was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.\nOldbag:\nSee! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\n...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his \"usual racing jacket\"!?\nOldbag:\n... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nJudge:\nNow hold your tongue still there for one second! So what you saw in actuality, was not Mr. Engarde, the man... but Mr. Engarde, the Nickel Samurai!?\nOldbag:\nBut when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!\nOldbag:\nEdgey-poo! Do you think so too?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, it might be something worth considering. (Changed from [Well, it might be something worth thinking about.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nJust say, \"It's important\" and agree with me for a change!\nJudge:\nWitness! Think carefully and try to remember as much as you can before you testify!\nOldbag:\n*sigh* Alright, if you insist.\nPhoenix:\n(I should be the one sighing, not you!)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Who I Saw --\nOldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.\nPhoenix:\nI... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Did you think there could've been someone else inside that costume? Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.\nPhoenix:\nBut... But the possibility does exist!\nOldbag:\nAh, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.\nJudge:\nH-How do you know that?\nOldbag:\nBecause... I said so. And what I say is the truth.\nPhoenix:\n(At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.\nCross Examination\n-- Who I Saw --\nOldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWould you please get on with your testimony!\nOldbag:\nHmph! Watch your language, young man! What sort of tone is that to take with an elder! My youthfulness isn't what it used to be, so you should forgive me for everything! If you keep on barking at me like that, I'll start singing at the top of my lungs!\nPhoenix:\nUh, what?\nOldbag:\n\"A striking figure by the sea, standing all alone is he. He's the Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n(...She's actually singing... Someone help my poor ears.)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Can you please do something about this racket!?\nEdgeworth:\nWitness. I'll give you a piece of gum later if you'll be good and stick to just the facts.\nOldbag:\nOKAAAAAAAY! ... You promise, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I'll be sending the bill for the chewing gum to your office at a later date.\nPhoenix:\n(Remind me to send you a thank you note later too, Edgeworth, old chum...)\nOldbag:\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBe a little more careful with your testimony, please! Not too long ago, you said he was wearing his \"racing jacket\", and now he's not!?\nOldbag:\n\"Not too long ago\"...? Then let me ask you this! When you were itty-bitty, what was your grand dream?\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nOldbag:\nWhat did you want to be when you grew up, whippersnapper!?\nPhoenix:\nMy dream, huh...? Well, I... uh, wanted to be Judge Wackner, hero of the Public's Court. So what!?\nOldbag:\nSee! And look at where you are now! You're not Judge Wackner, are you!? Are you!?\nPhoenix:\nWell...\nOldbag:\n\"What I said earlier\"... Who puts any weight into things like that!? The \"now\" is everything! I can't be held responsible for the \"past\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did court become theatrics over testimonies?)\nOldbag:\nAll that matters is that man was inside that costume. Isn't that enough!?\nOldbag:\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd why would that be?\nOldbag:\nThat way, no one could see his face, of course!\nPhoenix:\nBut there's still no advantage for him that I can see. In fact, you would think the costume would make him stand out all the more!\nOldbag:\n... You are such a annoying child, you know that? You disagree with everything I say...\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that what YOU'RE always doing to me!?)\nOldbag:\nI got it! Maybe it was more troublesome for him to change in and out of his costume!\nOldbag:\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWas there anyone else scheduled to appear at the post-ceremony show?\nOldbag:\nWell, all the contestants were supposed to go onstage in a friendly gesture thing.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that included the Jammin' Ninja...?\nOldbag:\nOf course it included him! That's why when Engarde came out of dear Juan's room, I didn't give it a second thought.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nOldbag:\nWell, anyway.\nOldbag:\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo let me ask you one last time. The person you saw, it really was the Nickel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nAs showy as ever. Haven't I been saying that from the very beginning!?\nPhoenix:\n(Can I throw in the towel yet?)\nPresent Knife\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Please take a look at this.\"\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nMia:\nYou don't need to think too hard on this one.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nThere's a contradiction in her testimony and it's sitting in plain sight. The question is what that contradiction means for us...\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I have to figure out what you're talking about first, but OK...)\nPhoenix:\nPlease take a look at this.\nOldbag:\nYeah, so, it's a knife. Big deal. If you're trying to scare me with that, I'll have you know it won't work!\nPhoenix:\nNo no, that's not my intention at all...\nJudge:\nThat's the knife that was used in the murder, correct?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. Do you know why this piece of evidence is important to this case?\nJudge:\nYou don't even have to ask. It's because the defendant's fingerprints are on it.\nEdgeworth:\n... Is that what you're driving at...?\nPhoenix:\nThat is exactly what I am driving at.\nJudge:\nWhat are we driving at? And whose car are we driving?\nPhoenix:\nIf Mr. Engarde was really in the Nickel Samurai costume at the time of the murder, then it's impossible for his fingerprints to have been left on this knife! Actually, he would have wiped all previous fingerprints on this knife right off!\nJudge:\nOh, that's right! The Nickel Samurai wears gloves, doesn't he?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nHe probably took his gloves off before he began the stabbing!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd why would he do something like that? To leave his prints on the murder weapon? There is no way he would do something like that!\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, there is one possibility!\nPhoenix:\nThen let's hear your \"possibility\"!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's very simple. The defendant went to the victim's room while in costume as the Nickel Samurai. At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder. He was probably just going to relax and talk with the victim about the stage show. Which is why he took his gloves off!\nJudge:\nHmm... But the murder still did take place...\nEdgeworth:\nIt's well known that there was bad blood between the defendant and the victim. (Changed from [It's well known that the defendant and the victim had bad blood between them.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm, yes... I have heard that before... (Changed from [Hmm, yes... I have heard of that...] in the original release) Well, Mr. Wright? What do you have to say about Mr. Edgeworth's theory...?\nPhoenix:\n(So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this: When the defendant went to the victim's room, he had no intentions of killing him. Now, up to this point, are there any problems with his theory...?)\nThere are no problems.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... I can't see any real problems with his theory...)\nMia:\nBut if you let Edgeworth's theory stand, then we're one very large step closer to a guilty verdict. Look at the Court Record again and take another shot at it.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I just have to think about it one more time...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please make your decision soon.\nLeads back to:\n\"So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this:\"\nThere is a contradiction.\nLeads to:\n\"This theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!\"\nThink about it one more time.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I think I need a little more time on this one.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this:\"\nPhoenix:\nThis theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you babbling about...?\nPhoenix:\nNow, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer. If that's the case, I think it's impossible for the killer to have gone to the victim's room without intent!\nPresent Knife\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nNaturally, you point to the one piece with the least value... but with such vigor! Enjoy your energy while you can. Humans don't live forever... Neither do lawyers.\nJudge:\nYou sure like to think you can bluff your way out of things, don't you?\nMia:\nPhoenix, pay attention! Let's pretend for a second that Mr. Engarde is the murderer. Now from that angle, if he didn't have a murderous intent from the very beginning, then that means there is a certain object that shouldn't be at the crime scene, right?\nPhoenix:\n(\"A certain thing\"...? What certain thing...?)\nEdgeworth:\nHow are you doing over there? Busy collecting your thoughts?\nPhoenix:\n(Alright, let's give this one more try... and with even more spirit this time!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer.\"\nPhoenix:\nThis knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.\nJudge:\nY-Yes, we did establish that.\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that if my client was, in fact, the killer... Then he brought this knife with him when he went to visit Mr. Corrida.\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose...\nPhoenix:\nHowever, you just said it yourself. \"At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder.\" If that were true, then why would he bring a knife!? He wouldn't, would he!?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means, Mr. Edgeworth, your theory was flawed from supposition one! And one more thing! If the murderer was wearing the costume at the time of the murder... Then there should be glove marks left on the knife! Which means the defendant's fingerprints shouldn't be all over it like bees on a hive!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that brings me to my final point... This knife was planted by the real killer to hide their identity and mislead us!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order, I say! Order in the court!! Was this knife really planted by the killer!? Why would the murderer do such a thing!?\nTo hide the murder method.\nPhoenix:\nIt's to hide the way in which the murder was carried out, of course!\nEdgeworth:\nM-More of your nonsense!?\nPhoenix:\nTake another good look at the autopsy report! The victim actually died from strangulation! The killer tried to hide thisx by stabbing a knife into thex victim's chest!\nJudge:\nBut doesn't the autopsy admit that the cause of death was strangulation?\nPhoenix:\nWell, yes, the real cause of death was easily discovered...\nEdgeworth:\nThen I'd say the knife did a terrible job of \"concealing\" this fact!\nPhoenix:\n... Aha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that laugh doesn't do a very good job of concealing your error either!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! I will ask you one more time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Was this knife really planted by the killer!?\"\nTo frame Matt Engarde.\nLeads to:\n\"It's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!\"\nPhoenix:\nIt's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!\nJudge:\nTo frame...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nA-Aren't you forcing the interpretation just a little too hard on this one!?\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut we just established that the witness saw the \"Nickel Samurai\" in costume, and if that were true, then there shouldn't be a single fingerprint on this knife!\nEdgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr! Witneeeeeesssssss!!\nOldbag:\n... Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey-poo...? (Changed from [Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey...?] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nGnnnnngh...\nJudge:\nWitness, did you or did you not really see the Nickel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess at first I might have forgotten, but...\nPhoenix:\nAre you saying you mixed up Mr. Engarde with the Nickel Samurai, his character on TV!?\nOldbag:\nBut I mean, I can't really do anything about that now! (Changed from [But I mean, I can't really do anything about that!] in the original release) Look, I was waiting around in front of their doors because, well... Well, I wasn't waiting around for the Nickel Samurai, that's for sure!\nPhoenix:\n...! (She wasn't waiting for the \"Nickel Samurai\"...?) Alright then... Who were you waiting around for then?\nOldbag:\n... Hmph! That's top secret to anyone outside of security!\nJudge:\nI have a feeling that you were waiting for Mr. Juan Corrida. Am I correct, witness?\nOldbag:\nHa ha ha. The way you think, you are a sad amateur with a terrible case of near-sightedness.\nJudge:\nAmateur...? Me...? What am I an amateur of...?\nPhoenix:\n(So Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room... But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...)\nMia:\nMaybe... Phoenix! Maybe the old bag was waiting around for \"that\" person!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, if it's who I think Mia's hinting at... It's certainly possible...) Ms. Oldbag. You were waiting for this person to come out of the victim's room, weren't you?\nPresent Adrian Andrews profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Who is this person...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nMia:\nWhat are you talking about, Phoenix!? She could've waited until the next century and this would never have appeared!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch... Busted... Guess there's no fooling her.)\nJudge:\nYou two! What do you think you're doing flirting in my courtroom!?\nPhoenix:\nWe weren't doing anything like that... Honest... (Well, back to the drawing board on this one... Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room...)\nLeads back to:\n\"But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...\"\nJudge:\nWho is this person...?\nPhoenix:\nThis is Adrian Andrews, Mr. Engarde's manager.\nJudge:\nB-But why would the defendant's manager be in the victim's room...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems that this is the latest rumor in circulation, Your Honor.\nJudge:\n...Hmm... Oh... This is... Well, this is... Hmm, hmm... Hah, I see...\nPhoenix:\n(The judge seems to be really into the \"article\"... If it can be called such a thing...)\nJudge:\nThen this manager with the initials A. A.... Are you saying it's...?\nEdgeworth:\nAdrian Andrews. Without a doubt, the witness thought so as well.\nOldbag:\n... Hmph. Looks like you found me out. Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole \"sworn to confidentiality stuff\" then. (Changed from [Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole sworn to confidentiality stuff.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nW-Witness...? What in the world are you...\nMia:\nWatch out, Phoenix. I've got a bad feeling about this... A very bad feeling.\nOldbag:\nI got some information... Some very secret information from a certain source. So that's why I was doing my own little investigation... In secret, of course.\nJudge:\nB-But what for...?\nOldbag:\nOh, just for myself... Personal reasons and all that.\nJudge:\n... Well, Mr. Edgeworth. How will you proceed from here?\nEdgeworth:\nI really don't want to do this, however I cannot simply let this point slide.\nJudge:\nI see. Very well then. Witness, please testify about this \"secret information\".\nOldbag:\nGet ready! This is going to take the wind out of you young'uns!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure we're all capable of handling this... Really, it's not like we're ten years old.)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Secret Information --\nOldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!\nI cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?\nJudge:\nThe defendant sent his manager...? What a distasteful topic for this court!\nOldbag:\nWhat!? Nobody's above gossip! And isn't there a saying!? \"The truth is never pleasant.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Never heard that one before...)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What about this Adrian Andrews person...?\nEdgeworth:\nWe have looked into this matter, and found that the \"truth\" the article proposes is, in fact, baseless gossip.\nJudge:\nHmm... But should this be true... Then this proves that the defendant did bear ill-will towards the victim.\nPhoenix:\n(...So this means I have to smash this rumor once and for all.)\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.\nMia:\nBe careful. The old bag seems rather excited right now.\nOldbag:\nThat's right! Engarde is nothing but your average foul-blooded youth!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, as the old saying goes... You've gotta burn old bags with fire! Time to fire up the afterburners and hit the highway to the danger zone!)\nCross Examination\n-- Secret Information --\nOldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou can't say something like that without proof! That's just slander!\nOldbag:\nBut it's true! That woman was getting intimate with poor Juan! Look! It says so right here, doesn't it!? \"Manager to the stars, Ms. A. A.!\"\nPhoenix:\nBut the name of the magazine this came from is \"Gossip Land\"...\nOldbag:\nWhat? Are you saying that \"gossip\" is all just a pack of lies? Hmph, what do you know? I suppose next you'll swear to me that the \"news\" is 100% truth!\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nHonestly, sonny. You can't discriminate between the news and gossip!\nJudge:\nYes, discrimination is bad, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Discriminate? When did I do anything like that?)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, Engarde will never get me to say \"touch\u00e9\"!\nOldbag:\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nA scandal...? What do you mean by that?\nOldbag:\nYou're a dimwitted one, aren't you? I can't believe you don't know what a \"scandal\" is! Honestly, what are they teaching kids in middle school these days...?\nPhoenix:\nAh, no no! I wasn't asking what the word \"scandal\" means! Even I know that much!\nOldbag:\nWell! That Engarde thought he could own a monopoly on popularity!\nOldbag:\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou don't have any proof that Mr. Engarde did any such thing!\nOldbag:\nYou must be suffering from shock; the shock of hearing the truth. And now, since you're in so much shock, you can't do anything right!\nPhoenix:\n(You're right, I can't do anything, but boy do I wish I could do something about you.)\nOldbag:\nAlright then, sonny, show me what you've got! Can you show me proof that Engarde didn't bear any ill-will towards Juan!?\nPresent evidence\nPhoenix:\nI'm not going to let you push me around that easily!\nOldbag:\nHeh. There's many a man who've said those exact words and paid dearly for them.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you should brace yourself this time! Here is my proof that Mr. Engarde did not hold any ill-will towards the victim!\nPresent anything\nPhoenix:\nOldbag:\n...Is that it? You can take it from here, Edgey-poo!\nEdgeworth:\nNgrk! Wh-What are you handing it over to me for!? (Changed from [EH!? Wh-What are you handing it over to me for!?] in the original release)\nOldbag:\nI want you to give that jagged-headed baboon-boy a message for me! Please? Tell him that no matter what he does, the only thing he's good at is failing.\nEdgeworth:\nUm... What she said, Wright! Or should I say... Baboon-boy!\nJudge:\nYes, I agree this isn't much of a piece of evidence... Baboon-boy.\nPhoenix:\n(Did I just gain a new nickname here...?)\nLeads to:\n\"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\"\nDecline the offer to present\nPhoenix:\n...I don't have anything to offer.\nOldbag:\nSeeeeeee! Just as I thought.\nLeads to:\n\"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\"\nOldbag:\nAnd you were lecturing me about saying things without proof! You've just given me a free pass to say whatever I want whenever I want, silly boy!\nPhoenix:\n(Me and my big mouth...)\nOldbag:\nThat's the way the cookie crumbles. For you, anyway.\nOldbag:\nI cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you mean by \"I took action\"...?\nOldbag:\nLike I already told you, I was lying in wait close to the crime scene! Once that slimy woman came out of Juan's room... I was going to capture her, and teach her a good lesson. Something you young'uns need!\nJudge:\nYou were going to \"teach her a good lesson\"...?\nOldbag:\nI was going to make her eat the damaging beams of my ray gun! Like this!\nJudge:\nN-No, stop!\nOldbag:\nWell, it was too bad that woman didn't come through the door that night.\nOldbag:\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWait!\nOldbag:\nWhat!? I'm a busy woman! Tea time with the kids is over!\nPhoenix:\nSecret information that no one else knows yet... If that's true, then how do you know this \"secret information\"!?\nOldbag:\nHuh!? Well... That's... because I'm a pro... Yes, that's it...\nPhoenix:\n...\nOldbag:\nI-It's a secret! Even if you drill a hole into my brain, you'll never find out!\nPhoenix:\n(How in the world did that old bat get such a \"secret\" piece of information...?)\nPress further\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't be a good girl and tell me where you got this secret information... You won't get to go home today!\nOldbag:\nUmm... Edgey-boy! What are you doing!? Help me!\nEdgeworth:\nEh!? What do I have to do with this!?\nOldbag:\nJust do this for me... You'll get your reward.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I don't want your reward, but you don't leave me much of a choice...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness could have gotten her information from anywhere! It's even possible that it was spontaneously made up inside the witness's head!\nPhoenix:\n(And he lectures ME on \"reckless blabbering\"!?)\nJudge:\nAs long as we don't know where this information came from, it's quite a waste of time to focus on this line of questioning.\nPhoenix:\n(Where did Oldbag get her inside information...? There has to be something I can use to figure it out!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPresent evidence\nPhoenix:\nSo no one else is supposed to know this \"secret information\", correct? If that's true, then why do you know it, Ms. Oldbag...?\nOldbag:\nWh-Wh-Why are you looking at me like that...? Stop that!\nPhoenix:\nWitness! I hate to say it, but this is how you came to acquire your secret info, isn't it!? (Changed from [I'm sad to say it, but this is how you found out this secret, isn't it!?] in the original release)\nPresent Lotta's Camera\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYou call that \"proof\"!? It looks more like proof of spite towards the witness! If you have nothing to back up your claims, then they are no more valid than \"gossip\"!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained. Witness, please feel free to ignore the defense's gesture of ill-will and continue.\nOldbag:\nOkie-dokie! See, nothing can get me down!\nPhoenix:\n(Great... That did nothing but set me back a few minutes of my life...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nWait and see\nPhoenix:\n(I should probably think a bit more about this... I don't want to do anything rash... For now, maybe I should sit back and watch how things play out...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nMia:\nSounds like just another tidbit of gossip, doesn't it? But you can't just ignore it either. It makes your client look bad either way.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I don't think I heard anything really out of the ordinary just now...)\nMia:\nThere has to be something we can catch her on...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... And when I find it, I'm going to press the heck out of it...)\nPhoenix:\nThe \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...\nJudge:\nOh yes... I remember that mischievous girl.\nPhoenix:\nShe reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.\nJudge:\nShe reported such a thing...?\nPhoenix:\nOn that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.\nOldbag:\nWh-What!? Outrageous ideas, you say!?\nPhoenix:\nNo no no, I said impressions.\nOldbag:\nThen... Then...! Then everything written on this piece of paper is completely meaningless!?\nPhoenix:\nAh! That's it! That's the note!\nOldbag:\nAh! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Noooo! You see, this is something completely different! This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!\nJudge:\nHmm, then you are the one who took Ms. Hart's note?\nOldbag:\nI'm a huuuuuuuge fan of Juan's, that's why! That infamous, puffy-haired whippersnapper... She's working with that evil Engarde! She said so herself! \"En garde! I'm his sidekick!\" She was so happy, smiling like a silly duck. I was only checking what she had written!\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nOldbag:\n... Edgey-poo! You believe me, don't you!?\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...\nOldbag:\nI was only trying to help out like the angel I am! It's only one little piece of paper! I've never taken anything else before!\nEdgeworth:\nYou really should come with a supply of cheese to match your vintage whine.\nJudge:\nWell, it was only a piece of paper. I suppose we can overlook this just this once.\nPhoenix:\n(She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)\nPile on more pressure.\nPhoenix:\n(If I let up on her now, she'll get away... I have to find some way to inflict a deafening blow to the prosecution!)\nLeads to:\n\"Witness!\"\nForgive her.\nPhoenix:\nI guess we should forgive her.\nOldbag:\nHmph! Who the heck are you to decide who should be forgiven, you delinquent!\nPhoenix:\nGrr... (Number of endearing qualities: ZERO.)\nMia:\nPhoenix. You can't go easy on her. She's no frail old lady.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nMia:\nYou should be pressing her until she gives in!\nPhoenix:\n(Mia is really scary today... *gulp*)\nLeads to:\n\"Witness!\"\nPhoenix:\nWitness! You said that the only thing you stole was that note. Is this correct?\nOldbag:\nS-S-Stole!? Why don't you listen more carefully, you annoying brat!? I saved this piece of paper from the terrible, lonely trash can! That's all!\nPhoenix:\nYou're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\nOldbag:\nAre you putting my credibility under scrutiny again!?\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! I don't believe that the note is the only thing you stole that night!\nPresent Lotta's Camera\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. More than the witness' credibility, perhaps you should be worrying about your legal standing, or should I say, falling?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nJudge:\nI'm setting the volume down to low so I won't have to waste my time with your objections!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I never knew the judge had hearing aids... Argh! Now's not the time to be wondering about health conditions! OK, one more try!)\nLeads back to:\n\"You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\"\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?\nJudge:\nA camera...?\nPhoenix:\nYesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, \"My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!\"\nJudge:\nWhy... Why... Witness!!\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, gramps?\nPhoenix:\nIf you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!\nOldbag:\nGrr... Looks like you found me out again, sonny... Is this the camera you're looking for?\nPhoenix:\nAh, that's...!\nOldbag:\nWhat!? Even though I look like this, I'm still a person, you know! I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and \"borrow\" things from people!\nJudge:\nUm... I think your definition of \"borrow\" is a little off...\nOldbag:\nI saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, \"Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire\"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!\nJudge:\nBailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.\nJudge:\nPlease present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!\nOldbag:\nSee, I told you! That's the guy I saw!\nJudge:\nThis proves that the witness was not lying earlier about this matter.\nLotta's Photo added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nWh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was still in his Nickel Samurai costume!\nJudge:\nIf that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...\nEdgeworth:\nThe defendant.\nJudge:\nHow did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?\nPhoenix:\n(If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...\nnothing strange with it.\nPhoenix:\nThere is nothing strange with this photo.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I have done nothing to alter this picture either, in case you're wondering, Wright.\nJudge:\nI see... And it seems the defense will rest on this matter. In that case, there is no reason to further prolong this trial.\nMia:\nIs this really alright with you, Phoenix!?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well... There's nothing wrong with this photo that I can poi--\nMia:\nTry again! Take another good look at it! And if you still don't see anything... Do something... anything to prolong the trial!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Chief! W-Wait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright? I'm about to enter my verdict. Please address me with your comment afterwards.\nPhoenix:\nUm, no, I'm sorry, but this can't wait...\nEdgeworth:\nOh? Let me guess. You are going to point out some peculiarity with this photo?\nJudge:\nWh-What? Why didn't you say so earlier!?\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"\nsomething strange with it.\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"\nPhoenix:\nThere's... There's something strange with this photo!\nEdgeworth:\nI knew this was coming, Wright.\nJudge:\nYour thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nI think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.\nJudge:\n\"Debunk with a bunker buster\"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\n... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!\nJudge:\nIf you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need one chance, correct...?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this photo from anyway...? (Changed from [Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...?] in the original release) It's all out of focus! Why can't she take a good shot, especially when it counts!?)\nJudge:\nNow then, let's hear your objection. What about this photo is \"strange\"...?\nPresent Nickel Samurai's feet\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!\"\nPresent Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIt's this person here, of course!\nJudge:\nYou mean the \"Nickel Samurai\"? And what is wrong with that?\nPhoenix:\nAt the time of the murder, Mr. Engarde was in his own room! Which means this Nickel Samurai is a fa--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIf you think that's all it takes, you should reconsider your choice of occupation.\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nEdgeworth:\nI think it's about time you retired!\nJudge:\nHmm, it looks like there was no problem with this photo after all.\nEdgeworth:\nThe problem was with the brain of that lawyer, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nYou are the one who let your last chance fly away from you, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penalty\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe strange thing is somewhere around here! ...I think.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Somewhere\"...?\nJudge:\n\"Around here\"...?\nMia:\n\"I think\"...?\nPhoenix:\nA-Am I seeing something you all are not...?\nJudge:\nHmm, it looks like there was no problem with this photo after all.\nEdgeworth:\nThe problem was with the brain of that lawyer, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nYou are the one who let your last chance fly away from you, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penalty\nPhoenix:\nI would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!\nJudge:\nWh-What are you pointing to? His ankles...?\nPhoenix:\nIf you could see this person's ankle, that would be one thing... However you can't.\nJudge:\nA-And...? What does that mean...?\nPhoenix:\nThe costumed person in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde! (Changed from [The 'Nickel Samurai' in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of this!?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if you would care to elaborate... With actual facts, that is.\nPhoenix:\nLet's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.\nJudge:\nHis... His socks... You can see his socks...\nPhoenix:\nExactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThere is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)\nMia:\nThat's curious...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What is?\nMia:\nEdgeworth is unusually calm today...\nPhoenix:\nThat's true...\nMia:\nHe's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.\nPhoenix:\n\"Along for the ride\"...? What do you mean by that?\nMia:\nI can only think that perhaps he doesn't feel under attack at all...\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, I haven't damaged his case at all!?) (Changed from [He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nIf the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!\nEdgeworth:\n... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?\nPhoenix:\n(Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)\nMia:\nDon't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts. Who is the person in this photograph...?\nPresent Adrian Andrews profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"A-Adrian Andrews...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nJudge:\nAre you saying this is who you think was in the costume...?\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um... Well, I know there isn't a lot to back me up here, but...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nSometimes I wonder about you. Do you just pick the first piece of evidence you see?\nMia:\nI can't believe it. I didn't think you would mess up here of all places...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... And I really thought I had it!)\nJudge:\nNow then, would you care to try one more time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts.\"\nJudge:\nA-Adrian Andrews...?\nPhoenix:\nIf you want to know who that Nickel Samurai is, it is none other than this woman!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why would you say it must be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her? (Changed from [And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nFor starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.\nJudge:\nAnd how does that all add up?\nPhoenix:\nIt means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!\nJudge:\nThe knife that was used as a murder weapon!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(I have to do this now! This is my last chance to turn things around!) The defense motions to indict Ms. Adrian Andrews in the murder of Juan Corrida! It was Ms. Andrews who tried to frame the defendant for the crime!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!! ORDER!! It looks like this trial has hit a most unexpected development! Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nThis court is issuing a subpoena for Ms. Adrian Andrews! A verdict cannot be passed without first hearing her testimony!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! This is it...)\nMia:\nThis... is kind of bad for us.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What do you mean?\nMia:\nIf Adrian Andrews is summoned to court as a witness... It means that the trial will go on for another day.\nPhoenix:\nOne more day...? Ack!! (If I don't get a verdict TODAY, then Maya...!)\nJudge:\nNow then, we shall set Ms. Andrews' testimony for tomorrow...\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What am I supposed to do!? The judge is about to adjourn the court!)\nWait and see\nPhoenix:\n(I have to do something... The trial must go on! But I don't have anything left... No evidence, no nothing!)\nJudge:\nNow then, court will adjourn for tod--\n???:\nLeads to:\n\"I abhor wasting such valuable time...\"\nRaise an objection\nJudge:\nNow then...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nPlease, Your Honor! Continue the trial! You must pass a verdict today!\nJudge:\nI can't do that. We cannot hear Ms. Andrews' testimony if she is not--\n???:\nLeads to:\n\"I abhor wasting such valuable time...\"\nEdgeworth:\nI abhor wasting such valuable time...\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. I request that you please continue with today's trial.\nJudge:\nB-But... We cannot continue due to this unexpected development!\nEdgeworth:\nTsk, tsk. \"Unexpected\" development? I think you underestimate me, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nAnd what do you mean by that...?\nEdgeworth:\nThat Mr. Phoenix Wright would slave his way to subpoenaing Ms. Adrian Andrews is all happening according to plan... Even if Wright was a bit slow to catch on...\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of your statement, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Adrian Andrews is currently waiting in the prosecution lobby... She is the next witness.\nPhoenix:\n...! (Everything... Everything was planned out in advance by that man...?)\nMia:\nSomehow, I knew there was no way Edgeworth would overlook Ms. Andrews... Looks like this battle is far from over.\nEdgeworth:\nExactly.\nJudge:\nVery well. We will call the next witness. However... Before we proceed, we shall take a 10 minute recess. Please prepare your witness in that time, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nThe court will now take a 10 minute recess.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 22, 2:14 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3\nEngarde:\nDude! I can't believe that Adrian... No way! Not cool and collected Adrian Andrews!\nPhoenix:\nShe is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... her.\nEngarde:\nSo after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...\nPhoenix:\nSee, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.\nEngarde:\nHmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?\nPhoenix:\nYes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.\nEngarde:\nBut... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!\nPhoenix:\nShe has her own agenda.\nEngarde:\nH-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.\nEngarde:\nGet me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?\nMia:\nPhoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's missing suicide note, right?\nPhoenix:\n...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live. (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release) But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...\nMia:\n...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!\nMia:\nThat sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.\nPhoenix:\nUm, what...?\nMia:\nWho was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' dependency issues with regards to Ms. Inpax...? (Changed from [Better stated, Mr. Andrews' co-dependency with regards to Ms. Inpax...?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n... It was Edgeworth...\nMia:\nIt looks like he's still the one in command of this ship. Don't let your guard down yet.\nMarch 22, 2:25 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3\nJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you please.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls the witness subpoenaed by this court. Ms. Adrian Andrews, the person who discovered the crime in Mr. Juan Corrida's room!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is your occupation?\nAndrews:\nI am the manager of the defendant in this case, Mr. Matt Engarde.\nJudge:\nI see. Now then...\nAndrews:\nBefore we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.\nJudge:\nUh, yes, sure. What is it?\nAndrews:\nI'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly \"magazine\" recently...\nJudge:\nAh, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of \"Gossip Land\"...\nPhoenix:\n(If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.\nAndrews:\nYes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.\nJudge:\nHmm, so it was a \"fry 'n bait\" matter... or was that \"bait 'n fry\"? Reminds me of fishing...\nAndrews:\nBut I... But I didn't kill him.\nEdgeworth:\nNo one has accused you of that.\nAndrews:\nI think there's someone who would beg to differ. (Changed from [I've got a feeling someone will soon...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nI think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.\nEdgeworth:\nVery well then. Witness, please testify to the court about what happened when you discovered the murder that had taken place.\nWitness Testimony\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...\nWhat I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.\nI felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.\nJudge:\nYou poured yourself a glass of juice...?\nAndrews:\nYes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.\nMia:\nPhoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.\nPhoenix:\nYes... I know.\nMia:\nIn order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pacing. (Changed from [You should disrupt her pace.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDisrupt her pacing...? (Changed from [Disrupt her pace...?] in the original release)\nMia:\nShe's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it. The instant you let up on your offense is the instant this trial is over. Understand?\nCross Examination\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd what was Mr. Engarde doing at the time...?\nAndrews:\nHe was taking a nap. He was worn out from his mini performance as the Nickel Samurai during the ceremony...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, Mr. Engarde did say he was taking a nap...) Then I guess you could say it could not have been taken out of his room, yes?\nAndrews:\nExcuse me? \"It\"...? What are you...?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I thought years of school would have taught you how to construct a sentence. If you can't make a sensible sentence with a subject, then I'll make one for you. Watch. Did you, Ms. Andrews, remove Mr. Engarde's knife from his room?\nAndrews:\n...No.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nSubject, verb, object Wright. Did you skip basic grammar? The witness may continue.\nAndrews:\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you do that...?\nAndrews:\nAs a friendly gesture, Juan was to make an appearance with the other Heroes.\nPhoenix:\n(So the show was supposed to be a \"show\" of friendship, huh?)\nPress further\nPhoenix:\nIs that the only reason?\nAndrews:\nI beg your pardon? What are you implying...?\nPhoenix:\nYou had a certain goal in mind when you started to get close to him, correct...? So perhaps you had a more personal matter to discuss with the victim...?\nAndrews:\n... Sorry, but I didn't have any such intentions in mind at that time.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't get her to talk without a strong piece of evidence, I guess...)\nLeads to:\n\"May we continue now...?\"\nLet her be\nPhoenix:\n(I should back off...

Was I not supposed to be?\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Andrews is a very calculating person... And despite how \"close\" they were, I doubt she had romantic feelings for Mr. Corrida...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnyone randomly stumbling upon a dead body would be in shock. And you can't seriously expect that a young beauty like her would not be shocked.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think beauty has anything to do with being shocked or not...)\nJudge:\nHmm...

I didn't think that was possible for you.\nAndrews:\nAren't you rude today? I was so dazed that I made one careless mistake...

It's true that the top of the guitar case was wet with water. However, that's exactly what is so strange! Ms. Andrews! You testified that the vase fell onto the guitar case! However! If that was true, the case should have gotten wet on the inside, not the outside!\nJudge:\nTh-That's very true!\nPhoenix:\nFurthermore, there is one other strange thing about this guitar case.\nJudge:\nAnd wh-what is that?\nPhoenix:\nLet's take another look at the crime scene photo. The remains of the vase are scattered on the floor.\nJudge:\nAnd what is wrong with that?\nPhoenix:\nIf the guitar case was open when the vase fell... The glass shards should be INSIDE, not outside the case!\nAndrews:\nAh!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is your point, Wright!? That the case was closed at the time the vase was knocked over?

She said that other than the vase, she didn't touch anything else!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nYes, that's right... She did implicitly say she didn't touch the guitar case!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nBut... But this whole matter with the guitar case is a dead end! The bright red guitar was found at the studio!

(Changed from [An empty guitar case does seem to have no relation to this case...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems that there is no deeper meaning to the guitar case. Well, Mr. Wright? Do you think we need to hear more details about the guitar case?\nMake her testify\nLeads to:\n\"The empty guitar case...\"\nLet her be\nPhoenix:\nWell, the case was empty, and I think that's all we really need to know...\nJudge:\nI see.\nMia:\nWait! Phoenix! Don't you remember what I told you earlier? What's important here is that you disrupt her pacing. You have to attack her when she's not expecting it!\nJudge:\nNow then, let's move on to a different matter...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nActually, Your Honor, I've changed my mind. I would like her to testify about the case.\nJudge:\nWh-Wh-Why are you changing your mind NOW!?\nPhoenix:\n(Well, looks like I disrupted the judge's pacing... Now comes the real deal... *gulp*)\nLeads to:\n\"The empty guitar case...\"\nPhoenix:\nThe empty guitar case... I believe this is a crucial piece of the puzzle!\nEdgeworth:\nHeh! I can't believe ANYONE would reach for straws like this! But it is you...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe I'm doing this either...)\nJudge:\nAlright. I'll follow along... For now. Ms. Andrews, please testify to the court about the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nYes, Your Honor.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Guitar Case --\nAndrews:\nI don't remember too clearly because I was a bit dazed.\nI suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over.\nIt's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all.\nAs for why I opened the case... Even I don't know.\nJudge:\nHmm... It looks like this really wasn't a very important point.\nEdgeworth:\nThis wastefulness is such a familiar feeling by now that it's almost... comforting.\nPhoenix:\nUm, anyway, I'll just go ahead and start the cross-examination...\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Using \"anyway\" to change the topic -- a convenient escape for a weak man.\nCross Examination\n-- The Guitar Case --\nAndrews:\nI don't remember too clearly because I was a bit dazed.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nDuring your testimony just now, did you remember those events clearly in your mind?\nAndrews:\n... Well, you see...\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure you are the one who opened the guitar case?\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...\nMia:\nShe's... She's waiting for someone to tell her if she should answer or not...\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like her dependent side is taking over...) (Changed from [Her 'co-dependency' is coming through, huh...?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nWell, Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nY...Yes, it was me...\nAndrews:\nI suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo, you opened the guitar case then?\nAndrews:\nY-Yes... Well, maybe...\nPhoenix:\n... Why did you open the guitar case?\nAndrews:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida's dead body was right there in front of you, wasn't it? I would think that the first thing you would do is call for help, not open a guitar case.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nAs the witness has said multiple times, when she found the dead body, she was \"dazed\".\nJudge:\nHmm...\nAndrews:\nMaybe I... Maybe I was curious to know if the bright red guitar was alright or not. I thought, \"Maybe the criminal took it.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Why would she care about the bright red guitar...?)\nAndrews:\nBut, getting back on topic...\nPresent Guitar Case\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way you were the one who opened the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nWhy would you say that!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's elementary, my dear. Because the only fingerprints on this guitar case are those of the victim!\nAndrews:\nAh!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\n... You shouldn't assume that I must have left prints just because I touched the case.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nAndrews:\nWhat if I were to tell you that I was wearing gloves at the time?\nJudge:\nGloves...? But why would you be wearing gloves at the time?\nAndrews:\nIt was the night of the award ceremony. So of course I dressed up for the occasion. Yes, now I remember... I'm almost sure I was wearing a pair of thin gloves.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see... Well, Mr. Wright. It seems the witness was wearing gloves at the scene of the crime.\nNothing strange about that.\nPhoenix:\nHmm, I guess so... And I guess that makes sense.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. You're the epitome of a half-baked idea.\nAndrews:\nA brain is to be used, not to look pretty for med students carving cadavers.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like I need to bake my thoughts just a little longer...)\nEdgeworth:\nNow, if the defense has no further objections, let's return to the testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nThat's strange...\nPhoenix:\nYou were wearing gloves...? Isn't that a little strange?\nAndrews:\nWhy is that strange!? Do you have something that would prove I was not wearing gloves at the time...?\nPresent Wine Glass\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I have your proof right here. This wine glass.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI think it's time for you to go home now, Wright... Before you hurt yourself, that is.\nPhoenix:\n(Hurt myself...!?)\nJudge:\nIt's alright, Mr. Wright. You don't have to push yourself so hard.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I was trying a little too hard there...)\nEdgeworth:\nNow, if the defense has no further objections, let's return to the testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nAndrews:\nIt's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWas it really empty?\nAndrews:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nI was just wondering if maybe when you opened the case, the guitar was still inside.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nHow long have you been a lawyer, Mr. Wright!? Have a little professionalism. The bright red guitar was found at the studio. These trials would be over in half the time if you would just pay attention.\nJudge:\nYes, pay more attention, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nSorry...\nPresent Guitar Case\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way you were the one who opened the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nWhy would you say that!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's elementary, my dear. Because the only fingerprints on this guitar case are those of the victim!\nAndrews:\nAh!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\n... You shouldn't assume that I must have left prints just because I touched the case.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nAndrews:\nWhat if I were to tell you that I was wearing gloves at the time?\nJudge:\nGloves...?

Even I don't know.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWas that because you were \"shocked and dazed\" at discovering the victim's body?\nAndrews:\nYes... That's probably it.\nPhoenix:\n...\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not going to get anywhere if I continue pressing her like this... The only way to make her talk is with evidence... I guess I should give it a try...)\nPresent Guitar Case\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way you were the one who opened the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nWhy would you say that!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's elementary, my dear.

We can't afford to let up on her now.\nPhoenix:\nI wasn't planning on letting up, but...\nMia:\nShe's at her weakest now, so this is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, if we had a weapon to hit her with...)\nMia:\nI'm sure a weapon is hiding somewhere in the Court Record, waiting to be found.\nPhoenix:\nI have your proof right here. This wine glass.\nAndrews:\nThe wine glass?\nPhoenix:\nYou left your fingerprints very clearly on this wine glass.\nAndrews:\nAh...\nPhoenix:\nEven if you took your gloves off when you poured yourself this glass of juice, wouldn't you think it was just a little strange... That you put your gloves back on, just to open the guitar case!?\nAndrews:\nUgn!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!\nMia:\nLooks like you hit the nail on the head this time.\nPhoenix:\n...? What do you mean?\nMia:\nI believe that guitar case plays a very important role here.\nPhoenix:\nBut it's just an empty case...\nMia:\nI wonder if it really was empty though...\nPhoenix:\nB-But the guitar... The bright red guitar was at the studio!\nMia:\nPhoenix, drop all of your presumptions. What was in the guitar case was not the bright red guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(You don't mean... it was a bright WHITE guitar!? Wait, that's not right either...)\nJudge:\nHmm, I admit it would be unnatural for someone to do that. So the witness was not wearing gloves, despite the fact that on the case...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, this is obviously the defense's usual misdirection tactic at work. Steer the court towards an unrelated topic, and lull us all into his misguided...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Honor! Please recall that Ms. Andrews had testified that the vase \"fell onto the guitar case\"! Which means that the case was closed when the crime took place! However, it is wide open in this photo of the crime scene! I am sure this guitar case has some relation to the murder!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIf you are so sure, Wright, then I'm sure you can somehow substantiate your outrageous claim, correct!? Please, enlighten us as to why that guitar case has anything at all to do with this murder!\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nJudge:\nCan you do that, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... Let's suppose for a second... That the bright red guitar was not the only thing that could have been in the case...\nJudge:\nThe bright red guitar not being the only thing...? Y-You don't mean to suggest that a bright BLACK guitar was inside the--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you intend to push your theory that the case was not empty!? Is that it, Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nI wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!\nEdgeworth:\nDeflate that head of yours! You haven't proven anything yet! Now then, let's have it. What was inside this case at the time of the murder!?\nPresent The Nickel Samurai or Lotta's Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Th-This is... This is a photograph...!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why would something like that be inside a guitar case, let alone this one?\nJudge:\nWhy, Mr. Wright, why?\nPhoenix:\nWell... I just thought it might have been possible...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have a suggestion. Why don't you put that in the void where your brain is supposed to be!\nJudge:\nYes, and never bring it out again!\nPhoenix:\n(Can't a foolishly foolish fool get some love...?)\nEdgeworth:\nDo you still think you can prove your theory? Can you prove that the guitar case was not empty at the time of the murder?\nLeads back to:\n\"I wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!\"\nJudge:\nTh-This is... This is a photograph...!\nPhoenix:\nYes, but what is important is what is in that picture, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI-In this picture...?\nPhoenix:\nIt doesn't take a genius to see what I mean! What I am proposing is... Inside the guitar case was the Nickel Samurai! The hero's very own costume!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What!?\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!\nEdgeworth:\nWright! Are you saying that the witness opened the guitar case to take out a costume!? What insane point would there be to doing something like that!?\nPhoenix:\nThat insane point would be to wear the costume, of course. Ms. Andrews put it on to hide her identity so she could make her escape. After all, you couldn't let anyone see you leave, could you, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nI-I refuse to accept your theory! Do you have anything to support such a preposterous idea!?\nPhoenix:\nJust outside the door was an investigative photographer who was starving for a big scoop. And in the end, she managed to get this shot, correct?\nJudge:\nYou... You mean this photo!? Order! Ordeeeer! It looks like we've wandered into quite another mess again, haven't we...?\nMia:\nNice job, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later!\nJudge:\nHmm... So the real murderer was hiding inside a costume...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nW-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!?\nJudge:\nHmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...?\nIt was stolen from Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nI think it may have been stolen from Mr. Engarde...\nJudge:\nS-Stolen!? But why would someone do such a thing!?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe the thief wanted to interfere with the post-ceremony stage show.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nAnd so, if he didn't have his costume, then Mr. Engarde would be forced to go naked!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe YOU should be stripped naked and run out for making a mockery of this court!\nPhoenix:\nE-EXCUSE ME!?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Matt Engarde did not take his costume off after the award ceremony! He even testified that he took a nap while still wearing his costume! Is this not correct!?\nPhoenix:\n... Ah, yeah, he did say something like that, didn't he?\nJudge:\n*sigh* That's what I thought. Let's try that one more time, shall we, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts.\"\nIt was a spare costume.\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period...\"\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a spare one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nJudge:\nThen... are you saying that on the night of the murder... there were TWO Nickel Samurai costumes at the Gatewater Hotel!?\nPhoenix:\nYes, that is what I am saying.\nJudge:\nAnd how do you explain the costume that was inside the guitar case...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt would mean that the victim himself had brought this spare to the ceremony on purpose! (Changed from [It would mean that the victim himself had planned to bring this spare to the ceremony!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nBut... But why!? The victim, Mr. Corrida, was the Jammin' Ninja. Why would he secretly bring the Nickel Samurai's spare costume with him...? What could be the reason behind such a peculiar act?\nPhoenix:\n... And therein lies the sticking point... (Changed from [... Ah, so that's what he intended...] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you mumbling to yourself about now!? Have you just been rambling all this time without any sense of inner monologue!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? N-No, I just...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please explain yourself! Why do you think the victim had the Nickel Samurai's spare costume!?\nMia:\nPhoenix... Are you sure you can explain this one? Think carefully before you answer... And then answer with gusto! I believe in you!\nPhoenix:\nAlright. This is what I think. The reason the victim brought the Nickel Samurai's spare costume to the hotel was...\nPresent Press Conference Ticket\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"What is this...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nMia:\nPhoenix! What are you doing!? Are you crazy!?\nPhoenix:\nI... I, uh... I presented the evidence with gusto, just like you said!\nMia:\nI told you to present it with gusto, yes... But I seem to recall the sentence before that was, \"Think carefully\"!\nPhoenix:\n*gulp*\nJudge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nAh, sorry...\nMia:\nThis one is pretty tough. I really think you should look carefully at the Court Record. And then search through your memories! The answer is there, I know you'll find it!\nJudge:\nNow then. Are you ready to try again, Mr. Wright? Minus the wrong evidence this time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Alright. This is what I think.\"\nJudge:\nWhat is this...?\nPhoenix:\nOn the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special press conference.\nJudge:\nA press conference...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something at this conference.\nEdgeworth:\nI heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nBut what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had no idea he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night.\nAndrews:\n...\nJudge:\nBut how can that be!?\nPhoenix:\nThe way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida himself!\nJudge:\nTh-The victim?\nPhoenix:\nYes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the \"Nickel Samurai\"!\nJudge:\nHe was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!?\nPhoenix:\nThat's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is what he intended to reveal at that conference.\nEdgeworth:\nThe Nickel Samurai was going to \"confess\" something. And by \"confess\", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about \"himself\".\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about Matt Engarde!\nJudge:\nYes, I guess that is what it would mean...\nEdgeworth:\nBut, if that's the case... that's not a \"confession\"! That's \"public disclosure\"!\nAndrews:\nHmph.\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nI can see why you are pros at what you do.\nJudge:\nPardon me?\nAndrews:\nYes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan.\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews! Please offer us an explanation for this!\nAndrews:\nI was the one he asked to help set it up. And the person who prepared the second costume for him... That was also me.\nJudge:\nYou...!?\nAndrews:\nJuan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway.\nJudge:\nHe was going to ruin him, huh...?\nAndrews:\nIt looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nJudge:\nAnd do you know what this \"secret\" of Mr. Engarde's is, Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\n... That's something only Juan knew. I... I don't know what it is.\nJudge:\nAh... I see.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nAndrews:\nI... I've probably been coming off quite suspicious to everyone, but that's to be expected. I've been trying to protect Matt, after all...\nPhoenix:\nP-Protect Mr. Engarde!?\nJudge:\nAnd yet again another strange bit of truth comes to light it seems... Ms. Andrews, if you could, please tell us the truth about your behavior!\nAndrews:\nYes, Your Honor. I understand.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Protecting Matt --\nAndrews:\nFrom the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.\nMatt had to kill Juan no matter what.\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...\nJudge:\nHmm... This does account for everything...\nAndrews:\nWell... I am the logical type.\nMia:\nWe're finally seeing her true self. She is more nervous than a scared rabbit.\nJudge:\nIf the defense can find no fault with this testimony, I am ready to make a ruling. (Changed from [If there are no objections, I feel that I can pass a verdict based on this testimony.] in the original release) Please keep that in mind as you cross-examine, Mr. Wright. (Changed from [Now then, Mr. Wright, if you please.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like somehow everything has swung to the opposite end of the scale again... That just means I have to put my weight into this and turn her logic upside-down!)\nCross Examination\n-- Protecting Matt --\nAndrews:\nFrom the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWould you say that was your \"intuition\" speaking to you?\nAndrews:\nDon't confuse my methods of reasoning with your own.\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\nAndrews:\nIf you want to prove that someone did something, you need three things.\nPhoenix:\nThree... things?\nAndrews:\nA motive, an opportunity to commit the crime, and finally... decisive evidence. And if you think these three things through, the answer becomes quite clear.\nMia:\nYou should have already known that, Phoenix...\nPhoenix:\nThey didn't teach that to us in school... At least, not from what I remember...\nAndrews:\nMay I continue now?\nAndrews:\nMatt had to kill Juan no matter what.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo would you say this \"need\" came from the press conference?\nAndrews:\nYes. Do you know why Juan chose that event and that hotel for the conference? Because that was when he could cause the most damage to the public's beloved Matt Engarde.\nJudge:\nAnd you knew of this plan, didn't you, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\nYes... because I was the one who set up the conference and prepared the costume.\nPhoenix:\nBut... I'm sure Mr. Engarde himself didn't know anything about a press conference.\nAndrews:\nOh really? Can you show me any proof that he didn't know about the press conference?\nPhoenix:\nA-Anyway! The important thing here is that this information was not in your testimony!\nJudge:\nYes, I agree. Ms. Andrews, please correct your testimony, if you please.\nAndrews:\n\"Grasping at straws\" now, are we, Mr. Wright?\nChanges statement from \"Matt had to kill Juan no matter what.\" to \"I know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.\"\nAndrews:\nI know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHas Mr. Engarde done something to hurt or betray you personally?\nAndrews:\n... Why do you ask?\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one who helped Mr. Corrida with his press conference... And that event was supposed to bring down Mr. Engarde, yet you still helped out!\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThe person on trial right now is Mr. Engarde, Wright. What the witness was thinking, helping the victim with his plan, is none of our concern. In any case, this means that the defendant had a motive to kill.\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I keep doing this to myself...?)\nAndrews:\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nB-But didn't you already testify earlier that Mr. Engarde was... \"Taking a nap in his room\"!? Are you telling me now that, that too, was a lie so you could cover for Mr. Engarde!?\nAndrews:\nI'm not telling you anything of the sort. When I went to get him for the show, he honestly was sleeping. However, as to whether he was sleeping the entire time, that I cannot say. I was too busy setting up the stage at the time.\nJudge:\nHmm... I keep trying, but I can find no flaws with what Ms. Andrews has said. I can't say the same for some people here in this courtroom, however.\nPhoenix:\n(The judge is glaring straight at Mia...)\nMia:\nHe's glaring at you, smart guy!\nAndrews:\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou can hardly call the knife \"decisive evidence\"! The fingerprints on the knife could very well be a clever camouflage!\nAndrews:\nThen... What about the button?\nPhoenix:\nThe button...?\nAndrews:\nIt's clear from the crime scene that the victim and the murderer fought. And during the fight, the killer ripped the button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nJudge:\nYou're talking about this button, correct?\nAndrews:\nThat button was found in the pleats of Matt's hakama, isn't that correct? I would think that makes it very decisive evidence.\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nJudge:\nLooks like you were out-foxed again, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nA-Anyway! The knife doesn't prove a thing! Please fix your testimony!\nAndrews:\nI can't stand the sight of a man who can't gracefully accept his defeat.\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(... Thank goodness Mia can still look at me...)\nMia:\nWith an icy stare, yes.\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews, for Mr. Wright's sake, please add this information to your testimony.\nChanges statement from \"My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\" to \"That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\"\nAndrews:\nThat button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd how do you know that?\nAndrews:\nWhen the ends of the threads on the button and the costume were matched up, they were found to fit together perfectly... Or so I heard.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I've heard that before too. But why would Ms. Andrews know about this case down to such a fine detail?)\nAndrews:\nDon't look at me like that! Just because I'm prepared and you are not!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... And I thought I had her this time for sure. If there's anything to trip her up on, it has to be here. ...But where and what?)\nPresent Juan's Autopsy Report\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This is the victim's autopsy report.\"\nAndrews:\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut what you really did was stab the guy in the back, didn't you? And at the worst possible time.\nAndrews:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nWho's to say she really \"stabbed the guy in the back\" as you put it?\nPhoenix:\nThis witness could have disclosed things about Mr. Engarde at any time. Why, then, would she wait until there was a large audience before doing so? It's the same reason why Mr. Corrida planned such an elaborate conference. Ms. Andrews wanted to cause Mr. Engarde as much damage as she possibly could! This witness bears ill-will towards the defendant!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThis isn't the \"Phoenix Wright Wax Philosophical Power Hour\". And please, stop slandering the witness.\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAs I expected, Ms. Andrews' testimony seems pretty solid.\nMia:\nReally? Because to me, it sounded a little wishy-washy.\nPhoenix:\nWishy-washy? (Well, I guess we'll see if I press a little more...)\nMia:\nYou should know this by now, but you'll need strong, decisive evidence to make her talk.\nPhoenix:\nGot it, Chief! (...I'm going to pin you down this time, Ms. Andrews!)\nPhoenix:\nThis is the victim's autopsy report. It clearly states that the cause of death was \"strangulation by a scarf\".\nAndrews:\nS...Strangulation...\nPhoenix:\nThe knife stab to the victim was done after the victim had already died.\nJudge:\nA-And what does that mean?\nPhoenix:\nLet's examine the evidence. This button has the victim's blood on it. Which would mean that it was ripped off of the costume... when?\nEdgeworth:\nAfter the knife was stabbed into the victim...\nPhoenix:\nExactly! Which means... It is impossible that this button was torn off during the victim's final struggle, because the victim was strangled to death in that fight!\nAndrews:\nAh...\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, Ms. Andrews. There is no way this button was ripped off during the struggle. This button was consciously pulled off of the victim's already dead body!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Wh-What is the meaning--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is the meaning of this, Wright!? So what if the button was torn off the body after the victim had already died? What does that change!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me ask you one simple question, Mr. Edgeworth. Why was the button torn off? What purpose did that serve?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat \"purpose\"...?\nPhoenix:\nWe now know this button was not torn off during the fight. So the murderer took the time and effort to purposely rip this from the victim's body. That would mean that the murderer had something in mind, wouldn't it?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Does this mean... Does this mean you know what the murderer wanted to do with this button!? What was it!?\nTo have a memento of the crime\nPhoenix:\nMaybe this was the criminal's first crime and since it went so well, the person wanted something as a memento...\nEdgeworth:\nWright... I'll give this button to you as a memento.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nA reminder to never set foot in another court of law again for as long as you live!\nJudge:\nYes... I think it would be for the best if you stayed away from the attorney's bench.\nPhoenix:\nW-W-Wait! Please, Your Honor! I... I'll get it right this time! I'm sure of it!\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\"\nTo pin the crime on Engarde\nLeads to:\n\"There is only one logical reason for doing something like that.\"\nTo destroy evidence\nPhoenix:\nIt was to destroy the evidence, of course!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... To destroy the evidence...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, we heard you the first time! And which blasted piece of evidence was the person trying to destroy, Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! If you continue like this, I'm afraid you'll only destroy yourself!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\"\nPhoenix:\nThere is only one logical reason for doing something like that. It was to pin the crime on Mr. Engarde!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way anyone would put a bloodied button in their own pants! That's right! Mr. Engarde was set up! By the real killer, of course!\nJudge:\nAnd... The real murder is...? Well, Mr. Wright!? Who in the world is the real killer then!?\nPhoenix:\n(Finally... I can't believe I managed to bring this trial all the way up to this point...)\nMia:\nPhoenix... You can't let your guard down yet! Not until the very end!\nPhoenix:\nThe real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...\nPresent Adrian Andrews profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Adrian Andrews!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nWright. Which of these four doesn't belong here? Up, down, left, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nUm, \"Wright\"?\nEdgeworth:\nThank you, I feel much better. I'm relieved to know you can at least pick that much out. I worry about you. You seem to fail every time you try to make logical sense!\nMia:\nOr in other words, \"think before you speak\", Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\n(Is it just me or is everyone ganging up on me?)\nJudge:\nThat's enough dawdling now, Mr. Wright. We don't have all day.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"The real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...\"\nPhoenix:\nMs. Adrian Andrews! I choose you! You are Mr. Corrida's killer!\nAndrews:\nWh-What!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!! Mr. Wright! This is a very grave matter! Do you have any evidence that supports your charge...?\nPhoenix:\n\"Any evidence\"...? ALL of the evidence points to Ms. Andrews!\nAndrews:\nWh... How preposterous! You can't stick any of that on me!\nPhoenix:\nI can't, can I? Would you care to test me?\nAndrews:\nThen... Then what about this knife!?\nPhoenix:\nThe knife was used to stab the victim after he had already been strangled to death. It was used to throw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, naturally. A knife covered in the defendant's fingerprints could only be taken from his room. And the only one who had dinner with him, and knew which knife to take, was you.\nAndrews:\n...Tsk! Th-Then! What... What about the button that was found in Matt's hakama!?\nPhoenix:\nThis button was removed from the victim's body after he had already died. The only people who could've done so were the person who found his body or the killer. However, if Mr. Engarde was the real killer, there is no way he would have put such incriminating evidence in his own hakama!\nAndrews:\nUghn...\nPhoenix:\nThe only person who could have put this button into Mr. Engarde's hakama, is the person who went to wake him from his nap... which is you, yet again, Ms. Andrews.\nJudge:\nI... I see... What about the empty guitar case...?\nPhoenix:\nThat is also another piece of evidence that incriminates Ms. Andrews. That costume was used to hide the real killer's identity as they fled the crime scene. Now, who could have known that there was just such a costume inside the guitar case...? It could only have been the person who prepared the costume for the victim. And that person is... you, Ms. Adrian Andrews!\nAndrews:\nN...No... I...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nBut Ms. Andrews' fingerprints were nowhere to be found on the guitar case! And it was you who proved that she was not wearing gloves at the time!\nJudge:\n...! Th-That's right!\nPhoenix:\nThat's because she did not intend on leaving any prints. If anyone had found out that she had touched the case, they would have asked her why. So to avoid leaving any prints, she used a towel or something else to open it. But! The glass of tomato juice is a different story! Ms. Andrews purposefully left her fingerprints on the glass to show that yes, indeed, she was the classic \"dazed discoverer\" of a dead body!\nAndrews:\nAaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\nAnd to top it all off, there is this photo! A photo of the killer as they exited the scene of the crime. No reasonable person on Earth can believe this Nickel Samurai is Mr. Engarde! He would be much too short for his own costume if it was him.\nAndrews:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nSpeaking of how tall people are... Ms. Andrews, you're also kind of short in stature, are you not?\nAndrews:\nP-Please... Stop...\nPhoenix:\nWell, how about it, Ms. Andrews!?\nAndrews:\nUm...\nPhoenix:\n(I've got her this time!)\nAndrews:\n...\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\n... I... I... I refuse... to testify.\nPhoenix:\nWhat was that...?\nAndrews:\nTh-There's a law... It says I can't be forced to testify about something... if it can incriminate me!\nJudge:\nWell, yes... You are absolutely correct, Ms. Andrews. The law does provide us with a way to avoid self-incrimination... by allowing a witness to not testify if the testimony can cause damage to themselves.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!? (\"Pleading the fifth\" is not something most people would think to do on the spot! Actually... Thinking back to yesterday in Mr. Engarde's room...)\nvon Karma:\nAdrian Andrews!\nAndrews:\nY-Yes...?\nvon Karma:\nThink hard about what we just discussed. Understood!?\nAndrews:\nA-Alright... ...\nPhoenix:\n(That's it. That's when Franziska planted this idea into her head... She must have told Ms. Andrews to not testify if things looked bad.)\nMia:\nYou did a good job proving everything up to this point, Phoenix. But there is still one thing you haven't done.\nPhoenix:\nSomething I haven't done...?\nEdgeworth:\nHeh heh heh. What's wrong, Wright? Are you finished already? Run out of evidence?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nWhat is so humorous, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sure you realize this as well, Your Honor... But, everything the good lawyer here has proven up to this point is meaningless.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nEdgeworth:\nEverything you have proven is circumstantial.\nPhoenix:\nCircumstantial...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, circumstantial. You have yet to provide a single piece of definitive proof. Proof that Ms. Andrews, did in fact, harbor a wish to murder Mr. Corrida!\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Andrews! You... Did you want to kill Mr. Corrida...?\nAndrews:\nI believe this may lead to me incriminating myself, so I will abstain from answering.\nJudge:\nBut Ms. Andrews... If you do that, it would be the same as admitting your guilt, don't you think...?\nAndrews:\nMaybe so, or maybe not. There is nothing to prove it either way. Besides, you don't even know what crime I would be \"guilty\" of due to my silence.\nPhoenix:\n(NO!! She's taking that defiant attitude again!) M-Mia! What should we do...?\nMia:\nSomehow, we've landed in the worst possible situation.\nJudge:\nI think we have reached a certain conclusion at this point in time. Ms. Adrian Andrews has refused to testify. And the defense's theory that she is the actual murderer... has not been fully substantiated with solid, definitive proof.\nPhoenix:\nBut! That's not true!\nJudge:\nIn this situation, there is only one thing this court can do. And that is to declare a recess.\nPhoenix:\nR-Recess...!?\nJudge:\nI request that both the prosecution and the defense look further into this matter. And at tomorrow's trial...\nPhoenix:\n(T-Tomorrow...!? We don't have a \"tomorrow\"! If we don't get a not guilty verdict today, then...)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nPlease wait, Your Honor! Th...That's not necessary! The trial... Please continue the trial!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you sweating for...? Your client is getting one more day to live, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\nThat... That's not it! This isn't about that. Edgeworth! I know you know who the real killer is! Please... Let the trial continue! If I don't get the verdict... then Maya...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nJudge:\nBut it's impossible to continue as long as the witness refuses to testify. Now then, this court is...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIt is not impossible for this trial to continue.\nAndrews:\n...!\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you...\nEdgeworth:\nIt's true Ms. Andrews holds the right against self-incrimination; however, if the topic of conversation were something unrelated to whatever she may be guilty of, then she has no right to withhold testimony!\nJudge:\nY-Yes, that is very true, but...\nEdgeworth:\nActually, there is one little thing that I'm curious about. Ms. Andrews.\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nWhen you found the victim's dead body, you poured yourself a glass of juice.\nAndrews:\nY-Yes... And...?\nEdgeworth:\nI can't help but think how unnatural that is. Usually when one finds a body, they are shaken up, not stirring a glass of juice.\nAndrews:\nSo my actions were \"unusual\"? But I've already...\nEdgeworth:\nBefore you speak, I want to state that if you have a reason behind your actions, I would like you to testify to that effect.\nAndrews:\nTestify...!?\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor! I would like to request that the witness testify again as to what happened when she first discovered the victim's body! Whatever we find out in this testimony should in no way implicate the witness.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nMia:\nI don't know what it is about Edgeworth today, but I can't get a good read off of him. Is he friend or foe? I just don't know...\nJudge:\nThe court acknowledges the prosecution's request. Ms. Andrews, if you please.\nWitness Testimony\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nThat glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.\nI was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.\nAnd Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.\nWhen I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.\nTo be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.\nWhen I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.\nJudge:\nHmm... So you poured that glass of juice for the victim. Why didn't you say so in your earlier testimony?\nAndrews:\n...I didn't think I needed to include something so trivial.\nMia:\nPhoenix. Please be careful here. If you can't find anything wrong with this testimony, then there's nothing left...\nPhoenix:\nI know. (Edgeworth... What the heck is going on in that brain of yours...?)\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nThat glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut... There wasn't anyone else in the room, right?\nAndrews:\nOf course not.\nPhoenix:\nThen... who did you pour it for?\nAndrews:\nMr. Wright. There is a rhyme and reason for everything. Can you wait just a little longer for it to be revealed to you?\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, Wright, \"Be quiet and listen.\"\nAndrews:\nPrecisely! I couldn't have said it better myself.\nPhoenix:\nUnnngh...\nAndrews:\nI was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo, it was a \"mess\"? Are you sure it wasn't messy because of your fight with Mr. Corrida...?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI understand your frustrations at not being able to prove your theory. However... Before you go accusing people of crimes, go find yourself some evidence!\nPhoenix:\n(Grr...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnd then, what did you see next, witness?\nAndrews:\nAnd Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSlumped over?\nAndrews:\nYes, he was just sitting there with his head tilted forward, eyes closed. He really looked like he was sleeping.\nPhoenix:\n(...Is it just me or did that right there sound a little... odd?)\nAndrews:\nWhen I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThen what did cross your mind?\nAndrews:\nI thought maybe he had smashed everything up in anger because he lost the Grand Prix. And then felt tired after his rampage, so he decided to take a nap... Anyways, that's what I thought...\nJudge:\nI see. So you didn't think he was dead at all.\nPresent Crime Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"\nAndrews:\nTo be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou thought he fainted...?\nAndrews:\nI thought he was asleep at first. But then, the room was in such a messy state... I thought maybe he had gotten into a fight with someone...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that's when you went to pour the glass of juice?\nAndrews:\nYes. He always has a hard time waking up. So Juan always has a glass of tomato juice to drink.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. And after that, what happened next?\nPresent Crime Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"\nAndrews:\nWhen I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd how did you come to realize that he was, in fact, dead?\nAndrews:\nI shook him over and over, but I never got a response... So I set the glass down on the dresser and tried to take his pulse. I... I was shocked... and staggered backward...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd knocked the flower vase over. So that's what happened.\nAndrews:\n...Yes.\nPresent Crime Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"\nMia:\n... This is what it all comes down to.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nThis is the absolute end for both sides... And Adrian is letting her guard down. Phoenix, now is our best chance yet to kill the prosecution's case!\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that a bit harsh...? Ms. Andrews... Will you tell us the truth this time...?)\nPhoenix:\nSo you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\nAndrews:\nNo, not at all...\nPhoenix:\nEven though this is what you saw when you discovered the body?\nAndrews:\n...Ah!\nJudge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nIsn't it obvious, Your Honor? There is a knife sticking straight out of Mr. Corrida's chest! Anyone who saw this scene would have immediately thought that here was a dead man!\nAndrews:\nAh... Um... That's... Well, you see...\nPhoenix:\nI doubt a single person in the world would mistake this for someone who fainted, and then so nonchalantly go pour something to drink!\nJudge:\nY-Your point is...?\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews! Your testimony just now... It was all one giant lie!\nAndrews:\nUngh!\nPhoenix:\nAnd your lie has proven one thing very clearly. That you are the real killer!\nAndrews:\n... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!\nJudge:\nIt looks like the defense has somehow brought the ugly truth to light. The defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde, is not guilty after all...\nAndrews:\nThat... But that's impossible! You're wrong...\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Andrews! Try to have some composure!\nAndrews:\nIt... It wasn't me... It wasn't me, I tell you! It was Matt! I swear it! He's the one who killed Juan!\nPhoenix:\nBut you were the one who refused to testify! And your reason for not doing so was that you \"might\" end up incriminating yourself!\nAndrews:\nTh-That's because...\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews, I will give you one last chance. What exactly are you hiding that may \"incriminate\" you?\nAndrews:\n... I... I... I refuse... to testify.\nJudge:\nThen there is no need for this court to continue any further. Mr. Matt Engarde's innocence has been clearly demonstrated.\nPhoenix:\n(Is... Is it... over...? Have we... Have we found the truth at last...?)\nMia:\nWhat's wrong, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nUsually... Well, usually, the real killer confesses his or her guilt. And now that I think about it, this is the first time someone hasn't.\nJudge:\nNow then, I would like to hand down my verdict for Mr. Matt Engarde.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. The prosecution feels that it would be premature to pass down a verdict at this time.\nJudge:\nWh-What...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe reason is quite simple. This witness has yet to speak the absolute, real truth.\nJudge:\nThe \"absolute, real truth\"...? What are you...?\nEdgeworth:\nWitness... Don't you understand yet?\nAndrews:\n...Huh?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know who planted this silly idea in your head, but as long as you \"protect\" yourself through your silence, Matt Engarde will go free. And in his place... YOU will become the guilty party!\nAndrews:\n...Th-That's... That's a lie! I... I don't believe you!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nAndrews:\nI... I was told... If I spoke... If I spoke, then it would be all over... And Matt would never be declared guilty...\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What in the world is she talking about!? Has she lost it!?)\nAndrews:\nI... I can't speak about it... I'm too scared...\nMia:\nIt's Franziska von Karma...\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nMia:\nDon't you rememeber, Phoenix? Ms. Andrews lives by gripping tightly onto the words of another. Because she doesn't have the strength to believe in herself.\nPhoenix:\nTh...Then, right now... Ms. Andrews is...\nMia:\nYesterday, she was tossed a life-saver by Ms. von Karma. \"Don't say a word, no matter what happens. If you do, Matt Engarde will be acquitted.\" Ms. Andrews undyingly believes in those words right now, and is clinging onto them...\nPhoenix:\n(Th-Then what should we do!? This... This is the first time I've ever come across anything like this! But Ms. Andrews has to be the killer, right!? All we have to do now is... is get our not guilty... That is my only priority!)\nAndrews:\nIt wasn't me! I'm begging you, please believe me! I didn't kill Juan! Help... Please... Someone... Help me...!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe court can't continue on like this, therefore I'd like to hear what you intend to do.\nPhoenix:\n(What I intend to do...!? Wh-What am I supposed to do!? What am I supposed to say!?)\nEdgeworth:\nWright! I suggest you think very carefully about this! Think about what this witness did, and what she did NOT do! And think about who is the real mastermind behind this crime!\nPhoenix:\n(Who's the real mastermind? Isn't that obvious!? There's no one else it could be except the woman crying over there! ...Right?)\nEdgeworth:\nCome now! What will you do!? What kind of man are you, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?\nRequest \"not guilty\" verdict\nPhoenix:\n(No matter what she says... Ms. Andrews is the only person it could be! Not to mention... I don't have a choice. I have to win a complete acquittal today!) Y-Your Honor! The defense believes there is enough evidence to substantiate our claim! Therefore, we motion that this court passes a verdict of \"not guilty\" as soon as possible!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nI'm disappointed in you, Wright! What have you learned in this past year!?\nLeads to:\n\"That's enough!\"\nForce Andrews to testify\nPhoenix:\n(I have to win a complete acquittal today... There's no way around that! But... I can't bring myself to do it like this! Not when she's making a face like that...) Ms. Andrews! I would like to know what you are really hiding!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Wright! Are you sure you know what you're doing!?\nPhoenix:\nSure, Mr. Engarde would get an acquittal, but in his place, you would be found guilty! Is this... Is this how you really want this trial to end!?\nAndrews:\nB-Be quiet... How dare you!? You... You're trying to trick me!\nLeads to:\n\"That's enough!\"\nJudge:\nThat's enough! I commend you for trying, Mr. Edgeworth. However, it's clear that the defense's theory is the truth.\nAndrews:\n...Y...You're wrong...\nEdgeworth:\n... What a shame... (Changed from [Such a shame...] in the original release)\nAndrews:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nI had hoped things wouldn't come to this, however...\nJudge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Andrews. Since you absolutely refuse to testify... It falls on my shoulders to disclose this to the court.\nAndrews:\n...S...Stop...\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis witness... How should I put this... She has an illness.\nAndrews:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd because of this illness, she has tried to commit suicide in the past.\nAndrews:\nS-Stop... Please stop...!\nEdgeworth:\nNo matter how much you want to hide it, it's no use. I have the evidence right here.\nAndrews:\nAh! Th-That's...!\nPhoenix:\n(That's the second part of the suicide report -- the attempted suicide report!)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat will you do now, witness? You know what I am about to do, don't you? I will now reveal to the court, the true nature of the pitiful woman known as Adrian Andrews!\nPhoenix:\n(The secret of her dependent nature... (Changed from [The secret of her co-dependant [sic] nature...] in the original release) Having other people know about it scares her more than anything else in the world...)\nAndrews:\nPlease! Please STOP!! I beg you!! If people find out... If people find out... I... I'll...\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're going to say you would \"choose death\", that is of no concern to me.\nAndrews:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth... How can you be so cold...!?)\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, before you die... I will pull the truth from your still-breathing lips! (Changed from [I will pull the truth from your breathing lips!] in the original release) ... No matter what I have to do.\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nSo, will you tell the court yourself, or shall I!? Either is fine with me.\nAndrews:\n... ... ...I... I'll talk. But please... Help me... N-Nothing matters anymore...\nWitness Testimony\n-- My \"Crime\" --\nAndrews:\nWhen I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest.\nWhen I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan.\nOnce I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room.\nAnd then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button.\nJust when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience.\nAnd that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume.\nJudge:\nS-Stabbed the body!? With the knife!? But why would you do that!?\nAndrews:\nIsn't it obvious? To pin the blame on a certain person... A certain cowardly man!\nJudge:\nWh... What do you mean by all of this...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt might take this court a little while to understand, but... This is the truth.\nAndrews:\nThe real killer is Matt! That scumbag of a man! I'll never forgive him! He's trying to escape his guilt again! Just like last time!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Last time\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nSo, Ms. Andrews stabbed the victim, Juan Corrida, in the chest with the knife. However, she didn't do it with murder in mind. She did it with the intent of framing Matt Engarde for the murder... And this! This is her \"crime\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-WHAT!? How is this possible!? I mean... Wasn't Ms. Andrews supposed to be the real murderer!?)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Please get over your shock and commence the cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- My \"Crime\" --\nAndrews:\nWhen I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut you could tell from the state the room was in, that there must have been a fight! Are you telling the truth when you say that you did not know he was dead?\nAndrews:\nHe... had a scarf tied around his neck... But that scarf is a part of the Jammin' Ninja's costume... So... So I didn't think anything about it was strange... His head was also... tilted down a bit, so I couldn't see his face that well... That's why I thought I'd wake him up... and went to pour the juice...\nAndrews:\nWhen I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhat is this \"plan\" you had?\nAndrews:\n... I knew right away the murderer was Matt. I knew because Juan... He was going to expose Matt's weakest weakpoint to the world. So Matt did this to stop Juan, and silence him for good. That's when I thought, \"I should forge some evidence and pin this crime on Matt.\"\nEdgeworth:\nSo the forged pieces of evidence were the knife and the button...\nAndrews:\nThe first thing that came to mind was to plant the knife.\nAndrews:\nOnce I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThat was so you could get the knife, correct?\nAndrews:\nThe knife Matt used at dinner had his fingerprints all over it. I thought if I used that, then the police would certainly turn their eyes towards him. Matt was napping with his costume on at the time. I slipped in, took the knife, and returned to the scene of the crime.\nAndrews:\nAnd then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo you were the one to stab the victim with that knife.\nAndrews:\nIt gives me goosebumps to think about it now... What a horrible thing I did... But... At the time, I couldn't control my own body. It moved on its own. Then, when I stabbed Juan's dead body... I suddenly realized something. If I used the button somehow, I could make Matt look even more suspect.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you thought to rip one of the buttons off and then plant it in Mr. Engarde's hakama.\nAndrews:\nYes... That's what I had planned to do. ...But things never go that smoothly, do they?\nAndrews:\nJust when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAn \"inconvenience\"...?\nAndrews:\nThere was a woman with a camera at the ready, loitering in the hallway.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm willing to bet my spikes it was Lotta...)\nAndrews:\nThere was also a woman with a ray gun at the ready pacing back and forth...\nPhoenix:\n(That's Ms. Oldbag for you...)\nAndrews:\nI had already been caught and made into a big scoop for a certain weekly tabloid once, so I couldn't very well go out looking like myself and get caught again.\nAndrews:\nAnd that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one who prepared that costume, weren't you?\nAndrews:\nYes. I took it from Global Studios... I also put it into Juan's guitar case the day before the award ceremony.\nEdgeworth:\nYou did this in preparation for the press conference, correct?\nAndrews:\nYes, Juan wanted to wear that costume and hold a press conference in it. He was going to disclose Matt's big secret there.\nJudge:\nAnd what is this \"secret\"...?\nAndrews:\n... ...That, I don't know. Anyway, I thought that if I were to leave Juan's room in the Nickel Samurai costume... then people would think that Matt was the \"real\" murderer. I was very careful not to leave any fingerprints when I opened the guitar case. I absolutely did not want anyone to know about the costume.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't want to concede, but this testimony... it rings of the truth...)\nMia:\nI'm sorry, Phoenix...\nPhoenix:\nN-No, please, don't apologize to me. We were both taken by surprise.\nMia:\nStill, I'm sorry...\nAfter pressing all statements:\nJudge:\nI think we've heard enough! So, after that, you went back to Mr. Engarde's room and planted the button?\nAndrews:\n...Into Matt's hakama? Yes. After that, I folded up the costume I was wearing and put it into a bag. Then I snuck it out of the hotel and got rid of it.\nJudge:\nM-My word... What does all this mean...?\nAndrews:\n...Mr. Edgeworth, is it?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nAndrews:\nThe real criminal... is Matt Engarde!! Yesterday... That woman prosecutor sat me down for a talk...\nPhoenix:\n(Franziska, huh...)\nAndrews:\nShe said that I should, under no circumstances, confess to what I had done. That if I just kept quiet, then Matt would be found guilty for sure... I... I had no choice but to believe in her words...\nPhoenix:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\n...............\nJudge:\nWhat this witness has done is clearly unlawful. However... As long as her testimony stands, we can be certain she is not the real killer!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait, Your Honor! The defense still...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWright.\nPhoenix:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's pointless. At this point in time, it is not possible to indict Ms. Andrews on anything.\nJudge:\nYes, exactly. There isn't a single piece of evidence that points to her as the murderer. The cross-examination of this witness is over. And so is today's trial. You couldn't establish that the witness was the culprit. Please let it go, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nB-But!\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth, please place Ms. Andrews under arrest for further questioning.\nEdgeworth:\nUnderstood, Your Honor. The prosecution will arrange for her detention immediately.\nJudge:\nThat's all. Court is adjourned for today!\nPhoenix:\n(Today's... Today's trial... It's over...! And I didn't win an acquittal!)\nEdgeworth:\nWitness... Would you mind if I asked you something?\nPhoenix:\n...! (Edgeworth...?)\nAndrews:\nWhat is it...?\nEdgeworth:\nBefore you leave court today, I wondered if I might look at one thing. The card in your hand. It's had my interest for quite some time now. What exactly is it...?\nAndrews:\nOh, this...? Mr. Wright also asked about this. Although I didn't remember at the time you asked me about it, Mr. Wright, I remembered just now. I found this in the room on that day.\nPhoenix:\n\"The room\"...?\nEdgeworth:\n\"That day\"...?\nAndrews:\nYes. I found this card when I discovered Juan's body. It was lying there right next to him...\nPhoenix:\nYou found that card... next to the victim's body?\nAndrews:\nI suppose I must have unconsciously slipped it into my pocket... ...But it's not as if this card has any relevance to Juan's murder, right?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I guess not. But it's still a strange card, if you ask me... But as far as a clue to this case...? I don't see why...)\n???:\nEdgeworth:\nWitness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry!\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time!\nAndrews:\nI... I didn't mean to...\nMia:\nWh-What is this all about...?\nPhoenix:\n(I've never seen Edgeworth so emotional before... (Changed from [I've never seen such an emotional Edgeworth in my entire life...] in the original release) That card... What in the world is it? And what does it mean...!?)\nTo be continued.\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?\nJudge:\nUh... I'm not sure I follow you.\nPhoenix:\nIt clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...\nJudge:\nYou don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!\nJudge:\n...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really?\nJudge:\nObjection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHow exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?\nPhoenix:\nThey aren't, are they...\nJudge:\nNot at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!\nJudge:\n... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)\nToo many penalties\nJudge:\nThat's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Matt Engarde...\nGuilty\nJudge:\nThe accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!\nFarewell, My Turnabout\nTranscript\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nMarch 22, 5:24 PMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPearl:\nMystic Maya... M-Mystic Mayaaa... *sniffle, sniffle*\nPhoenix:\nThere, there, Pearls...\nPearl:\nI... I can't take it... anymore... ...Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...\nPhoenix:\nL-Look! It'll be alright! Everything may still work out.\nPearl:\nHm...?\nPhoenix:\nThe condition was that we had to get a \"not guilty\" verdict. And so far, the kidnapper has kept his word and hasn't hurt Maya. And he won't because Mr. Engarde hasn't been given a \"guilty\" sentence yet!\nPearl:\nUnngg... Nnmff... *sniffle, sniffle*\nPhoenix:\nCheer up! We don't have time to stand around crying! We have to get going!\nPearl:\n... Y-You're right... Mystic Maya is in much more pain than I am!\nPhoenix:\nYes, that's right. So...\n???:\nHey! You guys! Glad I caught you, pal!\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Scruffy Detective...\nPhoenix:\n(...Oh boy. Looks like Detective Gumshoe... has been dubbed \"Mr. Scruffy Detective\" in Pearls's book now...)\nGumshoe:\nIt's just plain ol' \"Mr. Dick Gumshoe\" now, and I came to talk to you, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(But we're kind of busy right now...)\nExamine\nCharley the plant\nGumshoe:\nHey, it's wilting a little!\nPearl:\nI'll... I'll give it some delicious water, pal!\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK... I already did that...\nGumshoe:\n...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?\nPhoenix:\n(Did he just call the watering can, \"Mr.\"?)\nPoster\nPearl:\nThis is the... uh... Nickel Samurai, right?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's right.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!?\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.\nPearl:\nOh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either...\nGumshoe:\nB-But I can read AND I'm tall, pal!\nPhoenix:\nP-Please stop competing with an 8 year old... It's disturbing...\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh! I cleaned it up even more for you last night!\nGumshoe:\nB-But I can get it even more cleaner, pal!\nPearl:\nAaah! That's... That's for the toilet!!\nPhoenix:\n(What a mess. Literally...)\nTalk\nThe future\nPhoenix:\nSo, what are you going to do from now on?\nGumshoe:\nWhadaya mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you've been fired, right? So, do you have a new job lined up yet?\nGumshoe:\nOh, that! A-Ah... What am I supposed to do now, pal!? I... I don't have anything coming in at all until my next payday!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you talking about!? You don't have another payday!\nGumshoe:\n... I guess that means I'm just gonna half [sic] to work here at your place, pal!\nPhoenix:\nS-SAY WHAT!?\nGumshoe:\nYou'll be searching for things that will prove Mr. Engarde's innocence all day, right?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well... yeah...\nGumshoe:\nSo yeah! I'm going to help you, pal! I've got lots of experience in investigating, and watching over people's places! And I'm great at making really simple meals, pal! I'll take care of it all!\nPearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Let's let Mr. Scruffy Detective take care of things!\nPhoenix:\nA-Ah... OK... By the way, what's your best dish?\nGumshoe:\nInstant noodles, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(Why am I surrounded by people who only eat cheap, unhealthy foods...?)\nEdgeworth\nGumshoe:\n...That was the first time I've ever seen Mr. Edgeworth act like that... Never thought he'd say something like, he didn't care if Ms. Andrews killed herself...\nPearl:\nH-He said that!? That's horrible...\nGumshoe:\nBut because of him doing that, we got the truth finally.\nPhoenix:\n...The truth... (Ms. Andrews' last testimony; I wonder if that was the truth...?) I'll give you that there was nothing strange in her testimony itself. But... I still think there is something fundamentally wrong with the whole thing.\nGumshoe:\nYou mean about \"that\" thing, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWhy would she want to -- no, I mean, almost \"need\" to frame Mr. Engarde... I couldn't figure that out from anything she said all day!\nGumshoe:\n... Then... Then you're saying that testimony... was a lie...?\nPhoenix:\nNot a lie, per se... It just feels like there's more here than meets the eye. Or that's what Edgeworth would like us to believe...\nPearl:\nTh-That's such a dirty trick! Even that woman prosecutor was better than that!\nPhoenix:\n(Franziska von Karma...) Speaking of Ms. von Karma, do you have any more information on her condition? Wasn't she shot this morning!?\nFranziska (appears after \"Edgeworth\")\nGumshoe:\nMs. von Karma was shot today on the way to the trial by a pistol, pal.\nPhoenix:\nB-But she's going to be fine, right? I mean, Edgeworth said she was in \"stable condition\", but...\nGumshoe:\nWell, she was shot in the shoulder, so she's OK and still hanging in there. They should be done taking the bullet out, so she's probably resting at the hospital.\nPhoenix:\nWhich one...?\nGumshoe:\nWhat? Are you going to visit her, pal?\nPhoenix:\nN-No... Well, I was kind of thinking about it...\nGumshoe:\nHey! You've actually got a heart, don't you!? She looked like she was being tortured to death not being able to go to the trial today, so maybe it'd be good for her if you went and let her whip you for a bit, pal!\nPearl:\nLet's go let her whip us, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nNow I'm DEFINITELY not going.\nGumshoe:\nUm... let's see... The name of the hospital... Oh yeah! The \"Hotti Clinic\"!\nPhoenix:\n(That name sends a chill down my spine... Well, I guess it can't hurt to stop by and say hi...)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nLook, it's my attorney's badge.\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's a little tarnished, don't you think, pal? Don't worry! I'll make it all sparkly shiny again!\nPhoenix:\n(I... I'm really touched...)\nRadio Transceiver\nGumshoe:\nHave you heard anything from the kidnapper...?\nPhoenix:\n...No... not yet.\nGumshoe:\nI'm sure once he hears what happened at the trial today, he'll call, pal. But remember! You can't provoke him when you get to talk to him!\nJammin' Ninja's Button\nGumshoe:\nWhen I saw that button, I thought to myself, \"This is gonna prove Mr. Engarde's guilty!\"... But it looks like there was a lot more to it than I thought, huh pal?\nPhoenix:\nYou're a pro. You should know better than to say something like that.\nGumshoe:\nW-Well, I'm not a cop anymore. Just a regular helper around the office now, so...\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if he misses working down at the precinct...?)\nKnife\nGumshoe:\nWho would've thought that this knife Mr. Engarde used to eat his dinner steak with...\nPhoenix:\nGo on...\nGumshoe:\n...That it would be stabbed into the victim's body by Ms. Andrews, of all people. I guess she just hated the victim that much, huh pal?\nPhoenix:\nThe question isn't why she hated the victim to that extend, but rather why she tried to pin the murder on Mr. Engarde.\nPearl:\nI wonder if she really hates Mr. Engarde?\nLotta's Photo\nGumshoe:\nSo this \"Nickel Samurai\" was really Ms. Andrews, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. This is either when she went to Mr. Engarde's room to get the knife... ...or when she was done with the foul deed. But I guess we'll never know.\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nIt'll be OK! You'll see her again, little missy!\nPearl:\nY-Yeah!\nGumshoe:\nIt's really important that you don't give up!\nPearl:\nO-OK!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess a big voice really does give you a sense of presence...)\nPearl:\nI... I won't give up. Ever!\nPearl Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nCheer up! You can't give in, missy!\nPearl:\nY-Yeah!\nGumshoe:\nHey! I know! I'll show you something cool! How's this? It's a real, genuine pistol... ... I... I don't have my pistol or my police badge anymore...\nPearl:\nCheer up! You can't give in!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yeah!\nPhoenix:\n(What are those two doing...?)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nPeople are jealous of my roguishly cool \"detective look\", pal. It's because of this look that I passed the detective's test, you know.\nPhoenix:\nOh.\nGumshoe:\nBut you know, people can't coast through life on their looks alone, pal.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you can't count on your looks alone.\nPearl:\nWow... I learned something new today...\nFranziska von Karma profile\nPhoenix:\nIs she alright...? After being shot, I mean...\nGumshoe:\nHer wound isn't that bad... Well, the gunshot wound anyway... But the wound to her pride, now that's a different story, pal.\nPhoenix:\nThe wound to her pride?\nGumshoe:\nWell, until now, she's always upheld the \"Von Karma Creed\", but since she came here, well, you've given her pride quite a beating, pal.\nPhoenix:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nI mean, she may act all grown-up, but she's really still just an 18 year old. ...Quite frankly, I worry about her, pal.\nMiles Edgeworth profile\nGumshoe:\nThat's the first time I've seen that side of Mr. Edgeworth, pal. Forcing people to say what he wants them to during testimony... I want to know what in the world happened to him all this time he's been gone...\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nI can't believe it. Maya getting kidnapped all because of this guy... I mean, what kind of person is the real murderer anyway!?\nPearl:\nMaybe they're a big fan of Mr. Engarde?\nPhoenix:\n(But the kidnapper's voice... He sounded like an old man to me...)\nAdrian Andrews profile\nGumshoe:\nMy impression of her has totally changed, pal.\nPhoenix:\nUm... So, where is she right now...?\nGumshoe:\nI'm sure she's being questioned down at the precinct. At the very least about messing with the body, and obstructing the investigation. And she'll probably be staying over at the detention center...\nPhoenix:\n(The detention center, huh...)\nCeleste Inpax profile\nGumshoe:\nShe was Ms. Adrian Andrews' mentor.\nPhoenix:\n(Because of the suicide of the mentor she depended on, Adrian Andrews tried to follow her in an attempted suicide... Now the question is, who is Ms. Andrews relying on now...?)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nCould you please take a look at this...?\nGumshoe:\nUm... I can't think of anything to say about this, pal. ... Wh-Why don't I make us some instant noodles, instead?\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's OK... Really.\nMarch 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(From what the guard told me... It sounds like along with Mr. Engarde, Ms. Andrews is also being detained here.)\nPearl:\nThen we should talk with them since we're here...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but both of them are still in questioning.\nPearl:\nHmm... And we don't have time to waste.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, visiting hours are almost over...)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera.\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitor's the visitor's room. Catching a few z's while he's standing; now that's a good way to spend free time.\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPearl:\nAlright now, Mr. Nick! Let's go look for clues! We have to, for Mystic Maya's sake...\n???:\nYou shall not pass!\nPhoenix:\n*gasp* Ms. Oldbag!\nOldbag:\nDon't devalue my name and turn it into a gasp, you spiky-headed poof! Because of you, I've been made to look like the bad guy again! Although, I did get a piece of gum from Edgey-boy, just as he promised... But what I really wanted was something much more valuable! I wanted Edgey-poo's heart! I want it all for me! It's all your fault! You've awakened the wild beast inside of this Oldbag! Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! (Changed from [Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!] in the original release)\nPearl:\nAah! Ms. Oldbag!\nOldbag:\nKeep your hands off of me! This helmet is airtight! No air's [sic] gets in and no air gets out!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Then why do you keep putting it on...?Umm... What does your helmet have to do with anything?\nOldbag:\nHmph! Don't tal release ({{{2}}})hink you can get me to move with silly questions! You're going to have to defeat me if you want to get by!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not hearing this...)\nExamine\nAnywhere\nOldbag:\nHey! I said no restless loitering and no touching! You're interfering with my watch, and that's a no-no!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Looks like in order to search around here... I have to first get this kooky \"alien\" to go away...)\nTalk\nAny options\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nOldbag:\nHah! You're a million light-years too early to be asking ME questions, whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh.

Could you please take a look at this...?\nOldbag:\nHmph! Sorry, sonny. I can't see it very well through this helmet!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Looks like the only way I'm going to get any investigating done... is to first do something about this kooky \"alien\"...)\nOldbag:\nI see that look in your eyes! You stop thinking I'm an alien from outer space this instant!\nMarch 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nPearl:\nWow. Everybody looks really busy with something or another...\nPhoenix:\nHmm... They're probably strengthening the evidence for tomorrow's trial.\nDetective:\nHey! Hurry up with that, will ya!? Pass that victim's list around! ...Now you're speaking nonsense! There's more than 100 people on there!\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick...? Is Mr. Engarde a really bad, terrible criminal...?\nPhoenix:\n... Actually, Pearls, never mind. It sounds like they're working on a different case...\nExamine\nDetective on left\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.\nDetective:\n\"...Very well. Now why do you want to work for our company?\" \"Well, that would have to be because I feel I would like to help this company grow.\"\nPhoenix:\n... He must be doing image training for corporate interviews.\nChief\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.\nChief:\nWHAT!? Prosecutor von Karma was shot in front of the courthouse!? Wh-Who did it!? Who shot her!?\nPhoenix:\n(I have a sneaking suspicion that even Gumshoe could do this guy's job...)\nAfter clearing \"Franziska\" Talk option in Wright & Co.

Hmm...\nPhoenix:\nAh, hi... ...Wait a second! You're...!\n???:\nHmm, yes... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh.\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you still here!?\nHotti:\nHmm, yes... What is it? Hmm... Can I help you? You can tell me... Hmm, yes...\n???:\nDirector Hotti!\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth...\nHotti:\nHmm, yes... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh. ...Oh, you're the man from this morning. Hmm, yes... What is it?... Uh huh...\nEdgeworth:\nDirector. Franziska... How is Franziska von Karma?\nHotti:\nHmm... You don't need to worry. Hmm, yes... She's in good hands... Because, you see... I'm personally taking good care of her... Hmm, yes... Hee hee. Hmm, yes... and that thing... that surgery... It went well.\nEdgeworth:\n...You have my gratitude.\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like Edgeworth doesn't know about this \"Director\" and his secret...)\nHotti:\nShe looked so pitiful -- absolutely terrified. Hmm, yes... But I understand, hmm... Hmm, yes... Her opponent was a gun, after all. Uh huh. And when I snuck up on her real secret-like, she would scream really loud. Hmm, yes.\nEdgeworth:\nI see.\nHotti:\nAh, but she's really cute too. When I'd do that, she'd whip me with her whip, uh huh... Boy did I cry like a baby. Hmm, yes... But I think I could get used to it. Hmm... Hmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nGo back to your room.\nHotti:\nYou're so mean, uh huh... So mean... my frisky Friska. But that's good too-- Hmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! OK, OK... I... Hmm, yes... It's time for my IV drops. Hmm, yes...\nvon Karma:\n... And what are those tulips doing in your hand, Mr. Phoenix Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! I knew I shouldn't have come here!)\nExamine\nWaiting room on left\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the waiting area. It's got the feeling of one and there are sofas lined up... but I don't see all that many patients.\nHotti:\nHmm, yes... well, visiting hours are over. That's why... Hmm... It's time for nightly consultations to begin... Mine, that is... Heh heh heh.\nPhoenix:\n(...Isn't there anyone keeping an eye on this guy...?)\nDoor at the back\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder where that door way down there leads to...?)\nHotti:\nOh, that's the X-ray room. Hmm, yes...\nPhoenix:\nH-H-How did you know what I was thinking!?\nHotti:\nHmm, yes... Well, it's... Because that's the X-ray room... Uh huh, yes...\nPhoenix:\n(There is something very peculiar about this guy... Because I know it's not me...)\nLimping patient\nPhoenix:\nThis patient is undergoing rehabilitation.\nHotti:\nWasn't that patient standing in the same spot the last time you came to visit? Doesn't look like they've moved any closer to the reception desk, huh? Is this clinic really doing anything!? Is that patient really getting better!? Hmm...\nPhoenix:\nHey! Don't just cut into my monologue like that! I'm explaining things here!\nHotti:\nAh, sorry. Hmm, yes... Most sorry... Yes... Uh, huh...\nReception area\nPhoenix:\nThis is the clinic's reception desk, but it doesn't look like there's anyone at the counter. On the wall is this month's \"Word to the Wise\": \"Put your best foot forward.\" Putting this up at a general clinic like this is doesn't really mean much, does it...?\nTalk\nThe shooting\nvon Karma:\nI was shot in front of the courthouse, in my right shoulder. Hmph... It's no big deal. This sort of thing happens all the time. I even had full intentions of running the trial this morning.\nPearl:\nBut! But that would've been too much for you! (Changed from [But! But that would've been too much!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(There's no need to act tough in front of us, you know...) (Changed from [Yeah! You looked like you were deathly scared until only a few minutes ago...] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nRegardless, I was dragged here by THAT man over there. (Changed from [But I was dragged here by THAT prosecutor.] in the original release) He was so unyielding, one has to wonder if he was simply interested in stealing my case. (Changed from [He even went so far as to grab me by the wrist the whole way here.] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nIt was the only logical course of action given the bullet was still lodged in your shoulder. But by taking over the case... (Changed from [But with me doing so...] in the original release) I found myself having to clean up after you and that irresponsible deal you made.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(I think I know what \"deal\" he's referring to...)\nThe deal\nPhoenix:\nMs. von Karma. You made a deal with Ms. Andrews yesterday, didn't you?\nvon Karma:\nI don't know what you mean.\nPhoenix:\nIn order to make sure you got your guilty verdict on Mr. Engarde, you told Ms. Andrews to not testify in court today.\nvon Karma:\nHmph, I don't know what you're talking about. Do you have proof that I made such a deal?\nPhoenix:\nY-You're denying it!?\nvon Karma:\n... It looks like you were lucky, Mr. Phoenix Wright. If I had been in court today, this trial would already be over.\nPhoenix:\nAll while hiding Ms. Andrews' own crime?\nvon Karma:\nThat isn't my problem. Whether she had tampered with evidence or not... I have only one objective. To find Engarde guilty of murder. The end justifies the means, Mr. Phoenix Wright. The end justifies the means.\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nAah!\nvon Karma:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that's all I get...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n...Ms. von Karma. Adrian Andrews believed you when you said, \"If you don't tell the truth of what really happened, then Engarde will be found guilty.\"\nvon Karma:\nAnd what does that have to do with me?\nPhoenix:\nBecause of that, she is now in danger of being found guilty herself! All because she believed in your words until the very end...\nvon Karma:\n... That still has nothing to do with me. She's just a weak person, that's all.\nPhoenix:\nBut you had to know she was... OWWW!\nvon Karma:\n... I think visiting hours here are about over. So, if you'll excuse me.\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong? Why did she suddenly cut you off...?\nPhoenix:\n(Probably because she thinks I had the advantage in that argument... ...Edgeworth...)\nTalk\nToday's trial\nPhoenix:\nWhat happened today at the trial, Edgeworth? That was not like you at all...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI mean, I know you knew about Ms. Andrews' condition. You could have made her testify as many times as you wanted, but to go that far...!\nEdgeworth:\n...Ah, but she wouldn't testify about THAT until I said something. Listen, Wright. The courtroom is a garden of judgment. I am putting myself on the line when I stand in there. And that's why I made the witness do the same... It's only natural.\nAdrian's card\nPhoenix:\nBy the way, Edgeworth... You were really angry in court today... That's rare for you.\nEdgeworth:\nWitness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry!\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time!\nPhoenix:\nThat card... What in the world is it?\nEdgeworth:\n... You mean this...? ... Listen, Wright. This is top secret information. You absolutely cannot leak this. A special investigation team has existed for a number of years, but few know of it.\nPhoenix:\nI-I understand.\nEdgeworth:\nTheir task is to find the \"owner\" of this card... A man called Shelly de Killer. And just as his name states, he is a \"killer\", an assassin. The best, at that.\nPhoenix:\n(An assassin!?)\nPicture Card added to the Court Record.\nAdrian's card (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nBy the way, Edgeworth... You were really angry in court today...

The best, at that.\nPhoenix:\n(An assassin!?)\nAssassin (appears after \"Adrian's card\")\nPhoenix:\nSo who is this \"Shelly de Killer\"?\nEdgeworth:\n\"De Killer\" is the name of a long standing line of assassins.\nPearl:\nLong standing?\nEdgeworth:\nThe name first appeared about 100 years ago, I hear. Shelly is the professional name of the third heir to the De Killer name.\nPhoenix:\nSo because his professional name is \"Shelly\", he leaves cards with a shell on them...?\nEdgeworth:\nHe has a habit of making sure to leave a card by the body of his victims.\nPearl:\nWhy would he do something like that...?\nEdgeworth:\nWe think it is a part of his duty to his clients.\nPhoenix:\nHis \"duty\"?\nEdgeworth:\nIf he leaves a card, then his clients can be assured it was he who killed the victim. It also serves as insurance against any charges being pushed onto his clients.\nPhoenix:\n...I see...\nEdgeworth:\nDe Killer values the trust between his clients and himself above all else. It seems that this is one honorable assassin with a moral conscience.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that even honorable assassins can exist...) So, you think this assassin... You think he's the one who did the killing in this case?\nEdgeworth:\nIt would appear that way. The discovery of the card basically confirms it, wouldn't you agree?\nPhoenix:\n(Shelly de Killer, huh...)\nMaya's situation (appears after \"Assassin\")\nLeads to:\n\"I noticed something at the trial today.\"\nPresent\nAnything\nEdgeworth:\n...I've been put in charge of this case. So I can't give you any help with reagards to clues or evidence.\nPhoenix:\nYou sure are hardnosed. Totally different from Detective Gumshoe.\nEdgeworth:\n...And that is why he was fired.\nPhoenix:\n(He's got a point...)\nEdgeworth:\nI noticed something at the trial today. You were behaving in a very strange manner. ...Is something the matter?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess... I should just tell him.) Maya... She's been kidnapped.\nEdgeworth:\nK-Kidnapped? What does the kidnapper want!?\nPhoenix:\nAn acquittal.\nEdgeworth:\n... I see. I had no idea. ... I will prepare a rescue team as soon as possible, and resolve this by tomorrow.\nPearl:\nR-Really!? Did you hear that, Mr. Nick!? M-Mr. Edgeworth is going to...\nPhoenix:\nStop trying to console me, Edgeworth! I don't need your pity!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThere's no way you can find her. We don't have even a single clue to go on.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThere's only one way to save her. I... I have to get an acquittal somehow! It's the only way!\nEdgeworth:\n... Wright. Listen, you need to know something. Juan Corrida was killed by Shelly de Killer. And the client who ordered the job... is Matt Engarde... Your own client.\nPhoenix:\nPlease, stop! ...I can't listen to you. I can't believe that.\nEdgeworth:\n...I see. Well, if you want to continue your investigation, you will need this.\nPearl:\nWhat is it?\nEdgeworth:\nThe hotel right now is restricted to police personnel only, as we are looking for any clues that might lead us to Shelly de Killer. If you take this with you to the hotel, I'm sure they will let you enter.\nLetter of Introduction added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\n...In any case, I must attend to the preparations for Maya's rescue team. We'll meet again, if anything should happen. Now if you'll excuse me...\nPearl:\nMr. Nick? Do you... Do you think... Mr. Engarde hired an assassin...?\nPhoenix:\nNo way! (I mean, he doesn't have a Psyche-Lock...)\nPearl:\nY-Yeah, I guess not...\nPhoenix:\nMaya... Please... All I ask is you make it home, safe and sound!\nDate:\u00a0??? Time\u00a0???Location:\u00a0???\nMaya:\nHeh heh. I guess even kidnappers can be a little clumsy. Clumsy enough to drop a card like this for me. And even though he said he was an \"assassin\", I bet he's just making that up, like how Nick does with everything in court. Anyway, let's try out the card trick with this card I just found...\n...*click*...\nMaya:\nSounds like I got the door open... OK! Time to go take a look around!\nExamine\nDoor\nMaya:\nI've unlocked the door with this card... I should probably go and take a look around...\nDate:\u00a0??? Time\u00a0???Location:\u00a0???\nMaya:\nWh-What is this place...? I've got a feeling I'm not in the hotel anymore... Are those videos over there? ...Well, I'll worry about that later. For now, I should be looking for clues. That way, I can show them to sis and maybe get out of here!\nExamine\nTV\nMaya:\nWow, I've never seen a TV this big before. Now where's the power button... Hmm...\n...*click*...\nMaya:\n... Phooey. It's busted. I would so die a happy Samurai fan... if I ever got to see the Nickel Samurai on a TV like this. ... Ack! I can't believe I just made a joke about dying, all things considered...\nSatellite dish\nMaya:\nWhat is this thing? An antenna... I guess? And this is... a VCR? There sure are a lot of electronic gadgets here. But what is an antenna doing here...?\nComputer\nMaya:\nOh, hey. It's a computer. I've never really used one before. ... Um... I have no idea where the power switch on this thing is... Drat. There goes my plan to use this somehow to get out of here.\nTable\nMaya:\nThere's a framed picture sitting on this coffee table. It's a picture of a woman... She's kind of pretty. Hey, looks like something's written here... Let's see... I think it says, \"With love... Celeste\" I bet this could be a clue...\nSofa\nMaya:\n...That's weird. What's a figurine doing on a sofa in a place like this...? I think it's... a bear. Aww, how cute! But it's got a lot of cuts and slits on it... I wonder if it's some kind of puzzle or something...\nVideo tapes\nMaya:\nIt's so dark in here that I can barely see, but... these kinda feel like... video tapes... All of them... Just what kind of room is this...?\nDoor\nMaya:\nUnngh... Locked. Of course. And it doesn't look like I can use the card to open this door. There's a little hole at the bottom of the door. If only I was a little skinnier. Then maybe I'd be able to crawl through there...\nAfter examining satellite dish, table, sofa, and door:\n???:\nOh, this simply will not do... I cannot have you wandering around at will.\nMaya:\nEeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\n???:\n...It seems... that your Mr. Wright is truly concerned about you.\nMaya:\nHe is...?\n???:\nFor now, I would suggest you remain cooperative. If you cannot, there are ways in which I can help you...\nMaya:\nWays... You mean...\n???:\n\"Dead men tell no tales\" is how the saying goes, correct?\nMaya:\n\"D-D-D-D-Dead\"!?\n???:\nI'm almost certain I told you on our first meeting. I am... an assassin.\nMaya:\nN-No way... You're lying... I mean... An assassin...?\n???:\n...People are not always who they appear to be.\nMaya:\nNiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick!\nMarch 22, 7:04 PMHotti ClinicReception\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nHm? O-Oh yes, Pearls? (Got caught up in my thoughts about Maya's situation...)\nPearl:\nMr. Edgeworth has left, you know.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess for now, I have no choice but to believe in Mr. Engarde. But I think I should listen to his story one more time...) Alright! Let's get going, too.\nPearl:\nOK!\nMarch 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nJailer:\nI'm sorry, but visiting hours are over for today.\nPearl:\nAw...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... I have too many questions I need to ask...) I-I'm sorry, but I'm Phoenix Wright, a lawyer for one of the...\nJailer:\nYou're Mr. Wright, you say? Oh, yeah, there's a message here for you.\nPhoenix:\nA message...?\nJailer:\nIt's from Matt Engarde. ...Ah, here you are.\nPearl:\nWhat did he write!? Is it something really important...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know. Well, let's see what it has to say... \"To Mr. Lawyer dude, I've got something really important to tell you.\" (Changed from ['To the lawyer dude. I've got something really important to tell you.'] in the original release) (Why do I feel uneasy all of a sudden...?)\nEngarde:\n... ... Oh, Mr. Wright. So actually... I have a favor to ask of you. I have this cat named Shoe. I didn't put out a lot of food when I left the house, so he's probably pretty hungry. You think you could drop by my house and feed Shoe for me, dude? My house is just a little ways down from the hotel, alright?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nTh-This is terrible! Let's hurry! We have to feed his cat! I'm sure poor Shoe's stomach is growling by now!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I guess...\nMatt's Note jammed into a pocket.\nPhoenix:\n(A client's request is a request... Guess I should go check up on his cat.)\nHotel Lobby\nPresent\nLetter of Introduction\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... Maybe if I show her this letter I got from Edgeworth...\"\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Maybe if I show her this letter I got from Edgeworth...) Um... Ms. Oldbag... If you would look at...\nOldbag:\nWhat!? You want me to look at this worthless piece of... .................. ...Edgey-pooooo...\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... Is that her perfume, Ph\u00e9romone d'Amour, I smell...? *shudder*)\nOldbag:\nLet's see here... \"Would you please allow this unsophisticated young person to conduct his investigation? Yours truly, Miles Edgeworth\"\nPhoenix:\n\"Y-Yours truly\"!?\nOldbag:\nHmph, that man's good at flattery. Fine. But only because Edgey-poo said so, you understand!?\nLetter of Introduction given to Ms. Oldbag.\nOldbag:\nI just thought of something I have to do. Remember, no messing around! You do anything bad and I won't let you off the hook!\nPearl:\nIt looks like she has strong feelings for Mr. Edgeworth.\nPhoenix:\nThat may be, but you know nothing's going to come of it.\nPearl:\nThat's so mean, Mr. Nick! Feelings are meant to be told and shared!\nPhoenix:\nOwww... (Every time we talk about love, I always end up with a handprint on my face somehow.) Um, so anyway, let's continue our investigation.\nPearl:\nOK!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPhoenix:\nAck! What!? What now!?\nOldbag:\nOne little thing, before I forget. You can't go into Engarde's room today.\nPearl:\nWhy?\nOldbag:\nThe police's main investigation team is going to be in there all day, you hear?\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if they're the team in charge of investigating \"De Killer\"...?)\nOldbag:\nSo don't go in there! Set one foot in there and you'll face the wrath of Wendy Oldbag!\nExamine\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but...\nPearl:\nBut that press conference...\nPhoenix:\nIt was really the victim, Juan Corrida, trying to disclose something about Mr. Engarde.\nPearl:\nBut they're both heroes... Why would they do something so un-heroic?\nPhoenix:\nThey may look like heroes on the outside, but on the inside, they're only human.\nPearl:\n...\nAfter clearing \"Maya's situation\" Talk option in Hotti Clinic - Reception, then visiting Detention Center:\nMarch 22Engarde MansionLiving Room\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, sure is dark...)\nPearl:\nI'll go turn on a light!\nPhoenix:\nWow... So this is what a star's house looks like. Must be nice to be rich.\nPearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Let's find Shoe, the kitty-cat! Shoooooe!\nShoe:\nMeow.\nPhoenix:\nSo I guess this is Shoe.\nPearl:\nAh, what a lovely cat. ...Hello, Shoe.\nShoe:\nMeow.\nPearl:\n...Tee hee.\nPhoenix:\n(The cat seems to like Pearls.)\n???:\nPardon me...\nPhoenix:\n!\n???:\nMay I help you with something, Mister...\nPhoenix:\nOh, uh, we're lawyers. Actually, I'm Mr. Engarde's lawyer.\n???:\nThe master's... Then, you must be Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes.\n???:\nAh, it's a pleasure to meet your wonderful self.\nDoe:\nI am the family butler, John Doe.\nPhoenix:\nNice to meet you.\nShoe:\nMeow.\nExamine\nFireplace\nPearl:\nOh! There's a giant cooking hearth here.\nPhoenix:\nThat's actually a fireplace.\nPearl:\nHow are they different, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n... (You know, I've never actually seen a hearth before, come to think of it...)\nPearl:\nYou should come and visit Fey Manor, then. I'll show you one when you do.\nMotorcycle\nPearl:\nA... A giant bicycle is flying through the air!\nPhoenix:\n... That bicycle, Pearls, is one where you don't have to pedal, and it moves on its own.\nPearl:\nReally!? Wow!\nPhoenix:\nBut sorry to disappoint you, it can't fly.\nPearl:\n...Oh. That's too bad.\nLounge set\nPhoenix:\nIt's a very comfortable and spacious lounge set. I wonder if famous stars drop by and sit around and have a good time. ...In any case, I don't really belong here, do I? ... Argh. What is with me and feeling inferior today...?\nPearl:\n?\nMasks\nPearl:\nAh! There are masks here!\nPhoenix:\nYeah. That one in the middle is the Steel Samurai. The ones next to that are the Pink Princess and the Evil Magistrate. They fought many battles against the backdrop of Neo Olde Tokyo.\nPearl:\nWow, you really know a lot about the Steel Samurai, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\n... (I don't know whether to laugh or cry that I know more about that show than a kid...)\nDoorway behind railing\nPhoenix:\nThere's another door over there.\nPearl:\nYou shouldn't go wandering off over there, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\n...Yes, Pearls. (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her to stop playing around...)\nDoor\nPearl:\nThere's a small door at the bottom of this bigger door, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nI bet it's for Mr. Engarde's cat to use.\nPearl:\nOh, you mean Shoe.\nPhoenix:\n(The door... It's locked tight. Well, I guess that's to keep nosey people like me from entering it.)\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nYou must know all sorts of things about Mr. Engarde, right?\nDoe:\nHonestly, sir... I don't believe my master is capable of such a foul deed as murder.\nPhoenix:\n...\nDoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd, uh, anything else?\nDoe:\nNo, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master or his affairs.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... How typically \"butler-like\", as it were...)\nJohn Doe\nPhoenix:\nMr. Doe, how long have you served at this residence...?\nDoe:\nWell, sir, I would have to say... maybe about one year?\nPhoenix:\n...\nDoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd, uh, anything else?\nDoe:\nNo, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of himself and his affairs.\nPhoenix:\n(You know, I would've thought Mr. Engarde the kind to have a maid over a butler...) ([maid] in quotation marks in the original release)\nShoe\nPhoenix:\nThat's a very cute cat you've got here.\nDoe:\nIt is my duty to take care of him. The master rather fancies Shoe.\nPhoenix:\n...\nDoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd, uh, anything else?\nDoe:\nNo, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the family cat.\nPhoenix:\n(...Well then. I guess I don't need this piece of scrap paper anymore.)\nMatt's Note crumpled into a ball and thrown away.\nShoe (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThat's a very cute cat you've got here.\nDoe:\nIt is my duty to take care of him. The master rather fancies Shoe.\nPhoenix:\n...\nDoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd, uh, anything else?\nDoe:\nNo, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the family cat.\nPresent\nMatt Engarde profile\nPhoenix:\nYou must know all sorts of things about Mr. Engarde, right?\nDoe:\nHonestly, sir... I don't believe my master is capable of such a foul deed as murder.\nPhoenix:\n...\nDoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd, uh, anything else?\nDoe:\nNo, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master or his affairs.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... How typically \"butler-like\", as it were...)\nAny evidence\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking a look at this.\nDoe:\nI'm afraid I cannot offer up anything special about it. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of evidence for a trial.\nPhoenix:\n(Polite yet snotty with a touch of rude. He's the stereotypical butler alright.)\nAny other profiles\nPhoenix:\nWould you happen to know who this person is...?\nDoe:\nNo, I would not. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master's acquaintances.\nPhoenix:\n(Then what in the world CAN I talk to you about!?)\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Being angry is bad!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nDoe:\n...Well, I'm afraid I must take my leave of you now.\nPhoenix:\nOh, we should probably get going ourselves.\nDoe:\nAh, so young and yet already so accomplished. A master of law...\nPhoenix:\nBut there is also a lot to be proud of in being a butler, in charge of the house and all.\nDoe:\nThank you for the compliment, sir. ...People are not always who they appear to be. ...Now if you'll excuse me.\nShoe:\nMeow.\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like we're the only ones here.\nPearl:\nAnd yet... the hotel seems so busy somehow...\nPhoenix:\n(Probably because the police team is scouring for clues about \"De Killer\"...)\nExamine\nFront table\nPearl:\nI want to eat a meal with Mystic Maya again...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, me too...\nPearl:\nWhenever I watch Mystic Maya eat like she does... It makes me happy about eating, and then I can eat a lot.\nPhoenix:\nWell, then... How about after we wrap up this case, we all go out for a huge twenty-course feast!\nPearl:\nOK! Let's work really hard, then!\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelHallway\nLotta:\nHey, City Boy!\nPhoenix:\nL-Lotta... You're still here...\nLotta:\nReckon course! An investigative photographer eats or starves on her ability to snap up the scoop, yeah!? And this hotel just has that \"aura of mystery\". Ya know, like something's always about to happen.\nPearl:\nBut... Do you have a camera?\nLotta:\nReckgiven! A photographer's gotta have cameras out the ear like corn to be a real pro, ya know!? So I'm hangin' around here... ... ... Speaking of cameras and feedin' the mouth, do ya have mine, ya bread-thief!?\nPhoenix:\n(Why can't you drop that \"thief\" thing already?)\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPearl:\nAww, how lovely! The teddy bear looks happy to be surrounded by so many beautiful flowers.\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls really seems to like teddy bears a lot.)\nPhoenix:\nAh... I wonder if... Lotta also...\nLotta:\nI didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Although, other than sunflowers and tulips, I have no idea what any of them are.\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? What's this flower called?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a sunflower... I think.\nPearl:\nThis flower over here is pretty too.\nPhoenix:\nThat's a tulip, I guess.\nPearl:\n...\nLotta:\nCallin' everythin' a sunflower or a tulip; don't reckon even little kids'll fall for that!\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\".\nPearl:\nThe old lady told us about this, didn't she? That we can't go in this room tonight.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if an investigation briefing is going on right now inside... Without Detective Gumshoe...)\nTalk\nNight of the murder\nPhoenix:\nI want to ask you about the night of the murder.\nLotta:\nWhat? Ya really gonna shell out the bucks for the info I got!?\nPhoenix:\nLotta, you were loitering in this hallway the night of the murder, were you not?\nLotta:\nWell, kinda... But...\nPhoenix:\n(Brace yourself, Phoenix. Here it comes...) (Changed from [Brace yourself, Wright. Here it comes...] in the original release)\nLotta:\nI didn't exactly hang around here the entire time, ya know. Followed a few stars around... got a few autographs, shook a few hands, had a soda-pop with a few of 'em too.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like she wasn't here the entire time that night...)\nPearl:\nThe security lady also wasn't in this hallway the whole time either.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess this means there's no one who can tell us who came and went that night...)\nScandal\nPhoenix:\nSo, about the note that was inside your camera case.\nLotta:\nOh, that ditty I wrote?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Can I believe what you've written?\nLotta:\nYa mean the stuff about Engarde shovin' his manager lady onto Corrida?\nPhoenix:\nYeah...\nLotta:\nAh, well, I reckon ya best not be believin' that.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nLotta:\nLook, I sorta wrote that on a whim, ya know? Writin' whatever came to mind.\nPearl:\n\"Whatever came to mind\"...?\nLotta:\nYeah, when ya get down to it, it's just a lotta random bull dooders.\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\n...\nLotta:\nHey, what's with ya!? Why ya starin' at me like my grandpa used to!?\nPhoenix:\nHmph.\nLotta:\nHey, and why do you look like you suddenly got older too!? Or am I just shrinkin' here!?\nPearl:\nUmm...\nCamera\nLotta:\nAh! My baby! My $1,600 baby! What's with that red-coated prosecutor anyhow!? The guy told me it was \"evidence\" and refused to give it back to me!\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's kind of how it is...\nLotta:\nHey, hey. Yer that red-coat's friend, ain't ya? So put in a few good words for me and git me back my camera.\nPhoenix:\nY-You want me to do what!?\nLotta:\nListen, nag the guy real good fer 'bout five hours and I guarantee he'll give it back.\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you do your own dirty work...?\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nUm, would you please take a look at this?\nLotta:\nNope. Sorry. No can do. Only thing I wanna see is a steamin' hand towel.\nPhoenix:\nUm, what? A steaming hand towel...?\nLotta:\nNeed one for my eyes. Today just ain't a good day for my eyes to be lookin' at stuff.\nPhoenix:\n(How convenient! Maybe I'll have to use that one next time you show me something!)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nLotta:\n... Well, I reckon it's time for me to get going. A tabloid photographer without a camera is just a \"tabloid\", huh.\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Yeah, I guess so.\nLotta:\nKeep yerself together out there, ya hear!? I'm comin' to see ya in court tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nO-OK, I'll see you then...\nLotta:\nAnd you too there, little 'un. Keep up the good work, OK?\nPearl:\nOK!\nLotta:\nDon't be picky about yer food, now.\nPearl:\nOK!\nLotta:\nAnd make sure ya do all yer homework, ya hear?\nPearl:\nOK!\nLotta:\nAnd if you happen to find yerself a camera, make sure ya bring it right to me, ya--\nPhoenix:\nWould you please just leave already!?\nExamine\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". (I wonder what EXACTLY happened in the room behind this door...? Even now, no one really has any idea...)\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\n???:\n... Ooongh... Oooonnngh... Ooongh... Oooonnngh...\nPearl:\nM-M-Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is that otherworldly, ghastly moaning...!?\n???:\n... Ooonnnn... Oooo... Nnnghff... Ghfff...\nPearl:\nI... I hate evil ghosts... Waaaaaaaaaaaaah...\nPhoenix:\nI don't think it's a ghost... Maybe it's a demon!?\n???:\nE-Excuse me!? Watch who you're calling a demon, brat!\nPearl:\nAaaah!\nPhoenix:\nZoinks! It's the alien!!\nOldbag:\nWho are you calling an alien!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPhoenix:\nOh, it's just you, Ms. Oldbag. What are you doing here?\nOldbag:\nWhat is wrong with young'uns today!? I came down here to pay my respects to my poor Juan, and you're disturbing me!\nExamine\nBedroom\nPearl:\nSo that's a bed...\nPhoenix:\nYup. It's big, but it's a bed.\nPearl:\nAaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft!\nPhoenix:\n(How easily children are entertained.)\nFloor near guitar case\nPhoenix:\nBottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.\nPearl:\nThese glass shards...\nPhoenix:\nThey're probably from the glass vase Ms. Andrews knocked over.\nGuitar case\nPearl:\nSo, the Nickel Samurai's costume was in here?\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPearl:\nI can't believe Mr. Corrida went so far, just to say bad things about Mr. Engarde...\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, it was a \"press conference\", so he had to go in costume.\nPearl:\nBut weren't Mr. Engarde and Mr. Corrida friends?\nPhoenix:\nThey weren't friends. They couldn't be friends because they were rivals.\nPearl:\nSo, a \"rival\" is someone who is a \"strong enemy\"!?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is really fired up over this... And I don't have an answer for her.)\nWine glass\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nTalk\nNight of the murder\nPhoenix:\nPlease talk to me about the night of the murder just one more time.\nOldbag:\nI talked about it plenty at the trial! I was fooled, tricked... DECEIVED by that fraud of a photographer and her note! She was loitering around here with that imbecilic look on her face!\nPearl:\n\"With that imbecilic look on her face\"... OK, got it.\nOldbag:\nN-Now hold on a second there you little pipsqueak! If you're going to take notes, at least make me sound better than that!\nPearl:\nOh, alright.\nPhoenix:\n(Now I've seen everything...)\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I was working that night too, doing my job, minding my own business. So it's not like I had time to waste standing around here the whole night.\nMemories of Corrida\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about Mr. Corrida.\nOldbag:\nHe was the most popular star, you know... Especially where it counts -- in my book!\nPhoenix:\nBut I heard that he was lagging behind in the polls against Mr. Engarde...\nOldbag:\nUm, w-well, that's just a recent thing. Bad luck and all that, you know. But! He was going to become an even bigger star than he used to be! Look! Just look at this mountain of presents! It's a show of the mountain of feelings all his fans had for him!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, the mountain is pretty big, and certainly nothing to shake a stick at.\nPearl:\n...Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nHm? What is it, Pearls?\nPearl:\nThe presents. They're all bears... right?\nPhoenix:\n(She's got a point... There isn't a single thing here that isn't a bear...)\nPresents (appears after \"Memories of Corrida\")\nPhoenix:\nAll of Mr. Corrida's presents from his fans seem to be... bears...\nOldbag:\nOh, that's because you can't think of Juan without thinking about bears!\nPearl:\nBears...? Why bears?\nOldbag:\nYou don't know!? When my dear Juan was training, he fought barehanded with a bear. He refused to give in and let the bear win, but after the fight, they became friends.\nPearl:\nWow... What a heartwarming story.\nOldbag:\nLook, it's just like in those young people's dramas. I can see those two tuckered out, down by a river going, \"Heh... You... You sure can fight...\" \"You too, bub. You too.\"\nPhoenix:\nD-Did all that really happen?\nOldbag:\nIt's in his biography, bub.\nPhoenix:\n(What a load of crock!)\nOldbag:\nSo ever since then, fans have been giving him bears as presents.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Nice... Bears...\nAfter clearing all Talk options and visiting Living Room:\n*GROOOOOOOOOOWL!* I'm Uncle Bear, and I say it's \"bearly\" 8 o'clock!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What is that infernal racket!?\nOldbag:\nIt's one of the presents going off. Sounds like it's already 8 PM. Way past your bedtime!\nPhoenix:\nUrk... That startled me! I thought I was going to die for a second...\nPearl:\nEight PM... That's the time when the award ceremony ended that night, remember?\nPhoenix:\n(Time sure flies... Hard to believe it's been two days since the ceremony...)\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\n(The transceiver!)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nHello!? Hello!?\n???:\n...This is not a phone.\nPhoenix:\nMaya! How is Maya!? You haven't hurt her, have you!?\n???:\n...It seems you were not able to fulfill your end of the bargain, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [...It seems you were not able to fulfill your end of the bargain, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n...!\n???:\nI have heard the news. So it would seem my present did you no good...\nPearl:\nN-Noooo! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaa!\nPhoenix:\nOne more day! Please! All I ask is for one more day! I... I'll get a not guilty verdict for sure this time! Please...\n???:\n... I suppose if I must. I need that acquittal more than anything else, after all.\nPhoenix:\n...Please... Please let Maya say something! I want to hear she's alright!\n???:\nAlright... hissssss... then... hisssssss... ssssssssss... ssss... a little... sssssss...\nPhoenix:\n(What is with this static all of a sudden...!) Hello!? Hello!?\n???:\nIt seems... ssssss... hisss... sssss... bad... sssssss... hisssssssssss... ssssssssss... connect...sssssssssssss...\nPhoenix:\n(Dammit! Did the transceiver just suddenly break...!?)\n???:\nssssssssss... 'll excuse me... hisssssssssssssssss...\n...*beep*...\nPearl:\nWh-What happened...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know. All of a sudden, it became nothing but static.\nPearl:\nAaaah... Mystic Maya! Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\n(Why did the transceiver suddenly break like that...? I should probably have an electronics expert look at it... The sooner the better!)\nMarch 22Wright & Co. Law Offices\nGumshoe:\nHey! Welcome back, pal! I thought I'd make you a little something for dinner.\nPhoenix:\nTh...That's nice... Thanks.\nGumshoe:\nA rich-man's luxurious full course meal... out of a can, that is... (Changed from [It's a rich-man's luxurious full course meal... out of a can, that is...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry you went through all the trouble to cook, but I don't have the time to eat.\nGumshoe:\nOops... Looks like you don't have a can opener, pal. (Changed from [Oh, hey... You don't have a can opener here, pal.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(You've got to be kidding... And here I thought he had already whipped something up.)\nGumshoe:\nOh, I know! There is one way I know how to be helpful! Ask me about anything you want, pal! Go ahead!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, since he's here and offering... I wonder what I should try asking him about?)\nTalk\nElectromagnetic interference (appears after correctly presenting Radio Transceiver)\nLeads to:\n\"Um... So what is \"electromagnetic interference\"...?\"\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Corrida's Hotel Room)\nGumshoe:\nThe transceiver...?\nPearl:\nOh, Mr. Nick! You should ask Mr. Scruffy Detective about that thing.\nGumshoe:\nWhat thing?\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah! This thing just up and broke all of a sudden!\nGumshoe:\nIt... It broke, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWhen I was talking to the kidnapper, it just suddenly broke into static... Look, it sounded like this.\n...*beep*...\nGumshoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nI don't hear any static, pal.\nPhoenix:\nH-Huh??\nPearl:\nMaybe it fixed itself?\nPhoenix:\nThat's strange... I'm sure it was making a loud static noise.\nGumshoe:\nHmm... Maybe...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe what?\nGumshoe:\nMaybe it was \"electromagnetic interference\", pal.\nPhoenix:\n\"Electromagnetic interference\"?\nPicture Card\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah! Do you know about this card?\nGumshoe:\nCard?\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth, for some reason, went pale the instant he saw this card.\nGumshoe:\nHey, I know what this is, pal!\nPhoenix:\nYou do?\nGumshoe:\nNo matter what way you look at it, I'd say it's a picture of a shell.\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm, that's it?\nGumshoe:\nOh yeah! That's right! Mr. Edgeworth really likes those cooked snail things. Um, what are they called again...? \"Escargot\" or something like that...?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I think we just solved the mystery of why Mr. Edgeworth's face turned pale, right!?\nPhoenix:\n(As I suspected, Gumshoe has no clue...)\nPhoenix:\nUm... So what is \"electromagnetic interference\"...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's something that happens when a radio wave gets mixed up with another signal, pal.\nPhoenix:\nOh, when you put it that way...\nPearl:\nI don't understand what you're talking about...\nGumshoe:\nLike for example, when a cell phone goes off next to a computer screen, the stuff on the screen gets kinda fuzzy and starts acting funny, right?\nPearl:\nHuh? ...\"Kom-pu-ter\"?\nGumshoe:\n... Um, it's like when you use the dryer next to the TV, and the screen starts looking weird.\nPearl:\nO-Oh, yes, the TV does do that! Hmm... Oh, so that's what you're talking about!\nPhoenix:\n(She seems amazingly happy at being able to understand this...)\nGumshoe:\nSo the room you were in when that interference to the transceiver happened... There's gotta be something there that's sending out very strong radio waves, pal! Something like... Hmm... Like a listening device or something.\nPhoenix:\nAh!\nGumshoe:\nHey, speaking of that! Where were you when it happened?\nPearl:\nWe were in Mr. Corrida's room... The scene of the murder!\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? That's it! I'm going to sneak into the precinct and get a bug sweeper! I'll meet you at the crime scene later, alright pal!?\nPhoenix:\nAh, wait! Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nOh yeah, baby! It's investigating time! I'm on fire, pal! My fingers are itching to go! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah!\nPearl:\nWe should be going too, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nAlright, let's go!\nExamine\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh! I cleaned it up even more for you last night!\nAfter clearing \"Electromagnetic interference\" Talk option in Wright & Co. Law Offices:\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\nGumshoe:\nHey! You're finally here, pal!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry to keep you waiting.\nPearl:\nDo you have the... um... \"bug sweeper\"?\nGumshoe:\nUm, well, you see... I got busted trying to sneak in, pal. Then suddenly, I'm staring at the precinct doors. ...From the outside, I mean. So yeah... I couldn't get one of the police bug sweepers...\nPhoenix:\n... What do you mean you couldn't get it!? We need that item!\nGumshoe:\nHey, hey, calm down, pal. I didn't say I didn't get one, just not the police's.\nPearl:\nWow... So this is a \"bug sweeper\"...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks a little... broken.\nGumshoe:\nHey, this was made when I was in elementary school, pal.\nPhoenix:\nOh? By who?\nGumshoe:\nMe, of course! Ah, seeing this sure brings back memories...\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nHey, don't look down on it, pal! Sure, it looks a little beat up... (Changed from [Hey, don't look down on it, pal! Sure, it looks a little run down...] in the original release) But I put my heart and soul into building this puppy here!\nPearl:\nYour heart and soul...?\nGumshoe:\nIt'll work! Trust me, pal, it'll do the job! But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nBut you can't set the sensitivity... So it's going to beep at anything that gives off electromagnetic waves.\nPearl:\nBut isn't it better that way?\nGumshoe:\nOh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho! Well, anyway, since I brought it all this way, might as well give it a whirl, right pal?\nPhoenix:\n(I'm getting that sinking feeling again...)\nGumshoe:\nOK, now I'll tell you how to use this baby! There's a listening device or some other sort of bug hidden in this room, pal.\nPearl:\nSo we're going to find it, right?\nGumshoe:\nRight. Now, first, let's turn the sweeper on. Next, move the sweeper around to give the room a real thorough lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the sweeper and take a real good look around the room with it, pal.] in the original release) The sweeper'll let you know how strong of a signal it's picking up, so keep an eye on it, OK? (Changed from [You can see how strong the radio waves are in an area by looking at the CHECK gauge.] in the original release) Once you find something that's giving off a lot of radio waves... (Changed from [Once you find something that's giving off strong waves, the gauge will change...] in the original release) ...press [the A Button / Enter] to lock on to it. (Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the thing a long hard stare.] in the original release) There's a lot of things here that's going to give off radio waves, so let's take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Alright! I'm going to go stand outside and keep an eye out. Give me a yell if you find the bug. Got it, pal!?\nBug sweeper\nCalculator\nPhoenix:\nIt's a plain old calculator.\nPearl:\nIt says \"50\" on it. Maybe he was calculating his allowance?\nPhoenix:\n(A whole 50 cents?? Um, maybe if he was a spirit medium...)\nDryer\nPhoenix:\nAnd here we have a dryer... Nothing unusual here, I think.\nPearl:\nA dryer...? Oh! if you use it next to a TV, it'll make the screen look all weird right?\nPhoenix:\n...Y-Yeah.\nPearl:\nAnd when that happens, it's called \"electromagnetic interference\", right!?\nPhoenix:\nHey, good memory Pearls!\nPearl:\nI will never forget it for the rest of my life!\nClock bear\nPhoenix:\nWell, it certainly looks like an alarm clock.\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong? Why do you look troubled?\nPhoenix:\nI just can't imagine the listening device being inside this alarm clock. It just, um, sort of reminded me of something that happened a long time ago...\nPearl:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\nWell, anyway, it looks like the listening device isn't in here.\nBox next to clock bear\nPearl:\nWow, there's a really delicious loaf of bread in here!\nPhoenix:\nLooks like it's been on \"keep warm\" all this time since the murder.\nPearl:\nWell, Mr. Scruffy Detective always says, \"Got to keep the trail and crime scene warm.\"\nPhoenix:\n(I think the \"keep warm\" in that case is a little more metaphorical...)\nVideo camera\nPearl:\nWhat's this?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a small video camera. ...No listening device in this gizmo.\nPearl:\nEveryone's trying to make everything smaller and smaller lately, aren't they Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what it seems like.\nPearl:\nBut! I want to grow bigger and bigger!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, eating only vegetables isn't going to help you there. You have to eat meat too...)\nRemote control\nPhoenix:\nIt's the TV's remote control. But it doesn't look like the listening device is in here.\nPearl:\nUm, so I was thinking... I wonder if a TV remote works on other things... Like... Could I make you change your expressions like TV channels? Zap!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey! (Hmm, but if I could... Ooh, the people I would give the ol' mute button to!) Well, I don't think it's going to work on me... Why don't we try it on Maya tomorrow, OK?\nPearl:\n... OK!\nLaptop\nPhoenix:\nThere's no listening device in that notebook computer, huh.\nPearl:\nUmm... What's a \"notebook computer\"...?\nPhoenix:\n... Do you know what a \"notebook\" is?\nPearl:\nYes! It's a small book with paper that you can write on! ...So?\nPhoenix:\nWell, that thing is like a notebook in a way. It's basically a small laptop.\nPearl:\nUmm... Mr. Nick... What's a \"laptop\"...?\nRefrigerator\nPearl:\nThis is a... a refrigerator, right?\nPhoenix:\nI really don't think the listening device is in something like this.\nPearl:\nBecause it's filled with nothing but healty vegetable juices, right!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah, sure. (What does that have to do with listening devices?)\nCoffee pot\nPearl:\nWhat's this? It sort of looks like a hot water pot, but...\nPhoenix:\nOh, well, it's kind of like a hot water pot, I guess. But instead of hot water, coffee comes out.\nPearl:\nReally!? Th-This pot can do that!? ... Um, is there a pot that orange juice comes out of...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't think there's anything like that, Pearls. Sorry.\nWater pot\nPearl:\nOh, the water in this hot water pot has run out! I'll go get more water for it!\nPhoenix:\nO-OK. Sounds good. (Looks like she's forgotten all about looking for the listening device...)\nLarge bear near coffee machine\nLeads to:\n\"This is... This is just a giant stuffed teddy bear, right?\"\nAir conditioner\nPhoenix:\nWell, the listening device isn't in the air conditioner.\nPearl:\nAah! Yuck! This air filter is covered in dust and dirt...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nPearl:\n... Come on, Mr. Nick! Let's wash it!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if being a neat freak makes even the tiniest dust bunny look colossal...?)\nPearl:\n...What?\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh, nothing.\nTV\nPhoenix:\nI don't really think the listening device is in the TV of all places.\nPearl:\nLooks like the TV was left on, and it's now showing an old samurai movie.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. This channel plays all sorts of international movies, as well as domestic ones.\nPearl:\nYou know, every time I watch one of these old movies, I always think, \"Wow, these Japanese stars are really good at English!\"\nPhoenix:\n...Um, yeah.\nPearl:\nWhen I grow up, I want to study Japanese!\nPhoenix:\n(I should probably keep my mouth shut here, and not destroy her dream...)\nLamps\nPhoenix:\nLamp, check. Listening device... nope.\nPearl:\nThere are a lot of lamps in this room, aren't there Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPearl:\nAnd they're all on. You shouldn't do that, Mr. Nick. Don't you know that's wasteful?\nPhoenix:\n...Ah, yeah... I'll be more conscientious from now on. Sorry.\nCell phone\nPhoenix:\nA cell phone... Nope, no bugs in here.\nPearl:\nA \"cell phone\"...?\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!? Don't tell me you don't know what a cell phone is!\nPearl:\n...I'm sorry. I've never seen one before...\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, my cell phone couldn't get any reception while I was staying in Kurain Village... And Pearls has never lived outside of that village, so... Well, I guess I can't say it's impossible to live without one...)\nLandline phone\nPhoenix:\nWell, the phone is the most common place for a \"listening device\", I'd say. But, let's take the receiver apart first before we get ahead of ourselves here.\nPearl:\nWow, you know a lot about electronics, don't you Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know tons. Especially when it comes to taking them apart. It's my specialty. (I'll leave the fixing part up to Gumshoe...)\nPearl:\nSo...? Is there a \"listening device\" in there?\nPhoenix:\n...No. (And I really thought it had to be in the phone too...)\nBear between the two sofas\nPearl:\nAh, what a lovely bear...\n*GROOOOOOOOOOOOWL!*\nPearl:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!\nPhoenix:\nAh, this must be one of those fancy bear-shaped toy robots.\nPearl:\nI-It's a robot!? It's a REAL robot!?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, it's a real one.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nPearl:\nH-How many horse-powers is it? How many horsies!?\nPhoenix:\nHorsies...? ...\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well, look, it's a bear, so... uh...\nPearl:\nUm...\nRadio\nPearl:\nThe radio is on and playing something. Oh! It's \"Kids' Question Corner\"!\n\"Professor! Professor! Why is the Earth round?\"\nPearl:\n... Yes, why is it, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n... Why don't you listen to the radio program a little more, Pearls?\nPearl:\nThis is... This is just a giant stuffed teddy bear, right? It's the biggest one I have ever seen!\nGumshoe:\nHey! So did you guys find it yet? The listening device, I mean...\nPearl:\nNo, not yet. But this bear's eye is...\nGumshoe:\nLet's see, let's see... A perfectly normal stuffed bear with some really strong radio waves... Sounds like you found the device to me, pal. Let's dig this big fella's eye out and see what we've got.\nPearl:\nN-No! You can't! Such... Such a violent act...\nGumshoe:\nOomph! *rip!*\nPearl:\nNoooooooooo!\nGumshoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's!\nGumshoe:\nIt's a miniature camera... And it looks like there's more. There's a... transmitter, and a timer.\nPhoenix:\nA whattawhatta-mitter?\nGumshoe:\nA transmitter, pal.\nPearl:\nOh... Is this more of that \"high tech\" stuff...?\nTalk\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nSo this tiny thing is a camera...?\nGumshoe:\nYup. It's a pinhole CCD camera, pal. It's a small, high-grade video camera mostly used in security systems.\nPhoenix:\nSo it's a video camera...\nGumshoe:\nIt runs on a battery, which comes with it in a set.\nPhoenix:\nBut... there's no video tape in this camera...\nGumshoe:\nThis is only the camera part here, pal. The tape recorder with the tape inside it is somewhere else.\nPearl:\nSomewhere else?\nGumshoe:\nThe footage is changed into radio waves and then it's sent to that recorder.\nPearl:\nSo... It's sort of like a TV broadcast, isn't it?\nGumshoe:\nHey, you know, you're right!\nSpy Camera added to the Court Record.\nCamera (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo this tiny thing is a camera...?\nGumshoe:\nYup.

It's like a video version of a listening device, pal.\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's attached to a small, clock-like thing...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that's a timer, pal. You can set it to turn the camera on and record at a certain time with it.\nPearl:\nYou can set it for a certain time...?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Let's see... This looks like it was set to start at 8 PM and go for one hour.\nPhoenix:\nEight PM? (That was the time the award ceremony ended!)\nGumshoe:\nThere's no date set, so it's been recording every night, I'd guess.\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Detective! How long has this bear been here...?\nGumshoe:\nUm, I'm pretty sure it's been here since the night of the murder.\nPearl:\nThen... Then maybe...\nGumshoe:\nMaybe this camera caught the murder on tape!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nGumshoe:\nAnd if you think about the angle the bear is at... It's bound to have had a clear shot of the whole crime, pal!\nTransmitter added to the Court Record.\nTransmitter (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo... what is a \"transmitter\"?\nGumshoe:\nIt's a device that sends footage the camera took to a specific destination.

It's bound to have had a clear shot of the whole crime, pal!\nStuffed bear\nPearl:\nSo there was a camera... in this bear's eye...\nPhoenix:\nAnd it was disguised as a present.\nGumshoe:\nAnd I'm sure it was here on the night of the murder, pal. It's pretty big, so it stands out pretty well in my mind.\nPhoenix:\nBut... who gave Mr. Corrida this present?\nGumshoe:\nI, ah, don't know, pal. But! This means that someone out there's got a video of what happened here that night!\nPearl:\nIsn't there any way we can find out who that person is?\nGumshoe:\nIt's impossible, pal. Radio waves can be sent almost anywhere, so there's no real way to find out...\nPearl:\nOh... *sniffle*\nPhoenix:\n(Is there really no way to find out...?)\nStuffed Bear added to the Court Record.\nStuffed bear (subsequent times)\nPearl:\nSo there was a camera... in this bear's eye...\nPhoenix:\nAnd it was disguised as a present.\nGumshoe:\nAnd I'm sure it was here on the night of the murder, pal.

Ho ho ho ho! Oh, that's great. But you know, no matter how strange I may seem, at least my jokes don't make you cringe. Right, pal?\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... Yeah, you keep on thinking that...)\nSpy Camera\nPearl:\nIt's a really tiiiiny camera.\nGumshoe:\nA camera this size lasts about 3 hours with a fresh battery pack, pal.\nPhoenix:\nBut what would something like this be doing in...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'd say taking a secret video of the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(Which means... Someone knew there was going to be a murder here!)\nTransmitter\nGumshoe:\nThis device looks like it was made by the criminal themselves. If it's only sending images, then I'd say it'd last about 80 hours, pal.\nPearl:\nYou know a lot about these things, don't you Mr. Detective? Is spying on people a hobby of yours...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, no... I mean... You're making me embarrassed, putting me on the spot like this.\nPhoenix:\n(Why should he be embarrassed? Is there something I'm not getting here...?)\nStuffed Bear\nPearl:\nThe bear is really lovely, isn't it? It's so soft and fuzzy, and the face is really well-made...\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess when you compare it to all the other presents, it is well-made.)\nGumshoe:\nYeah, but I don't think the bear itself is a clue to this case at all.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nGumshoe:\n... ...I got it!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal. Let me borrow this mini camera for a bit!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you going to do?\nGumshoe:\nI'm going to go around to the electronic shops and see if I can find out who bought this!\nPhoenix:\nB-But that's impossible! I mean, it's already 9 PM!\nGumshoe:\nLeave it to me! Even if I have to search all night, I'll find your man, pal!\nSpy Camera and Transmitter given to Detective Gumshoe.\nGumshoe:\nOh yeah, baby! It's investigating time! I'm on fire, pal! My fingers are itching to go! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah!\nPearl:\n...He's gone.\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah.\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Scruffy Detective sure is a nice man. He's pushing himself so hard, all for Mystic Maya's sake...\n???:\nIt's a mystery how you always manage to do things in the most inefficient ways, Wright. (Changed from [...You always manage to do things in the most ineffective ways.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Ack!)\nEdgeworth:\nYou'll have to excuse me. I heard your conversation just now.\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth! What are you doing here!?\nEdgeworth:\nA rescue team has been created and deployed. I can't say I'm optimistic... but we have to move forward, one step at a time.\nPhoenix:\nI-I see... Thanks.\nEdgeworth:\nDon't thank me yet. We still have to find her.\nPearl:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... So, there was a spy camera hidden inside this stuffed animal, huh? You are one lucky man, Wright.\nPhoenix:\n?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know this stuffed bear, little girl?\nPearl:\nUm... I have no idea!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... Of course not. The maker of this bear is a very expensive, luxury brand from overseas. It's completely hand-made, and only a small number of these are exported here. (Changed from [It's completely hand-made and there are very few that are exported here.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nWh-What?\nEdgeworth:\nThe camera and transmitter that scatterbrained detective took with him are dead ends. Things like those can be bought anywhere... However, this bear is different. By tracking how it got into this country, this bear can tell us who the buyer is.\nPearl:\nC-Can you really do that!? Mr. Nick, can he really?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, I guess so...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... It's 9 PM. I think I can still make it in time.\nPhoenix:\n?\nEdgeworth:\nI'll be taking this for now. I'm sure you have other things you have to do.\nStuffed Bear snatched up by Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nSee you soon, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you doing this...?\nEdgeworth:\n... I have no interest in explaining myself to someone who cannot comprehend. But besides that, Wright. Until court reconvenes tomorrow, you should concern yourself with this question: \"Who was the person that murdered Juan Corrida?\"\nPhoenix:\nThe \"real killer\"...\nEdgeworth:\nDo you really still think it was Adrian Andrews?\nPhoenix:\nTo be honest... I don't know anymore.\nEdgeworth:\n... You still have a little time left... Find the truth, Wright. Everything begins with the truth.\nPhoenix:\n(Juan Corrida's real killer... Ms. Andrews' past... The kidnapper whose sole condition is an acquittal for Mr. Engarde... And... this card. Shelly de Killer...) ...Maya. The only way I can save you now, is to find all the answers to this case tonight! I don't understand what your real intentions are, Edgeworth... but as you said, all I can do for now is find the truth!\nTo be continued.\nMarch 22, 9:14 PMGatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nIt's past 9:00 PM already, isn't it? I wonder... I wonder if Mr. Edgeworth has already found Mystic Maya...?\nPhoenix:\n(These things take time. I'd say probably not...) The police are professionals, Pearls. They'll find her, so don't you worry. And if we can win a not guilty verdict tomorrow... then everything will be OK.\nPearl:\nY-You're right... ...\nTalk\nThe real killer\nPhoenix:\nSo the real person who killed Mr. Corrida was...\nPearl:\nThat assassin... Mr. Shelly de Killer, right?\nPhoenix:\nAnd the card Ms. Andrews found at the crime scene seems to be proof of that. But if that's the case, then a new question comes to mind. Who was the one that hired De Killer to begin with? Who is his client?\nPearl:\nYou mean... Who asked for the murder...?\nPhoenix:\nThat person didn't want to dirty their own hands in blood, but whoever this client is, they're still a killer.\nPearl:\n...\nThe assassin's client\nPearl:\nWho... Who could have hired the assassin? Do you think it was Ms. Andrews...?\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder... But if she was the client... then why go through the effort to stab the knife into the corpse herself...?)\nPearl:\nBut if Ms. Andrews wasn't the client... Then... No, it can't be...\nPhoenix:\n(...Matt Engarde himself...?)\nWas it Matt? (appears after \"The real killer\" and \"The assassin's client\")\nPearl:\nIf Mr. Engarde really did hire the assassin...\nPhoenix:\nThen he is not innocent at all. Far from it, he would be guilty of the crime.\nPearl:\nB-But it can't be Mr. Engarde, right!? I mean, when we first talked with him...\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Did you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?\nEngarde:\n... Alright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't see any Psyche-Locks at that time... Actually... That reminds me...)\nPearl:\nDid you remember something, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, something Ms. Andrews said at the trial today. She said something interesting.\nSomething interesting (appears after \"Was it Matt?\")\nPearl:\nUm... So what is this \"interesting thing\"?\nPhoenix:\nOh, that's right. You didn't hear it, did you Pearls?\nAndrews:\nJuan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway.\nAndrews:\nIt looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde's \"secret\"...!? Wh-What is this secret...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know yet. But for now, let's think about it this way. Mr. Corrida was going to reveal this \"secret\". That means... Mr. Engarde had plenty of motive to have Mr. Corrida silenced. ... (Which means we have to meet with Mr. Engarde. There's no way around it now.)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPearl:\nI... I believe in your lawyer powers, Mr. Nick. I know you can bring us a miracle.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm guessing by \"miracle\", she means a not guilty verdict... And she wouldn't be wrong either. It will take a miracle to pull this one off.)\nRadio Transceiver\nPearl:\nWhy... Why did the kidnapper have to take Mystic Maya...? Why couldn't he have taken me instead!?\nPhoenix:\nStop it, Pearls! Don't say things like that! If that had happened, then Maya would be hurting, I'm sure of it. Just like how you are hurting now, Pearls.\nPearl:\nY-You're right...\nMaya Fey profile\nPearl:\nOne more day...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... If we can bring the trial to its end, she'll be back. Don't worry.\nPearl:\nI decided I won't cry anymore, Mr. Nick. You're so brave and holding strong for Mystic Maya, so I have to do the same.\nPearl Fey profile\nPearl:\nIf only I had studied harder during my training... I could be a bigger help to you, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nAh, don't worry about it. Really. Pearls, you're doing a great job...\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Is there a waterfall around here!? I feel that I must be made new under the rushing spring waters!\nPhoenix:\nSorry, Pearls... The only body of water around here is a lake.\nPearl:\nOh... Thanks anyway...\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPearl:\nThis is the first time I've ever met someone who loves to eat instant noodles.\nPhoenix:\n(Something tells me Gumshoe isn't eating them because he genuinely likes them, but...)\nPearl:\nHe's working so hard, all for Mystic Maya's sake... I'm going to get him lots and lots of instant noodles as a thank your present!\nJuan Corrida profile\nPearl:\nUm... Is it really that important to be the Master of all the Stars? So important that you try to find your friends' weaknesses, and then expose them...?\nPhoenix:\nI... I wouldn't know...\nMatt Engarde profile\nPearl:\nI-Is it really alright for us to trust him? This person... Mr. Engarde...?\nPhoenix:\n... (I-I don't know... I can't even answer that for myself. We have to go see him one more time! That's the only way to know for sure!)\nSecurity Lady profile\nPearl:\nUm... I was wondering if that old lady is really a person from Earth. I mean, maybe she's really from waaaaaay out in outer space...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, actually, I was thinking the same exact thing. She's too strange to be from Earth.\nAdrian Andrews profile\nPearl:\nWhy did Ms. Andrews... Why did she frame Mr. Engarde, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(She has some sort of grudge against Mr. Engarde... But why is that? That's something we still have to figure out...) Let's go ask her, OK?\nCeleste Inpax profile\nPearl:\nThis person was Ms. Andrews' mentor... And she... killed herself, right?\nPhoenix:\n(Right. And Mr. Corrida hid Ms. Inpax's suicide note... So to get it back, Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... But the thing is, where is that suicide note now?)\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelHallway\nPearl:\nWow, it's really getting late, isn't it Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. It's past 9:00 PM already. But we still have some things to prepare for tomorrow's trial. (There's still the matter of this \"secret\" Mr. Corrida held about Mr. Engarde... And Ms. Andrews' real intentions. These are two things I must know tonight!)\nPearl:\nBut aren't visiting hours over at the detention center?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I'm sure we'll think of something, Pearls. Don't you worry.\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nOldbag:\n...\nPhoenix:\nHey! Wait!\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, whippersnapper!? All I know is nothing that has anything to do with you is ever good! Like just now. I was handed this strange device for who knows what reason. And I was told to use it to search the whole hotel.\nPhoenix:\nThat's... the bug sweeper, isn't it? (The one Gumshoe made...)\nOldbag:\nI don't know and frankly, I don't care. But the request came from Edgey-poo, so...\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth...?\nOldbag:\nAnd he said,\nEdgeworth:\n\"If you feel angry, direct your anger at that unsophisticated lawyer.\"\nOldbag:\nSo, I'm going to feel free to direct all my anger towards you!\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... Gee, thanks a bundle, Edgeworth! What a pal you are!)\nExamine\nTables at back\nPhoenix:\nThey haven't cleaned up all the food yet.\nOldbag:\nDon't you touch it without permission! I brought a lunch box today, so I could pack it.\nPearl:\nUm... But... Hasn't the food been out for two days already?\nOldbag:\nWhen it's in your stomach, it's all the same!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, the digestive powers of an alien are wondrous...)\nFront table\nPearl:\nI want to eat a meal with Mystic Maya again...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, me too...\nPearl:\nWhenever I watch Mystic Maya eat like she does... It makes me happy about eating, and then I can eat a lot.\nPhoenix:\nWell, then... How about after we wrap up this case, we all go out for a huge twenty-course feast!\nOldbag:\nMy mind's like a steel trap, so I'm going to hold you to that!\nPhoenix:\n(I was NOT talking to you!)\nTalk\nBug sweeper\nOldbag:\nThis is absolutely top secret, so you had better keep it to yourselves! I heard they found a spy camera hidden in one of the presents!\nPhoenix:\nHmm, very interesting.\nOldbag:\nI'm sure it was... you know... It was to catch poor Juan in the middle of a scandalous \"meeting\"!\nPearl:\n\"Scandalous\"...? What's that?\nOldbag:\nIt means... Well, you know, that gossip that's been going around about my dear Juan.\nPhoenix:\nOh... You mean that thing about Ms. Andrews. (But I'm sure she must've had some reason for getting close to Mr. Corrida...)\nOldbag:\nI'll let you in on another secret, young'un. I know who planted that spy camera! It was that obnoxious, puffy-haired photographer girl! The nerve of some people! Spying on people by herself! As if I wouldn't want to see it for myself too!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow! The alien actually admitted her true intentions for a change!)\nOldbag:\nI don't know what you're thinking exactly, but I can bet that it's nothing good!!\nPhoenix:\n(But I didn't say anything...)\nJuan and Adrian\nOldbag:\nSo you want to know about Juan and that manager, right? Actually, as I hear it, they were something of a refreshing pair, those two.\nPhoenix:\nOh?\nOldbag:\nI tell you, Juan really welcomed that manager with open arms, I heard.\nPearl:\nThat \"manager\"...? Who are you talking about?\nOldbag:\nYou don't know? That manager woman Juan had. It's a shame she killed herself, though...\nPhoenix:\nOh, you're talking about Ms. Celeste Inpax... Ms. Andrews' mentor, right?\nOldbag:\nYes, yes, that's the one! That Celeste girl. She was supposed to get married, you know.\nPhoenix:\nM-Married? You mean... to Mr. Corrida?\nOldbag:\n*sigh* Really, you young kids today don't know anything, do you? That girl Celeste killed herself three days after their marriage announcement!\nPhoenix:\n(Three days after their marriage announcement!? What in the...!?)\nCeleste's suicide (appears after \"Juan and Adrian\")\nPearl:\nWhy would Ms. Inpax want to kill herself!? She was going to get married!\nOldbag:\nWell, that's because... she was thrown away, you see, by Juan.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nPearl:\nB-But... They were going to get married, right? They promised each other, right?\nOldbag:\nThey held a grand announcement session... But... Three days later... Juan suddenly cancelled their marriage.\nPhoenix:\nI-Is that true?\nOldbag:\nIt was in the weekly magazines.\nPearl:\nB-But why!? Why did he do that!?\nOldbag:\nThat was not in the magazines, unfortunately.\nPhoenix:\n...I see.\nOldbag:\nThat night after Juan called off the wedding, that manager, Celeste, killed herself.\nPhoenix:\nHow terrible...\nPearl:\nI wonder what happened between those two...?\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPhoenix:\nOn that night, there must've been at least a few hundred people here. Hmm... I guess the police are done with their questioning and investigating. It looks like things here in the lobby have finally calmed down.\nExamine\nSecond floor\nPhoenix:\nA lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. When the murder happened, it was abuzz with people running back and forth... But now since things have quieted down, it actually feels more eerie than before.\nMarch 22Engarde MansionLiving Room\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like no one is around...\nPearl:\nUm, what happened to that person with the stuffed teddy face...?\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, she must mean that butler with the stitches in his face.)\nPearl:\nShoooooe!\nShoe:\nMeow.\nPearl:\nOh, there you are. I guess you're still awake, huh Shoe?\nShoe:\nMeow.\nPearl:\nHee hee, come on, let's play.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that butler, Mr. Doe, is already asleep or not...)\nMarch 22Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPearl:\nIt doesn't look like Mr. Scruffy Detective is here.\nPhoenix:\nWell, he's out there with that camera asking around at all the electronic stores.\nPearl:\nThen, I'll make some salad for him for dinner.\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like Pearls really appreciates what Gumshoe is doing for us...)\nPearl:\n...Um, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nHm? Yes?\nPearl:\nWhere is the lettuce?\nPhoenix:\n...I don't think I've ever bought lettuce before.\nPearl:\n... Aww, I guess I have to give up on making a salad, then.\nPhoenix:\n(Guess the lack of lettuce is kind of a problem.)\nExamine\nCharley the plant\nPearl:\nOh! I'll water it!\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK... Gumshoe already gave it more than plenty earlier...\nPearl:\n...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...)\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh, I'll wipe it some more and make it super shiny! ...The wiping cloth... Where are you, Mr. wiping cloth...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's fine. Really. If you wipe it any more, it'll be so shiny I'll be using it as a mirror.\nMarch 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nVisiting hours ended a few hours ago. Looks like we're not going to get a chance to talk with Mr. Engarde tonight...\nPearl:\nB-But... Isn't what we have to ask very important?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, but I don't think that matters to the guard...)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nVisiting hours ended hours ago, so what's the camera watching over now?\nPearl:\nMaybe it's watching the Mr. Policeman who's standing over there.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think that's it...)\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nVisiting hours ended hours ago, so what's he watching over now?\nPearl:\nMaybe he did something bad and he's standing there as punishment.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think that's it...)\nMarch 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nPearl:\nIt feels sort of tense in here, doesn't it Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it does. I wonder if something happened...?)\nChief:\nYou're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, right?\nPhoenix:\nAh, yes sir.\nChief:\nWell, we've finally found just the person we've been looking for. A real decisive witness.\nPhoenix:\nA \"decisive witness\"? You mean for Mr. Engarde's case?\nChief:\nWe're taking the witness's statement right now. Gotta hand it to Mr. Edgeworth.\nPhoenix:\n(What's Edgeworth up to now...?)\nPearl:\nWh-Who is this witness?\nChief:\nI think you know this person quite well, Mr. Lawyer.\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(Between the kidnapper's demand and now this... I can't see any way to win here!)\nChief:\nOh, yeah... Mr. Edgeworth wanted me to tell you something.\nPhoenix:\nHe did?\nChief:\nEven though visiting hours are long over at the detention center, he wanted me to grant you special permission, so there you go.\nPearl:\nWhat!? (Changed from [Eh!?] in the original release)\nChief:\nI've already called them so they know. Go on, go talk to your heart's content.\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much.\nPearl:\nThis is such good news, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Go talk to your heart's content\"? It sounds like the police are pretty sure they have tomorrow's trial in the bag.)\nExamine\nDetective on left\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.\nDetective:\n\"It seems as though my true face has been revealed... I was an elite businessman who made deals with the entire world! I was the young successor and CEO of a colossal corporate conglomeration! But my real self is that of a regular everyday policeman!\"\nPhoenix:\n... Stop doing image training, and get yourself out there in the field!!\nChief\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.\nChief:\nWhaaat!? \"The real killer in the Corrida murder is an assassin...\"!? This must be someone's idea of a joke. I can't believe this garbage!\nPhoenix:\n(Have a little more faith in your own subordinates!)\nBlue Badger\nChief:\nThis mascot here is the \"Blue Badger\". I made him, you know. I'm finally gonna show him off to the Chief of Police tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nWow, that's really something.\nChief:\nYou have no idea how much time and effort I invested into him to get this far... But my hopes for this little guy go far beyond just this precinct, yessiree. I'll get him deployed to every precinct in the nation. Just you wait.\nPearl:\nI wish you luck, sir.\nAfter clearing \"Something interesting\" Talk option in Gatewater Hotel - Corrida's Hotel Room, clearing \"Celeste's suicide\" Talk option in Gatewater Hotel - Hotel Lobby, and visiting Criminal Affairs Dept.:\nMarch 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure they must have transferred Ms. Andrews here by now... So that means that both Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews are in this detention center. Now then, whose story do I want to hear?)\nMatt Engarde\nEngarde:\nDude! It's Mr. Wright! I hope you can get me off the hook tomorrow. I'm counting on you!\nPhoenix:\nI... hope so too... (Edgeworth just dropped a bombshell on me by saying... (Changed from [Edgeworth just dropped a bombshell on me and said...] in the original release) that Juan Corrida was killed by an assassin, and that the assassin's client is... (Changed from [that Juan Corrida was killed by an assassin, and that assassin's client is...] in the original release) this man... Matt Engarde...)\nEngarde:\nWhat's wrong?\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. Engarde. There is something I must know with one hundred percent certainty.\nEngarde:\nHmm, you seem kinda different. You're totally not like your usual lawyer dude self.\nExamine\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitor's the visitor's room. He's sleeping standing up. The night's pretty long, and he probably got tired. Hmm... I hope he doesn't fall over...\nTalk\nMatt's secret\nPhoenix:\nUm, about the \"press conference\"...\nEngarde:\nYou mean the one where Juan was gonna dress up as the Nickel Samurai?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I heard a little more about it from Ms. Andrews.\nAndrews:\nIt looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nCould you please fill me in on what this \"secret\" is? Please?\n5 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(I knew this was coming...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick? D-Don't tell me...\nPhoenix:\n(Psyche-Locks...) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock...] in the original release)\nEngarde:\nYou said a \"secret\", right? But I don't have any idea what it is. Do you dude...? (Changed from [You said a 'secret', right? But you don't have any idea what it is, do you dude...?] in the original release)\nMatt's secret (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis is a very important matter! Please! You must tell me! What is this \"secret\"!?\n5 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nEngarde:\nHmm... Well... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna consult my lawyer, OK?\nPhone:\n............\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nH-Hello? This is Phoenix Wright.\nEngarde:\nOh, hey Mr. Lawyer dude. Sorry, but you know dude, you totally don't have any idea. And I really didn't care at all about what Juan was up to, OK?\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nEngarde:\nSo, it's like that.\nPhoenix:\n... (Looks like I have no choice but to remove those Psyche-Locks...)\nJuan and Adrian\nPhoenix:\nDid you know about Mr. Corrida and Ms. Andrews' relationship...?\nEngarde:\nWell, it's all over the tabloids, dude. Ah, but I don't know any of the details, if that's what you mean. Look, how many times do I have to tell you? I don't care what Juan did with his life.\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews... She had a purpose in mind when she started seeing Mr. Corrida. Her mentor was Mr. Corrida's manager... and Ms. Andrews was going to get Ms. Celeste Inpax's suicide note from him.\nEngarde:\nCeleste...\nPhoenix:\nDoes that jog any memories...?\nEngarde:\n... Dude, I suddenly just got totally hungry. You up for a pizza? My treat.\nEngarde:\n... ...\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? What's a \"pea-za\"? Is it a kind of pea, like green peas?\nPhoenix:\nLet's go eat one later, OK?\nEngarde:\n...Argh, I got cut off by the pizza dude at the shop.\nPhoenix:\nThat's too bad...\nEngarde:\nWell, how about we get our minds off of this topic and talk about something else, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde... Are you connected to Ms. Inpax's suicide in some way...?)\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\nThat Juan... Posing as someone else and trying to hold a press conference...! And the person who set it all up was Adrian, wasn't it?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what I heard.\nEngarde:\nArgh... I can't believe... Why would she do such a thing, dude!?\nRadio Transceiver\nEngarde:\nThat's a very nice transceiver, dude. I'm kind of an expert in gadgety things...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does what he just said give me a sinking feeling?)\nPearl:\n?\nGuitar Case\nEngarde:\nHis signature item was a guitar. Hah! I mean, dude, what kind of ninja carries a guitar!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, I'm not someone who would know...\nEngarde:\nDude, it's such a kid thing to do. I mean, just my opinion and all.\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't your show a kid's show too?)\nCrime Photo\nEngarde:\nHe was a bit of a talentless hack when he was alive... But who knew he could play dead so well? Wouldn't you agree?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, that's because he really IS dead!\nEngarde:\nAnd quite pitifully indeed, yes?\nJammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo\nEngarde:\nThat Adrian... I never thought she'd go this far to frame me for the crime... I mean, what does she have against me? Dude, I don't get it.\nPhoenix:\nThat's something I would like to know too. Do you have any ideas at all? Even the slightest clue?\nEngarde:\nHuh!? What!? Me!? D-Don't be silly, Mr. Lawyer dude! How am I supposed to know something like that?\nSuicide Report or Celeste Inpax profile\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. Engarde?\nEngarde:\nDude, I know I asked you to be my lawyer and all... But I don't think I have to tell you anything and everything.\nPhoenix:\nUm... What do you mean by that?\nEngarde:\nIt just means I don't have to tell you anything and everything, dude.\nPearl:\n...\nAttempted Suicide Report\nPhoenix:\nUm, about this...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! You can't!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews said she doesn't want anyone to know about that, remember?\nEngarde:\nWhat's that?\nPhoenix:\nOh, this? Um... Nothing. It's nothing, really.\nPicture Card\nPhoenix:\n(... I'm kind of scared to show him this card...)\nEngarde:\nWhat's wrong, dude?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um... So about this picture card... Have you ever seen this before?\nEngarde:\n...? Nope, never saw it before in my life, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think he's lying... Or is he...? Then again, he looked like he gasped just now... Maybe I'm seeing things...?)\nEngarde:\n?\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nIt's true we debuted at the same time... so that's why people were always comparing us. But I totally didn't care what people were saying because he wasn't even close, dude. I mean, I won every contest we ever had, hands down!\nAdrian Andrews profile\nEngarde:\nI don't get it... Why would she want to frame me...? I mean, I've never done anything to her, dude...\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde sounds pretty sincere and he seems trustworthy... So I have to find out what Ms. Andrews' real intentions are!)\nJohn Doe profile\nPhoenix:\nAbout this person...\nEngarde:\n...H-He's...\nPearl:\nHe is your butler, Mr. Doe, right? We met him at your mansion.\nEngarde:\nOh... Yes, that's right. He's a pretty cool dude who can do lots of things. He takes real good care of me.\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nCould you please take a look at this...? I know it may not seem important to you...\nEngarde:\nWell, if it's not important, then I'd rather be in bed. If I don't get my 12 hours of beauty sleep, my skin's gonna wrinkle up like a prune, dude.\nPearl:\nYou know, he's right Mr. Nick. Your skin's kind of drying up here and there.\nPhoenix:\n(I swear... After this case is over, I'm going to get lots and lots of sleep...)\nAdrian Andrews\nAndrews:\n..Oh, it's you.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry to be visiting at such a late hour. But there are a few questions I absolutely have to ask you tonight.\nAndrews:\nMe? I thought your client was Matt.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure Ms. Andrews knows something... She can't be clueless about this \"secret\" Mr. Corrida had on Mr. Engarde...)\nAndrews:\n...\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nI'd like to ask you about Matt Engarde, if you don't mind...\nAndrews:\nMr. Wright... You still don't know, do you? The real him, I mean...\nPhoenix:\n... You seem to bear a lot of resentment towards Mr. Engarde. If that's the case, then why did you become his manager? And why would you become intimate with his rival?\nAndrews:\n... That... has nothing to do with this case. Nothing.\nCeleste Inpax\nPhoenix:\nAbout Ms. Celeste Inpax...\nAndrews:\nI had finally put her death behind me... And now, thanks to you, it's all come back to the surface.\nPhoenix:\nI... I'm sorry.\nAndrews:\nYes, I was shocked by her suicide. And it's true that when I heard the rumor that Juan was the one who had hidden her suicide note, I began to draw close to him. I wanted to get her suicide note back... and to burn it.\nPhoenix:\nYou wanted to \"burn it\"? But why?\nAndrews:\nI didn't want it to spread like just another piece of gossip. But... I never held any murderous intent towards Juan. I would never do something so stupid.\nPhoenix:\n(The suicide note, huh...? I wonder what it said?)\nWhy frame him? (appears after \"Matt Engarde\" and \"Celeste Inpax\")\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you try to frame Mr. Engarde?\nAndrews:\nThat's simple. Because he's the killer, that's why. Isn't it the duty of every good citizen to inform the police?\nPearl:\nB-But... there had to be another way.\nPhoenix:\nThe police are excellent at doing their job, so they'd figure it out, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, they're so good that they couldn't figure out the real truth behind Celeste's death.\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews...\nPhoenix:\nWell, um, I know you're not the type of person to do something without a reason, so please, tell me why you did what you did...\nAndrews:\n...Revenge.\nPearl:\nHuh...? Did you say something just now...?\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nPhoenix:\n(A Psyche-Lock, huh...)\nAndrews:\nDon't you understand yet? You're not my lawyer. To be honest, you're more like my enemy.\nPearl:\nBut...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure I just heard Ms. Andrews say, \"Revenge\".)\nWhy frame him? (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you frame Mr. Engarde...?\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nAndrews:\nHmm, I wonder why...? I don't really know myself. When I realized what I was doing, I had already stabbed the knife into the body.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm almost sure that just now... Ms. Andrews muttered, \"Revenge\" to herself.)\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nAndrews:\nI was the one who organized the whole press conference. Juan wanted to deal the most damage possible to Matt's career. And that's why he was killed. It's quite simply a story of cause and effect, yes?\nMagazine Clipping\nAndrews:\nIt appears to me that rumor was started by Juan himself.\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida...? But...\nAndrews:\nI'm Matt's manager, remember. I think he wanted to embarrass Matt through his relationship with me.\nPearl:\nBut... But didn't Mr. Corrida like you...!?\nAndrews:\nThere weren't any feelings of love between us. For me, it was about getting Celeste's suicide note... For him, it was about wounding Matt's pride. That's all it was.\nPearl:\nThat's... That's...\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls is in shock. She sees just how cruel the world can really be.)\nGuitar Case\nPhoenix:\nSo there was a Nickel Samurai costume inside of this case, correct?\nAndrews:\nYes, there was. I even personally carried it here from the studio. I always thought it was such a childish thing to dress up and wear a costume like that, but I never thought that I would wind up using it myself that night.\nWine Glass\nAndrews:\nWhen I was pouring that glass of juice... I honestly had no idea that Juan was dead...\nPearl:\nI see...\nAndrews:\nI really am a terrible woman, aren't I? One moment, I'm thinking of looking after him, and the next, I'm stabbing him in the chest with a knife.\nCrime Photo\nPhoenix:\nAbout this photo...\nAndrews:\nThe person who stabbed the body and opened the guitar case was me.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that was so you could get the Nickel Samurai's costume out so you could wear it...?\nAndrews:\nI thought I had executed that part quite well. But you showed me differently. You are a formidable lawyer, Mr. Wright.\nJammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo\nAndrews:\nYou know... There was only one thought running through my head at that time. \"With this, I can finally expose Matt's true nature to the world.\"\nPhoenix:\n(His \"true nature\"...? I wonder why she's saying that, but not telling me what his true nature is? If it were me, I think I'd be happy to finally get that kind of thing off my chest.)\nSuicide Report\nAndrews:\nI don't care what the reason was... It's unforgivable that he hid Celeste's suicide note.\nPhoenix:\nBut you don't have any proof that she left a suicide note behind, right?\nAndrews:\nCeleste...

I... I noticed it when I went to fill the glass. And then when I realized that Juan was dead... I completely panicked. That's when I must have unconsciously picked this card up and put it into my pocket. As for why...? I simply don't know.\nWill Powers profile\nAndrews:\nThat's Mr. Will Powers.

What a horrible thing to say...)\nAndrews:\n...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright.\nJuan Corrida profile\nAndrews:\nHe is a very prideful man... Or rather, was. He absolutely had to compete with Matt in everything, no matter what it was. He really was such an idiot.\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nWell, I guess maybe all stars are like that.

When all of a sudden, \"You there! You're under arrest!\" And I was brought back here.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh.\nPowers:\nThey said my face and whole self in general looked \"suspicious\" or something.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Well, I guess I can see how they thought you looked suspicious...)\nPowers:\n*sigh* I'm just a normal guy on an exercise show for kids...

What was it?\nPowers:\nAh, well, the detective told me not to talk about it. \"You can't tell anyone, and especially not that lawyer,\" he said.\nPearl:\nWho do you think is \"that lawyer\" the detective was talking about...?\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to take a wild guess and say it's me.\nPowers:\n...Y-Yeah, you got it.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick!

Because he's got that \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" image going.\nPhoenix:\nBut what is he really like?\nPowers:\nWell, let's see. Matt's always been kind of a \"player\" with women... He would never really turn a pretty face away, if you know what I mean... He'd always say, \"It's just a game\" to justify himself.\nPearl:\nWhat!? H-How horrible! That's unforgivable!\nPowers:\nOww. S-Sorry. Didn't mean to offend you. But you know, he said once that, \"There's only one person in the world who won't swoon over me.\"\nPhoenix:\nOne person who wouldn't swoon over him?\nPowers:\nHis manager, you know. Ms. Adrian Andrews.\nPhoenix:\n(Why is Mr. Powers suddenly looking kind of... energetic?)\nGossip\nPowers:\nAh, you see, I'm actually a sucker for gossip. I mean, celebrities and their world have this dazzling sort of image, right?\nPhoenix:\nA dazzling sort of image? But aren't you a part of that dazzle, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nNo, I'm more of a hairy, sweaty, smelly, brutish kind of guy, you see. But it's OK, really. I get to hear plenty of gossip about a lot of the other stars around me as things happen.\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's true.\nPowers:\nOh, hey! So did you hear about this yet? About Ms. Andrews' mentor and her suicide...?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Ms. Inpax?\nPearl:\nWe heard something about how her wedding was cancelled...\nPowers:\nYeah, that's what I'm talking about! I thought about it a little the other day! About that mysterious death! Hey, Mr. Wright! Why don't you ask me about that!? Go on, go ahead!\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Powers is so charged up his skin is practically glowing with electricity...)\nCeleste's suicide (appears after \"Gossip\")\nPowers:\nHey, so have you heard this? Celeste left a suicide note! And they say that Juan went and hid it...\nPhoenix:\nWe heard about that in court today. (But there wasn't any actual proof that she had left a note...)\nPowers:\nWell, this is what I think. I think that something bad was written on that note. Something bad for Juan, that is.\nPearl:\nSomething bad for Mr. Corrida?\nPhoenix:\nWhy do you figure so?\nPowers:\nWell, before she died, Celeste talked with a few of her friends. And she said, \"It looks like I got caught up with a truly insidious man...\" (Changed from [And she said, 'It looks like I may have been caught by an insidious man...'] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nA \"truly insidious man\"...? Did she mean Mr. Corrida by that? (Changed from [An 'insidious man'...? Did she mean Mr. Corrida by that?] in the original release)\nPowers:\nWell, there's no one else that fits the bill, right? And that would be reason enough for him to hide the suicide note!\nPhoenix:\nI see... Well, that's some good info. Thank you.\nPowers:\nY-You're welcome!\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews; they're both at the detention center right now. There are still things I don't understand or know about, I'm sure...

That article! Is that from \"Gossip Land\"?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I guess so.\nPowers:\nAh, you too? I absolutely love this magazine!\nPhoenix:\nUm... \"You too\"...?\nPowers:\nOh, they wrote a little something about me once! \"Steel Samurai's Midnight Dine and Dash\".\nPearl:\nDine and dash...?\nPowers:\nI bought ten copies of that issue, you know.\nPhoenix:\n(Do you think we could somehow get back to THIS article...?)\nGuitar Case\nPowers:\nThe Jammin' Ninja made me want a bright red guitar, you know.

Why would Mr. Engarde do something like this!?\nGumshoe:\nI bet it was to catch Ms. Andrews and Mr. Corrida in one of their rendezvous.\nPhoenix:\n\"I bet\" is not good enough for me.

So you were Shelly de Killer's client!?\nEngarde:\nYou don't really think I would dirty my own hands in this, do you?\nPearl:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nEngarde:\nAnd that woman... Adrian was quite brave herself. Trying to stick the crime on me -- I didn't think she had it in her. But all I care about is that Juan is dead. Isn't that right, Mister Lawyer?\nPearl:\nTh-That's... You're lying!! What a terrible...!\nEngarde:\nIt's way past your bedtime... little girl. Go on, and let us grown-ups talk about more... adult things.\nPearl:\nBut why!? Why did you hide the video camera and...\nEngarde:\n... A weakling soon believes the words of others... just like that pathetic Adrian.\nPhoenix:\n(He knew about Ms. Andrews' secret...?)\nEngarde:\nBut I'm no weakling. I don't believe anyone... least of all assassins.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\nEngarde:\nOh, come now, Mr. Wright. Assassins aren't above blackmail. They turn their clients into cashcows by holding the sinful deed over their heads. And a superstar like me, how much do you think I'm worth? Care to guess?\nPearl:\nAnd... And that's why...?\nEngarde:\nYes, that's where the video comes in. It's got his face and the crime scene recorded on it, preserved for all time. With that, I can keep him at bay, and even blackmail him if I want. That's right. That video is my \"insurance\"... Isn't that what they call it, Mr. Wright?\nPearl:\nWhy would you do something so wrong...?\nEngarde:\nBecause I'm a grown-up, and I can. Good enough of an answer for you, little girl?\nMotive for murder (appears after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nPearl:\nWhy!? Why would you kill Mr. Corrida...?\nEngarde:\nBecause he was about to sling so much dung onto my beautiful public image. Scandals are a little annoying, aren't they?\nPhoenix:\nThis is all because of that press conference, isn't it...?\nPearl:\nIf Mr. Corrida had been able to give it, then Mr. Engarde's secret would've...\nEngarde:\nAh, well, that's what we call \"taking advantage of the situation\", you know? I had no interest in doing it, really, but bit by bit, it crept up on me. And then the situation just presented itself perfectly... \"How beautiful,\" I thought.\nPearl:\nAnd that's... That's how Mr. Corrida ended up dead...\nEngarde:\nLet me tell you something. I'm not like Adrian. I don't depend on anyone. People are simply things to be used. Used and thrown away. Put on a sweet, innocent face, and people will swallow anything you feed them. Adrian fell for it. The assassin too. Oh, and how can I forget. Even you fell for it, Mister Lawyer!

Dude... You should've said that earlier.\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nEngarde:\n... Um, so can I ask you one thing?\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nEngarde:\nYou're my lawyer, right dude? So, if you are, then why are you looking into stuff like that?\nPhoenix:\nBecause if I don't know the truth, I can't help you.\nEngarde:\nSounds more like stupid lawyer talk to me... Hey, let's stop talking about this, OK?\nPhoenix:\nNo, not yet. I haven't asked why you set the camera up yet.\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd what your \"secret\" is. Of course, it would be strictly confidential...\nEngarde:\nSo...? What are you going to do now?\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to find out what I want to know... because I must. The reason you hid this camera in Mr. Corrida's room and filmed it in secret is...\nPresent Picture Card\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Wh-What is this card...?\"\nPresent Magazine Clipping or Adrian Andrews profile\nPhoenix:\nEngarde:\nAdrian Andrews?\nPhoenix:\nThere is a rumor going around... That Ms. Andrews and Mr. Corrida were having secret meetings.\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYou, who was keeping tabs on Mr. Corrida... You were going to reveal this as fact, and turn it into a scandal. Isn't that right!?\nEngarde:\n... ...Dude, you can be such a moron.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEngarde:\nOh man, Mr. Lawyer dude, that kind of scandal... That's the good stuff! That's what we in the industry call \"juicy\"!\nPhoenix:\n...The \"good stuff\"...? \"Juicy\"...?\nEngarde:\nLook, we can get publicity without spending a penny with that kind of stuff. I mean, if people stopped paying attention to us, then it'd be the end, dude.\nPhoenix:\n... Too bad that wasn't your intention.\nEngarde:\nWhat are you talking about?\nPhoenix:\nI wish your reason for spying was something so innocent. But it wasn't. You didn't spy on Mr. Corrida because of Ms. Andrews... Then there's only one reason I can think of for you to do such a thing.\nEngarde:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nThe real reason you set up that camera in Mr. Corrida's room was...\nPresent Picture Card\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Wh-What is this card...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEngarde:\n...If I really wanted to set up a spy camera... I wouldn't have set it up in Juan's room. It would be in your office, dude.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? My office...?\nEngarde:\nWell, dude, you're always saying really absurd things, right? It'd be like getting the comedy channel for free!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! I'm so close! I can feel it!) I-If you're done laughing!\nLeads back to:\n\"You didn't spy on Mr. Corrida because of Ms. Andrews...\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEngarde:\n... ...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde?\nEngarde:\nDude, how about you take that bear home with you and talk to it? I'm sure Mr. Bear will talk with you about as much as I will, which is not at all.\nPhoenix:\nUm... (I have to somehow get it through his head I'm not giving up.)\nEngarde:\nSo, is it time to throw in the towel yet, dude?\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but no.\nLeads back to:\n\"I'm going to find out what I want to know... because I must.\"\nEngarde:\nWh-What is this card...?\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe he doesn't know about this card...) This is a certain man's \"calling card\"... The man's name is Shelly de Killer... and I'm sure you know of him, don't you?\nEngarde:\nShelly... de Killer... Th-Th-That's ridiculous! Wh-Why would I know some shady scumbag like him...?\nPhoenix:\nIf you really don't know him, then why are you acting so jumpy all of a sudden?\nEngarde:\nUmm!\nPhoenix:\n(This is it! I'm finally starting to get to the truth! I can't afford to make any more mistakes now...) Mr. Matt Engarde. I know why you know Mr. de Killer. It's because...\nyou're a hero of justice.\nPhoenix:\nIt's because you're the great hero of justice, the Nickel Samurai!\nEngarde:\nDuuuuude!?\nPhoenix:\nYou spied on that room to do one thing and one thing only! To expose Shelly de Killer's fiendish plot!\nEngarde:\n...I... ...Okay... If that's what you think, then whatever, dude.\nPhoenix:\n... (I get the feeling that wasn't quite it...) S-Sorry. Slip of the tongue...\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Matt Engarde.\"\nyou're his client.\nLeads to:\n\"Since you're the one who set up that camera...\"\nyou're a star.\nPhoenix:\nIt's because you're a star!\nEngarde:\nDuuuuude!? What in the world are you talking about!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're a star. And stars never need a logical, or sane reason for anything!\nEngarde:\n...I... ...Okay... If that's what you think, then whatever, dude.\nPhoenix:\n... (I get the feeling that wasn't quite it...) S-Sorry. Slip of the tongue...\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Matt Engarde.\"\nPhoenix:\nSince you're the one who set up that camera... That means you knew... You knew exactly what was going to happen in that room!\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nSo... How? How would you know something like that...? It's because you're his client. That's why. You hired Shelly de Killer to assassinate Mr. Juan Corrida! The real mastermind behind this whole murder is... You, Matt Engarde!\nEngarde:\n... ... ... ...*sigh* And here I was, trying to be a good boy for you, dude.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEngarde:\nI thought if you didn't know, you'd be able to do your job without feeling bad. Well, that's what I thought, anyway...\nPhoenix:\nM-Mr. Engarde... You really did hire...!?\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna consult myself, OK? ... ...\nPhoenix:\n(Consult... \"myself\"...??)\nEngarde:\n...Well, I guess it's probably about time anyway.\nPhoenix:\nAbout time for what?\nEngarde:\nI think it's time for you to meet him now, Mr. Lawyer dude.\n3 LOCKS BROKEN\nEngarde:\nHow do you do... Mister Lawyer? I'm Matt Engarde.\nUnlock Successful\nAnything (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nEngarde:\nI don't care what you show... I think you've gotten enough out of me, don't you? Enough freebies for today. The rest is up to you, isn't that right... Mister Lawyer?\nAfter breaking Matt Enguarde's Psyche-Locks, then clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n...\nEngarde:\nWhat's wrong, Mister Lawyer? You've grown awfully quiet...\nPhoenix:\nH-How could I have been so deceived by you all this time? When we first met, I asked if you had killed Juan Corrida... And you answered very clearly that you hadn't killed anyone.\nEngarde:\nHey now. I never told you any lies. The person who did the killing was that De Killer guy, right? All I'm guilty of is taking a catnap in my room.\nPhoenix:\nYou... You... You killed Mr. Corrida!\nEngarde:\nHahaha. I dare you to say that in court tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nGrr...\nEngarde:\nAww, but too bad. You can't. You're my lawyer, after all. Aren't you?\nPhoenix:\n...\nEngarde:\nYou could always drop my case and refuse to represent me. How does that sound? Aww, but you can't, can you? That would be the one thing you absolutely can't do.\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya...!\nEngarde:\nYou wouldn't want to test De Killer. He's a man of his word, or so I hear. You could end up getting a certain friend of yours rubbed out if you lose.\nPhoenix:\n...Y...You... scoundrel...\nEngarde:\nSo if I were you, Mr. Wright, esquire, I think I would give it my all tomorrow. Remember, everyone likes a happy win-win resolution.\nPhoenix:\nI... I'll get you for this!\nEngarde:\nThat's such a clich\u00e9 phrase. Juan said something just like that, if memory serves. Of course... Well, we all know how well things turned out for him, don't we? Good night, Mister Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... Maya, what am I supposed to do!?)\n???:\n... And now... Now you've finally found it.\nEdgeworth:\nThe starting line of this case.\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nI don't care for the horrid atmosphere here. Let's return to the precinct.\nMarch 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Wright? What are you going to do? If you plan on changing your defense...\nPearl:\nN...No! We can't do that...\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right... He's holding Maya hostage...\nPhoenix:\n... What... What should I do...?\nEdgeworth:\n... That's not something I can answer for you.\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nWright... Only you can decide where to go from here. One year ago... At that time, I didn't truly understand what a \"prosecutor\" was. And that is why... I had to leave the Prosecutor's Office. I felt that I couldn't stand in a court of law until I knew what a prosecutor really was. And now, Wright... It's your turn.\nPhoenix:\nMy... turn?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this thing called a \"lawyer\"? What can you do as one? You must find the answer... And you must find it on your own.\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nI'm a lawyer... But to fight for someone who is clearly a killer... Matt Engarde... That man is really... Argh!\nEdgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter who, every person deserves a proper defense and a fair trial. Isn't that the basis of our judicial system?\nPhoenix:\n\"Proper defense\"? But what exactly is that? Is it where a lawyer forcibly and blindly gets an acquittal through shouting and trickery?\nEdgeworth:\n...*sigh* Ironic that you of all people should say such a thing. Isn't that exactly how you have fought for your clients up until now?\nPhoenix:\nUh... W-Well, that may be true, but... But that's... That's because I've believed my clients to be innocent from the bottom of my heart! But if I were to get Engarde an acquittal... That... That isn't a proper defense at all!\nMaya's situation\nPhoenix:\nI became a lawyer because I thought... I thought I could save people who were suffering and in pain...\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\nBut... When I look at this mess we're in... I can't even protect the person closest to me. Even if I win the case, I still lose in the end... I just don't know what to do!\nEdgeworth:\n... Wright. Would you get a hold of yourself? You have it all wrong.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nWe aren't some sort of heroes. We're only human, you and I. You want to \"save someone\"? That's something easier said than done, wouldn't you say?\nPearl:\nTh-That's...\nEdgeworth:\nYou are a defense lawyer. You can't run away from that. You can only fight. That's all you can do.\nWhy fight? (appears after \"Matt Engarde\" and \"Maya's situation\")\nLeads to:\n\"People like you and Franziska von Karma are always using all you have to pin me down.\"\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\n(Now's not the time to talk about evidence...)\nPhoenix:\nPeople like you and Franziska von Karma are always using all you have to pin me down. You fight to the very end, even when you know the truth is not with you. But I'm not like you. I can't fight for a false verdict -- for a man I clearly know to be guilty!\nEdgeworth:\n... Franziska... She fights for herself. The only thing she fights for is her perfect win record. That's all.\nPhoenix:\nAnd!? Isn't that the same as you!? Isn't that why you ran away a year ago? Because your precious win record was destroyed!? You are so petty!\nEdgeworth:\n... I see... Now I understand why you despise me so. However, you are mistaken.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you...?\nEdgeworth:\nThanks to you, when you sealed off my path to a perfect win record... I began to realize the error of my ways. I realized that things such as a perfect record were meaningless.\nPearl:\nWhat!? (Changed from [Eh!?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nI don't believe you. Are you saying that is why you left the Prosecutor's Office? But then, why? Why are you here now?\nEdgeworth:\nThe answer to that... is something you will find out on your own. I have faith you will see it before the verdict is read tomorrow. But if you can't, then you will be powerless to change the ending of this story.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! The transceiver!\n...*beep*...\n???:\nI'm sorry for what happened earlier. Well then, Mr. Attorney. Do you wager you can obtain an acquittal tomorrow?\nPhoenix:\n...\n???:\nMy, my. What is the matter, Mr. Attorney? I don't sense your usual anger this time.\nPhoenix:\n...Tell me. Please. Why are you holding Maya hostage for Mr. Engarde's sake? Why are you... Why are you doing this for that cold-blooded killer!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright...\n???:\n... Please don't misunderstand things. He is my client.\nPhoenix:\nDon't toy with me! A man who hires an assassin is just as much of a killer himself!\n???:\n... ...I believe you were asking me for a reason as to why I am doing what I am...\nPhoenix:\n...Y-Yeah.\n???:\nThis is what I like to call my \"aftercare\".\nPhoenix:\nWh-What the heck is \"aftercare\"?\n???:\nMy name carries a certain amount of honor and dignity, Mr. Attorney. I take great care to insure that no suspicion falls upon my clients for my handiwork. That is what is called \"client relations\" and it is a part of an assassin's duty.\nPhoenix:\nAn assassin's... \"duty\"...?\n???:\nWe were unlucky this time and my client was arrested as a suspect. As a result, I did what I had to do to enlist your expert help, Mr. Attorney. And to ensure that you would do everything in your power to the very end.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is your name!?\n???:\nI believe I told you once before, however...\nPhoenix:\nYou did... But...\n???:\nMy name is... De Killer. Shelly de Killer.\nEdgeworth:\nY-You're Shelly de Killer!?\nde Killer:\nPlease keep in mind you do not have much space to maneuver with me. As a De Killer, I always finish what I set out to do. If you fail to keep up your end of the bargain...\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya!\nde Killer:\nIt would be my duty as an assassin to see to it she receives a nice long nap.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaaah! Noooooooooooo!\nde Killer:\nNow then, if you'll excuse me. If someone were to trace this signal back to me, it would be quite troublesome.\n...Meow.\n...*beep*...\nPearl:\nMystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaa!\nEdgeworth:\nI... I don't know what to say...\nPhoenix:\n...Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nHm?\nPhoenix:\nDid you hear that? At the end of that transmission...\n...Meow.\nEdgeworth:\nHuh? Oh, that... It sounded like a cat.\nPearl:\n...A cat?\nPhoenix:\n(It can't be... that cat... Can it...?)\nPearl:\nWhat is it...?\nPhoenix:\nI think... I know where Shelly de Killer is holding Maya hostage! Edgeworth! Have all police units head for Engarde Mansion immediately!\nEdgeworth:\n...! Alright. You hurry over as well, then!\nPhoenix:\nDon't lose hope yet, Pearls! The fight has only just begun!\nPearl:\nY-Yeah!\nDetention Center (after breaking Matt Engarde's Psyche-Locks, then clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)\nPhoenix:\n(Now then, whose story do I want to hear?)\nMatt Engarde\nJailer:\nI'm really sorry, but... Matt Engarde is refusing to meet with you.\nPhoenix:\n...I see.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess I don't really have anything left to talk to him about anyway...)\nPearl:\nShall we listen to what Ms. Andrews has to say...?\nMarch 22Engarde MansionLiving Room\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nPearl:\nPlease answer us! Mystic Mayaaaa!\nEdgeworth:\nWe have this area completely surrounded. There is no way for him to escape. Assuming he's still in the area...\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe it... That butler... All this time, he was De Killer...\nEdgeworth:\nHe and Engarde were working together all this time. I'm sure they had worked out a contingency plan ahead of time.\nExamine\nFireplace\nPhoenix:\nThis is the first time I've seen such a large fireplace.\nEdgeworth:\nI don't particularly care for large fireplaces. They remind me of my youth.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder, if memory serves, if it's because of that rich aunt he had?) Don't tell me you're still stuck on that incident...?\nEdgeworth:\nDon't take this personally, but I really do not wish to remember anything from that time in my life.\nMotorcycle\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems that Engarde was quite famous, even as a motorcycle racer.\nPhoenix:\nGenerally when a star like him tries to do something like that, they fail, but...\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems Engarde is no ordinary man.\nLounge set\nEdgeworth:\nThat Engarde... This is probably where he conducted business with De Killer.\nPhoenix:\nYeah...\nEdgeworth:\nShelly de Killer values his client relations more than anything else. So I'm sure he must meet with his clients in person to talk about any transactions.\nMasks\nEdgeworth:\nIt's Engarde's personal collection. I'd say it's a hobby of his to collect prop masks of shows related to his own.\nPhoenix:\nYou seem to know all sorts of details about Matt Engarde... Almost too many details...\nEdgeworth:\nHe's the defendant in this case. Of course I would know about him.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah... I guess that makes sense...\nDoorway behind railing\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like there's another room in the back.\nEdgeworth:\nLeave that to us. I'm sure the investigation team is already doing its job in there.\nDoor\nPearl:\nThere's a small door at the bottom of this bigger door, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nI bet it's for the cat to use.\nPearl:\nOh, you mean Shoe.\nBear figurine\nLeads to:\n\"Oh, it's a figurine of a bear!\"\nPearl:\nOh, it's a figurine of a bear! But there are a lot of cuts in it for some reason...\nFigurine added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nA bear...? Isn't that more of a thing for Mr. Corrida? Why would something like this be here...?\nEdgeworth:\nWright, look down. There's a little pet door installed here.\nPearl:\nAh, I'm sure that's for Shoe...\nPhoenix:\nDo you think that this... came through that little door...?\nEdgeworth:\nUmph! This door... It's locked!\nPhoenix:\nWell, I'm pretty used to breaking doors down by now. Let's go, Edgeworth!\n*SLAM* *SLAM* *CRASH!*\nPrivate Lounge\nPhoenix:\nArgh! There's no one here!\nEdgeworth:\nFrom the looks of this room, I would say this is Engarde's private lounge. ...Look at this, Wright!\nPhoenix:\nAn antennae for sending and receiving radio signals and a VCR... Check inside the deck! If there's a tape, it would be an important piece of evidence! (If we're lucky, it'll have the moment the crime was committed recorded on it!)\nEdgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but... The tape deck is empty. There's no tape to be found.\nPearl:\nNo...\nEdgeworth:\nBut there's no mistake that someone used this to record something. It looks like someone took the tape we're looking for, and escaped with it...\nExamine\nTV\nPhoenix:\nA huge television and speakers loom largely here. I'm sure if Maya saw this, she'd say,\nMaya:\n\"I would die a happy Samurai fan if I could see the Nickel Samurai on a TV like this!\"\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's what she'd say... ... Ack! I can't believe I just made a joke about Maya, all things considered...\nSatellite dish\nPhoenix:\nIt's a VCR and an antennae. The footage that the spy camera took at the scene of the crime... was beamed here and recorded on tape.\nPearl:\nIf only we had that tape, it would have been really helpful...\nComputer\nPhoenix:\nIt's Engarde's computer. Maya... Why couldn't you have used this to get help?\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Where's... Where's the power switch!?\nPhoenix:\n... (Oh, I get it... So that's what happened. She couldn't find the power switch...)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nIt's a very small table. I bet we could barely squeeze 3 Pearls on there.\nPearl:\nBut I wouldn't sit on a table to begin with, Mr. Nick...\nSofa\nPhoenix:\nWhat a spacious sofa. I bet 10 Pearls would fit on here.\nPearl:\nUm, I don't think 10 of me would fit, Mr. Nick...\nVideo tapes\nPhoenix:\nI can't read all the labels, but this is a very large collection of video tapes. Looks like Engarde taped all of his own shows...\nDoor\nPearl:\nThere's a little door for Shoe in this big door.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure Maya used this door to shove this out there... I'm sure it was her! (Every time you give me some piece of evidence, it's always the most crucial piece. This time too, I'm sure...)\nWine Cellar\nPhoenix:\n... (We've searched all over, but it looks like he got away...)\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry. It looks like he slipped out of our grasp this time.\nPhoenix:\nAnd now... we've lost our only lead.\nEdgeworth:\nDon't give up yet. That little girl is looking to you to be her pillar.\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, you're right.\nEdgeworth:\nWe're close, I can tell. We've already set up checkpoints along every route leading out of this district. Leave the rest to us.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya...)\nExamine\nBottles\nPearl:\nWow... I've never seen so many bottles all in one place before.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess when you're a star, you have so much money you can buy anything you want.\nBoxes\nPhoenix:\nThe light doesn't filter in all the way, so it's hard to see. It looks like there are crates and cardboard boxes tied up with wire here.\nDoor\nPearl:\nIt's a pretty heavy door, isn't it? I can't open it by myself. Please don't shut me in here by accident, OK Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(If I were locked in a place like this... I'd be plenty scared too. Trust me.)\nPhoto frame\nLeads to:\n\"This looks like a picture of Ms. Inpax...\"\nPhoenix:\nThis looks like a picture of Ms. Inpax... (\"With love... Celeste\")\nPearl:\nMs. Inpax? You mean...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Mr. Corrida's former manager.\nPearl:\nWhy would a picture of Ms. Inpax be here in Mr. Engarde's mansion?\nPhoenix:\n(And why does it say, \"With love\"...? Hmm, this might be a clue...)\nCeleste's Photo added to the Court Record.\nPearl:\nAh!\nPhoenix:\nWhat's wrong, Pearls?\nPearl:\nP-Please let me see that picture frame!\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? What's so special about the frame?)\nPearl:\nOn the back... There's something written on the back of the frame! ...\"Maya\" It's Mystic Maya!

I guess I'll talk to you guys later.\nPearl:\n...That's... I... Nooooooooo! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa... *sob*\nEdgeworth:\nWright!\nPhoenix:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's wrong? Why the blank stare?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, nothing.\nEdgeworth:\nWe've searched the house, and this is the last room. It looks like he eluded us.\nPhoenix:\n...Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nYes?\nPhoenix:\nAs far as clues go, I think this is about all I'm going to get.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nBut I'm still short one last thing...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what is that?\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Andrews' Psyche-Lock... If I could just find out what secret she's holding... Then I think I stand a chance in court tomorrow... To blow this case wide open and expose the truth.)\nEdgeworth:\nI think I know what you're thinking. I'll contact the detention center.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Thanks, Edgeworth. Well, let's go Pearls. It's time to open that last lock.\nMarch 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nAndrews:\nGood evening, Mr. Wright. ... What's wrong? You look ill...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews. I have come to remove your Psyche-Lock.\nAndrews:\nPsyche-Lock...?\nPhoenix:\nI want to know, and you will tell me... ...your secret.\nAndrews:\nFine, go ahead. Try to break me, if you can.\nTalk\nWhy frame him? (after breaking Psyche-Lock)\nAndrews:\nCeleste... She was supposed to get married to Juan.\nPhoenix:\nYes... But I heard that it didn't work out.\nPearl:\nBecause Mr. Corrida didn't want to get married to her anymore, right...?\nAndrews:\nYes... Because of Matt.\nPearl:\nB-Because of Mr. Engarde? What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\n(I think I can see where this is going.)\nAndrews:\nCeleste... She was Matt's manager a long time ago. She was the happiest woman in the world at that time. I was working part-time back then, and I often saw the two of them together.\nPhoenix:\nSo that's why... \"With love... Celeste\" is written on the frame of that picture.\nPearl:\nThey were a couple, weren't they?\nAndrews:\nIt wasn't anything as splendid as that. Celeste was being used; toyed with until she was... thrown away.\nPearl:\nThat's so horrible...\nAndrews:\nMatt's entire image is built around how nice and wonderful of a man he is. A scandal would have destroyed that. Which is why Celeste, in her kindness, moved over to Worldwide Studios. And that is where she met Juan. She seemed really happy with him; even happier than when she was with Matt. Celeste and Juan were such a good match that they were even planning to get married. And then it was suddenly called off. On the night Juan called their marriage off, Celeste... She killed herself. And that's why I framed Matt. It was revenge for Celeste and for myself.\nRevenge (appears after \"Why frame him?\")\nLeads to:\n\"I'm sure even you can guess why Juan called the wedding off, right?\"\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nPhoenix:\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\n-- Why Frame Him? --\nPhoenix:\nCan you please tell me why you framed Mr. Engarde for the murder?\nAndrews:\nI've already told you countless times.

You may think I didn't hear it, but I know you said something earlier. You said, \"Revenge.\"\nAndrews:\nSo you are saying I was taking my revenge out on Matt, and that's why? Wh-What an absurd idea.

What does all this have to do with Matt?\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. You haven't mentioned him... Yet. But for you to hate Mr. Engarde... It would mean that he must have had some relation to Ms. Inpax and her suicide.\nAndrews:\nCan you explain to me this \"relation\" between Celeste and Matt!?\nPresent Celeste's Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This...

I can't afford to mess up something as big as this! I need evidence that clearly shows a connection between Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde. If I can find that, I can finally get the real story!)\nAndrews:\nI wonder if you'd like to try again, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"Can you explain to me this \"relation\" between Celeste and Matt!?\"\nPhoenix:\nThis... This is a photo of Ms. Inpax, correct? She looks younger than when she passed away though.\nAndrews:\n...W...\nPhoenix:\n\"With love... Celeste\". This is Ms. Inpax's handwriting, isn't it?\nAndrews:\n... Where did you find this...? No, that's alright. It was a rhetorical question...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it is. I found this at Mr. Engarde's mansion.\nAndrews:\n... ...And after all this time... My last remaining secret has been revealed...\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nAndrews:\nI'm sure even you can guess why Juan called the wedding off, right? Matt \"confessed\" to Juan... about his relationship with Celeste.\nPhoenix:\nI see... So that's what happened.\nPearl:\nBut... Then why did Mr. Corrida have to call off the wedding!? I don't understand at all...\nAndrews:\nIt was probably because of his worthless male pride. Juan and Matt were always fierce rivals. Matt waited for the wedding announcement and then unleashed the truth on Juan. He was aiming for when it would hurt Juan the most.\nPearl:\nPoor Ms. Inpax!\nAndrews:\n...That wasn't the end of it. That day, I'm almost certain that Celeste left a suicide note behind. And in that note, she left a detailed account of Matt's various misdeeds, and... So that she would never again be hurt by Matt, she chose... to die. Then, when Juan discovered her body, he hid her note.\nPearl:\nB-But why would he do that!?\nAndrews:\nIt's simple. Juan realized that note was a powerful weapon against Matt. And it would be especially damaging to his \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" image. In any case... With his pride hurt, Juan sought revenge.\nPhoenix:\nRevenge... There's that word again.\nAndrews:\nJuan wanted to publicly disclose the contents of that suicide note. At a time that would cause Matt the most damage, of course.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that was at the press conference after the stage show...\nAndrews:\nI know all about it, because I heard it all from Juan. It was so I could find out about all this that I drew close to Juan to begin with. They're quite a pair of hideous monsters, aren't they? Even Celeste's death was something for them to use in their game. That night, when I found Juan's body, it was only natural that I thought the murderer was Matt. Those two were always spying on one another, after all. As for me, I was frantically searching for Celeste's suicide note. I wanted to destroy it before it ever went public. I was going to burn it. I had even brought a lighter. But... I couldn't find the suicide note... And that's when revenge crossed my mind. Yes, I was going to bring to them my own kind of cruel revenge. Celeste was killed by those two monsters. So when I stabbed Juan's body with that knife... I didn't feel a single shred of guilt.\nPearl:\n...!\nAndrews:\n... And that's all I have to say.\nPhoenix:\n...\nAndrews:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Even knowing all this, are you still going to help that... \"man\"?\nPhoenix:\n... I... I'm a lawyer...\nAndrews:\nI see. What a foul profession.\nPhoenix:\n... Thank you very much for your time and for talking with me.\nAndrews:\nIt was no big deal. I couldn't sleep anyway.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't sleep either...

Can you please just tell us your client's...?\nde Killer:\nI don't think you understand your place, Mr. Attorney. I said this is something I must first state. Do you know what the word \"first\" means?\nPhoenix:\n... S-Sorry... Go on...\nJudge:\nWell, it appears this is one witness you can't badger, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(That's only because you don't know about Maya's situation...)de Killer:\nTo an assassin, nothing is more important than the trust between a client and himself.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe trust between you and your client...?\nde Killer:\nI provide my services in a fast and efficient manner. In exchange, I trust that my clients are discreet about me and my identity. If too many people knew my face, it would be quite troublesome.\nJudge:\nAnd that is why you're testifying in this manner?\nde Killer:\nThis is the first time one of my clients has ever been accused of murder. I must preserve the De Killer name so my clients can trust me.\nPhoenix:\nBut couldn't someone stab you in the back and break your trust?\nde Killer:\nIt has never happened before, but if it ever did...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes...?\nde Killer:\nThat person wouldn't be my client for very long.

In exchange, I trust that my clients are discreet about me and my identity. These are the roles and duties an assassin and his client are to carry out.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, but I was wondering about something you just said. You said that your client had already \"broken the rules\"...\nde Killer:\nA person who frames another is the worst kind of human.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's why you feel you can betray this person?\nde Killer:\nI have no trust relation with a client who can't understand their assigned role.\nPhoenix:\n(Just my luck... An assassin with a conscience. Who would've figured...?)\nde Killer:\nNow then, everyone. Do you think you can understand my logic?\nPhoenix:\n(This case just keeps getting better and better!)\nde Killer:\nIf you can't, then I'm afraid we can't proceed...\nPhoenix:\nEveryone understands your point, I think.

I mean, you're about to tell us the name of your client. I would think that this would be very bad for them.\nde Killer:\nIt doesn't matter to me. This client has already broken the rules and acted outside of their prescribed role.\nJudge:\nTheir role...?\nde Killer:\nThis person tried to implicate another of the crime in order to save themselves. And this is a trespass that cannot be forgiven.\nJudge:\nYou... Who gave you the right to be so high and mighty...!?\nde Killer:\nTo the gentleman who spoke just now... Excuse me, but would you care to die?\nJudge:\nAh, no! No!

You won't live very long if you let everything bother you...\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, that coming from an assassin makes it less than comforting...)de Killer:\nNow then, I do believe it's about time I revealed the name of my client, don't you agree?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...\"Phoenix:\n(I don't really care about all this extra fluff.

All of a sudden, it feels like we can actually win this.Phoenix:\nYeah...Judge:\nThe prosecution has failed to provide a motive and has instead, provided this suicide note, which is a forgery created by the victim. Furthermore, there is a possibility the defendant himself knew it was a fake. But most definitive of all, we have heard from the assassin himself; the name of his client. Mr. de Killer's client who requested the murder was not the defendant at all!Edgeworth:\n...No...Judge:\nWith all this evidence, it is obvious to me that this means that Mr. Matt Engarde... Is innocent!de Killer:\nI seem to have caused you all a bit of confusion. Please, continue your discussion, and call me when you have reached a verdict....*beep*...Judge:\nBailiff! Please bring Ms. Adrian Andrews in immediately!Mia:\nWhat now? With the way this is going, Engarde will be found innocent. This may be our last chance... to save Maya...Phoenix:\nYeah... But... But Edgeworth is right. De Killer is lying! And Engarde... my client... I know he's guilty!

The prosecution requests permission to further question the witness! Shelly de Killer is certainly lying under oath!Judge:\nHmm...Andrews:\nIt wasn't me! Listen! Everyone! Please! That testimony just now... It was all one big lie!Phoenix:\nMs. Andrews...Andrews:\nThe suicide note may have been a fake. But! That man... Matt... He's the reason Celeste died! And Juan's death...

That's...Judge:\nYou even have a motive. We know that Ms. Celeste Inpax was a large part of your life. You wanted to follow her... And you wanted revenge against the two who hurt her.

The moment you've all been waiting for! Who will be this year's Grand Prix Champion? Who will be our \"Hero of Heroes\"!? Will it be last year's runner-up, Jammin' Ninja!? Or maybe Captain Saipan all the way from the lovely tropical island of Saipan!? I see the students of a certain Starry School are raring to win! And Global Hero Onyankopon doesn't want to go home without the prize! We hope Lady Luck is with all our heroes tonight! And now! The winner of the third annual Hero of Heroes Grand Prix... IS ME!!\nWhoooooooooa! The true hero of the night has appeared in our midst! It looks like this year's Grand Prix goes to this fantastic warrior! The Nickel Samurai! Too bad, Jammin' Ninja. Looks like the title eluded you again this year!\nMarch 20, 7:42 PMGatewater HotelViola Hall\nMaya:\nAlright! Yes! Did you hear that, Nick!? Did you!? The Nickel Samurai! He did it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.\nPowers:\nAh, I'm proud of the guy for doing the series justice.\nPearl:\nU-Um... So the person everyone was cheering for... I guess he got the prize?\nMaya:\nYup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? \"The Nickel Samurai\"!\nPearl:\nNo. Every Sunday, I only watch the Educational Channel's \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nOK, that's it! From now on, it's \"The Nickel Samurai\"! All the kids watch it!\nPearl:\nDo you like \"The Nickel Samurai\" too, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nNah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. But I do like \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nHey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed to watch it anymore! You're supposed to act your age and have interests that match. ...It's very important.\nMaya:\nAw, give it a rest, Pearly!\nPowers:\nLooks like I made the right choice in inviting everyone here. I'm glad you're all having a good time.\nMaya:\nAaaaah... It's like a dream!\nPowers:\nToo bad for the Jammin' Ninja, though. Last year, he lost to The Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo. I thought this might be his year...\nMaya:\nYeah... Oh, hey, did anyone else think that the Jammin' Ninja was a bit different today?\nPearl:\nDifferent? What do you mean?\nMaya:\nUm, well, he wasn't carrying his bright red guitar.\nPowers:\nHey, you're right! Strange he'd walk around without his signature guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh* I will never understand these people and their shows...) Anyway, Mr. Powers, thank you very much for tonight.\nPowers:\nA-Aw, it was nothing... I owe you one, so it's just my way of saying thanks.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! It's time to get going to the lobby! There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.\nPowers:\nAnd then, I heard there's going to be a press conference after that.\nPhoenix:\nA press conference? Is he going to make a speech about winning this year's prize?\nPowers:\nUh, well, not exactly... Something about the Nickel Samurai confessing something.\nPhoenix:\nConfessing...? Sounds pretty serious.\nMaya:\nArgh! Nick! COME ON! You don't want us to be the last ones there, do you!?\nPearl:\nYeah, Mr. Nick! Do you!?\nPhoenix:\n(Why me...? The show doesn't even start for another 20 minutes...)\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there.\nPowers:\nAnd behind those doors is an equally grand lobby.\nPearl:\nShall we go and take a look, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nHey, wait up! This grand dessert is calling to me... It's saying, \"Eat me now!\"\nWalls or ceiling\nPhoenix:\nThis sure is one luxurious hotel. Almost to the point of gaudy, with how it blends together everything \"fancy\" imaginable. (Speaking of fancy, didn't that bellboy give me something like that last year?)\nChandelier\nMaya:\nThat chandelier is really something, isn't it?\nPearl:\nI thought it was a kind of space ship...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. How about we get one of these for the office?\nPhoenix:\nOne of those hanging from our poor, weak ceiling? I don't think so.\nTables at back\nMaya:\nIf this is all a dream, I don't ever want to wake up! And all the directors and stars that were here to see the heroes, wow.\nPhoenix:\nI had no idea who most of them were.\nPearl:\nNeither did I.\nMaya:\nNick, you've got to cut that \"news only\" habit out. Your new show is going to be \"The Nickel Samurai!\" Every Sunday morning at 8! Oh, I know! We can watch it together starting next week! I'll come wake you up extra early to make sure, OK?\nPhoenix:\nAh, I'm fine... You know, you really don't have to on my account...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second.\nMaya:\nWell, shows like that are guaranteed to be good, you know?\nFront table\nMaya:\nWhat can I say? This is a really high-class hotel!\nPearl:\nI've never eaten this kind of salad before.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nMaya:\nDon't worry! Any leftovers belong in my happily awaiting stomach anyway!\nPhoenix:\nYou're such a glutton, Maya.\nPowers:\nAh, I lose this one to Maya. You sure can eat.\nMaya:\nWell, a growing girl needs her nutrients!\nPhoenix:\n(A growing girl? Exactly how big do you plan on getting...?)\nTalk\nWill Powers\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much for inviting us today.\nPowers:\nAww, it was nothing really. Guys like us don't get to come to a place like this often, so I thought I'd invite you all.\nMaya:\nHey, Mr. Powers! What have you been up to lately?\nPowers:\nWell, since \"The Pink Princess\" successfully wrapped up last month, I've been on a kid's exercise show... ...while wearing a rabbit mask over my face...\nMaya:\nOh, I see.\nPowers:\nI'm still really sorry about all the headaches I caused you that time, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nAh, well. What's done is done, so let's forget about it. (This is Will Powers. He's an action star. His popularity exploded when he was the Steel Samurai. And he was the first case Maya worked on with me.)\nMaya:\nIt's too bad you look scary, or people'd know you're a real softy who's good with kids. (Changed from [You can't tell by looking at you, but you're a really nice guy with a love of kids.] in the original release)\nPowers:\nUm, thanks. (Changed from [Ah, thanks.] in the original release)\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe they're going to make a movie based on the Nickel Samurai.\nMaya:\nI can't believe it either, but for a different reason!\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai. An epic story of one hero in a desperate fight against his arch-enemy, the Evil Magistrate in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo. And last year, they started a new series, \"The Nickel Samurai\". The new series seems to be a hit with the kids, too.\nPowers:\nI'm really attached to the Steel Samurai as a show, (Changed from [The Steel Samurai is a show I have a lot of strong feelings for,] in the original release) so I was hoping that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one... (Changed from [so I hoped that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nYeah, it's too bad... It'd been [sic] awesome to see you with the new actor, Matt Engarde. (Changed from [Yeah... It's too bad... It'd be great to see you on the show...] in the original release) He's super popular right now. (Changed from [With the new actor, Matt Engarde. He's super popular right now.] in the original release)\nPearl:\nMr. Un-gard...?\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Pearls doesn't know who he is.)\nMaya:\nThis year it's going to be the Nickel Samurai vs. the Jammin' Ninja at the box office!\nPhoenix:\n...Jammin' Ninja...? Who's that again?\nJammin' Ninja (appears after \"The Nickel Samurai\")\nPhoenix:\nSo who is this \"Jammin' Ninja\" again?\nMaya:\nHe's a hero, duh. His symbol is a bright red guitar he's always carrying.\nPhoenix:\n(A ninja who's always carrying around a bright red guitar...? How does that even work!?)\nMaya:\nWith a scarf around his neck and a guitar in hand, he rises to stardom in an ancient time.\nPhoenix:\nA ninja... Who becomes a star??\nMaya:\nYeah! A ninja who becomes a star!\nPowers:\nThere's a strong rivalry between the two of them. Global Studios' Nickel Samurai and Worldwide Studios' Jammin' Ninja. They even air at the same time.\nMaya:\nYou know what I heard? I heard those two don't get along at all. The Nickel Samurai's Engarde and the guy who plays the Jammin' Ninja, I mean.\nPhoenix:\n(The Nickel Samurai speaks French!? Oh, you mean Matt Engarde, the actor...) I guess even the world of heroes isn't a sparkling, happy place.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPowers:\nAh, I really owe you one. If it wasn't for you guys, I don't know what would've happened. What you did... It was a real tight spot I was in, and you fought so hard to get me out. I don't care what happens. I'll never forget everything you've done for me.\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo, you're going to study to become a lawyer too. Am I right or am I right?\nMaya:\nUmm...\nPowers:\nIt must be real tough. There's all those thick books with hard words you have to read...\nMaya:\nUh, um... Well...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, yeah. Mr. Powers doesn't know that Maya's a spirit medium...)\nMaya:\nI thought he'd be able to tell by my clothes.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he thinks that you've got some strange hobby on the side or something.\nMaya:\n...Hey, wait a sec. What's that's supposed to mean!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo are you Maya's little sister?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but no.\nPowers:\nOh, then you must be Mr. Wright's little sister!\nPearl:\nAgain, I'm sorry, but...\nPowers:\nThen... Whose little sister are you?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but I'm an only child.\nPowers:\nOh, I see... S-Sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(Pearl looks so sad... She looks really sorry too...)\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, they're all shocked because then they figure out who I am.\nMaya:\nHmm... Well, I don't think you look scary.\nPearl:\nMe either. I think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Those two are making Mr. Powers tear up...)\nAnything else\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Thanks for taking the time to take it out and show it to me, but I'm really sorry, I don't know a thing about it.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nPhoenix:\nWow, what is with this place? Looks like I've stumbled into Oz or something. Way in the back, there's a sign for the bathroom. Maybe I should visit it while I can before the show starts... (Changed from [I bet we have a little time to look around before the show starts...] in the original release)\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...? Could it be that there's an action star who has a soft spot for teddy bears...? ...Nah, can't be.\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". \"Juan Corrida\"... His name just sounds like a star's name. I've heard it before, but I don't know anything about him at all.\nEnd of hallway\nPhoenix:\nThere are toilets in each room in this hotel, but since all sorts of events are held here, there are bathrooms for people who aren't staying here to use as well. Perfect for people like me, who can't afford a stay here in the first place...\nFlowers on right\nPhoenix:\n\"To Mr. Engarde From the Global Studio Staff\" Ah, it'd be nice if lawyers got flowers too. Something like, \"To Mr. Wright From All Your Grateful Clients\".\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\". \"Matt Engarde\"... I've heard that name before. Oh, yeah. Maya's always yammering about him like the obsessed fan she is...\nViola Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Viola Hall and visiting Hallway)\nPowers:\nSounds like the post-ceremony show is about to start.\nMaya:\nAlright! I'm so pumped! I wonder if he's going to show off his special move today? \"Nickel Samurai Smelting!\"\nPowers:\nActually, what I'm interested in most is the press conference.\nMaya:\nYou mean the \"big confession\" the Nickel Samurai's going to make after the show? So what is it? Don't you know what it's about, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nUh, well, I'm not the Steel Samurai anymore, so I don't have any idea.\nMaya:\nBah.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Ah, so I guess you are all going to the press conference then?\nMaya:\nYeah, of course!\nPowers:\nIf that's the case, then here, take these tickets so you can get in.\nPress Conference Ticket added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much. Well, let's get going to the lobby.\nPearl:\nIt looks like it's over this way, Mr. Nick!\nMaya:\nOK! For great justice!\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPowers:\nThey called this so suddenly that something about it just seems off, you know?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the press conference?\nPowers:\nYeah. He said, \"There's something I'd like to confess if I win.\" I heard he faxed his request for a conference in to the office only yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nYesterday... (Yeah, that is kind of sudden.)\nPowers:\nBut I guess his manager set everything up somehow, so he was lucky.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Nice manager.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Only a really gaudy hotel would have such a large, gaudy lobby to match.\nPearl:\nAh, I think they're going to have the post-ceremony show over there.\nPhoenix:\nThey're using a compact stage, I see.\nMaya:\nOoh... I'm all ready to use my special \"Samurai Power\".\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks like she's ready to start a fight...)\nPA Notice:\nYour attention please, your attention please. The Nickel Samurai's Post-Ceremony Stage Show will not be held tonight due to unforeseen circumstances.\nMaya:\nWHAAAT!? WHYYYYY!?\nPhoenix:\nOww! You didn't have to pinch me! Pinch yourself if you don't believe it!\nPA Notice:\nWe are asking for everyone's cooperation at this time. So please stay where you are. ...This is a special request from the police.\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nP-Police? Did they just say the police?\nPowers:\nD-Do you want me to go check out what's going on?\nPhoenix:\nUm, wait, I'll come with you...\n???:\nFreeze! You two! Didn't you hear the announcement just now!? It just finished telling you not to move!\nMaya:\nTh-That voice... I've heard that voice somewhere before...\n???:\nHonestly, youth these days can't be bothered to listen to other people when they talk! Just the other day it was the same thing! There was a small footbridge with a sign next to it that said, \"Beware, Bridge Out!\" And along comes a snot-nosed little punk kid right up to the bridge. I tried to tell the boy the bridge was out and it was dangerous, but would he listen!? No, of course not! He said he'd be careful and only walk on the \"in\" part of the bridge since the \"out\" part is what was dangerous! I am not kidding you here! The kid said that and really meant it! WELL! I really let him have it then, and knocked him clear off of that bridge! Honestly, kids these days don't know right from wrong, I tell you!\nPowers:\nThis non-stop chatter...\nPhoenix:\nI-It can't be... ...Ms. Oldbag?\n???:\n...\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, you young whipper-snappers!? Do I know you!? ...Wait. YOU! You're Powers, aren't you!?\nPowers:\nY-Yeah. Um, about what happened back then...\nOldbag:\nYou didn't even get nominated this year, did you? (Changed from [You didn't get nominated last year either, did you?] in the original release) Oh, that's right. You're doing that children's exercise program, trying to play nice.\nPowers:\nAh, yeah, that's me. Thankfully I still have a job...\nOldbag:\nI love that show, and you're a hoot! You're the \"big brother\" character, right? Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You're that giant rabbit! (Changed from [Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You ended up with a rabbit face.] in the original release) What a work of art, but that's how it is, you know? I mean, if you didn't wear the mask, who knows how many TVs you'd break? Really, and shame on those kids exercising around you. They're getting what they deserve. This is why I thought you shouldn't be anywhere...\nPhoenix:\nUm... What are you doing here?\nOldbag:\nLook at my uniform and tell me you can't tell I'm a member of security!\nMaya:\nBut that outfit...\nOldbag:\nAnnoying, noisy brats get the blaster!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nSecond floor\nMaya:\nWow, it looks like there's a fancy restaurant on the second floor!\nPhoenix:\nYou STILL feel like eating?\nMaya:\nI mean, since we're here, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't pull the \"since we're here\" trick on me...)\nPearl:\nWhat a beautiful mansion. Do you live in this wonderful world every day, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, this is my first time in a place like this.\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to say these cameras were set up to cover the post-ceremony stage show.\nMaya:\nBut I wonder where everyone's gone, abandoning their cameras like this...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess something big must have happened...)\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage for the post-ceremony stage show.\nPowers:\nThere was supposed to be a press meeting after the show, but now...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like no one will hear what the Nickel Samurai had to confess after all.\nSeats\nMaya:\nWe're here, so we might as well take some pictures. OK, everyone, sit in a chair!\nPhoenix:\nBut we're all out of film...\nMaya:\nDon't worry about it. There's a zillion cameras over there we can borrow.\nPhoenix:\nHey, hey! You can't just go and \"borrow\" an expensive professional camera like that!\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nMaya:\nWhat incident? What did you do?\nOldbag:\nI didn't do anything, you young'un! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I plead the fifth.\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me!?\nOldbag:\nI thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.\nMaya:\nYou? A bodyguard?\nOldbag:\nFor your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles.\nMaya:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth?\nOldbag:\nBut...\nEdgeworth:\nThat sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me.\nOldbag:\nThat's what he said to me. What did I ever do to deserve that!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nWhat happened?\nMaya:\nUm... So, did something happen?\nOldbag:\nI don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those \"incidents\" happened again.\nPowers:\nA-An \"incident\"? Like a \"murder\" kind of \"incident\"?\nOldbag:\nMaybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, showers of blood are sure to follow. Bet you didn't know that! (Changed from [So wherever I go, a rain of blood will come pouring down. Bet you didn't know that!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUm, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake?\nOldbag:\nSilence, whippersnapper!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nThese eyes of mine are real pros now!\nPhoenix:\n\"Pros\"? Pros at doing what?\nOldbag:\nAt doing police work, of course! My eyes are like a hawk! And my professional eyes spot a messy incident! A messy, bloody incident! That's why I don't have time for you meddling kids and your petty little things!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\n...Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it? I don't like that devilish smile playing on your lips...\nMaya:\nLet's make like we're going to the bathroom, and check things out!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way. The police told us not go [sic] anywhere, remember?\nMaya:\nHuh!? How B-O-R-I-N-G! You're such a boring guy! You've got no motivation! No spirit!\nPearl:\nHuh? What? What's going on? Are you giving Mystic Maya trouble again, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Not you too, Pearls... Please don't stick your little nose into this one...)\nMaya:\nSo listen to this, Pearly. This one time at lawyer camp, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nO-OK! I get it! Let's go take a look.\nMaya:\nYay! I know you couldn't say no to me, Nick!\nPearl:\nThat's right. You'd walk over miles of hot coals for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That would be EVERY time we work a case together...)\nMaya:\nWell, what are we waiting for? Let's go already! You can come along too, Pearly.\nPearl:\nGoody! I get to come! I get to come!\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nThere's nothing really out of the ordinary here...\nPearl:\nAre you looking for the \"in-si-dent\" that the old lady was talking about? (Changed from [Are you looking for the 'something' that the old lady was talking about?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't look like it happened here. Well, we'd better go look somewhere else.\nMaya:\nAlright! Then, let's try...\nBellboy:\nExcuse me.\nMaya:\nAck!\nBellboy:\nAre you by chance, Ms. Maya Fey?\nMaya:\nUm, yeah... That's me.\nBellboy:\nYou have a phone call waiting for you at the front desk.\nMaya:\nA call? I wonder if it's someone from Kurain Village...\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mystic Maya?\nMaya:\nOh, nothing. You guys go on ahead and I'll be right there, OK? (Changed from [Oh, nothing. I'll just go on ahead to check it out, OK?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nOK.\nBellboy:\nRight this way, Ms. Fey.\nPearl:\nLet's go look somewhere else now, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, OK.\nPearl:\nThis is a little exciting... And a little scary...\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of.\nChandelier\nPearl:\nSo, that's called a \"shan-deh leer\", right?\nPhoenix:\nYup.\nPearl:\nWhat is that for? What does it do?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's for lighting up a room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? Can I look down now? My neck hurts...\nTables at the back\nPhoenix:\nThey haven't cleaned up all the food yet. There's a sad feeling hanging in the air now that the party is over...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nIt's a feast fit for a king!\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPearl:\nIt was the first time I ate that food. What was it called again? I think it started with \"key\". Key... Wee?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, a \"kiwi\".\nPearl:\nI don't know what to say. It's a sweet but sour fruit all in one.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nHotel Lobby\nExamine\nSecond floor\nPhoenix:\nA lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. But right now, the only thing filling this enormous room is anxiety about the murder. ...I really hope nothing else bad happens here...\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nThese cameras must belong to the press that came to cover the conference. They're all basically doing the same thing: staring at the empty stage.\nSeats\nPhoenix:\nSeats for the spectators of the post-ceremony show and the press conference. But it's too bad neither event is going to be held now.\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nPearl:\nUm, I guess you must have done something... um... \"deh-plor-ible\"...\nOldbag:\n\"Deplorable!?\" I would never do such a thing! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I plead the fifth.\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it!

Like a \"murder\" kind of \"incident\"?\nOldbag:\nMaybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, showers of blood are sure to follow. Bet you didn't know that! (Changed from [So wherever I go, a rain of blood will come pouring down. Bet you didn't know that!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUm, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake?\nOldbag:\nSilence, whippersnapper!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nI.

Just ya wait! It'll be all over the morning paper! \"Scruffy Detective's Secret Scandal Revealed!\" You'll see! I'll git ya back!\nPearl:\nThose two sound pretty serious...\nPhoenix:\n(That southern accent can only mean...)\nHey, Wright!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey... Lotta...\nLotta:\nCome on, do a gal a favor and tell this cop I'm just doin' my job and I've got rights...\nGumshoe:\nAh, YOU!\nPhoenix:\nAh... Detective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, help a guy out! Tell her that only the police are allowed here! This is the scene of a murder, so she should leave this to us pros...\nPearl:\nA... A murder!?\nGumshoe:\nAw, shoot! Me and my big mouth!\nLotta:\nSee! I knew it! My gut instinct told me so! I always trust my gut! A murder, it said! And that's what it is! A genuine murder!\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, wait...\nYeehaw, a murder! Of a big star, no less!\nGumshoe:\nOh, man... I'm in trouble now...\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nSo... Detective Gumshoe... A murder...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, no, that's not it. I got my facts mixed up for a second there, pal.\nPearl:\nU-Um... Mr. Nick? Is the dead person the Nickel Samurai...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Why do you ask?\nPearl:\nWell, Mystic Maya was rooting for him, so...\nGumshoe:\nIt wasn't the Nickel Samurai that got bumped. Actually, the Nickel Samurai is the one under suspicion of doing the bumping off...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nThe guy that died was this hero named the Jammin' Ninja, pal.\nPhoenix:\nThe Jammin' Ninja...\nLotta Hart\nPearl:\nUm, that woman with the big puffy hair that looks like cotton candy...\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Lotta?\nPearl:\nThat woman... She was there that time too, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat time?\nPearl:\n...When Mystic Maya did that channeling...\nPhoenix:\nOh, that time... Well, Lotta's a journalist, so that's why she was there.\nPearl:\nJer-nal-ist...\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like she was hanging around here before the murder happened.\nPhoenix:\n\"Hanging around\"...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, hiding in wait in front of the Jammin' Ninja's door, pal.\nPhoenix:\nB-But why would she...?\nGumshoe:\nShe wouldn't tell me, pal. Just said something about \"Gettin' my big scoop\"...\nPhoenix:\n(Scoop? What sort of news could she be after...?)\nThe victim (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nSo the victim was the Jammin' Ninja?\nPearl:\nMr. Jammin' Ninja...?\nGumshoe:\nHe was on a really popular rival TV show to \"The Nickel Samurai\".\nPearl:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nThe victim was the action star, Juan Corrida. He got a huge push and rode the express train to stardom. I mean, even I know who he is!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, even I recognize his face...)\nGumshoe:\nBut I heard lately that Matt Engarde's been taking the wind out of his sail. I'm telling you, pal, as far as who's popular, those two are hogging all the limelight.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess there's no space for Mr. Powers at all, huh... Poor guy...)\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde... Um... That's the Nickel Samurai, right...?\nGumshoe:\nYup. I mean, no! You've got to say it with more umph! \"The Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n...Anyway, so now that Juan Corrida's gone, that means Mr. Engarde has the whole stage to himself, wouldn't you say?\nGumshoe:\nI wouldn't bet on it, pal. We can't have that happen, you know?\nPhoenix:\n\"Can't have that happen\"? (What's that supposed to mean, I wonder...)\nArrested? (appears after presenting Matt Engarde profile)\nPhoenix:\nWh-Why was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's not something I can tell you. We just started the investigation, so we don't want any leaks.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like yet another \"Steel Samurai\" hero is in hot water...)\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick... If Mystic Maya knew about this...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know. She'd make me take this case... I know...\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI was really shocked by what happened to her in that one case. I didn't know she had such an awesome power!\nPearl:\nAwesome power...?\nGumshoe:\nI thought maybe I should do some self-improvement and take up a hobby. So I went out and bought some Morning Glory seeds and planted them, pal.\nPhoenix:\n...That's a good way to improve yourself.\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. Well, it's nothing really...\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nThat girl is number three on my \"People I've Seen A Lot Of Lately\" list.\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then who's number one...?\nGumshoe:\nAs if you need to ask. It's YOU, pal!\nPhoenix:\nA-Ah... So who's number two?\nGumshoe:\nMaya Fey. ...But it looks like she's not around this time.\nPearl:\nIt must be nice to be such good friends with each other, isn't it Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think that's the real meaning of Detective Gumshoe's list...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nI look good! I think I've lost some weight, pal!\nPhoenix:\nIt's only wishful thinking.\nGumshoe:\nWishful thinking, huh? ... In that case, I wishfully think I've lost some weight!\nPhoenix:\n(I wishfully think he might face the facts one day...)\nGumshoe:\nLately, I've been on the instant noodles only diet, pal!\nJuan Corrida profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm not a real fan of action shows or anything... But I know who Juan Corrida and Matt Engarde are.\nPhoenix:\nYou can't talk about one without talking about the other, I guess.\nGumshoe:\nThey even debuted around the same time. So they have this real fiery rivalry with each other. Kinda like you and me, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(I never knew he thought of me as a rival...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nThe Nickel Samurai! He really took the Grand Prix tonight!\nPhoenix:\nMaya's a big fan of his.\nGumshoe:\nReally? ...Oh, I'm sorry then.\nPearl:\nWhy are you sorry?\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde was just arrested, pal. ...On suspicion of murdering Juan Corrida.\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nAny evidence\nPhoenix:\nWould you take a look at this for me?\nGumshoe:\nListen, pal... I'm not leaking any info about the evidence to you this time. If I do, my salary's really gonna get it... And then I won't even be able to get those instant noodles down at the discount market!\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nDo you know this person?\nGumshoe:\nYou meet a lot of people as a detective, pal. So we make extra sure to not forget people because that's our job. ...Now, having said that, I don't remember ever seeing this person before.\nPearl:\nWhich means that you're kind of forgetful, aren't you Mr. Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThat's not what it means... Not exactly anyway...\nAfter clearing \"The victim\" and \"Arrested?\" Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Hallway:\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPowers:\nHey! So what's going on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Juan Corrida has been killed.\nPowers:\nWh-Wh-What!? Juan is... He's...!?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde.\nPowers:\nY-You're joking, right!?\nPhoenix:\nNope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja.\nPowers:\nOoogh... Not again... I feel sick.\nPearl:\n\"Again\"...?\nPhoenix:\n...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls.\nPowers:\nI still can't believe... No way... No way Matt would...\nPhoenix:\n(...? What's Mr. Powers got in his hand...?)\nPowers:\n...Oh, before I forget... This... This is for you, Mr. Wright. I got this from the bellboy that came by earlier.\nRadio Transceiver received from Mr. Powers.\nPhoenix:\n...For me...? But why?\nPowers:\nI don't know. All he said was it was for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney.\nTalk\nMatt and Juan\nPowers:\nMatt is the most energetic and active actor out there right now. The Nickel Samurai really sealed his place as a pop idol, but... he kept adding fuel to the fire of his rivalry with Juan anyway.\nPearl:\nMr. Juan... He's the Jammin' Ninja, right?\nPowers:\nThose two would butt heads over everything they could think of. But I'd say that Matt was the one who almost always came out on top.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess some people only know how to relate to others by butting heads like a ram...)\nPowers:\nJuan said that he'd take Matt on this time too, so he joined a rival TV show.\nPearl:\nAnd that was \"The Jammin' Ninja\"...?\nPowers:\nThe stylish Nickel Samurai and the burning Jammin' Ninja... Well, things turned messy real fast with those two using their shows for their \"war\". And the final tally... Look around... It's pretty obvious how things ended up.\nPhoenix:\n(Matt even won the Grand Prix this year... The final win over his rival, I guess...)\nPress conference\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde was going to hold a press conference, wasn't he?\nPowers:\nThat's what I heard. Though if you wanted to get technical about it, it was the Nickel Samurai's conference.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai's...?\nPowers:\nYeah. He was supposed to wear his costume and give the press conference that way.\nPhoenix:\nHe was going to be in costume...? But why? (Changed from [So he was supposed to be in-costume...? But why?] in the original release)\nPowers:\nI'm not sure... They don't keep me in the loop anymore.\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nPowers:\nIt was almost right after you guys left. An old man who's a bellboy at this hotel showed up.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when he told you to give this to me...?\nPowers:\nYeah...\nPhoenix:\n(Why... Why give me this transceiver...?)\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nHey, where did Maya go off to?\nPhoenix:\nShe got a phone call.\nPowers:\nOh yeah, that's right. She was heading for the front desk just now. She sure stands out in a crowd, doesn't she?\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, then they're all shocked because they figure out who I am...\nPearl:\nI think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Mr. Powers is getting teary eyed.)\nJuan Corrida profile\nPowers:\nHe debuted around the same time as Matt in everything, you know.\nPearl:\nReally?\nPowers:\nYeah, it started out small... First it was singing contests, then swimming competitions... Then it was bowling tournaments, and then it was who could throw the best New Year's parties... Juan was always trying to one-up Matt. But lately, those two were escalating to more and more dangerous things... I thought that no good would come of it all, so I began to worry.\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad Juan's story ended so soon...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nPowers:\nMatt's younger than me, but you can practically see his star potential.\nPearl:\nHis star po-ten-shial...?\nPowers:\nI got his autograph the other day.\nPhoenix:\n...Feels kind of wrong now, doesn't it?\nPowers:\nI don't care what people say! Matt didn't kill Juan! I know he didn't!\nAny other profile\nPowers:\nUmm... I'm honored you're asking me, But I have no idea who this person is. Umm... Sorry...\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPearl:\nUm... I was just wondering... Where's Mystic Maya? She's been gone a long time.\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, she was only going to answer a phone call...)\nPearl:\nMaybe she got lost. I'll take a quick look around for her.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nPearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I... I'm not sure... (It's coming from this transceiver...) (Changed from [Did this transceiver just...?] in the original release)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, hello? Wright here...\n???:\nIs this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney?\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are...!?\n???:\nYou don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMaya:\nHeeelp! Niiiiick!\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\nMaya...?\n???:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Wouldn't you agree that the more important issue is the fate of the girl?\nPhoenix:\n(Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?) Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?\n???:\nCome now. Don't fall apart on me yet.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This... No! This can't be!)\n???:\nNow that I have your attention, Mr. Attorney, I have a modest proposal for you. If you do what I require, then I will return to you your valuable \"item\" unharmed. ...What is this called again in your fancy lawyer terms?\nPhoenix:\n...\"Kidnapping for ransom\"...\n???:\nYes, that's it. This is a kidnapping.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nPhoenix:\n(M-My sight... Everything's fading away... Maya... Maya... Maya's been kidnapped!)\n???:\n...--re you there? Mr. Attorney, are you there? (Changed from [You there? Mr. Wright, are you there?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nH-How much!? How much do you want!?\n???:\nVery good, Mr. Attorney. I'm glad you have such a good grasp of the situation.\nPhoenix:\nHurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya--\n???:\nMoney is not what I seek.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\n???:\nWhat I want is a certain verdict. I would like a complete acquittal.\nPhoenix:\nComplete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!?\n???:\nI am not the person you will be representing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\n???:\nYou are currently at the Gatewater Hotel, are you not? And I know that a murder has just taken place there.\nPhoenix:\nJuan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde...\n???:\nYou are, as expected, quite on top of things, Mr. Attorney. Now then. What I want is very simple. I want you to obtain a complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nM-Matt Engarde? But why?\n???:\nHe did not kill anyone. I can attest to that. However...\nPhoenix:\nH-However!? However what!?\n???:\nHowever, someone is framing him for the murder. A very smart someone who is setting him up to take the fall...\nPhoenix:\n... (If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?)\n???:\nYou are, of course, at liberty to take me at my word or not. (Changed from [You are, of course, at liberty to believe me or not.] in the original release) However, there is one thing you can take as fact. Right now, your very precious \"item\" is with me, in my possession.\nMaya:\nMmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\n???:\nYou have two days. Of course, tonight, he will be in questioning with the police. But the trial is in two days. At that trial, you will win a not guilty verdict. Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nO-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!?\n???:\nYes, exactly. I don't believe I was wrong in choosing you, so don't let me down.\nPhoenix:\nAagh!\n???:\nOh, yes, that's right. Now that I am playing the role of the kidnapper, I can't pass up this chance to say, \"And don't even think about callin' the cops!\" ...Hmm, not great, but you get the idea.\nPhoenix:\nD-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!?\n???:\nAlright, I'll tell you that much. My name is... ...De Killer.\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Wh-Where is Mystic Maya!?\nPhoenix:\n...She's been kidnapped.\nPearl:\nN-No... ... It's all my fault! If only I had gone with Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault, Pearls.\nPearl:\nBut it is! It is! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nPowers:\nMr. Wright... I think we... I think we should tell the police what it's [sic] going on...!\nPhoenix:\n(No! We can't do that! If we do, who knows what will happen to Maya...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What about the detective we saw earlier...?\nPhoenix:\n(...Detective Gumshoe!) Yes, that's it! Wait here, and I'll be right back!\nPowers:\nAlright! I'll take care of Pearl while you're away!\nHallway\nGumshoe:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANSOM!?\nPhoenix:\nShhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nGumshoe:\nWait, the deal is \"complete acquittal\" in exchange for Maya, you mean...? Then this means Matt Engarde is obviously the killer, pal! No doubt about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent...\nGumshoe:\nYou really believe what a KIDNAPPER tells you, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd on top of everything else, there's all this evidence we keep finding.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nThe forensics team's having a field day back there. (Changed from [The guys with the eagle eyes are really lapping it up like they just caught a huge fish.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nGumshoe:\nBut it's strange. There's so much evidence that it feels like something's wrong.\nPhoenix:\nThere's too much evidence? Is that possible? (Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being \"set-up\"...?)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, looks like you won't be leaving here tonight, pal. Just sit tight and cooperate with the investigation. Tomorrow you can start yours.\nPhoenix:\n...A-Alright... (Isn't there another way...?)\nGumshoe:\nWe've also got to be careful about pushing the kidnapper the wrong way.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right...\nDate:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0???\nMaya:\nNnngh... Oww, my head... (Wh-Where... Where am I!? I wonder if I'm still in that hotel... Wh-What happened to me...?) Nick... Pearly! ... (Come on, you guys. This isn't funny anymore...)\n...*ka-click*...\n???:\nI see you have awoken.\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you!?\n???:\nMe? ...I am known as \"De Killer\".\nMaya:\n\"D-De Killer\"!? You mean like an \"ASSASSIN\"!? (I... I'm too young to die!)\n???:\nDon't worry. You are not my target. ...For now anyway.\nMaya:\nA-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nick! Nick! Where are you!? ...Help me...\n???:\nYes, that's right. Only one person can save you now, and that is Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\n...Huh? Wh-What? Nick... Nick's going to save me...?\n???:\nCalm down and be a good girl. Think of this as a business transaction.\nMaya:\nA... A business transaction?\n???:\nI am going to contact him now. I hope you'll cooperate and play your assigned role well.\nMaya:\n...Nick... What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearly... (Changed from [What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearls...] in the original release) ...Sis...\n???:\n... Is this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney? ... You don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with...

She's been like this since last night... We managed to get home somehow, yesterday evening... Thanks to Detective Gumshoe gently holding her by the hand and leading her here... But by the looks of it, I don't think Pearls got any sleep at all last night.)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mystic Maya... She's alright, right!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she's alright. Either way, I'm going to save her. You can trust me on that.\nPearl:\nPlease... Please... Help her...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm only able to stay this calm and collected...

What if he... ...is the real murderer? What would you do then, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWould you fight to get a not guilty for a murderer to save Mystic Maya...?\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Let's talk to Mr. Engarde first, OK? ...We can think all the bad things we want, but it doesn't change a thing.\nPearl:\nY-Yeah, you're right... I'm sorry. I... I can't stop thinking about it...\nMaya's situation\nPhoenix:\nPearls... You're really worried about Maya, aren't you?\nPearl:\nI...

We're...\nEngarde:\nOh, sorry dude...\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nI already signed up...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me...?\nEngarde:\nI already have life insurance.

Dude, I really don't need that right now either.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nFire extinguishers. I mean, this building isn't my house, so...\nPhoenix:\n... No no no... We're not here to sell you fire extinguishers either! I'm a lawyer. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nEngarde:\nA lawyer...? ... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my manager, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nThe Nickel Samurai sure is a strange person, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(I think \"strange\" is an understatement.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. You're just in time.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\nEngarde:\nYou're a lawyer dude, right? My manager's looking for a good one right now, so how about it?\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! This is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to make him let me take his case! I have to!)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera. Mr. Engarde keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nSorry to intrude, but I would like to ask you a few personal questions.\nEngarde:\nUm, that's OK, but dude, my autobiography's coming out soon, so... If I say stuff without the publisher's approval, then I'm gonna be in real hot water... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my publisher, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde is so lucky! He has so many people he can talk to.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... I don't know if he actually has anyone he can really talk to...)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. Like I thought, the publisher said it'd be \"real bad\" if I said anything, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(Does he have a mind of his own!?)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, I would like to ask you about the murder...\nEngarde:\nOh, are you covering this for a tabloid as a side job, dude? Um, um... Well, if you want my statement on this, you should ask through my staff...\nPhoenix:\nNo no no... I'm not asking on behalf of a tabloid...\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the president of the studio, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nIs he alright, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(If we're talking about Mr. Engarde's brain here, I wouldn't put my money on it.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. The studio president said, \"Even Neo Mt. Fuji itself knows that I'm not the murderer!\"\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? What's \"Neo Mt. Fuji\"...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a mountain in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo; the city the Nickel Samurai protects.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, this is an attorney's badge.\nEngarde:\nDude, I'm sorry, but I don't have the free time to be looking at things like that.\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nEngarde:\nI'm much too busy with Nickel Samurai stuff right now.\nEngarde:\nI don't have the time to take a lawyer's correspondence course...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does he believe I'm a salesman!? Insurance, then extinguishers... Now this!!)\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\n...? What's that?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a ticket for the press conference. You were going to give one after winning the Grand Prix, right?\nEngarde:\nHuh? Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. While you were in costume, no less. ([in costume] hyphenated in the original release)\nEngarde:\nUm, I never heard anything like that, dude. I only heard about the stage show.

What are you going to do with that?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know yet, but I figured I could at least show it to him...\nEngarde:\nIs that a transceiver?

Interesting.\nPhoenix:\nI've also been instructed to take your case.\nEngarde:\nIs that what you heard from the transceiver?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nEngarde:\nDude, that's terrible!

I gave him an autograph just the other day.\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't see Mr. Powers as a mentor at all...)\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nMan, it's too bad he's dead...\nPhoenix:\nYou killed him... That's the most logical conclusion, don't you agree?\nEngarde:\nDude, what are you talking about!? You're making a huge mistake.\nPhoenix:\nIf that's such a mistake, then why did they issue an arrest warrant for you!?\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the guy in charge of this place, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nStars sure know a lot of people, don't they?\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that phone even really gets reception in here...)\nEngarde:\n...Um, I guess you're right about the warrant after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we might be making some progress here!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nEngarde:\nYeah... I'm such a handsome devil.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um, yeah...\nEngarde:\nAnd I'm way good at sports! Karate, tennis, judo, soccer, football, hockey, fencing... Dude, it's no wonder I'm so popular.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um, yeah... (You're also good at sitting in a jail cell, Mr. Popular.)\nAny other evidence\nEngarde:\nDude, I know I like to throw money around, but it's not like I buy anything and everything.\nPhoenix:\n(That's nice, because it's not up for sale anyway!)\nAny other profile\nEngarde:\nUm, dude, this person looks like a member of my fan club. Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the fan club president, OK? ... ...\nPhoenix:\nUm, \"dude\", you know what...? Forget I asked...\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Press Conference Ticket and Radio Transceiver:\nEngarde:\n... ...Well, dude, I think it's about time for me to get going.\nPhoenix:\nPlease, wait! ...I really need to take your case!\nEngarde:\nThere's always other people in need of a lawyer, right? Want me to introduce you to a few?\nPearl:\nPlease! Please let Mr. Nick represent you!\nEngarde:\nMan, oh man. Lawyers these days. Now you dudes use kids to pull in clients, too?\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't take me as your lawyer, then De Killer is going to...!\nEngarde:\n... Wait... What did you just say?\nPhoenix:\n\"De Killer\"...\nEngarde:\nD-De Killer!?\nPhoenix:\n(...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...)\nEngarde:\n... Alright, dude. I accept your terms.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEngarde:\nI'll let you represent me in court.\nPearl:\nW-We did it! We did it, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...)\nEngarde:\nGo ahead, ask me anything. I'll help out as much as I can...\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nEngarde:\nMan, I thank my lucky stars that people know my name.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're quite the hero, and you're in the national spotlight.\nPearl:\nI didn't know who he is... Does that mean I'm not a good citizen...?\nEngarde:\nAh, it's really great to be the Nickel Samurai. Dude, lately, I just keep on getting more and more popular.\nPhoenix:\n(True enough... \"The Nickel Samurai\" is very popular among high schoolers and secretaries right now. I guess Mr. Engarde has a way of catching the eyes of women...)\nEngarde:\nDo you know my motto? \"Refreshing like a spring breeze.\" That's what I am.\nPearl:\nA spring breeze...\nEngarde:\nThat's why this kind of scandal is disastrous, dude. I mean, even if I get out of here tomorrow, it's still gonna look bad.\nPhoenix:\n(But everyone loves a good scandal...) (Changed from [Everyone loves a good scandal...] in the original release)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me about your activities last night?\nEngarde:\nAfter I got the award, I took a break and went back to my room. I had that post-ceremony stage show to do. So I was in my Nickel Samurai costume.\nPhoenix:\nAnd you were alone the entire time?\nEngarde:\nMy manager was running around being busy, so yeah.\nPhoenix:\nBecause of the press conference you were supposed to have after the show?\nEngarde:\nI told you, dude. I have no idea about any press conference, alright?\nPhoenix:\n(That's strange... I thought the Nickel Samurai was going to confess something...)\nEngarde:\nAnyway, when I was leaving my room, that's when I noticed it was kinda noisy...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida was already dead at that time...?\nEngarde:\nYeah, that's what I gathered anyway from my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm beginning to gather that this guy can't do a thing on his own...) (Changed from [With the way he's always talking about his manager, it's as if she runs his life.] in the original release)\nEngarde:\nAnd that's when the detective in the green coat showed up. He searched me... And then, out of the blue, the dude arrested me.\nThe victim (appears after \"Matt Engarde\")\nPhoenix:\nAbout you and the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida, what sort of...\nEngarde:\nThat's got nothing to do with anything, dude. Man, with that face of his, you can't even tell he's the same age as me. And he wanted to try making a \"Jammin' Ninja\" movie, even though we all know it'd fail.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai still won in the end, right?\nEngarde:\nYeah. I took the Grand Prix by storm. So why would I, the winner, have any reason to kill the guy anyway? Dude, you'd think it'd be the other way around, you know?\nThe charge of murder (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know why you were arrested?\nEngarde:\nI guess maybe my full body search went badly.\nPhoenix:\nDid they find something on you?\nEngarde:\nThey found a button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nPhoenix:\nA button...?\nEngarde:\nI don't get it either. It was caught in the pleats of my samurai pants, or \"hakama\".\nPearl:\nAaah!\nEngarde:\nDude, I really think someone planted it there though. I'm serious.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that's what really happened...?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nPearl:\nLet's ask one last thing. Let's test Mr. Engarde to see if he really is innocent or not...\nPhoenix:\nW-We can do that...?\nPearl:\nYes. If you use this...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's Magatama!)\nPearl:\nHe won't be able to hide any secrets from you, Mr. Nick. I'm sure of it.\nPhoenix:\n(I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly.\nEngarde:\nWhat is it, dude?\nPhoenix:\nDid you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nPlease put the phone away and answer this question yourself.\nEngarde:\nAlright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWell, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nNothing. Not a chain or lock in sight.\nPearl:\nWhich means... I think it is alright to trust him.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.)\nEngarde:\nUm... The trial's tomorrow, right? I'm counting on you, dude.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 21, 11:34 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWell, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important...\nPearl:\nSo! So now what should we do!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer.\nPearl:\nOK! Then let's start looking!\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Actually, the crime happened at the recently completed hotel in the center of town, the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. ...Just how far are they going to expand their empire...?\nCharley the plant\nPearl:\nOh! I'll water it!\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK... I already did that...\nPearl:\n...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...)\nPoster\nPearl:\nThis is the Nickel Samurai... right?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's right.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!?\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.\nPearl:\nOh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either...\nPhoenix:\nI-It's OK, Pearls. Really.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh! I cleaned it up some more for you last night! ...Because I couldn't sleep...\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSince there were no Psyche-Locks, then that means we can trust Mr. Engarde to be innocent.\nPearl:\nI really feel much better knowing that. Ever since last night, I was so worried that I kept wondering... \"What if he is the real killer...? What then...?\"\nAny ideas\nPhoenix:\nHey, I have something I want to ask you, Pearls.\nPearl:\nOK, what is it?\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you so interested in how Maya and I get along? I mean, she and I don't have anything special go--\nPearl:\nHuh!? Wh-What do you mean!? B-But I thought... I thought you and Mystic Maya were... I-I've been mistaken all this time!? No way...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aaaah! She really wasn't kidding! Pearls actually believes Maya and I are... ...Maybe I should've just left it alone...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Stop it! Don't hide your true feelings from me!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! She slapped me!!)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPearl:\nThat's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nI guess?\nPearl:\nI feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...)\nMaya Fey profile\nPearl:\nOh, Mystic Maya... I wonder if you're alright...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure she's OK. We have to be patient for just one more day. I'm sure we can save her. Trust me.\nPearl:\nIf there's anything I can do, please tell me, OK!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPearl:\nTo tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me.\nPhoenix:\nI think your hair now suits you perfectly.\nPearl:\nR-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget*\nPhoenix:\n*fidget, fidget*\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPearl:\nI'm sure that Mr. Detective would be our ally if we asked!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I think so too. (Looking back, we've known each other for a while now... He's always been trustworthy... A bit \"off\", but still trustworthy. What a paradox.)\nWill Powers profile\nPearl:\nHe's a really kind and nice old man, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is really perceptive when it comes to people... But what does she mean by \"old man\"...?) Hey, Pearls? What about me...?\nPearl:\nWhat about you, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, I don't think I want to hear this...)\nAnything else\nPearl:\nUm, there are still so many things in this world that I don't understand yet. ...Honestly, I still don't have enough training.\nPhoenix:\nAh, no, it's OK. I don't have any ideas myself...\nPearl:\nI'm sorry. I'm really sorry!\nMarch 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEngarde:\nAh, the lawyer dude. So what did you find out?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... I'm still in the middle of investigating...\nEngarde:\nI see. ...But I've already told you everything I know, dude.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\nDude, like I told you, I don't know anything about that press conference. I leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(...This is harder than pulling bass from a river...)\nRadio Transceiver\nEngarde:\nSo, why are you carrying around that transceiver...?\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about it.\nEngarde:\nAnd why do you do everything it tells you to do? You know, the messages it sends you, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, he probably doesn't have anything to do with Maya's kidnapping.) ...That's a secret.\nEngarde:\nOK, whatever, dude.\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nLook, dude, I didn't kill him. I mean, the Nickel Samurai kicked the Jammin' Ninja's butt, right? So it's not like I felt threatened by the likes of him.\nPearl:\nBeing rivals sounds like a sad way to relate to another person...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nOldbag:\nHey! What do you think you're doing!? You can't come in without...\nPearl:\nGood morning.\nOldbag:\nHold on, it's YOU! What is going on around here!?\nPhoenix:\nU-Uh... Um...\nOldbag:\nI heard poor Juan was killed. Is that true!? It's a bad rerun is what this is. Another \"Steel Samurai\" doing the most evil of deeds.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you know... That's not entirely...\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know that I was a huge fan of Juan's! Why, oh why, do all the stars I'm interested in drop one by one like flies!? It's always been that way! Ever since I was a little girl in elementary school! The class hamster was fine until it was my turn to clean its cage, and then it died! The other kids started calling me the \"Queen Reaper\". I swear that's what they dubbed me! \"Whoever you name in your evil spell dies within three minutes,\" they would taunt.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened...\nOldbag:\nHmph! Don't push me, boy!\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? I... Um... I couldn't hear everything she said... because she was talking too fast...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...?\nOldbag:\nDon't boss me around, you spiky-haired, smarty-pants!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but...\nPearl:\n...Even Mr. Engarde himself didn't seem to know, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(How does the person who's supposed to give a conference not know about it...?)\nTalk\nThe victim\nOldbag:\nMy dear Hammer died a year ago in that dreadful murder. And only recently did I finally find a star that makes this heart go *badump* again.\nPhoenix:\n...I don't know what to say...\nOldbag:\nI ask you, why does every star I cheer for always ends [sic] up kicking the bucket?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nI'd watch your words! No one's going to get away with saying anything bad about my Juan!\nPhoenix:\nBut I haven't said anything...\nOldbag:\nWell, I don't believe a word that woman says anyway!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What woman?\nOldbag:\nThat irritating, backwater girl with the afro and the horrible country accent. I mean, what is that manner of speaking supposed to be? And why does she never stop? Honestly, women these days. They don't know the meaning of the word \"modesty\". When I was a young maiden, I was so beautiful even the flowers of the field blushed. But despite this, I pressed flowers, or read the stars, or wrote beautiful love poems or\nPhoenix:\n...Pearls? Are you thirsty?\nPearl:\nUm, a little.\nPhoenix:\nOK. I'll go get you some juice or something.\nPearl:\nTh-Thank you very much.\nOldbag:\nHey! Are you paying attention!? Young'uns today!\nPhoenix:\n(So I'm guessing Ms. Oldbag heard everything from Lotta...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nI want to ask you about what happened around the time of the murder...\nOldbag:\nAh, I don't know anything about that. I was here getting ready.\nPhoenix:\nGetting ready? For what...?\nOldbag:\nThe show, of course! ...Well, and the press conference afterwards.\nPhoenix:\n(Cue mysterious music for the magical press conference.)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I don't know anything about the murder.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see...\nOldbag:\n... But.\nPhoenix:\n?\nOldbag:\nBut if you're talking about what I saw, that's different. I saw it very clearly!\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nOldbag:\nI saw the most important moment of the night!\nWhat you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nTh-The most important moment!? You don't mean...!?\nOldbag:\nOh, so now you treat me with respect, you disrespectful child. When you speak to your elders, you should always be polite. Really, kids today.\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see!?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nOldbag:\nThe murder last night was gruesome, wasn't it? But then, what murder isn't?\nPhoenix:\n(Please don't stray onto another tangent... Please...)\nOldbag:\nIf you want to hear more, then show your respect and bring this lady a present!\nWhat you witnessed (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see on the night of the murder!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPearl:\nP-Please! Mystic Maya's life is...\nOldbag:\nAh, but you haven't given me my present yet. ...Hmm... Let's see... I'll only tell it to you if you can bring me Juan's autograph!\nPhoenix:\n(What an unreasonable request... You might as well have asked for the moon!)\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nI don't have anything to say to delinquents like you!\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr... She's clamming up like the old clam she is...)\nPearl:\nPlease! Anything would be helpful!\nOldbag:\nWell then, how about I tell you my measurements?\nPhoenix:\n...Um... No, that's okay... Really.\nPearl:\nShe really doesn't like you, does she Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI know, I know...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like the investigation is still in full swing. The hotel staff and the police are running around like a bunch of headless chickens.\nPearl:\nI wonder if we can do any investigating of our own in this kind of atmosphere...\nPhoenix:\n...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess.\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of, only to disappear... ...If only we had all gone together...\nChandelier\nPearl:\nThat is such a beautiful sight.\nPhoenix:\nThe chandelier?\nPearl:\nYes. But I can't believe it... I can't believe that such a terrible murder happened under such beautiful lights... It's shocking.\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was held on that stage just last night. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nWe ate at this table last night, didn't we?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nPearl:\nI was really happy then.\nPhoenix:\n(I wish I could make you smile again... Even for a second...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHallway\nLotta:\nHey! Yer here! Been waitin' for ya, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nLotta...\nLotta:\nHey! Mr. Cop fella! The thief's showed his face!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!?\nLotta:\nArrest him! Put him on trial! Find him guilty! Give him the death penalty!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong, Lotta!? Are you feeling alright?\nLotta:\nLooked here and there and up and down the mountain, but it ain't here! So why don'tcha just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep! (Changed from [So why don't ya just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep!] in the original release)\nPearl:\nUm, what are you looking for...?\nLotta:\nMy CAMERA! C-A-M-E-R-A! It's my life blood! I'm gonna die without my $700 camera!!\nPhoenix:\nY-Your camera...?\nLotta:\nLook, don't lots of people say the criminal always goes back to the scene of the crime!? And lookie lookie, here ya are!\nPhoenix:\nYep. Here I am... Faced with a Lotta trouble.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...?\nLotta:\nI didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nLotta:\nYeah, that's what I thought too, so I was a nice enough gal to lend a helpin' hand! ...Secretly, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(I have a feeling one of these days, I'm going to end up defending her in court...)\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\".\nLotta:\nSo that's the scene of the murder, I reckon. I thought somethin' had gone on that night, but I didn't never think it was murder.\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\".\nPearl:\nSo Mr. Engarde was here during his break, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what he claims. (Hmm... The crime scene... If he had wanted to get to Mr. Corrida's room... He would have had to pass through this hallway.)\nTalk\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!\nPearl:\nHuh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?\nLotta:\nI had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon. I made this itty-bitty scratch on it and the manager got all huffed up in the face... He gave me his talkin' to and was real mean about it too. He done made me cry at that!\nPearl:\nWhen did you lose your camera?\nLotta:\nLast night, after the murder happened. Musta been when I was busy runnin' around lookin' into things! That's when I lost sight of my dear, darlin' expensive sweetie!\nPhoenix:\nLotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours?\nLotta:\nI don't rightly know. I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?)\nLotta's Camera added to the Court Record.\nCamera (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera!

Yeah, actually I was here until around the time Mr. Engarde was arrested.\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you doing here...?\nLotta:\nYou sure you went to school, City Boy? Wherever Lotta Hart goes, there's a story to be found! A big scoop to be had!\nPhoenix:\nA big scoop...?\nLotta:\nI told ya before. I'm gonna be the best tabloid photographer the world's ever seen! Reckon course that means I'm always lookin' for the perfect shot!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what \"scoop\" she was after this time...?)\nLotta:\nAlthough, I was also on the look out for the other stars that were here, so... maybe I wasn't here the entire time...\nBig scoop (appears after \"Camera\" and \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nLotta... Are you sure you weren't here the entire time? So you could take a picture for your big scoop?\nLotta:\nWell... Maybe I was. But that's what real journalists do! I got some juicy inside info, so I thought to myself, why not get a picture for proof?\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of story was it that you would hang around here...?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nOops, sorry, Mr. Lawyer. Can't be tellin' you that. Trade secret, ya know?\nPhoenix:\n(Not again... Why does everyone have something to hide...?)\nPearl:\nWe've been stopped, haven't we?\nLotta:\nHa ha, yeah! Take that, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here is happy... Ms. Lotta and your \"I rule!\" smile...)\nBig scoop (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou were on the hunt for your big scoop last night?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nIt's just a bunch of tabloid photos. They ain't got nothing to do with the murder.\nPearl:\nIt looks like we have no choice but to remove the Psyche-Locks.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I guess so.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nLotta:\nHey, what's that? ...A press conference ticket? How come I ain't got myself one of them!?\nPhoenix:\nP-Please don't direct your anger at me...\nLotta:\nWhy in tarnations wasn't I invited to that!? How come someone on the bottom of the popularity chart like you got the info, but not me!? Info like that is worth nothin' to ya, am I right or what!?\nPhoenix:\n(...Is that the kind of person she thinks I am...?)\nPearl:\nAre you going to stand there and take that, Mr. Nick!?\nLotta's Camera\nLotta:\nNngh... And I just bought that camera... Who did it!? The thievin' rascal!\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't look straight at me while you're saying that...\nLotta:\nWhen I find the bugger who went and done this, they're gonna pay with a bullet!\nPhoenix:\n(And if you do that, don't expect me to defend you...)\nMaya Fey profile\nLotta:\nNow that I think about it, she isn't with y'all today, is she...?\nPearl:\nUm...\nLotta:\nShe's a spunky one! You shouldn't have been lettin' her outta yer sight. Who knows what she's up to now...\nPhoenix:\n(Like you're one to talk...)\nPearl:\n...\nPearl Fey profile\nLotta:\nAh, just wanna say sorry to ya.\nPearl:\nFor...?\nLotta:\nWell, I really, absolutely thought you were the murderer.\nPearl:\n...Huh?\nLotta:\nYou know... Last time, that thing with Maya Fey...\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!? But why!?\nLotta:\nI mean, you were all worked up, ya know?\nPearl:\n*sniffle* ...Meanie...\nPhoenix:\nLotta, that was very insensitive of you!\nLotta Hart profile\nLotta:\nThis kind of hairstyle is pretty hard to get, ya know. Hard to care for too. Just the other day, I ran my hand through my hair to fix it up, and suddenly, out pops this dollar coin!

Don't go around getting her mixed up in things like that!\nSecurity Lady profile\nLotta:\nThis old granny? Ah, she kept on glarin' at me with those eyes of hers. As if it's my fault. Kept babblin' how she won't forgive people who write \"trash\" about her Juan... ...Ah, yeah, we sorta got into a little fight, ya know...\nPhoenix:\n(A \"little\" fight? Knowing those two, it was probably more of a blabbering contest.)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know anything...\nLotta:\n...*sigh*... I've told ya how many times now? I'm a journalist. I've got so much info runnin' laps in my head I forget things here and there!\nPearl:\nPlease don't get so worked up over this...\nLotta:\nHah! I don't care if ya beg me! \"Be extra tough on kids!\" That's this gal's motto on learnin' youngsters.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nUm... Where are we?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room.\n???:\nMay I help you with something?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... We're...\n???:\nYou're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail.\nPhoenix:\nUm... How did you know I'm his lawyer...?\n???:\nYou were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer.\nPearl:\nWow...\n???:\nIt's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either.\nPearl:\nIt's really not the time to be showing off, Mr. Nick.\nAndrews:\nI am Adrian Andrews. I hate to waste time, so let's get down to business.\nPhoenix:\nA-Alright... (She may be of small stature, but appearances can be deceiving...)\nExamine\nRed suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's probably Mr. Engarde's suitcase. For someone who was only going to be here for the award show, this is a lot of stuff. Looks like he has about three days' worth of clothes in here.\nPearl:\nStars really are different from us, aren't they...?\nBedroom\nPhoenix:\nThat's the bedroom over there.\nPearl:\nThat's a bed...? Wow, they have really big beds here!\nSofa\nPhoenix:\nThere's some samurai-looking clothes on the sofa here.\nPearl:\nUm, I think that jacket looking thing is called a \"happi\".\nPhoenix:\n(Whatever it is, I'm sure something like that would make a great souvenir. Maya would be absolutely thrilled...)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nLooks like dishes left over from dinner... A dinner for two, at that.\nPearl:\nI'm sure they're Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews' plates.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they had T-bone steaks... What's with Global Studios and T-bone steaks...?\nPlate on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a giant bone sitting on the plate.\nPearl:\nI... I don't really like meat...\nPhoenix:\n(...? There's something... weird about this plate... I just wish I could put my finger on what it is...)\nTalk\nNight of the murder\nAndrews:\nI assume the first thing you need to know is what everyone was doing that night, correct?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, that is correct.\nAndrews:\nThen I will tell you. Before the award ceremony, I had dinner with Mr. Engarde. In this very room, I might add.\nPhoenix:\n\"Dinner\"? What did you eat?\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate to waste time with trifling details. If you took a look at the table yourself, you wouldn't need to ask me.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet she's a lot of fun at parties...)\nAndrews:\nWhen the award show was starting, I headed for Viola Hall.\nPhoenix:\nAnd after the show ended, you came back to this room...?\nAndrews:\nNo, I had some small errands to run. I helped with the preparations in the lobby.\nPhoenix:\nOh... (Preparations for the post-ceremony show, I guess...)\nAndrews:\nWhen it was time for the post-ceremony show, I came back to call for Mr. Engarde. After that, I went to visit Mr. Corrida...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you found his body, isn't it?\nAndrews:\n...\nPearl:\nYou really held strong through everything...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... She does seem to be mentally tough as nails...)\nRelation to Engarde\nPhoenix:\nUm, so... About you and...\nAndrews:\nStop right there. You aren't seriously about to ask how Mr. Engarde and I are related, are you? (Changed from [Don't expect me to believe you have been talking to me without knowing how we relate.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nAndrews:\nI have no idea how he could chose [sic] you as his lawyer. (Changed from [I have no idea why Mr. Engarde chose you as his lawyer.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Why did she have to go and say something like that...?)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Calm down and hang in there. I'll give you a shoulder rub to relieve your stress later, alright?\nAndrews:\nI already gave you my name earlier, but I'll add that I'm Mr. Engarde's manager.\nPhoenix:\nHis manager... Speaking of managers, did the victim, Mr. Corrida have one?\nAndrews:\nNo, he did not.\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't?\nAndrews:\nGlobal Studios has a very different policy from Worldwide Studios in that Worldwide Studios does not assign individual managers to their stars.\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nAndrews:\nThis industry is very ruthless and unforgiving. Actually, you look quite ruthless and unforgiving yourself to your poor partner. Dragging a little girl like her to places like this. Honestly.\nPearl:\nYou're wrong! I... I'm doing this to help Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Calm down and hang in there. I'll buy you a juice later, alright?\nPearl:\nNngh...\nMotive for murder (appears after presenting Juan Corrida profile)\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any ideas?\nAndrews:\nAs to...?\nPhoenix:\nAs to why Mr. Corrida was murdered?\nAndrews:\nWhy would you ask me about such a thing...?\nPhoenix:\nI'm just doing my job. So, do you have any ideas?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nSorry, but there's nothing more I have to add to this conversation.\nPearl:\nIs it a Psyche-Lock, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYes... There's getting to be more and more of these lately.\nMotive for murder (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou know something, don't you? About why Mr. Corrida was murdered...\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nAndrews:\nWhy are you asking me? Don't tell me you can see inside my heart.\nPhoenix:\n(No, but I can see the locks you have on your psyche.)\nPearl:\nIf you don't remove her locks...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it's worthless to even ask...)\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one taking care of the arrangements for this press conference, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, that's right.\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Engarde said he \"didn't know\" about it.\nAndrews:\n... Is that what he said...?\nPearl:\nHuh...?\nAndrews:\nActually, I didn't know all the details either. It was a request from the publicity department. All I did was help out and do what I was asked.\nPearl:\nOh... I see.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder about that... I wouldn't take her to be the type of person to do something without knowing the details.)\nWill Powers profile\nAndrews:\nThat's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be.\nPhoenix:\n(Urk... What a horrible thing to say...)\nAndrews:\n...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? For a second, her face twisted in pain...)\nPearl:\nI wonder if something happened to Ms. Andrews...\nJuan Corrida profile\nPhoenix:\nDid you know the victim, Mr. Corrida?\nAndrews:\nYes, I knew him. The world is such a small place, after all.\nPearl:\nDid you know about his rivalry with the Nickel Samurai?\nAndrews:\nHonestly, they were like children when it came to that. Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most trivial things. (Changed from [Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most uninteresting things.] in the original release) ... If either one of them wasn't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die. (Changed from [If either one of them weren't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n! (...I've got a hunch that this woman knows more than she's letting on... She must know why Juan Corrida was killed!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nAndrews:\nI asked to become Mr. Engarde's manager. He's a pleasure to manage with his nice disposition.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Mr. Engarde does seem like a rather weak-willed man; always doing as he's told...)\nPearl:\nHe's always saying, \"my manager,\" right Mr. Nick?\nAndrews:\n...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAndrews:\nI hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... (Take away that layer of sarcasm and she really does seem to hate herself...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, I'd like to ask you about this...\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Where are we...?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Juan Corrida's room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Corrida...?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim... Which makes this the crime scene, too.\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's you! So!? What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!?\nPhoenix:\nNot yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there?\nPhoenix:\n(I just want Maya to be alright...)\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nWe don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal.\nPhoenix:\nCan you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...?\nGumshoe:\nJust this once... \"Special circumstances\" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here.\nPhoenix:\nThank you.\nGumshoe:\nOh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy.\nPearl:\nWow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you!\nGumshoe:\nHa ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I got a map!\nPhoenix:\nThat's great, Pearls!\nPearl:\n... Um... But Mr. Nick, I can't read what it says...\nHotel Guidemap added to the Court Record.\nExamine\nRefrigerator\nPhoenix:\nThere are all sorts of things in this refrigerator...\nPearl:\nThe carrot juice bottle and the tomato juice bottle are both empty...\nPhoenix:\nEmpty...? (It's too much of a hassle to throw them away, I guess.) They're all vegetable juices. I guess he must've been a real health nut.\nPearl:\n...Oh! There's a beet, some ketchup, and a bottle of strawberry jam too!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe red was his favorite color...?\nStuffed bears\nPearl:\nWow, there are a lot of bears!\nPhoenix:\n(Alarm clock ones, collector's editions, stuffed teddies, plastic models... It's pretty overwhelming... Is there a kind of bear he doesn't have...?)\nPearl:\nThere's even a few in the trash can...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I get the feeling maybe the guy didn't really like bears.\nPearl:\nPoor teddies...\nIt's hard to \"bear\" with all these problems... Growl! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n... (I don't think I want to \"bear\" with the trauma the last case caused me...)\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mr. Nick?\nDesk\nPearl:\nHmph! It's so messy here!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls really likes things neat and tidy, I take it...)\nPearl:\nThere are a lot of electronic things in here that I've never seen before. Hey, Mr. Nick! Tell me what they are, pretty please?\nPhoenix:\nOK. That over there is a \"watch\". You wear it on your wrist.\nPearl:\n... I know what a watch is...\nPhoenix:\n(Oops. For a second there, I forgot I was talking with Pearls, not Maya...)\nBlue suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's a suitcase. There are so many things in it that I bet it barely closes. There's his clothes, a dryer, an electric shaver, a calculator...\nPearl:\nDo all stars pack too much stuff like Mr. Corrida?\nTable on right\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Mr. Corrida had dinner last night.\nPearl:\nThis bottle... It's tomato juice.\nPhoenix:\n(We had a lot of food at the award show last night... But I wonder if the stars had gone onstage after only eating a meager meal like this...)\nBedroom\nPearl:\nSo that's a bed, right?\nPhoenix:\nYup. It's big, but it's a bed.\nPearl:\nAaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft!\nPhoenix:\n(Big beds must be a rarity for her...)\nScattered items near guitar case\nPhoenix:\nBottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.\nPearl:\nWhat's this glass fragment from...?\nPhoenix:\nA flower vase maybe? There are flowers on the floor, but I don't know what they are.\nPearl:\nYou don't know much about flowers, do you Mr. Nick?\nGuitar case\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.\nPearl:\nThat's strange. The guitar is not here...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he forgot to bring it to the show?\nPearl:\nBut Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item...\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid...\nPearl:\nYeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nGuitar Case added to the Court Record.\nGuitar case (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.\nPearl:\nThat's strange. The guitar is not here...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he forgot to bring it to the show?\nPearl:\nBut Mystic Maya...

There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nWine glass\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nPearl:\nBut doesn't it seem weird?\nPhoenix:\n...What seems weird?\nPearl:\nI mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor.\nPhoenix:\n... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)\nPearl:\nWhy is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?\nWine Glass added to the Court Record.\nWine glass (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there.

(She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)\nPearl:\nWhy is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?\nTalk\nCause of death\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what was the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nWell, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal. (Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIt should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Here's a picture.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a knife in his chest.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal, that's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was stabbed to death...)\nGumshoe:\nThey're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now.\nPhoenix:\nThere were fingerprints on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nYup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nCause of death (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what was the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nWell, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal.

And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nReason for arrest\nPhoenix:\nWhy was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nBecause we had evidence on him.\nPearl:\nEvidence...?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the victim, Juan Corrida, really put up a big fight.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, one look at the crime scene and you can tell. There's signs of a struggle everywhere.\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah. During the fight, his button came off...\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde said something about a button... Something like, one of the Jammin' Ninja's buttons got caught in his \"hakama\"...)\nGumshoe:\nBut that's not all...\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nThere was a witness, pal.\nPhoenix:\nA witness!? Wh-Who is it!?\nGumshoe:\nThat lady... Ms. Oldbag.\nPhoenix:\n(Please... Anyone but her!)\nGumshoe:\nThe prosecution has plenty of evidence to make a solid case... Not to mention there's something around where the vic was that's a little off. (Changed from [Not to mention there's something at the crime scene that was a little off.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nSomething that's a little off...? As in...? (Changed from [Something that was a little off...? As in...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nAs in, that's for you to figure out, pal!\nPearl:\nAlright, let's try to figure it out, Mr. Nick!\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nGumshoe:\nThat's your \"present\" from the kidnapper, huh? While you're talking, it sends and receives radio waves... If we could trace that...\nPearl:\nYeah! We could use it to find out where the bad guy is!\nPhoenix:\n(It uses radio waves, huh?)\nGumshoe:\nI got it! I'll go find a radio scanner, and let you borrow it, pal!\nGuitar Case\nPhoenix:\nWhat can you tell me about this guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nOh, that. This is just what I heard, pal, but that's the Jammin' Ninja's signature item.\nPhoenix:\nThe guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nNo, not that! What do you take me as? I mean the guitar inside, of course!\nPearl:\nBut... The guitar is missing.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, we looked for it too. It's not normal for a person to forget to bring their most famous item to an award show.\nPhoenix:\n(It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...)\nWine Glass\nPhoenix:\nSo about this wine glass...\nGumshoe:\nAh, so you noticed it, pal. The whole crime scene was a mess, but this glass was the only thing that was untouched.\nPhoenix:\nYou noticed that too, Detective Gumshoe...?\nGumshoe:\nNo, actually Ms. von Karma noticed it first.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Pearls noticed it before me too... Hey, wait a minute. So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's here at the hotel...? (Changed from [So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's coming here...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah, she's around. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal. (Changed from [Yeah, she's coming. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal.] in the original release) Especially if she catches you in here. (Changed from [I think it'd be best if you didn't bump into her here.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou can bet the instant I see her, I'll be running the 1,000 meter dash.\nCrime Photo\nGumshoe:\nYou look at this photo and you can't help it. It makes you want to say, \"I can't believe this is the scene of a murder.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Stabbed with a knife after a struggle... A clue is sleeping in this photo somewhere... I know it.)\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm sorry.\nPhoenix:\n...For what?\nGumshoe:\nI really want to help you look for her, pal.\nPearl:\nMr. Detective...\nGumshoe:\nIf anything happens, let me know, OK? I want to help in any way I can!\nPearl Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, little missy. Listen good, OK?\nPearl:\nOK. What is it?\nGumshoe:\nDon't ever pick up a whip, OK? Don't even think about it.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nGumshoe:\nIf you ever find yourself thinking you want one, try to make due with a good slap to the face. Got that? Slap the person in the face. Promise me, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(Personal experience tells me Gumshoe should be careful what he wishes for...)\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nIf I had a choice, she would be number three on my list of people I don't want to see.\nPhoenix:\n...Because I'm in the number one spot?\nGumshoe:\nDon't get all high and mighty on me here. You've taken a tumble into second place, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really? Then who's in first...?\nGumshoe:\nMs. von Karma's miles and miles ahead of you in this race.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh...\nGumshoe:\nShe's really scary... Right now... M-Ms. von Karma... You really don't...\nPhoenix:\n(He's so scared of her that he's whispering now...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, why don't we let bygones be bygones, pal? Look, this guy is guilty. A buck says so.\nPhoenix:\nOne dollar...? Sure you're not talking about Pearls' allowance money?\nGumshoe:\nI... I can't bet any more than that... My salary... It's...\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't matter what we think... I still have to defend Mr. Engarde in court or else!)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick...\nSecurity Lady profile\nGumshoe:\nI thought she was an alien from outer space.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, probably because she's wearing that strange helmet.\nGumshoe:\nNah, even with her helmet off, I thought she was an alien, pal.\nPhoenix:\n... I think that's probably best kept to yourself, if you know what I mean...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nGumshoe:\nShe's Mr. Engarde's manager, right? No matter what I do, I really stink at talking with people like her. As soon as I open my mouth, I get all flustered. See, she's one of those women with a brain. She's someone who \"gets things done\".\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she does give that sort of impression, like she's got it all together.\nGumshoe:\nCompared to her, you can easily tell I'm a \"can't do anything right\" kind of guy. That's why I get all nervous and start messing up.\nPhoenix:\n(I feel sort of bad for him...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you know about this?\nGumshoe:\nUm... There's nothing special I can tell you about this, pal. Look pal, we don't have a lot of time. Why don't you show me something more important? If Ms. von Karma saw me here like this... I'd have to switch sides real fast...\nAfter clearing all Talk options, examining guitar case, and presenting Wine Glass:\n...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*...\nPearl:\nWh-What's that beeping noise, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I've heard this sound somewhere before...)\nGumshoe:\nIt's Ms. von Karma...\nPearl:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nFor some reason, whenever I hear that sound, she pops out of nowhere and whips me! (Changed from [Whenever I hear that sound, for some reason, she pops out of nowhere and whips me!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, that's exactly what happen [sic] the last time...) (Changed from [Come to think of it, that did happen the last time...] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nS-Sorry! I've gotta make myself scarce! Later, pal! Eowww!\nvon Karma:\nAt last, you reveal your true nature... Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(*gulp* Would it be too much to ask for you to be nice to me for a change...?)\nvon Karma:\nSo you're the type to steal information from pitifully hopeless detectives! That's very dishonorable of you!\nPhoenix:\n(Owww!)\nvon Karma:\nHey! Don't you dare run away, Scruffy McTrenchcoat!\nGumshoe:\nAh!\nvon Karma:\nI didn't think the detectives of this country could be this pitiful...\nGumshoe:\nUwaah!\nvon Karma:\nDetective! Come over here for a second!\nGumshoe:\nYeooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!\nvon Karma:\n...Hmph. I feel better knowing at least you were man enough to face your punishment.\nPhoenix:\n(He was so scared, he just froze up on the spot...)\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright! You... You have soiled my perfect prosecution record. I'll never forget that. This time... Victory is mine!\nPhoenix:\n... Victory is yours? Is that all this means to you...?\nvon Karma:\nWh-What...!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nvon Karma:\n... H-Hmph! Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin. (Changed from [Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!\nvon Karma:\nThis isn't over yet... I swear on my family's honor!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! What did she throw at me NOW...!? (Changed from [Ow! Now what did she throw at me...!?] in the original release) What is this...?)\nGumshoe:\n...Well, I guess this means I've gotta get back to the precinct now, pal. If you ever need me, come down to the Criminal Affairs Department, alright? And if you can, try not to let Ms. von Karma see you...\nExamine\nPaper on desk\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, what's this piece of paper...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's called an \"autograph\".\nPearl:\nAuto-graff?\nPhoenix:\nIt's got Mr. Corrida's name written on it, so it's his autograph.\nPearl:\nI can't read it at all. To be honest, I've never seen writing that looks like this.\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's a special way of writing called \"cursive\". Look here. See how it says, \"To my dearest Wendy\" in more normal letters here?\nPearl:\nTh-This sloppy, unreadable writing! It's crazy and cruel to give this to someone!\nPhoenix:\n(Hold on...)\nPearl:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nWendy... I've heard that name somewhere before...\nMr. Corrida's Autograph added to the Court Record.\nAfter visiting Enguarde's Hotel Room:\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPowers:\nOh, Mr. Wright! How are you?\nPhoenix:\nAh, Mr. Powers. Have you been here the entire time?\nPowers:\nYeah. People connected to the murder aren't allowed to go home, let alone leave...\nTalk\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me a little more about the Nickel Samurai TV show?\nPowers:\nOK. \"The Nickel Samurai\" is an action hero program aimed towards kids. It's the sequel to \"The Steel Samurai\".\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nPowers:\nThis time, there are three Samurai Brothers: Aluminum Samurai, Tin Samurai... And of course, the Nickel Samurai. It's a love \"Y\" in Neo Olde Tokyo!\nPhoenix:\nI see... ... W-Wait... A love what...?\nPowers:\nA love \"Y\". This girl, Sayo, works at a tea shop and all three guys fall for her at the same time.\nPhoenix:\nOh... I guess the \"Y\" shape is like the 3 brothers colliding over this one girl?\nPowers:\nAnyway, Sayo is actually the daughter of the evil Strawberry Clan's leader!\nPhoenix:\nSounds like an unusual situation. Like Romeo and Juliet... times three.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah...

What's he like!?\nMia:\nI don't know... Apparently, Maya went to answer a phone call at the hotel and was drugged there...\nPhoenix:\nAnd!?\nMia:\nShe didn't see the face of her attacker.\nPhoenix:\nArgh...\nPresent\nAnything\nMia:\nSorry, but I don't have time to answer your questions.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... And we should be worrying about Maya right now...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMia:\nMaya is locked up in a very dark place right now.

I could really go for some apple pie... I mean, at a time like this, sweets are the only way to go! I have to stay positive! He promised he wasn't going to kill me! I'm not going to die! (Sis... I wonder if you're with Nick right now...)\nExamine\nBottles\nMaya:\nWhat's this...? It feels like there are a lot of glass bottles here. And these... They feel like barrels. I'll pass... Too bad I'm really hungry, and not really thirsty.\nBoxes\nMaya:\nThere's all sorts of things piled up here... But it's too dark to see.\nDoor\nMaya:\nDrat, it's locked. (Hmm, but this door's lock seems easy enough to open...) On TV, the hero always uses a plastic card or a stiff piece of cardboard... ...Then \"click\", they magically open the door. (I wonder if there's a card like that around here I could use...)\nCard\nMaya:\nHuh? Someone dropped a card here... It kinda looks like... a business card... But there's no name on it. Hmm... It's a picture of a seashell, I think... What a strange card.\nMove\nMaya:\nIf I don't do something to the door first, I don't think I'll be \"moving\" anywhere...\nAfter examining door and card:\nMaya:\nAh! That's it! This shell card! If I use this, maybe I can get the door open! This might be my key out of here! I had a feeling this card might be useful... I'm such a genius! Alright. Now if you'll excuse me, Mr. Kidnapper...\n...*click*...\nMaya:\n(I did it!) OK... Now I'm getting the heck out of here! (I shouldn't keep Nick waiting...

She's unharmed, right!?\n???:\nWell... When I checked on her earlier this morning, she seemed a bit, how shall we say, tired.\nPhoenix:\n...!\n???:\nDon't worry. People don't die that easily.

Are the prosecution and defense ready?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nJudge:\n... I say! Mr. Wright! What happened to Ms. von Karma!?\nPhoenix:\nI-I don't know, Your Honor! (Why are you getting mad at me!?)\nBailiff:\n...Your Honor!\nJudge:\nPlease be quiet, bailiff. Court is in session. If you must tell me something, please keep it brief. Now then, what is it?\nBailiff:\nProsecutor... Prosecutor von Karma has... This morning, Ms. von Karma was shot by an unknown gunman!\nJudge:\n... WWWWWWWHAT!?\nPhoenix:\nSh-Shot!?\nMia:\nSomehow... I think this is the \"present\" that man was talking about.\nPhoenix:\nHis \"present\"...!\nMia:\nMs. von Karma is one of the top prosecutors in the country at the moment. If she were to disappear...

Y-Y-You're...\nPhoenix:\n(I thought he'd show up...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Your Honor... Due to the circumstances, Ms. Franziska von Karma can not appear in court today. I, Miles Edgeworth, will be taking her place. The prosecution is ready... naturally.\nEdgeworth:\nMs. von Karma was shot in her right shoulder, and is currently undergoing surgery. Luckily, I have looked this case over and am familiar with the details. The prosecution seeks to prove the guilt of Mr. Matt Engarde.\nJudge:\nTh-The court acknowledges the prosecution.\nEdgeworth:\n...Wright. I finally found the answer I was struggling for on my long journey this past year. By the time this case comes to an end, you too, will know the answer.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, the prosecution would like to call its first witness... Please bring Detective Gumshoe to the witness stand!\nEdgeworth:\nWitness, your name and occupation.\nGumshoe:\nMy name's Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm a detective down at the precinct... for now.\nJudge:\n\"For now\"...?\nGumshoe:\nAfter this trial's over... I'm supposed to turn in my badge, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(D-Detective Gumshoe...)\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution has no need for a depressed witness. Lift your head up and face forward like a proud officer, Detective Dick Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nNow, let's have your testimony. If we want to explore the various facets of this case, we must start with that.\nMia:\nGet ready, Phoenix. This is going to be one very rough fight.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... It would have to be with Edgeworth as my opponent.  (The answer he was \"struggling\" for... Interesting... Show me this \"answer\" you finally found, Edgeworth...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Bare Facts of the Case --\nGumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... After the award ceremony ended, the victim was alone in his room...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir! Both the victim and defendant went alone to their rooms, sir.\nJudge:\nI see. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- Bare Facts of the Case --\nGumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWould you please give us a brief timeline of what happened after the ceremony?\nGumshoe:\nOK, pal. The ceremony started at 6 PM. It ended around 8 PM... and then there was a short break. A special post-ceremony show was supposed to start in the lobby 30 minutes later.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when the victim's body was found, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nWhich is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period.\nJudge:\nHmm... Please continue with your testimony, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe person who discovered the victim's body was Adrian Andrews, correct?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Adrian Andrews\" you're talking about?\nGumshoe:\nShe's the defendant, Matt Engarde's, manager. She's a really pretty lady... sir.\nJudge:\nAh, so she's a pretty lady... I wonder if she will grace us with her presence...\nGumshoe:\nWhen the post-ceremony show was about to start, she went to get Mr. Engarde. After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir.\nJudge:\nI see... And that's when she found the victim's body...\nGumshoe:\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana.\nJudge:\nMmm... \"Banana\"...\nGumshoe:\nUm, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir.\nJudge:\nAh, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana.\nPhoenix:\nThen, what about the knife...?\nGumshoe:\nIt seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death.\nJudge:\nHmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nPress (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo.

We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.\nGumshoe:\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...\nGuitar Case updated in the Court Record.\nPress (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal.

Ah, so much for my theory then...\nGumshoe:\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhat convinced you it had nothing to do with the case?\nGumshoe:\nThe guitar wasn't at the Gatewater Hotel that night.\nJudge:\nWell then, where was it?\nGumshoe:\nThe bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir.\nJudge:\nSo you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar.\nPhoenix:\nSo that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nMia:\nOur first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.\nPhoenix:\nBut there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...\nMia:\nMaybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.\nPhoenix:\nIf you say so...\nMia:\nOf course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?\nAfter pressing third, fourth, and fifth statements:\nEdgeworth:\nI believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nWhich brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.\nPhoenix:\n(Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)\nJudge:\nVery well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Why Arrest Engarde? --\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!\nJudge:\nHmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.\nGumshoe:\nIt was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.\nKnife added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\n...And there's this button.\nJudge:\nThat was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nJammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nAll of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?\nPhoenix:\nHmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!\nEdgeworth:\nYou can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.\nPhoenix:\nGrrrrrrrrr...\nCross Examination\n-- Why Arrest Engarde? --\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown.\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end...\nJudge:\nThat is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nGumshoe:\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls!\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah, I guess, but...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all!\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUm, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nDetective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired.\nGumshoe:\nEh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's...\nEdgeworth:\nI look forward to your pension negotiations.\nGumshoe:\nN-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony.\nGumshoe:\n*sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too...\nEdgeworth:\nDetective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)\nGumshoe:\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any proof that button belonged to the victim?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nOh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\".\nGumshoe:\nHuh? But can't you tell by just looking at it?\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nA-And the victim's blood is on it.\nPhoenix:\nAnyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward.\nGumshoe:\n... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Thread.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nThe button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal!\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nMia:\nThat's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.\nGumshoe:\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhen was this button found?\nGumshoe:\nPretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder...\nEdgeworth:\nThe police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people...\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)\nGumshoe:\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHow were the fingerprints arranged on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nBy examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...?\nGumshoe:\nOh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe the bumbling of this department...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?\nGumshoe:\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife!\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...)\nMia:\n...Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nThere's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.\nPresent Knife\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"\nPhoenix:\n(A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)\nMia:\nBe grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.\nPhoenix:\nWe're still in a world of trouble...\nMia:\nWell, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nWait a second!\nGumshoe:\nWh-What?\nPhoenix:\nSo the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The defendant...\nPhoenix:\n...Did not buy this knife.\nGumshoe:\nH-Huh!?\nPhoenix:\nTake a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.\nGumshoe:\n...Huh?\nJudge:\nIt has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...\nGumshoe:\n\"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.\nPhoenix:\nThat's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.\nGumshoe:\n... Uh oh.\nPhoenix:\nThe murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!\nJudge:\nYes, that is very true! This is a very big...\nEdgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...\nJudge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nI think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.\nPhoenix:\nH-How so!?\nEdgeworth:\nI admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.\nGumshoe:\n...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*\nEdgeworth:\nThe question is... Where did this knife come from?\nJudge:\nWh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.\nJudge:\nThere is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?\nEdgeworth:\nIf it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.\nJudge:\nAmazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.\nMia:\nIt seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...\nPhoenix:\n(This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)\nJudge:\nA murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.\nEdgeworth:\nI can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.\nPhoenix:\n(Evidence not yet shown...?)\nMia:\nHe means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.\nJudge:\nWhat does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well...\nMia:\nPhoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...\nPhoenix:\n(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?\nActually, I do.\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"\nNo, not right now.\nPhoenix:\n(This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.)\nJudge:\nLooks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means this court is adjourned.\nMia:\nPhoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!)\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"\nPhoenix:\nThere's one...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nOne piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.\nPhoenix:\n(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)\nJudge:\nYou may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?\nPresent Wine Glass\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong.\nJudge:\nI can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nI am a man of my word, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penalty\nJudge:\nThis... is a wine glass, is it not?\nPhoenix:\nPlease look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, yes, I see your point.\nPhoenix:\nHowever! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!\nJudge:\n...\nGumshoe:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nW-Well? What do you all have to say...?\nJudge:\nAh, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!\nJudge:\nYou can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is it, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nYour opinion...\nEdgeworth:\n...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.\nPhoenix:\n...What!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.\nJudge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)\nIt's possible.\nPhoenix:\n(It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...)\nMia:\nYou can't think like that, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nRight now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(So in other words, push as far as we can go...)\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"\nThere's no way.\nPhoenix:\n(If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!)\nMia:\nThey just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough!\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"\nPhoenix:\nThe defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!\nJudge:\nHmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?\nPhoenix:\n(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)\nEdgeworth:\nUnlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nEdgeworth:\nYou're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?\nPhoenix:\nTh-Then...\nEdgeworth:\nOf course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.\nPhoenix:\nFingerprints...\nEdgeworth:\nThere were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.\nJudge:\nOnly one? Well, whose were they!?\nEdgeworth:\nThey were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!?\nWine Glass updated in the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nThat is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.\nJudge:\nHmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.\nPhoenix:\nGrrr!\nEdgeworth:\nI've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!\nJudge:\nW-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.\nPhoenix:\n\"Another witness\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!\nMia:\nWhat in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, witness, please state your name and occupation...\nOldbag:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nEdgeworth:\nUurrngh!\nOldbag:\n...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!\nEdgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr...\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)\nOldbag:\nOh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!\nEdgeworth:\nI saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?\nOldbag:\nI tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.\nJudge:\nMs... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nJudge:\nOof!\nOldbag:\nShush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!\nJudge:\nYes, madam.\nEdgeworth:\nNo no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.\nOldbag:\nIt's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?\nOldbag:\nIt was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!\nJudge:\nYou mean... You were a fan of the victim?\nOldbag:\nLook, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!\nPhoenix:\n(Um... But those two were the same age...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.\nEdgeworth:\nVery well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.\nOldbag:\nLeave it to me, Edgey-poo!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What You Witnessed --\nOldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!\nJudge:\nHmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...\nOldbag:\nSee! It has to be him! He's the murderer!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- What You Witnessed --\nOldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what was your post on that night?\nOldbag:\nThe lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...)\nOldbag:\nBesides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?\nOldbag:\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSomething you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that?\nOldbag:\nIt's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course.\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Gossip\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nIf this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony.\nMia:\nIt looks like we shouldn't force it right now.\nJudge:\nHmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?\nOldbag:\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room?\nOldbag:\nI have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am!\nJudge:\n...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?\nOldbag:\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWho in the world was that!?\nOldbag:\nI'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was...\nJudge:\nYes...? He was...?\nOldbag:\n... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...)\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.\nOldbag:\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release))\nThe person's face\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's face in more detail!\nOldbag:\nYou don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth!\nPhoenix:\nHis teeth were... shining?\nOldbag:\nWell, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie.\nPhoenix:\n... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!?\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nIt was not important.\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nIt was very important.\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nWhat the person was carrying\nPhoenix:\nWhat was the man you saw carrying?\nOldbag:\nIn which hand? His right or his left?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nAh, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand?\nOldbag:\nAh, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand.\nPhoenix:\nThen how about his left?\nOldbag:\nEmpty.\nPhoenix:\n... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nIt was not important.\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nIt was very important.\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nThe person's clothes\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's clothes in more detail!\nOldbag:\nWhat a troublesome man you are. Really, as if something like that matters.\nPhoenix:\nBut it does.\nOldbag:\nUm... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat thing?\nOldbag:\nThat gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...)\nOldbag:\nThat thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!!\nPhoenix:\nUm, right...\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nIt was not important.\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable?

I request what the witness said about the jacket be appended to her testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't quite see where you're going with this, but alright. Witness, please...\nOldbag:\nAh well, I don't like to badmouth anyone without reason, but if I must...\nAdds statement \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\"\nPress (after adding statement)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I'm going to have to press a little harder on this one... There's got to be some sort of huge contradiction I can find here...)\nOldbag:\nHe was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure the defendant was wearing a racing jacket?\nOldbag:\nWhat do you think? It's not like I've seen him in anything other than that horrible thing. I'm sure he was wearing it!\nPhoenix:\n(She is so sure of herself that it's to the point of self-absorption...)\nPresent Jammin' Ninja's Button\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag...\"\nMia:\nShe may not remember things or be mistaken here and there, but I don't think she's lying.\nPhoenix:\nThat's bad for us. Really bad.\nMia:\nBut, that's how the human mind is. It also has the tendency to jump off-topic. She's strayed onto a few interesting side-topics this time too, hasn't she? But that's what makes her a sweet old lady, right?\nPhoenix:\n(That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag...\nOldbag:\nWhat!? Don't say my name for no reason!\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what this is?\nOldbag:\nAaaah! It's button number 2 on the Jammin' Ninja's costume!\nPhoenix:\n(Now I KNOW she's an obsessed fan... She identified it in a single glance!)\nOldbag:\nGive it here! Give it here! If you don't give it to me, I'll punish you with this!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.\nOldbag:\nSee! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!\nPhoenix:\nIt was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.\nOldbag:\nSee! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\n...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his \"usual racing jacket\"!?\nOldbag:\n... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nJudge:\nNow hold your tongue still there for one second! So what you saw in actuality, was not Mr. Engarde, the man... but Mr. Engarde, the Nickel Samurai!?\nOldbag:\nBut when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!\nOldbag:\nEdgey-poo! Do you think so too?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, it might be something worth considering. (Changed from [Well, it might be something worth thinking about.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nJust say, \"It's important\" and agree with me for a change!\nJudge:\nWitness! Think carefully and try to remember as much as you can before you testify!\nOldbag:\n*sigh* Alright, if you insist.\nPhoenix:\n(I should be the one sighing, not you!)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Who I Saw --\nOldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.\nPhoenix:\nI... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Did you think there could've been someone else inside that costume? Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.\nPhoenix:\nBut... But the possibility does exist!\nOldbag:\nAh, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.\nJudge:\nH-How do you know that?\nOldbag:\nBecause... I said so. And what I say is the truth.\nPhoenix:\n(At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.\nCross Examination\n-- Who I Saw --\nOldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWould you please get on with your testimony!\nOldbag:\nHmph! Watch your language, young man! What sort of tone is that to take with an elder! My youthfulness isn't what it used to be, so you should forgive me for everything! If you keep on barking at me like that, I'll start singing at the top of my lungs!\nPhoenix:\nUh, what?\nOldbag:\n\"A striking figure by the sea, standing all alone is he. He's the Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n(...She's actually singing... Someone help my poor ears.)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Can you please do something about this racket!?\nEdgeworth:\nWitness. I'll give you a piece of gum later if you'll be good and stick to just the facts.\nOldbag:\nOKAAAAAAAY! ... You promise, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I'll be sending the bill for the chewing gum to your office at a later date.\nPhoenix:\n(Remind me to send you a thank you note later too, Edgeworth, old chum...)\nOldbag:\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBe a little more careful with your testimony, please! Not too long ago, you said he was wearing his \"racing jacket\", and now he's not!?\nOldbag:\n\"Not too long ago\"...? Then let me ask you this! When you were itty-bitty, what was your grand dream?\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nOldbag:\nWhat did you want to be when you grew up, whippersnapper!?\nPhoenix:\nMy dream, huh...? Well, I... uh, wanted to be Judge Wackner, hero of the Public's Court. So what!?\nOldbag:\nSee! And look at where you are now! You're not Judge Wackner, are you!? Are you!?\nPhoenix:\nWell...\nOldbag:\n\"What I said earlier\"... Who puts any weight into things like that!? The \"now\" is everything! I can't be held responsible for the \"past\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did court become theatrics over testimonies?)\nOldbag:\nAll that matters is that man was inside that costume. Isn't that enough!?\nOldbag:\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd why would that be?\nOldbag:\nThat way, no one could see his face, of course!\nPhoenix:\nBut there's still no advantage for him that I can see. In fact, you would think the costume would make him stand out all the more!\nOldbag:\n... You are such a annoying child, you know that? You disagree with everything I say...\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that what YOU'RE always doing to me!?)\nOldbag:\nI got it! Maybe it was more troublesome for him to change in and out of his costume!\nOldbag:\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWas there anyone else scheduled to appear at the post-ceremony show?\nOldbag:\nWell, all the contestants were supposed to go onstage in a friendly gesture thing.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that included the Jammin' Ninja...?\nOldbag:\nOf course it included him! That's why when Engarde came out of dear Juan's room, I didn't give it a second thought.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nOldbag:\nWell, anyway.\nOldbag:\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo let me ask you one last time. The person you saw, it really was the Nickel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nAs showy as ever. Haven't I been saying that from the very beginning!?\nPhoenix:\n(Can I throw in the towel yet?)\nPresent Knife\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Please take a look at this.\"\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nMia:\nYou don't need to think too hard on this one.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nThere's a contradiction in her testimony and it's sitting in plain sight. The question is what that contradiction means for us...\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I have to figure out what you're talking about first, but OK...)\nPhoenix:\nPlease take a look at this.\nOldbag:\nYeah, so, it's a knife. Big deal. If you're trying to scare me with that, I'll have you know it won't work!\nPhoenix:\nNo no, that's not my intention at all...\nJudge:\nThat's the knife that was used in the murder, correct?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. Do you know why this piece of evidence is important to this case?\nJudge:\nYou don't even have to ask. It's because the defendant's fingerprints are on it.\nEdgeworth:\n... Is that what you're driving at...?\nPhoenix:\nThat is exactly what I am driving at.\nJudge:\nWhat are we driving at? And whose car are we driving?\nPhoenix:\nIf Mr. Engarde was really in the Nickel Samurai costume at the time of the murder, then it's impossible for his fingerprints to have been left on this knife! Actually, he would have wiped all previous fingerprints on this knife right off!\nJudge:\nOh, that's right! The Nickel Samurai wears gloves, doesn't he?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nHe probably took his gloves off before he began the stabbing!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd why would he do something like that? To leave his prints on the murder weapon? There is no way he would do something like that!\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, there is one possibility!\nPhoenix:\nThen let's hear your \"possibility\"!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's very simple. The defendant went to the victim's room while in costume as the Nickel Samurai. At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder. He was probably just going to relax and talk with the victim about the stage show. Which is why he took his gloves off!\nJudge:\nHmm... But the murder still did take place...\nEdgeworth:\nIt's well known that there was bad blood between the defendant and the victim. (Changed from [It's well known that the defendant and the victim had bad blood between them.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm, yes... I have heard that before... (Changed from [Hmm, yes... I have heard of that...] in the original release) Well, Mr. Wright? What do you have to say about Mr. Edgeworth's theory...?\nPhoenix:\n(So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this: When the defendant went to the victim's room, he had no intentions of killing him. Now, up to this point, are there any problems with his theory...?)\nThere are no problems.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... I can't see any real problems with his theory...)\nMia:\nBut if you let Edgeworth's theory stand, then we're one very large step closer to a guilty verdict. Look at the Court Record again and take another shot at it.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I just have to think about it one more time...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please make your decision soon.\nLeads back to:\n\"So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this:\"\nThere is a contradiction.\nLeads to:\n\"This theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!\"\nThink about it one more time.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I think I need a little more time on this one.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this:\"\nPhoenix:\nThis theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you babbling about...?\nPhoenix:\nNow, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer. If that's the case, I think it's impossible for the killer to have gone to the victim's room without intent!\nPresent Knife\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nNaturally, you point to the one piece with the least value... but with such vigor! Enjoy your energy while you can. Humans don't live forever... Neither do lawyers.\nJudge:\nYou sure like to think you can bluff your way out of things, don't you?\nMia:\nPhoenix, pay attention! Let's pretend for a second that Mr. Engarde is the murderer. Now from that angle, if he didn't have a murderous intent from the very beginning, then that means there is a certain object that shouldn't be at the crime scene, right?\nPhoenix:\n(\"A certain thing\"...? What certain thing...?)\nEdgeworth:\nHow are you doing over there? Busy collecting your thoughts?\nPhoenix:\n(Alright, let's give this one more try... and with even more spirit this time!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer.\"\nPhoenix:\nThis knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.\nJudge:\nY-Yes, we did establish that.\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that if my client was, in fact, the killer... Then he brought this knife with him when he went to visit Mr. Corrida.\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose...\nPhoenix:\nHowever, you just said it yourself. \"At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder.\" If that were true, then why would he bring a knife!? He wouldn't, would he!?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means, Mr. Edgeworth, your theory was flawed from supposition one! And one more thing! If the murderer was wearing the costume at the time of the murder... Then there should be glove marks left on the knife! Which means the defendant's fingerprints shouldn't be all over it like bees on a hive!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that brings me to my final point... This knife was planted by the real killer to hide their identity and mislead us!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order, I say! Order in the court!! Was this knife really planted by the killer!? Why would the murderer do such a thing!?\nTo hide the murder method.\nPhoenix:\nIt's to hide the way in which the murder was carried out, of course!\nEdgeworth:\nM-More of your nonsense!?\nPhoenix:\nTake another good look at the autopsy report! The victim actually died from strangulation! The killer tried to hide thisx by stabbing a knife into thex victim's chest!\nJudge:\nBut doesn't the autopsy admit that the cause of death was strangulation?\nPhoenix:\nWell, yes, the real cause of death was easily discovered...\nEdgeworth:\nThen I'd say the knife did a terrible job of \"concealing\" this fact!\nPhoenix:\n... Aha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that laugh doesn't do a very good job of concealing your error either!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!

Witneeeeeesssssss!!\nOldbag:\n... Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey-poo...? (Changed from [Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey...?] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nGnnnnngh...\nJudge:\nWitness, did you or did you not really see the Nickel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess at first I might have forgotten, but...\nPhoenix:\nAre you saying you mixed up Mr. Engarde with the Nickel Samurai, his character on TV!?\nOldbag:\nBut I mean, I can't really do anything about that now! (Changed from [But I mean, I can't really do anything about that!] in the original release) Look, I was waiting around in front of their doors because, well... Well, I wasn't waiting around for the Nickel Samurai, that's for sure!\nPhoenix:\n...! (She wasn't waiting for the \"Nickel Samurai\"...?) Alright then... Who were you waiting around for then?\nOldbag:\n... Hmph! That's top secret to anyone outside of security!\nJudge:\nI have a feeling that you were waiting for Mr. Juan Corrida. Am I correct, witness?\nOldbag:\nHa ha ha. The way you think, you are a sad amateur with a terrible case of near-sightedness.\nJudge:\nAmateur...? Me...? What am I an amateur of...?\nPhoenix:\n(So Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room... But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...)\nMia:\nMaybe... Phoenix! Maybe the old bag was waiting around for \"that\" person!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, if it's who I think Mia's hinting at... It's certainly possible...) Ms. Oldbag. You were waiting for this person to come out of the victim's room, weren't you?\nPresent Adrian Andrews profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Who is this person...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nMia:\nWhat are you talking about, Phoenix!? She could've waited until the next century and this would never have appeared!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch... Busted... Guess there's no fooling her.)\nJudge:\nYou two! What do you think you're doing flirting in my courtroom!?\nPhoenix:\nWe weren't doing anything like that... Honest... (Well, back to the drawing board on this one... Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room...)\nLeads back to:\n\"But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...\"\nJudge:\nWho is this person...?\nPhoenix:\nThis is Adrian Andrews, Mr. Engarde's manager.\nJudge:\nB-But why would the defendant's manager be in the victim's room...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems that this is the latest rumor in circulation, Your Honor.\nJudge:\n...Hmm... Oh... This is... Well, this is... Hmm, hmm... Hah, I see...\nPhoenix:\n(The judge seems to be really into the \"article\"... If it can be called such a thing...)\nJudge:\nThen this manager with the initials A. A.... Are you saying it's...?\nEdgeworth:\nAdrian Andrews. Without a doubt, the witness thought so as well.\nOldbag:\n... Hmph. Looks like you found me out. Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole \"sworn to confidentiality stuff\" then. (Changed from [Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole sworn to confidentiality stuff.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nW-Witness...? What in the world are you...\nMia:\nWatch out, Phoenix. I've got a bad feeling about this... A very bad feeling.\nOldbag:\nI got some information... Some very secret information from a certain source. So that's why I was doing my own little investigation... In secret, of course.\nJudge:\nB-But what for...?\nOldbag:\nOh, just for myself... Personal reasons and all that.\nJudge:\n... Well, Mr. Edgeworth. How will you proceed from here?\nEdgeworth:\nI really don't want to do this, however I cannot simply let this point slide.\nJudge:\nI see. Very well then. Witness, please testify about this \"secret information\".\nOldbag:\nGet ready! This is going to take the wind out of you young'uns!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure we're all capable of handling this... Really, it's not like we're ten years old.)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Secret Information --\nOldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!\nI cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?\nJudge:\nThe defendant sent his manager...? What a distasteful topic for this court!\nOldbag:\nWhat!? Nobody's above gossip! And isn't there a saying!? \"The truth is never pleasant.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Never heard that one before...)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What about this Adrian Andrews person...?\nEdgeworth:\nWe have looked into this matter, and found that the \"truth\" the article proposes is, in fact, baseless gossip.\nJudge:\nHmm... But should this be true... Then this proves that the defendant did bear ill-will towards the victim.\nPhoenix:\n(...So this means I have to smash this rumor once and for all.)\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.\nMia:\nBe careful. The old bag seems rather excited right now.\nOldbag:\nThat's right! Engarde is nothing but your average foul-blooded youth!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, as the old saying goes... You've gotta burn old bags with fire! Time to fire up the afterburners and hit the highway to the danger zone!)\nCross Examination\n-- Secret Information --\nOldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou can't say something like that without proof! That's just slander!\nOldbag:\nBut it's true! That woman was getting intimate with poor Juan! Look! It says so right here, doesn't it!? \"Manager to the stars, Ms. A. A.!\"\nPhoenix:\nBut the name of the magazine this came from is \"Gossip Land\"...\nOldbag:\nWhat? Are you saying that \"gossip\" is all just a pack of lies? Hmph, what do you know? I suppose next you'll swear to me that the \"news\" is 100% truth!\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nHonestly, sonny. You can't discriminate between the news and gossip!\nJudge:\nYes, discrimination is bad, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Discriminate? When did I do anything like that?)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, Engarde will never get me to say \"touch\u00e9\"!\nOldbag:\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nA scandal...? What do you mean by that?\nOldbag:\nYou're a dimwitted one, aren't you? I can't believe you don't know what a \"scandal\" is! Honestly, what are they teaching kids in middle school these days...?\nPhoenix:\nAh, no no! I wasn't asking what the word \"scandal\" means! Even I know that much!\nOldbag:\nWell! That Engarde thought he could own a monopoly on popularity!\nOldbag:\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou don't have any proof that Mr. Engarde did any such thing!\nOldbag:\nYou must be suffering from shock; the shock of hearing the truth. And now, since you're in so much shock, you can't do anything right!\nPhoenix:\n(You're right, I can't do anything, but boy do I wish I could do something about you.)\nOldbag:\nAlright then, sonny, show me what you've got! Can you show me proof that Engarde didn't bear any ill-will towards Juan!?\nPresent evidence\nPhoenix:\nI'm not going to let you push me around that easily!\nOldbag:\nHeh. There's many a man who've said those exact words and paid dearly for them.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you should brace yourself this time! Here is my proof that Mr. Engarde did not hold any ill-will towards the victim!\nPresent anything\nPhoenix:\nOldbag:\n...Is that it? You can take it from here, Edgey-poo!\nEdgeworth:\nNgrk! Wh-What are you handing it over to me for!? (Changed from [EH!? Wh-What are you handing it over to me for!?] in the original release)\nOldbag:\nI want you to give that jagged-headed baboon-boy a message for me! Please? Tell him that no matter what he does, the only thing he's good at is failing.\nEdgeworth:\nUm... What she said, Wright! Or should I say... Baboon-boy!\nJudge:\nYes, I agree this isn't much of a piece of evidence... Baboon-boy.\nPhoenix:\n(Did I just gain a new nickname here...?)\nLeads to:\n\"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\"\nDecline the offer to present\nPhoenix:\n...I don't have anything to offer.\nOldbag:\nSeeeeeee! Just as I thought.\nLeads to:\n\"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\"\nOldbag:\nAnd you were lecturing me about saying things without proof! You've just given me a free pass to say whatever I want whenever I want, silly boy!\nPhoenix:\n(Me and my big mouth...)\nOldbag:\nThat's the way the cookie crumbles. For you, anyway.\nOldbag:\nI cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you mean by \"I took action\"...?\nOldbag:\nLike I already told you, I was lying in wait close to the crime scene! Once that slimy woman came out of Juan's room... I was going to capture her, and teach her a good lesson. Something you young'uns need!\nJudge:\nYou were going to \"teach her a good lesson\"...?\nOldbag:\nI was going to make her eat the damaging beams of my ray gun! Like this!\nJudge:\nN-No, stop!\nOldbag:\nWell, it was too bad that woman didn't come through the door that night.\nOldbag:\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWait!\nOldbag:\nWhat!? I'm a busy woman! Tea time with the kids is over!\nPhoenix:\nSecret information that no one else knows yet... If that's true, then how do you know this \"secret information\"!?\nOldbag:\nHuh!? Well... That's... because I'm a pro... Yes, that's it...\nPhoenix:\n...\nOldbag:\nI-It's a secret! Even if you drill a hole into my brain, you'll never find out!\nPhoenix:\n(How in the world did that old bat get such a \"secret\" piece of information...?)\nPress further\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't be a good girl and tell me where you got this secret information... You won't get to go home today!\nOldbag:\nUmm... Edgey-boy! What are you doing!? Help me!\nEdgeworth:\nEh!? What do I have to do with this!?\nOldbag:\nJust do this for me... You'll get your reward.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I don't want your reward, but you don't leave me much of a choice...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness could have gotten her information from anywhere! It's even possible that it was spontaneously made up inside the witness's head!\nPhoenix:\n(And he lectures ME on \"reckless blabbering\"!?)\nJudge:\nAs long as we don't know where this information came from, it's quite a waste of time to focus on this line of questioning.\nPhoenix:\n(Where did Oldbag get her inside information...? There has to be something I can use to figure it out!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPresent evidence\nPhoenix:\nSo no one else is supposed to know this \"secret information\", correct? If that's true, then why do you know it, Ms. Oldbag...?\nOldbag:\nWh-Wh-Why are you looking at me like that...? Stop that!\nPhoenix:\nWitness! I hate to say it, but this is how you came to acquire your secret info, isn't it!? (Changed from [I'm sad to say it, but this is how you found out this secret, isn't it!?] in the original release)\nPresent Lotta's Camera\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYou call that \"proof\"!? It looks more like proof of spite towards the witness! If you have nothing to back up your claims, then they are no more valid than \"gossip\"!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained. Witness, please feel free to ignore the defense's gesture of ill-will and continue.\nOldbag:\nOkie-dokie! See, nothing can get me down!\nPhoenix:\n(Great... That did nothing but set me back a few minutes of my life...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nWait and see\nPhoenix:\n(I should probably think a bit more about this... I don't want to do anything rash... For now, maybe I should sit back and watch how things play out...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nMia:\nSounds like just another tidbit of gossip, doesn't it? But you can't just ignore it either. It makes your client look bad either way.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I don't think I heard anything really out of the ordinary just now...)\nMia:\nThere has to be something we can catch her on...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... And when I find it, I'm going to press the heck out of it...)\nPhoenix:\nThe \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...\nJudge:\nOh yes... I remember that mischievous girl.\nPhoenix:\nShe reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.\nJudge:\nShe reported such a thing...?\nPhoenix:\nOn that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.\nOldbag:\nWh-What!? Outrageous ideas, you say!?\nPhoenix:\nNo no no, I said impressions.\nOldbag:\nThen... Then...! Then everything written on this piece of paper is completely meaningless!?\nPhoenix:\nAh! That's it! That's the note!\nOldbag:\nAh! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Noooo! You see, this is something completely different! This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!\nJudge:\nHmm, then you are the one who took Ms. Hart's note?\nOldbag:\nI'm a huuuuuuuge fan of Juan's, that's why! That infamous, puffy-haired whippersnapper... She's working with that evil Engarde! She said so herself! \"En garde! I'm his sidekick!\" She was so happy, smiling like a silly duck. I was only checking what she had written!\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nOldbag:\n... Edgey-poo! You believe me, don't you!?\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...\nOldbag:\nI was only trying to help out like the angel I am! It's only one little piece of paper! I've never taken anything else before!\nEdgeworth:\nYou really should come with a supply of cheese to match your vintage whine.\nJudge:\nWell, it was only a piece of paper. I suppose we can overlook this just this once.\nPhoenix:\n(She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)\nPile on more pressure.\nPhoenix:\n(If I let up on her now, she'll get away... I have to find some way to inflict a deafening blow to the prosecution!)\nLeads to:\n\"Witness!\"\nForgive her.\nPhoenix:\nI guess we should forgive her.\nOldbag:\nHmph! Who the heck are you to decide who should be forgiven, you delinquent!\nPhoenix:\nGrr... (Number of endearing qualities: ZERO.)\nMia:\nPhoenix. You can't go easy on her. She's no frail old lady.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nMia:\nYou should be pressing her until she gives in!\nPhoenix:\n(Mia is really scary today... *gulp*)\nLeads to:\n\"Witness!\"\nPhoenix:\nWitness! You said that the only thing you stole was that note. Is this correct?\nOldbag:\nS-S-Stole!? Why don't you listen more carefully, you annoying brat!? I saved this piece of paper from the terrible, lonely trash can! That's all!\nPhoenix:\nYou're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\nOldbag:\nAre you putting my credibility under scrutiny again!?\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! I don't believe that the note is the only thing you stole that night!\nPresent Lotta's Camera\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. More than the witness' credibility, perhaps you should be worrying about your legal standing, or should I say, falling?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nJudge:\nI'm setting the volume down to low so I won't have to waste my time with your objections!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I never knew the judge had hearing aids... Argh! Now's not the time to be wondering about health conditions! OK, one more try!)\nLeads back to:\n\"You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\"\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?\nJudge:\nA camera...?\nPhoenix:\nYesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, \"My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!\"\nJudge:\nWhy... Why... Witness!!\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, gramps?\nPhoenix:\nIf you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!\nOldbag:\nGrr... Looks like you found me out again, sonny... Is this the camera you're looking for?\nPhoenix:\nAh, that's...!\nOldbag:\nWhat!? Even though I look like this, I'm still a person, you know! I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and \"borrow\" things from people!\nJudge:\nUm... I think your definition of \"borrow\" is a little off...\nOldbag:\nI saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, \"Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire\"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!\nJudge:\nBailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.\nJudge:\nPlease present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!\nOldbag:\nSee, I told you! That's the guy I saw!\nJudge:\nThis proves that the witness was not lying earlier about this matter.\nLotta's Photo added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nWh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was still in his Nickel Samurai costume!\nJudge:\nIf that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...\nEdgeworth:\nThe defendant.\nJudge:\nHow did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?\nPhoenix:\n(If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...\nnothing strange with it.\nPhoenix:\nThere is nothing strange with this photo.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I have done nothing to alter this picture either, in case you're wondering, Wright.\nJudge:\nI see... And it seems the defense will rest on this matter. In that case, there is no reason to further prolong this trial.\nMia:\nIs this really alright with you, Phoenix!?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well... There's nothing wrong with this photo that I can poi--\nMia:\nTry again! Take another good look at it! And if you still don't see anything... Do something... anything to prolong the trial!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Chief! W-Wait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright? I'm about to enter my verdict. Please address me with your comment afterwards.\nPhoenix:\nUm, no, I'm sorry, but this can't wait...\nEdgeworth:\nOh? Let me guess. You are going to point out some peculiarity with this photo?\nJudge:\nWh-What? Why didn't you say so earlier!?\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"\nsomething strange with it.\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"\nPhoenix:\nThere's... There's something strange with this photo!\nEdgeworth:\nI knew this was coming, Wright.\nJudge:\nYour thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nI think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.\nJudge:\n\"Debunk with a bunker buster\"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\n... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!\nJudge:\nIf you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need one chance, correct...?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this photo from anyway...? (Changed from [Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...?] in the original release) It's all out of focus! Why can't she take a good shot, especially when it counts!?)\nJudge:\nNow then, let's hear your objection. What about this photo is \"strange\"...?\nPresent Nickel Samurai's feet\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!\"\nPresent Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIt's this person here, of course!\nJudge:\nYou mean the \"Nickel Samurai\"? And what is wrong with that?\nPhoenix:\nAt the time of the murder, Mr. Engarde was in his own room! Which means this Nickel Samurai is a fa--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIf you think that's all it takes, you should reconsider your choice of occupation.\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nEdgeworth:\nI think it's about time you retired!\nJudge:\nHmm, it looks like there was no problem with this photo after all.\nEdgeworth:\nThe problem was with the brain of that lawyer, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nYou are the one who let your last chance fly away from you, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penalty\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe strange thing is somewhere around here! ...I think.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Somewhere\"...?\nJudge:\n\"Around here\"...?\nMia:\n\"I think\"...?\nPhoenix:\nA-Am I seeing something you all are not...?\nJudge:\nHmm, it looks like there was no problem with this photo after all.\nEdgeworth:\nThe problem was with the brain of that lawyer, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nYou are the one who let your last chance fly away from you, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penalty\nPhoenix:\nI would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!\nJudge:\nWh-What are you pointing to? His ankles...?\nPhoenix:\nIf you could see this person's ankle, that would be one thing... However you can't.\nJudge:\nA-And...? What does that mean...?\nPhoenix:\nThe costumed person in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde! (Changed from [The 'Nickel Samurai' in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of this!?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if you would care to elaborate... With actual facts, that is.\nPhoenix:\nLet's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.\nJudge:\nHis... His socks... You can see his socks...\nPhoenix:\nExactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThere is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)\nMia:\nThat's curious...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What is?\nMia:\nEdgeworth is unusually calm today...\nPhoenix:\nThat's true...\nMia:\nHe's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.\nPhoenix:\n\"Along for the ride\"...? What do you mean by that?\nMia:\nI can only think that perhaps he doesn't feel under attack at all...\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, I haven't damaged his case at all!?) (Changed from [He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nIf the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!\nEdgeworth:\n... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?\nPhoenix:\n(Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)\nMia:\nDon't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts. Who is the person in this photograph...?\nPresent Adrian Andrews profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"A-Adrian Andrews...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nJudge:\nAre you saying this is who you think was in the costume...?\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um... Well, I know there isn't a lot to back me up here, but...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nSometimes I wonder about you. Do you just pick the first piece of evidence you see?\nMia:\nI can't believe it. I didn't think you would mess up here of all places...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... And I really thought I had it!)\nJudge:\nNow then, would you care to try one more time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts.\"\nJudge:\nA-Adrian Andrews...?\nPhoenix:\nIf you want to know who that Nickel Samurai is, it is none other than this woman!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why would you say it must be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her? (Changed from [And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nFor starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.\nJudge:\nAnd how does that all add up?\nPhoenix:\nIt means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!\nJudge:\nThe knife that was used as a murder weapon!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(I have to do this now!

The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... her.\nEngarde:\nSo after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...\nPhoenix:\nSee, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.\nEngarde:\nHmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?\nPhoenix:\nYes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.\nEngarde:\nBut... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!\nPhoenix:\nShe has her own agenda.\nEngarde:\nH-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.\nEngarde:\nGet me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?\nMia:\nPhoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's missing suicide note, right?\nPhoenix:\n...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live. (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release) But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...\nMia:\n...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!\nMia:\nThat sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.\nPhoenix:\nUm, what...?\nMia:\nWho was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' dependency issues with regards to Ms. Inpax...? (Changed from [Better stated, Mr. Andrews' co-dependency with regards to Ms. Inpax...?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n... It was Edgeworth...\nMia:\nIt looks like he's still the one in command of this ship. Don't let your guard down yet.\nMarch 22, 2:25 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3\nJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you please.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls the witness subpoenaed by this court. Ms. Adrian Andrews, the person who discovered the crime in Mr. Juan Corrida's room!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is your occupation?\nAndrews:\nI am the manager of the defendant in this case, Mr. Matt Engarde.\nJudge:\nI see. Now then...\nAndrews:\nBefore we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.\nJudge:\nUh, yes, sure. What is it?\nAndrews:\nI'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly \"magazine\" recently...\nJudge:\nAh, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of \"Gossip Land\"...\nPhoenix:\n(If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.\nAndrews:\nYes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.\nJudge:\nHmm, so it was a \"fry 'n bait\" matter... or was that \"bait 'n fry\"? Reminds me of fishing...\nAndrews:\nBut I... But I didn't kill him.\nEdgeworth:\nNo one has accused you of that.\nAndrews:\nI think there's someone who would beg to differ. (Changed from [I've got a feeling someone will soon...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nI think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.\nEdgeworth:\nVery well then. Witness, please testify to the court about what happened when you discovered the murder that had taken place.\nWitness Testimony\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...\nWhat I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.\nI felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.\nJudge:\nYou poured yourself a glass of juice...?\nAndrews:\nYes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.\nMia:\nPhoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.\nPhoenix:\nYes... I know.\nMia:\nIn order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pacing. (Changed from [You should disrupt her pace.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDisrupt her pacing...? (Changed from [Disrupt her pace...?] in the original release)\nMia:\nShe's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it. The instant you let up on your offense is the instant this trial is over. Understand?\nCross Examination\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd what was Mr. Engarde doing at the time...?\nAndrews:\nHe was taking a nap. He was worn out from his mini performance as the Nickel Samurai during the ceremony...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, Mr. Engarde did say he was taking a nap...) Then I guess you could say it could not have been taken out of his room, yes?\nAndrews:\nExcuse me? \"It\"...? What are you...?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I thought years of school would have taught you how to construct a sentence. If you can't make a sensible sentence with a subject, then I'll make one for you. Watch. Did you, Ms. Andrews, remove Mr. Engarde's knife from his room?\nAndrews:\n...No.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nSubject, verb, object Wright. Did you skip basic grammar? The witness may continue.\nAndrews:\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you do that...?\nAndrews:\nAs a friendly gesture, Juan was to make an appearance with the other Heroes.\nPhoenix:\n(So the show was supposed to be a \"show\" of friendship, huh?)\nPress further\nPhoenix:\nIs that the only reason?\nAndrews:\nI beg your pardon? What are you implying...?\nPhoenix:\nYou had a certain goal in mind when you started to get close to him, correct...? So perhaps you had a more personal matter to discuss with the victim...?\nAndrews:\n... Sorry, but I didn't have any such intentions in mind at that time.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't get her to talk without a strong piece of evidence, I guess...)\nLeads to:\n\"May we continue now...?\"\nLet her be\nPhoenix:\n(I should back off... As long as I don't have any proof, she's not going to talk.)\nLeads to:\n\"May we continue now...?\"\nEdgeworth:\nMay we continue now...? Witness, what did you see when you got to his room?\nAndrews:\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou were \"in shock\"...?\nAndrews:\nWhat? Was I not supposed to be?\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Andrews is a very calculating person... And despite how \"close\" they were, I doubt she had romantic feelings for Mr. Corrida...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnyone randomly stumbling upon a dead body would be in shock. And you can't seriously expect that a young beauty like her would not be shocked.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think beauty has anything to do with being shocked or not...)\nJudge:\nHmm... I see...\nPress (after pressing fifth statement, before adding statement)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou were \"in shock\"...?\nAndrews:\nWhat? Was I not supposed to be?\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Andrews is a very calculating person... And despite how \"close\" they were, I doubt she had romantic feelings for Mr. Corrida...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnyone randomly stumbling upon a dead body would be in shock. And you can't seriously expect that a young beauty like her would not be shocked.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think beauty has anything to do with being shocked or not...)\nJudge:\nHmm... I see...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews, I would like to confirm with you one more time. When you discovered the dead body of Juan Corrida, you were in great shock. And that's when you poured yourself the glass of juice, correct?\nAndrews:\nAnd what of it...? My mind really was a complete blank at the time.\nPhoenix:\nYour mind was a complete blank? I didn't think that was possible for you.\nAndrews:\nAren't you rude today? I was so dazed that I made one careless mistake... That one thing...\nPhoenix:\nWhat \"one thing\"?\nAndrews:\nUm, never mind. It's no big deal.\nPhoenix:\n(What was she starting to say just now...?)\nPress further\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Andrews!\"\nLet her be\nPhoenix:\n(Well, it probably doesn't have anything to do with the case, so...)\nMia:\nStop right there. You finally got her to open her mouth on this one, and you're going to let it go? Now is the time to get as much out of her as we can.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're right.\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Andrews!\"\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews! I'm convinced that as you said, you made a \"mistake\" at the scene of the crime.\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat I really want to know is what this \"mistake\" was.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, actually... So would I...\nAndrews:\nI... I'm sorry... It's just... It's kind of... embarrassing... When I... When I set the glass down on the dresser... I accidentally... knocked the flower vase over...\nJudge:\nF-Flower vase...? Are you talking about the one on the floor in the crime photo...? This mess of glass shards!?\nAndrews:\nIt was originally on top of the dresser... but when I bumped into it with my elbow, it fell... onto the guitar case.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-Why did you withhold such an important piece of information!?\nAndrews:\nI'm sorry... I thought that since the crime scene was already in disarray, that people would simply assume the vase was just another part of the mess.\nJudge:\nIt looks like yet another fact has come to light here. Please add this and anything else you have to reveal to your testimony.\nAndrews:\nI'm sorry... But... I have nothing more to add... I didn't touch anything else.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nAdds statement \"I was the one who knocked the flower vase over, where it fell onto the guitar case.\"\nAndrews:\nWhat I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis is the photo you're referring to, correct?\nAndrews:\nYes, the one with the knife lodged in his chest...\nPhoenix:\nAnd the guitar case was like this too?\nAndrews:\nYes, it was open and empty, of course.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd then, what did you do next, witness?\nPresent Guitar Case or Crime Photo (after pressing third and fifth statements)\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"You testified that you knocked the flower vase over. Is this correct?\"\nAndrews:\nI felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nJuice...?\nAndrews:\nYes, there was a bottle of tomato juice on the table, so I helped myself.\nPhoenix:\nBut you didn't drink any of it, did you?\nAndrews:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nThere were no lip marks left on this wine glass to suggest that anyone drank from it.\nAndrews:\nI... I wasn't feeling terribly great, so I set the glass down. Without drinking it...\nPress (after pressing third statement, before adding statement)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nJuice...?\nAndrews:\nYes, there was a bottle of tomato juice on the table, so I helped myself.\nPhoenix:\nBut you didn't drink any of it, did you?\nAndrews:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nThere were no lip marks left on this wine glass to suggest that anyone drank from it.\nAndrews:\nI...

I thought I would try to take Juan's pulse... So I set the glass I was holding down on the dresser. And that's when my elbow accidentally hit the vase...\nPhoenix:\n(That's odd. I thought she was always in total control of herself...?)\nMia:\nThat's what she would like people to think. Always be mindful of the gap between the perception and reality.\nPresent Guitar Case or Crime Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"You testified that you knocked the flower vase over. Is this correct?\"\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't sound like there's any glaring contradictions in her testimony just now...)\nMia:\nI warned you earlier that she would not crack so easily. The only way to make her is to...\nPhoenix:\n...Keep on the offensive and not let up.\nMia:\nThe only way you're going to catch her is with some very strong, decisive evidence...\nPhoenix:\n(I have to find something! I just have to! ...For Maya's sake...)\nPhoenix:\nYou testified that you knocked the flower vase over. Is this correct?\nAndrews:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\nAnd are you sure it fell onto the guitar case?\nAndrews:\nI-Is there some problem with what I said...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's not \"some\" problem, it's a \"major\" problem. It's true that the top of the guitar case was wet with water. However, that's exactly what is so strange! Ms. Andrews! You testified that the vase fell onto the guitar case! However! If that was true, the case should have gotten wet on the inside, not the outside!\nJudge:\nTh-That's very true!\nPhoenix:\nFurthermore, there is one other strange thing about this guitar case.\nJudge:\nAnd wh-what is that?\nPhoenix:\nLet's take another look at the crime scene photo. The remains of the vase are scattered on the floor.\nJudge:\nAnd what is wrong with that?\nPhoenix:\nIf the guitar case was open when the vase fell... The glass shards should be INSIDE, not outside the case!\nAndrews:\nAh!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is your point, Wright!? That the case was closed at the time the vase was knocked over? Is that all!?\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nNo. Think back to what Ms. Andrews testified to! She said that other than the vase, she didn't touch anything else!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nYes, that's right... She did implicitly say she didn't touch the guitar case!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nBut... But this whole matter with the guitar case is a dead end! The bright red guitar was found at the studio! It has no bearing on this case at all!\nPhoenix:\n... That may very well be, however... (Argh, the empty guitar case does seem to have no relation to this case, doesn't it...) (Changed from [An empty guitar case does seem to have no relation to this case...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems that there is no deeper meaning to the guitar case. Well, Mr. Wright? Do you think we need to hear more details about the guitar case?\nMake her testify\nLeads to:\n\"The empty guitar case...\"\nLet her be\nPhoenix:\nWell, the case was empty, and I think that's all we really need to know...\nJudge:\nI see.\nMia:\nWait! Phoenix! Don't you remember what I told you earlier? What's important here is that you disrupt her pacing. You have to attack her when she's not expecting it!\nJudge:\nNow then, let's move on to a different matter...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nActually, Your Honor, I've changed my mind. I would like her to testify about the case.\nJudge:\nWh-Wh-Why are you changing your mind NOW!?\nPhoenix:\n(Well, looks like I disrupted the judge's pacing... Now comes the real deal... *gulp*)\nLeads to:\n\"The empty guitar case...\"\nPhoenix:\nThe empty guitar case... I believe this is a crucial piece of the puzzle!\nEdgeworth:\nHeh! I can't believe ANYONE would reach for straws like this! But it is you...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe I'm doing this either...)\nJudge:\nAlright. I'll follow along... For now. Ms. Andrews, please testify to the court about the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nYes, Your Honor.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Guitar Case --\nAndrews:\nI don't remember too clearly because I was a bit dazed.\nI suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over.\nIt's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all.\nAs for why I opened the case... Even I don't know.\nJudge:\nHmm... It looks like this really wasn't a very important point.\nEdgeworth:\nThis wastefulness is such a familiar feeling by now that it's almost... comforting.\nPhoenix:\nUm, anyway, I'll just go ahead and start the cross-examination...\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Using \"anyway\" to change the topic -- a convenient escape for a weak man.\nCross Examination\n-- The Guitar Case --\nAndrews:\nI don't remember too clearly because I was a bit dazed.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nDuring your testimony just now, did you remember those events clearly in your mind?\nAndrews:\n... Well, you see...\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure you are the one who opened the guitar case?\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...\nMia:\nShe's... She's waiting for someone to tell her if she should answer or not...\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like her dependent side is taking over...) (Changed from [Her 'co-dependency' is coming through, huh...?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nWell, Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nY...Yes, it was me...\nAndrews:\nI suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo, you opened the guitar case then?\nAndrews:\nY-Yes... Well, maybe...\nPhoenix:\n... Why did you open the guitar case?\nAndrews:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida's dead body was right there in front of you, wasn't it? I would think that the first thing you would do is call for help, not open a guitar case.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nAs the witness has said multiple times, when she found the dead body, she was \"dazed\".\nJudge:\nHmm...\nAndrews:\nMaybe I... Maybe I was curious to know if the bright red guitar was alright or not. I thought, \"Maybe the criminal took it.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Why would she care about the bright red guitar...?)\nAndrews:\nBut, getting back on topic...\nPresent Guitar Case\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way you were the one who opened the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nWhy would you say that!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's elementary, my dear. Because the only fingerprints on this guitar case are those of the victim!\nAndrews:\nAh!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\n... You shouldn't assume that I must have left prints just because I touched the case.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nAndrews:\nWhat if I were to tell you that I was wearing gloves at the time?\nJudge:\nGloves...? But why would you be wearing gloves at the time?\nAndrews:\nIt was the night of the award ceremony. So of course I dressed up for the occasion. Yes, now I remember... I'm almost sure I was wearing a pair of thin gloves.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see... Well, Mr. Wright. It seems the witness was wearing gloves at the scene of the crime.\nNothing strange about that.\nPhoenix:\nHmm, I guess so... And I guess that makes sense.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. You're the epitome of a half-baked idea.\nAndrews:\nA brain is to be used, not to look pretty for med students carving cadavers.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like I need to bake my thoughts just a little longer...)\nEdgeworth:\nNow, if the defense has no further objections, let's return to the testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nThat's strange...\nPhoenix:\nYou were wearing gloves...? Isn't that a little strange?\nAndrews:\nWhy is that strange!? Do you have something that would prove I was not wearing gloves at the time...?\nPresent Wine Glass\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I have your proof right here. This wine glass.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI think it's time for you to go home now, Wright... Before you hurt yourself, that is.\nPhoenix:\n(Hurt myself...!?)\nJudge:\nIt's alright, Mr. Wright. You don't have to push yourself so hard.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I was trying a little too hard there...)\nEdgeworth:\nNow, if the defense has no further objections, let's return to the testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nAndrews:\nIt's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWas it really empty?\nAndrews:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nI was just wondering if maybe when you opened the case, the guitar was still inside.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nHow long have you been a lawyer, Mr. Wright!? Have a little professionalism. The bright red guitar was found at the studio. These trials would be over in half the time if you would just pay attention.\nJudge:\nYes, pay more attention, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nSorry...\nPresent Guitar Case\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way you were the one who opened the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nWhy would you say that!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's elementary, my dear.

We can't afford to let up on her now.\nPhoenix:\nI wasn't planning on letting up, but...\nMia:\nShe's at her weakest now, so this is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, if we had a weapon to hit her with...)\nMia:\nI'm sure a weapon is hiding somewhere in the Court Record, waiting to be found.\nPhoenix:\nI have your proof right here. This wine glass.\nAndrews:\nThe wine glass?\nPhoenix:\nYou left your fingerprints very clearly on this wine glass.\nAndrews:\nAh...\nPhoenix:\nEven if you took your gloves off when you poured yourself this glass of juice, wouldn't you think it was just a little strange... That you put your gloves back on, just to open the guitar case!?\nAndrews:\nUgn!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!\nMia:\nLooks like you hit the nail on the head this time.\nPhoenix:\n...? What do you mean?\nMia:\nI believe that guitar case plays a very important role here.\nPhoenix:\nBut it's just an empty case...\nMia:\nI wonder if it really was empty though...\nPhoenix:\nB-But the guitar... The bright red guitar was at the studio!\nMia:\nPhoenix, drop all of your presumptions. What was in the guitar case was not the bright red guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(You don't mean... it was a bright WHITE guitar!? Wait, that's not right either...)\nJudge:\nHmm, I admit it would be unnatural for someone to do that. So the witness was not wearing gloves, despite the fact that on the case...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, this is obviously the defense's usual misdirection tactic at work. Steer the court towards an unrelated topic, and lull us all into his misguided...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Honor! Please recall that Ms. Andrews had testified that the vase \"fell onto the guitar case\"! Which means that the case was closed when the crime took place! However, it is wide open in this photo of the crime scene! I am sure this guitar case has some relation to the murder!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIf you are so sure, Wright, then I'm sure you can somehow substantiate your outrageous claim, correct!? Please, enlighten us as to why that guitar case has anything at all to do with this murder!\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nJudge:\nCan you do that, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... Let's suppose for a second... That the bright red guitar was not the only thing that could have been in the case...\nJudge:\nThe bright red guitar not being the only thing...? Y-You don't mean to suggest that a bright BLACK guitar was inside the--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you intend to push your theory that the case was not empty!? Is that it, Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nI wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!\nEdgeworth:\nDeflate that head of yours! You haven't proven anything yet! Now then, let's have it. What was inside this case at the time of the murder!?\nPresent The Nickel Samurai or Lotta's Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Th-This is... This is a photograph...!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why would something like that be inside a guitar case, let alone this one?\nJudge:\nWhy, Mr. Wright, why?\nPhoenix:\nWell... I just thought it might have been possible...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have a suggestion. Why don't you put that in the void where your brain is supposed to be!\nJudge:\nYes, and never bring it out again!\nPhoenix:\n(Can't a foolishly foolish fool get some love...?)\nEdgeworth:\nDo you still think you can prove your theory? Can you prove that the guitar case was not empty at the time of the murder?\nLeads back to:\n\"I wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!\"\nJudge:\nTh-This is... This is a photograph...!\nPhoenix:\nYes, but what is important is what is in that picture, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI-In this picture...?\nPhoenix:\nIt doesn't take a genius to see what I mean! What I am proposing is... Inside the guitar case was the Nickel Samurai! The hero's very own costume!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What!?\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!\nEdgeworth:\nWright! Are you saying that the witness opened the guitar case to take out a costume!? What insane point would there be to doing something like that!?\nPhoenix:\nThat insane point would be to wear the costume, of course. Ms. Andrews put it on to hide her identity so she could make her escape. After all, you couldn't let anyone see you leave, could you, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nI-I refuse to accept your theory! Do you have anything to support such a preposterous idea!?\nPhoenix:\nJust outside the door was an investigative photographer who was starving for a big scoop. And in the end, she managed to get this shot, correct?\nJudge:\nYou... You mean this photo!? Order! Ordeeeer! It looks like we've wandered into quite another mess again, haven't we...?\nMia:\nNice job, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later!\nJudge:\nHmm... So the real murderer was hiding inside a costume...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nW-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!?\nJudge:\nHmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...?\nIt was stolen from Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nI think it may have been stolen from Mr. Engarde...\nJudge:\nS-Stolen!? But why would someone do such a thing!?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe the thief wanted to interfere with the post-ceremony stage show.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nAnd so, if he didn't have his costume, then Mr. Engarde would be forced to go naked!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe YOU should be stripped naked and run out for making a mockery of this court!\nPhoenix:\nE-EXCUSE ME!?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Matt Engarde did not take his costume off after the award ceremony! He even testified that he took a nap while still wearing his costume! Is this not correct!?\nPhoenix:\n... Ah, yeah, he did say something like that, didn't he?\nJudge:\n*sigh* That's what I thought. Let's try that one more time, shall we, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts.\"\nIt was a spare costume.\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period...\"\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a spare one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nJudge:\nThen... are you saying that on the night of the murder... there were TWO Nickel Samurai costumes at the Gatewater Hotel!?\nPhoenix:\nYes, that is what I am saying.\nJudge:\nAnd how do you explain the costume that was inside the guitar case...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt would mean that the victim himself had brought this spare to the ceremony on purpose! (Changed from [It would mean that the victim himself had planned to bring this spare to the ceremony!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nBut... But why!? The victim, Mr. Corrida, was the Jammin' Ninja. Why would he secretly bring the Nickel Samurai's spare costume with him...? What could be the reason behind such a peculiar act?\nPhoenix:\n... And therein lies the sticking point... (Changed from [... Ah, so that's what he intended...] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you mumbling to yourself about now!? Have you just been rambling all this time without any sense of inner monologue!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? N-No, I just...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please explain yourself! Why do you think the victim had the Nickel Samurai's spare costume!?\nMia:\nPhoenix... Are you sure you can explain this one? Think carefully before you answer... And then answer with gusto! I believe in you!\nPhoenix:\nAlright. This is what I think. The reason the victim brought the Nickel Samurai's spare costume to the hotel was...\nPresent Press Conference Ticket\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"What is this...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nMia:\nPhoenix! What are you doing!? Are you crazy!?\nPhoenix:\nI... I, uh... I presented the evidence with gusto, just like you said!\nMia:\nI told you to present it with gusto, yes... But I seem to recall the sentence before that was, \"Think carefully\"!\nPhoenix:\n*gulp*\nJudge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nAh, sorry...\nMia:\nThis one is pretty tough. I really think you should look carefully at the Court Record. And then search through your memories! The answer is there, I know you'll find it!\nJudge:\nNow then. Are you ready to try again, Mr. Wright? Minus the wrong evidence this time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Alright. This is what I think.\"\nJudge:\nWhat is this...?\nPhoenix:\nOn the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special press conference.\nJudge:\nA press conference...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something at this conference.\nEdgeworth:\nI heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nBut what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had no idea he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night.\nAndrews:\n...\nJudge:\nBut how can that be!?\nPhoenix:\nThe way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida himself!\nJudge:\nTh-The victim?\nPhoenix:\nYes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the \"Nickel Samurai\"!\nJudge:\nHe was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!?\nPhoenix:\nThat's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is what he intended to reveal at that conference.\nEdgeworth:\nThe Nickel Samurai was going to \"confess\" something. And by \"confess\", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about \"himself\".\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about Matt Engarde!\nJudge:\nYes, I guess that is what it would mean...\nEdgeworth:\nBut, if that's the case... that's not a \"confession\"! That's \"public disclosure\"!\nAndrews:\nHmph.\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nI can see why you are pros at what you do.\nJudge:\nPardon me?\nAndrews:\nYes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan.\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews! Please offer us an explanation for this!\nAndrews:\nI was the one he asked to help set it up. And the person who prepared the second costume for him... That was also me.\nJudge:\nYou...!?\nAndrews:\nJuan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway.\nJudge:\nHe was going to ruin him, huh...?\nAndrews:\nIt looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nJudge:\nAnd do you know what this \"secret\" of Mr. Engarde's is, Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\n... That's something only Juan knew. I... I don't know what it is.\nJudge:\nAh... I see.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nAndrews:\nI... I've probably been coming off quite suspicious to everyone, but that's to be expected. I've been trying to protect Matt, after all...\nPhoenix:\nP-Protect Mr. Engarde!?\nJudge:\nAnd yet again another strange bit of truth comes to light it seems... Ms. Andrews, if you could, please tell us the truth about your behavior!\nAndrews:\nYes, Your Honor. I understand.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Protecting Matt --\nAndrews:\nFrom the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.\nMatt had to kill Juan no matter what.\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...\nJudge:\nHmm... This does account for everything...\nAndrews:\nWell... I am the logical type.\nMia:\nWe're finally seeing her true self. She is more nervous than a scared rabbit.\nJudge:\nIf the defense can find no fault with this testimony, I am ready to make a ruling. (Changed from [If there are no objections, I feel that I can pass a verdict based on this testimony.] in the original release) Please keep that in mind as you cross-examine, Mr. Wright. (Changed from [Now then, Mr. Wright, if you please.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like somehow everything has swung to the opposite end of the scale again... That just means I have to put my weight into this and turn her logic upside-down!)\nCross Examination\n-- Protecting Matt --\nAndrews:\nFrom the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWould you say that was your \"intuition\" speaking to you?\nAndrews:\nDon't confuse my methods of reasoning with your own.\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\nAndrews:\nIf you want to prove that someone did something, you need three things.\nPhoenix:\nThree... things?\nAndrews:\nA motive, an opportunity to commit the crime, and finally... decisive evidence. And if you think these three things through, the answer becomes quite clear.\nMia:\nYou should have already known that, Phoenix...\nPhoenix:\nThey didn't teach that to us in school... At least, not from what I remember...\nAndrews:\nMay I continue now?\nAndrews:\nMatt had to kill Juan no matter what.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo would you say this \"need\" came from the press conference?\nAndrews:\nYes. Do you know why Juan chose that event and that hotel for the conference? Because that was when he could cause the most damage to the public's beloved Matt Engarde.\nJudge:\nAnd you knew of this plan, didn't you, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\nYes... because I was the one who set up the conference and prepared the costume.\nPhoenix:\nBut... I'm sure Mr. Engarde himself didn't know anything about a press conference.\nAndrews:\nOh really? Can you show me any proof that he didn't know about the press conference?\nPhoenix:\nA-Anyway! The important thing here is that this information was not in your testimony!\nJudge:\nYes, I agree. Ms. Andrews, please correct your testimony, if you please.\nAndrews:\n\"Grasping at straws\" now, are we, Mr. Wright?\nChanges statement from \"Matt had to kill Juan no matter what.\" to \"I know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.\"\nAndrews:\nI know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHas Mr. Engarde done something to hurt or betray you personally?\nAndrews:\n... Why do you ask?\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one who helped Mr. Corrida with his press conference... And that event was supposed to bring down Mr. Engarde, yet you still helped out!\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThe person on trial right now is Mr. Engarde, Wright. What the witness was thinking, helping the victim with his plan, is none of our concern. In any case, this means that the defendant had a motive to kill.\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I keep doing this to myself...?)\nAndrews:\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nB-But didn't you already testify earlier that Mr. Engarde was... \"Taking a nap in his room\"!? Are you telling me now that, that too, was a lie so you could cover for Mr. Engarde!?\nAndrews:\nI'm not telling you anything of the sort. When I went to get him for the show, he honestly was sleeping. However, as to whether he was sleeping the entire time, that I cannot say. I was too busy setting up the stage at the time.\nJudge:\nHmm... I keep trying, but I can find no flaws with what Ms. Andrews has said. I can't say the same for some people here in this courtroom, however.\nPhoenix:\n(The judge is glaring straight at Mia...)\nMia:\nHe's glaring at you, smart guy!\nAndrews:\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou can hardly call the knife \"decisive evidence\"! The fingerprints on the knife could very well be a clever camouflage!\nAndrews:\nThen... What about the button?\nPhoenix:\nThe button...?\nAndrews:\nIt's clear from the crime scene that the victim and the murderer fought. And during the fight, the killer ripped the button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nJudge:\nYou're talking about this button, correct?\nAndrews:\nThat button was found in the pleats of Matt's hakama, isn't that correct? I would think that makes it very decisive evidence.\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nJudge:\nLooks like you were out-foxed again, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nA-Anyway! The knife doesn't prove a thing! Please fix your testimony!\nAndrews:\nI can't stand the sight of a man who can't gracefully accept his defeat.\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(... Thank goodness Mia can still look at me...)\nMia:\nWith an icy stare, yes.\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews, for Mr. Wright's sake, please add this information to your testimony.\nChanges statement from \"My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\" to \"That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\"\nAndrews:\nThat button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd how do you know that?\nAndrews:\nWhen the ends of the threads on the button and the costume were matched up, they were found to fit together perfectly... Or so I heard.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I've heard that before too. But why would Ms. Andrews know about this case down to such a fine detail?)\nAndrews:\nDon't look at me like that! Just because I'm prepared and you are not!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... And I thought I had her this time for sure. If there's anything to trip her up on, it has to be here. ...But where and what?)\nPresent Juan's Autopsy Report\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This is the victim's autopsy report.\"\nAndrews:\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut what you really did was stab the guy in the back, didn't you? And at the worst possible time.\nAndrews:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nWho's to say she really \"stabbed the guy in the back\" as you put it?\nPhoenix:\nThis witness could have disclosed things about Mr. Engarde at any time. Why, then, would she wait until there was a large audience before doing so? It's the same reason why Mr. Corrida planned such an elaborate conference. Ms. Andrews wanted to cause Mr. Engarde as much damage as she possibly could! This witness bears ill-will towards the defendant!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThis isn't the \"Phoenix Wright Wax Philosophical Power Hour\". And please, stop slandering the witness.\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAs I expected, Ms. Andrews' testimony seems pretty solid.\nMia:\nReally? Because to me, it sounded a little wishy-washy.\nPhoenix:\nWishy-washy? (Well, I guess we'll see if I press a little more...)\nMia:\nYou should know this by now, but you'll need strong, decisive evidence to make her talk.\nPhoenix:\nGot it, Chief! (...I'm going to pin you down this time, Ms. Andrews!)\nPhoenix:\nThis is the victim's autopsy report. It clearly states that the cause of death was \"strangulation by a scarf\".\nAndrews:\nS...Strangulation...\nPhoenix:\nThe knife stab to the victim was done after the victim had already died.\nJudge:\nA-And what does that mean?\nPhoenix:\nLet's examine the evidence. This button has the victim's blood on it. Which would mean that it was ripped off of the costume... when?\nEdgeworth:\nAfter the knife was stabbed into the victim...\nPhoenix:\nExactly! Which means... It is impossible that this button was torn off during the victim's final struggle, because the victim was strangled to death in that fight!\nAndrews:\nAh...\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, Ms. Andrews. There is no way this button was ripped off during the struggle. This button was consciously pulled off of the victim's already dead body!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Wh-What is the meaning--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is the meaning of this, Wright!? So what if the button was torn off the body after the victim had already died? What does that change!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me ask you one simple question, Mr. Edgeworth. Why was the button torn off? What purpose did that serve?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat \"purpose\"...?\nPhoenix:\nWe now know this button was not torn off during the fight. So the murderer took the time and effort to purposely rip this from the victim's body. That would mean that the murderer had something in mind, wouldn't it?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Does this mean... Does this mean you know what the murderer wanted to do with this button!? What was it!?\nTo have a memento of the crime\nPhoenix:\nMaybe this was the criminal's first crime and since it went so well, the person wanted something as a memento...\nEdgeworth:\nWright... I'll give this button to you as a memento.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nA reminder to never set foot in another court of law again for as long as you live!\nJudge:\nYes... I think it would be for the best if you stayed away from the attorney's bench.\nPhoenix:\nW-W-Wait! Please, Your Honor! I... I'll get it right this time! I'm sure of it!\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\"\nTo pin the crime on Engarde\nLeads to:\n\"There is only one logical reason for doing something like that.\"\nTo destroy evidence\nPhoenix:\nIt was to destroy the evidence, of course!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... To destroy the evidence...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, we heard you the first time! And which blasted piece of evidence was the person trying to destroy, Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! If you continue like this, I'm afraid you'll only destroy yourself!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\"\nPhoenix:\nThere is only one logical reason for doing something like that. It was to pin the crime on Mr. Engarde!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way anyone would put a bloodied button in their own pants! That's right! Mr. Engarde was set up! By the real killer, of course!\nJudge:\nAnd... The real murder is...? Well, Mr. Wright!? Who in the world is the real killer then!?\nPhoenix:\n(Finally... I can't believe I managed to bring this trial all the way up to this point...)\nMia:\nPhoenix... You can't let your guard down yet! Not until the very end!\nPhoenix:\nThe real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...\nPresent Adrian Andrews profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Adrian Andrews!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth:\nWright. Which of these four doesn't belong here? Up, down, left, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nUm, \"Wright\"?\nEdgeworth:\nThank you, I feel much better. I'm relieved to know you can at least pick that much out. I worry about you. You seem to fail every time you try to make logical sense!\nMia:\nOr in other words, \"think before you speak\", Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\n(Is it just me or is everyone ganging up on me?)\nJudge:\nThat's enough dawdling now, Mr. Wright. We don't have all day.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"The real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...\"\nPhoenix:\nMs. Adrian Andrews! I choose you! You are Mr. Corrida's killer!\nAndrews:\nWh-What!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!! Mr. Wright! This is a very grave matter! Do you have any evidence that supports your charge...?\nPhoenix:\n\"Any evidence\"...? ALL of the evidence points to Ms. Andrews!\nAndrews:\nWh... How preposterous! You can't stick any of that on me!\nPhoenix:\nI can't, can I? Would you care to test me?\nAndrews:\nThen... Then what about this knife!?\nPhoenix:\nThe knife was used to stab the victim after he had already been strangled to death. It was used to throw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, naturally. A knife covered in the defendant's fingerprints could only be taken from his room. And the only one who had dinner with him, and knew which knife to take, was you.\nAndrews:\n...Tsk! Th-Then! What... What about the button that was found in Matt's hakama!?\nPhoenix:\nThis button was removed from the victim's body after he had already died. The only people who could've done so were the person who found his body or the killer. However, if Mr. Engarde was the real killer, there is no way he would have put such incriminating evidence in his own hakama!\nAndrews:\nUghn...\nPhoenix:\nThe only person who could have put this button into Mr. Engarde's hakama, is the person who went to wake him from his nap... which is you, yet again, Ms. Andrews.\nJudge:\nI... I see... What about the empty guitar case...?\nPhoenix:\nThat is also another piece of evidence that incriminates Ms. Andrews. That costume was used to hide the real killer's identity as they fled the crime scene. Now, who could have known that there was just such a costume inside the guitar case...? It could only have been the person who prepared the costume for the victim. And that person is... you, Ms. Adrian Andrews!\nAndrews:\nN...No... I...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nBut Ms. Andrews' fingerprints were nowhere to be found on the guitar case! And it was you who proved that she was not wearing gloves at the time!\nJudge:\n...! Th-That's right!\nPhoenix:\nThat's because she did not intend on leaving any prints. If anyone had found out that she had touched the case, they would have asked her why. So to avoid leaving any prints, she used a towel or something else to open it. But! The glass of tomato juice is a different story! Ms. Andrews purposefully left her fingerprints on the glass to show that yes, indeed, she was the classic \"dazed discoverer\" of a dead body!\nAndrews:\nAaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\nAnd to top it all off, there is this photo! A photo of the killer as they exited the scene of the crime. No reasonable person on Earth can believe this Nickel Samurai is Mr. Engarde! He would be much too short for his own costume if it was him.\nAndrews:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nSpeaking of how tall people are... Ms. Andrews, you're also kind of short in stature, are you not?\nAndrews:\nP-Please... Stop...\nPhoenix:\nWell, how about it, Ms. Andrews!?\nAndrews:\nUm...\nPhoenix:\n(I've got her this time!)\nAndrews:\n...\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\n... I... I... I refuse... to testify.\nPhoenix:\nWhat was that...?\nAndrews:\nTh-There's a law... It says I can't be forced to testify about something... if it can incriminate me!\nJudge:\nWell, yes... You are absolutely correct, Ms. Andrews. The law does provide us with a way to avoid self-incrimination... by allowing a witness to not testify if the testimony can cause damage to themselves.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!? (\"Pleading the fifth\" is not something most people would think to do on the spot! Actually... Thinking back to yesterday in Mr. Engarde's room...)\nvon Karma:\nAdrian Andrews!\nAndrews:\nY-Yes...?\nvon Karma:\nThink hard about what we just discussed. Understood!?\nAndrews:\nA-Alright... ...\nPhoenix:\n(That's it. That's when Franziska planted this idea into her head... She must have told Ms. Andrews to not testify if things looked bad.)\nMia:\nYou did a good job proving everything up to this point, Phoenix. But there is still one thing you haven't done.\nPhoenix:\nSomething I haven't done...?\nEdgeworth:\nHeh heh heh. What's wrong, Wright? Are you finished already? Run out of evidence?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nWhat is so humorous, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sure you realize this as well, Your Honor... But, everything the good lawyer here has proven up to this point is meaningless.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nEdgeworth:\nEverything you have proven is circumstantial.\nPhoenix:\nCircumstantial...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, circumstantial. You have yet to provide a single piece of definitive proof. Proof that Ms. Andrews, did in fact, harbor a wish to murder Mr. Corrida!\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Andrews! You... Did you want to kill Mr. Corrida...?\nAndrews:\nI believe this may lead to me incriminating myself, so I will abstain from answering.\nJudge:\nBut Ms. Andrews... If you do that, it would be the same as admitting your guilt, don't you think...?\nAndrews:\nMaybe so, or maybe not. There is nothing to prove it either way. Besides, you don't even know what crime I would be \"guilty\" of due to my silence.\nPhoenix:\n(NO!! She's taking that defiant attitude again!) M-Mia! What should we do...?\nMia:\nSomehow, we've landed in the worst possible situation.\nJudge:\nI think we have reached a certain conclusion at this point in time. Ms. Adrian Andrews has refused to testify. And the defense's theory that she is the actual murderer... has not been fully substantiated with solid, definitive proof.\nPhoenix:\nBut! That's not true!\nJudge:\nIn this situation, there is only one thing this court can do. And that is to declare a recess.\nPhoenix:\nR-Recess...!?\nJudge:\nI request that both the prosecution and the defense look further into this matter. And at tomorrow's trial...\nPhoenix:\n(T-Tomorrow...!? We don't have a \"tomorrow\"! If we don't get a not guilty verdict today, then...)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nPlease wait, Your Honor! Th...That's not necessary! The trial... Please continue the trial!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you sweating for...? Your client is getting one more day to live, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\nThat... That's not it! This isn't about that. Edgeworth! I know you know who the real killer is! Please... Let the trial continue! If I don't get the verdict... then Maya...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nJudge:\nBut it's impossible to continue as long as the witness refuses to testify. Now then, this court is...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIt is not impossible for this trial to continue.\nAndrews:\n...!\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you...\nEdgeworth:\nIt's true Ms. Andrews holds the right against self-incrimination; however, if the topic of conversation were something unrelated to whatever she may be guilty of, then she has no right to withhold testimony!\nJudge:\nY-Yes, that is very true, but...\nEdgeworth:\nActually, there is one little thing that I'm curious about. Ms. Andrews.\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nWhen you found the victim's dead body, you poured yourself a glass of juice.\nAndrews:\nY-Yes... And...?\nEdgeworth:\nI can't help but think how unnatural that is. Usually when one finds a body, they are shaken up, not stirring a glass of juice.\nAndrews:\nSo my actions were \"unusual\"? But I've already...\nEdgeworth:\nBefore you speak, I want to state that if you have a reason behind your actions, I would like you to testify to that effect.\nAndrews:\nTestify...!?\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor! I would like to request that the witness testify again as to what happened when she first discovered the victim's body! Whatever we find out in this testimony should in no way implicate the witness.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nMia:\nI don't know what it is about Edgeworth today, but I can't get a good read off of him. Is he friend or foe? I just don't know...\nJudge:\nThe court acknowledges the prosecution's request. Ms. Andrews, if you please.\nWitness Testimony\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nThat glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.\nI was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.\nAnd Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.\nWhen I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.\nTo be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.\nWhen I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.\nJudge:\nHmm... So you poured that glass of juice for the victim. Why didn't you say so in your earlier testimony?\nAndrews:\n...I didn't think I needed to include something so trivial.\nMia:\nPhoenix. Please be careful here. If you can't find anything wrong with this testimony, then there's nothing left...\nPhoenix:\nI know. (Edgeworth... What the heck is going on in that brain of yours...?)\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- When I Found the Body --\nAndrews:\nThat glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut... There wasn't anyone else in the room, right?\nAndrews:\nOf course not.\nPhoenix:\nThen... who did you pour it for?\nAndrews:\nMr. Wright. There is a rhyme and reason for everything. Can you wait just a little longer for it to be revealed to you?\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, Wright, \"Be quiet and listen.\"\nAndrews:\nPrecisely! I couldn't have said it better myself.\nPhoenix:\nUnnngh...\nAndrews:\nI was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo, it was a \"mess\"? Are you sure it wasn't messy because of your fight with Mr. Corrida...?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI understand your frustrations at not being able to prove your theory. However... Before you go accusing people of crimes, go find yourself some evidence!\nPhoenix:\n(Grr...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnd then, what did you see next, witness?\nAndrews:\nAnd Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSlumped over?\nAndrews:\nYes, he was just sitting there with his head tilted forward, eyes closed. He really looked like he was sleeping.\nPhoenix:\n(...Is it just me or did that right there sound a little... odd?)\nAndrews:\nWhen I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThen what did cross your mind?\nAndrews:\nI thought maybe he had smashed everything up in anger because he lost the Grand Prix. And then felt tired after his rampage, so he decided to take a nap... Anyways, that's what I thought...\nJudge:\nI see. So you didn't think he was dead at all.\nPresent Crime Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"\nAndrews:\nTo be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou thought he fainted...?\nAndrews:\nI thought he was asleep at first. But then, the room was in such a messy state... I thought maybe he had gotten into a fight with someone...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that's when you went to pour the glass of juice?\nAndrews:\nYes. He always has a hard time waking up. So Juan always has a glass of tomato juice to drink.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. And after that, what happened next?\nPresent Crime Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"\nAndrews:\nWhen I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd how did you come to realize that he was, in fact, dead?\nAndrews:\nI shook him over and over, but I never got a response... So I set the glass down on the dresser and tried to take his pulse. I... I was shocked... and staggered backward...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd knocked the flower vase over. So that's what happened.\nAndrews:\n...Yes.\nPresent Crime Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"\nMia:\n... This is what it all comes down to.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nThis is the absolute end for both sides... And Adrian is letting her guard down. Phoenix, now is our best chance yet to kill the prosecution's case!\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that a bit harsh...? Ms. Andrews... Will you tell us the truth this time...?)\nPhoenix:\nSo you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\nAndrews:\nNo, not at all...\nPhoenix:\nEven though this is what you saw when you discovered the body?\nAndrews:\n...Ah!\nJudge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nIsn't it obvious, Your Honor? There is a knife sticking straight out of Mr. Corrida's chest! Anyone who saw this scene would have immediately thought that here was a dead man!\nAndrews:\nAh... Um... That's... Well, you see...\nPhoenix:\nI doubt a single person in the world would mistake this for someone who fainted, and then so nonchalantly go pour something to drink!\nJudge:\nY-Your point is...?\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews! Your testimony just now... It was all one giant lie!\nAndrews:\nUngh!\nPhoenix:\nAnd your lie has proven one thing very clearly. That you are the real killer!\nAndrews:\n... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!\nJudge:\nIt looks like the defense has somehow brought the ugly truth to light. The defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde, is not guilty after all...\nAndrews:\nThat... But that's impossible! You're wrong...\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Andrews! Try to have some composure!\nAndrews:\nIt... It wasn't me... It wasn't me, I tell you! It was Matt! I swear it! He's the one who killed Juan!\nPhoenix:\nBut you were the one who refused to testify! And your reason for not doing so was that you \"might\" end up incriminating yourself!\nAndrews:\nTh-That's because...\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews, I will give you one last chance. What exactly are you hiding that may \"incriminate\" you?\nAndrews:\n... I... I... I refuse... to testify.\nJudge:\nThen there is no need for this court to continue any further. Mr. Matt Engarde's innocence has been clearly demonstrated.\nPhoenix:\n(Is... Is it... over...? Have we... Have we found the truth at last...?)\nMia:\nWhat's wrong, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nUsually... Well, usually, the real killer confesses his or her guilt. And now that I think about it, this is the first time someone hasn't.\nJudge:\nNow then, I would like to hand down my verdict for Mr. Matt Engarde.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. The prosecution feels that it would be premature to pass down a verdict at this time.\nJudge:\nWh-What...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe reason is quite simple. This witness has yet to speak the absolute, real truth.\nJudge:\nThe \"absolute, real truth\"...? What are you...?\nEdgeworth:\nWitness... Don't you understand yet?\nAndrews:\n...Huh?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know who planted this silly idea in your head, but as long as you \"protect\" yourself through your silence, Matt Engarde will go free. And in his place... YOU will become the guilty party!\nAndrews:\n...Th-That's... That's a lie! I... I don't believe you!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nAndrews:\nI... I was told... If I spoke... If I spoke, then it would be all over... And Matt would never be declared guilty...\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What in the world is she talking about!? Has she lost it!?)\nAndrews:\nI... I can't speak about it... I'm too scared...\nMia:\nIt's Franziska von Karma...\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nMia:\nDon't you rememeber, Phoenix? Ms. Andrews lives by gripping tightly onto the words of another. Because she doesn't have the strength to believe in herself.\nPhoenix:\nTh...Then, right now... Ms. Andrews is...\nMia:\nYesterday, she was tossed a life-saver by Ms. von Karma. \"Don't say a word, no matter what happens. If you do, Matt Engarde will be acquitted.\" Ms. Andrews undyingly believes in those words right now, and is clinging onto them...\nPhoenix:\n(Th-Then what should we do!? This... This is the first time I've ever come across anything like this! But Ms. Andrews has to be the killer, right!? All we have to do now is... is get our not guilty... That is my only priority!)\nAndrews:\nIt wasn't me! I'm begging you, please believe me! I didn't kill Juan! Help... Please... Someone... Help me...!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe court can't continue on like this, therefore I'd like to hear what you intend to do.\nPhoenix:\n(What I intend to do...!? Wh-What am I supposed to do!? What am I supposed to say!?)\nEdgeworth:\nWright! I suggest you think very carefully about this! Think about what this witness did, and what she did NOT do! And think about who is the real mastermind behind this crime!\nPhoenix:\n(Who's the real mastermind? Isn't that obvious!? There's no one else it could be except the woman crying over there! ...Right?)\nEdgeworth:\nCome now! What will you do!? What kind of man are you, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?\nRequest \"not guilty\" verdict\nPhoenix:\n(No matter what she says... Ms. Andrews is the only person it could be! Not to mention... I don't have a choice. I have to win a complete acquittal today!) Y-Your Honor! The defense believes there is enough evidence to substantiate our claim! Therefore, we motion that this court passes a verdict of \"not guilty\" as soon as possible!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nI'm disappointed in you, Wright! What have you learned in this past year!?\nLeads to:\n\"That's enough!\"\nForce Andrews to testify\nPhoenix:\n(I have to win a complete acquittal today... There's no way around that! But... I can't bring myself to do it like this! Not when she's making a face like that...) Ms. Andrews! I would like to know what you are really hiding!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Wright! Are you sure you know what you're doing!?\nPhoenix:\nSure, Mr. Engarde would get an acquittal, but in his place, you would be found guilty! Is this... Is this how you really want this trial to end!?\nAndrews:\nB-Be quiet... How dare you!? You... You're trying to trick me!\nLeads to:\n\"That's enough!\"\nJudge:\nThat's enough! I commend you for trying, Mr. Edgeworth. However, it's clear that the defense's theory is the truth.\nAndrews:\n...Y...You're wrong...\nEdgeworth:\n... What a shame... (Changed from [Such a shame...] in the original release)\nAndrews:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nI had hoped things wouldn't come to this, however...\nJudge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Andrews. Since you absolutely refuse to testify... It falls on my shoulders to disclose this to the court.\nAndrews:\n...S...Stop...\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis witness... How should I put this... She has an illness.\nAndrews:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd because of this illness, she has tried to commit suicide in the past.\nAndrews:\nS-Stop... Please stop...!\nEdgeworth:\nNo matter how much you want to hide it, it's no use. I have the evidence right here.\nAndrews:\nAh! Th-That's...!\nPhoenix:\n(That's the second part of the suicide report -- the attempted suicide report!)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat will you do now, witness? You know what I am about to do, don't you? I will now reveal to the court, the true nature of the pitiful woman known as Adrian Andrews!\nPhoenix:\n(The secret of her dependent nature... (Changed from [The secret of her co-dependant [sic] nature...] in the original release) Having other people know about it scares her more than anything else in the world...)\nAndrews:\nPlease! Please STOP!! I beg you!! If people find out... If people find out... I... I'll...\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're going to say you would \"choose death\", that is of no concern to me.\nAndrews:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth... How can you be so cold...!?)\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, before you die... I will pull the truth from your still-breathing lips! (Changed from [I will pull the truth from your breathing lips!] in the original release) ... No matter what I have to do.\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nSo, will you tell the court yourself, or shall I!? Either is fine with me.\nAndrews:\n... ... ...I... I'll talk. But please... Help me... N-Nothing matters anymore...\nWitness Testimony\n-- My \"Crime\" --\nAndrews:\nWhen I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest.\nWhen I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan.\nOnce I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room.\nAnd then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button.\nJust when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience.\nAnd that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume.\nJudge:\nS-Stabbed the body!? With the knife!? But why would you do that!?\nAndrews:\nIsn't it obvious? To pin the blame on a certain person... A certain cowardly man!\nJudge:\nWh... What do you mean by all of this...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt might take this court a little while to understand, but... This is the truth.\nAndrews:\nThe real killer is Matt! That scumbag of a man! I'll never forgive him! He's trying to escape his guilt again! Just like last time!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Last time\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nSo, Ms. Andrews stabbed the victim, Juan Corrida, in the chest with the knife. However, she didn't do it with murder in mind. She did it with the intent of framing Matt Engarde for the murder... And this! This is her \"crime\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-WHAT!? How is this possible!? I mean... Wasn't Ms. Andrews supposed to be the real murderer!?)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Please get over your shock and commence the cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- My \"Crime\" --\nAndrews:\nWhen I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut you could tell from the state the room was in, that there must have been a fight! Are you telling the truth when you say that you did not know he was dead?\nAndrews:\nHe... had a scarf tied around his neck... But that scarf is a part of the Jammin' Ninja's costume... So... So I didn't think anything about it was strange... His head was also... tilted down a bit, so I couldn't see his face that well... That's why I thought I'd wake him up... and went to pour the juice...\nAndrews:\nWhen I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhat is this \"plan\" you had?\nAndrews:\n... I knew right away the murderer was Matt. I knew because Juan... He was going to expose Matt's weakest weakpoint to the world. So Matt did this to stop Juan, and silence him for good. That's when I thought, \"I should forge some evidence and pin this crime on Matt.\"\nEdgeworth:\nSo the forged pieces of evidence were the knife and the button...\nAndrews:\nThe first thing that came to mind was to plant the knife.\nAndrews:\nOnce I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThat was so you could get the knife, correct?\nAndrews:\nThe knife Matt used at dinner had his fingerprints all over it. I thought if I used that, then the police would certainly turn their eyes towards him. Matt was napping with his costume on at the time. I slipped in, took the knife, and returned to the scene of the crime.\nAndrews:\nAnd then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo you were the one to stab the victim with that knife.\nAndrews:\nIt gives me goosebumps to think about it now... What a horrible thing I did... But... At the time, I couldn't control my own body. It moved on its own. Then, when I stabbed Juan's dead body... I suddenly realized something. If I used the button somehow, I could make Matt look even more suspect.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you thought to rip one of the buttons off and then plant it in Mr. Engarde's hakama.\nAndrews:\nYes... That's what I had planned to do. ...But things never go that smoothly, do they?\nAndrews:\nJust when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAn \"inconvenience\"...?\nAndrews:\nThere was a woman with a camera at the ready, loitering in the hallway.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm willing to bet my spikes it was Lotta...)\nAndrews:\nThere was also a woman with a ray gun at the ready pacing back and forth...\nPhoenix:\n(That's Ms. Oldbag for you...)\nAndrews:\nI had already been caught and made into a big scoop for a certain weekly tabloid once, so I couldn't very well go out looking like myself and get caught again.\nAndrews:\nAnd that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one who prepared that costume, weren't you?\nAndrews:\nYes. I took it from Global Studios... I also put it into Juan's guitar case the day before the award ceremony.\nEdgeworth:\nYou did this in preparation for the press conference, correct?\nAndrews:\nYes, Juan wanted to wear that costume and hold a press conference in it. He was going to disclose Matt's big secret there.\nJudge:\nAnd what is this \"secret\"...?\nAndrews:\n... ...That, I don't know. Anyway, I thought that if I were to leave Juan's room in the Nickel Samurai costume... then people would think that Matt was the \"real\" murderer. I was very careful not to leave any fingerprints when I opened the guitar case. I absolutely did not want anyone to know about the costume.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't want to concede, but this testimony... it rings of the truth...)\nMia:\nI'm sorry, Phoenix...\nPhoenix:\nN-No, please, don't apologize to me. We were both taken by surprise.\nMia:\nStill, I'm sorry...\nAfter pressing all statements:\nJudge:\nI think we've heard enough! So, after that, you went back to Mr. Engarde's room and planted the button?\nAndrews:\n...Into Matt's hakama? Yes. After that, I folded up the costume I was wearing and put it into a bag. Then I snuck it out of the hotel and got rid of it.\nJudge:\nM-My word... What does all this mean...?\nAndrews:\n...Mr. Edgeworth, is it?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nAndrews:\nThe real criminal... is Matt Engarde!! Yesterday... That woman prosecutor sat me down for a talk...\nPhoenix:\n(Franziska, huh...)\nAndrews:\nShe said that I should, under no circumstances, confess to what I had done. That if I just kept quiet, then Matt would be found guilty for sure... I... I had no choice but to believe in her words...\nPhoenix:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\n...............\nJudge:\nWhat this witness has done is clearly unlawful. However... As long as her testimony stands, we can be certain she is not the real killer!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait, Your Honor! The defense still...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWright.\nPhoenix:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's pointless. At this point in time, it is not possible to indict Ms. Andrews on anything.\nJudge:\nYes, exactly. There isn't a single piece of evidence that points to her as the murderer. The cross-examination of this witness is over. And so is today's trial. You couldn't establish that the witness was the culprit. Please let it go, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nB-But!\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth, please place Ms. Andrews under arrest for further questioning.\nEdgeworth:\nUnderstood, Your Honor. The prosecution will arrange for her detention immediately.\nJudge:\nThat's all. Court is adjourned for today!\nPhoenix:\n(Today's... Today's trial... It's over...! And I didn't win an acquittal!)\nEdgeworth:\nWitness... Would you mind if I asked you something?\nPhoenix:\n...! (Edgeworth...?)\nAndrews:\nWhat is it...?\nEdgeworth:\nBefore you leave court today, I wondered if I might look at one thing. The card in your hand. It's had my interest for quite some time now. What exactly is it...?\nAndrews:\nOh, this...? Mr. Wright also asked about this. Although I didn't remember at the time you asked me about it, Mr. Wright, I remembered just now. I found this in the room on that day.\nPhoenix:\n\"The room\"...?\nEdgeworth:\n\"That day\"...?\nAndrews:\nYes. I found this card when I discovered Juan's body. It was lying there right next to him...\nPhoenix:\nYou found that card... next to the victim's body?\nAndrews:\nI suppose I must have unconsciously slipped it into my pocket... ...But it's not as if this card has any relevance to Juan's murder, right?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I guess not. But it's still a strange card, if you ask me... But as far as a clue to this case...? I don't see why...)\n???:\nEdgeworth:\nWitness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry!\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time!\nAndrews:\nI... I didn't mean to...\nMia:\nWh-What is this all about...?\nPhoenix:\n(I've never seen Edgeworth so emotional before... (Changed from [I've never seen such an emotional Edgeworth in my entire life...] in the original release) That card... What in the world is it? And what does it mean...!?)\nTo be continued.\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?\nJudge:\nUh... I'm not sure I follow you.\nPhoenix:\nIt clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...\nJudge:\nYou don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!\nJudge:\n...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really?\nJudge:\nObjection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHow exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?\nPhoenix:\nThey aren't, are they...\nJudge:\nNot at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!\nJudge:\n... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)\nToo many penalties\nJudge:\nThat's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Matt Engarde...\nGuilty\nJudge:\nThe accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!\nFarewell, My Turnabout\nTranscript\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nMarch 22, 5:24 PMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPearl:\nMystic Maya... M-Mystic Mayaaa... *sniffle, sniffle*\nPhoenix:\nThere, there, Pearls...\nPearl:\nI... I can't take it... anymore... ...Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...\nPhoenix:\nL-Look! It'll be alright! Everything may still work out.\nPearl:\nHm...?\nPhoenix:\nThe condition was that we had to get a \"not guilty\" verdict. And so far, the kidnapper has kept his word and hasn't hurt Maya. And he won't because Mr. Engarde hasn't been given a \"guilty\" sentence yet!\nPearl:\nUnngg... Nnmff... *sniffle, sniffle*\nPhoenix:\nCheer up! We don't have time to stand around crying! We have to get going!\nPearl:\n... Y-You're right... Mystic Maya is in much more pain than I am!\nPhoenix:\nYes, that's right. So...\n???:\nHey! You guys! Glad I caught you, pal!\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Scruffy Detective...\nPhoenix:\n(...Oh boy. Looks like Detective Gumshoe... has been dubbed \"Mr. Scruffy Detective\" in Pearls's book now...)\nGumshoe:\nIt's just plain ol' \"Mr. Dick Gumshoe\" now, and I came to talk to you, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(But we're kind of busy right now...)\nExamine\nCharley the plant\nGumshoe:\nHey, it's wilting a little!\nPearl:\nI'll... I'll give it some delicious water, pal!\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK... I already did that...\nGumshoe:\n...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?\nPhoenix:\n(Did he just call the watering can, \"Mr.\"?)\nPoster\nPearl:\nThis is the... uh... Nickel Samurai, right?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's right.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!?\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.\nPearl:\nOh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either...\nGumshoe:\nB-But I can read AND I'm tall, pal!\nPhoenix:\nP-Please stop competing with an 8 year old... It's disturbing...\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh! I cleaned it up even more for you last night!\nGumshoe:\nB-But I can get it even more cleaner, pal!\nPearl:\nAaah! That's... That's for the toilet!!\nPhoenix:\n(What a mess. Literally...)\nTalk\nThe future\nPhoenix:\nSo, what are you going to do from now on?\nGumshoe:\nWhadaya mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you've been fired, right? So, do you have a new job lined up yet?\nGumshoe:\nOh, that! A-Ah... What am I supposed to do now, pal!? I... I don't have anything coming in at all until my next payday!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you talking about!? You don't have another payday!\nGumshoe:\n... I guess that means I'm just gonna half [sic] to work here at your place, pal!\nPhoenix:\nS-SAY WHAT!?\nGumshoe:\nYou'll be searching for things that will prove Mr. Engarde's innocence all day, right?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well... yeah...\nGumshoe:\nSo yeah! I'm going to help you, pal! I've got lots of experience in investigating, and watching over people's places! And I'm great at making really simple meals, pal! I'll take care of it all!\nPearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Let's let Mr. Scruffy Detective take care of things!\nPhoenix:\nA-Ah... OK... By the way, what's your best dish?\nGumshoe:\nInstant noodles, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(Why am I surrounded by people who only eat cheap, unhealthy foods...?)\nEdgeworth\nGumshoe:\n...That was the first time I've ever seen Mr. Edgeworth act like that... Never thought he'd say something like, he didn't care if Ms. Andrews killed herself...\nPearl:\nH-He said that!? That's horrible...\nGumshoe:\nBut because of him doing that, we got the truth finally.\nPhoenix:\n...The truth... (Ms. Andrews' last testimony; I wonder if that was the truth...?) I'll give you that there was nothing strange in her testimony itself. But... I still think there is something fundamentally wrong with the whole thing.\nGumshoe:\nYou mean about \"that\" thing, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWhy would she want to -- no, I mean, almost \"need\" to frame Mr. Engarde... I couldn't figure that out from anything she said all day!\nGumshoe:\n... Then... Then you're saying that testimony... was a lie...?\nPhoenix:\nNot a lie, per se... It just feels like there's more here than meets the eye. Or that's what Edgeworth would like us to believe...\nPearl:\nTh-That's such a dirty trick! Even that woman prosecutor was better than that!\nPhoenix:\n(Franziska von Karma...) Speaking of Ms. von Karma, do you have any more information on her condition? Wasn't she shot this morning!?\nFranziska (appears after \"Edgeworth\")\nGumshoe:\nMs. von Karma was shot today on the way to the trial by a pistol, pal.\nPhoenix:\nB-But she's going to be fine, right? I mean, Edgeworth said she was in \"stable condition\", but...\nGumshoe:\nWell, she was shot in the shoulder, so she's OK and still hanging in there. They should be done taking the bullet out, so she's probably resting at the hospital.\nPhoenix:\nWhich one...?\nGumshoe:\nWhat? Are you going to visit her, pal?\nPhoenix:\nN-No... Well, I was kind of thinking about it...\nGumshoe:\nHey! You've actually got a heart, don't you!? She looked like she was being tortured to death not being able to go to the trial today, so maybe it'd be good for her if you went and let her whip you for a bit, pal!\nPearl:\nLet's go let her whip us, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nNow I'm DEFINITELY not going.\nGumshoe:\nUm... let's see... The name of the hospital... Oh yeah! The \"Hotti Clinic\"!\nPhoenix:\n(That name sends a chill down my spine... Well, I guess it can't hurt to stop by and say hi...)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nLook, it's my attorney's badge.\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's a little tarnished, don't you think, pal? Don't worry! I'll make it all sparkly shiny again!\nPhoenix:\n(I...

But remember! You can't provoke him when you get to talk to him!\nJammin' Ninja's Button\nGumshoe:\nWhen I saw that button, I thought to myself, \"This is gonna prove Mr. Engarde's guilty!\"... But it looks like there was a lot more to it than I thought, huh pal?\nPhoenix:\nYou're a pro. You should know better than to say something like that.\nGumshoe:\nW-Well, I'm not a cop anymore. Just a regular helper around the office now, so...\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if he misses working down at the precinct...?)\nKnife\nGumshoe:\nWho would've thought that this knife Mr. Engarde used to eat his dinner steak with...\nPhoenix:\nGo on...\nGumshoe:\n...That it would be stabbed into the victim's body by Ms. Andrews, of all people. I guess she just hated the victim that much, huh pal?\nPhoenix:\nThe question isn't why she hated the victim to that extend, but rather why she tried to pin the murder on Mr. Engarde.\nPearl:\nI wonder if she really hates Mr. Engarde?\nLotta's Photo\nGumshoe:\nSo this \"Nickel Samurai\" was really Ms. Andrews, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. This is either when she went to Mr. Engarde's room to get the knife... ...or when she was done with the foul deed. But I guess we'll never know.\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nIt'll be OK!

I learned something new today...\nFranziska von Karma profile\nPhoenix:\nIs she alright...? After being shot, I mean...\nGumshoe:\nHer wound isn't that bad... Well, the gunshot wound anyway... But the wound to her pride, now that's a different story, pal.\nPhoenix:\nThe wound to her pride?\nGumshoe:\nWell, until now, she's always upheld the \"Von Karma Creed\", but since she came here, well, you've given her pride quite a beating, pal.\nPhoenix:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nI mean, she may act all grown-up, but she's really still just an 18 year old. ...Quite frankly, I worry about her, pal.\nMiles Edgeworth profile\nGumshoe:\nThat's the first time I've seen that side of Mr. Edgeworth, pal.

Maya getting kidnapped all because of this guy... I mean, what kind of person is the real murderer anyway!?\nPearl:\nMaybe they're a big fan of Mr. Engarde?\nPhoenix:\n(But the kidnapper's voice... He sounded like an old man to me...)\nAdrian Andrews profile\nGumshoe:\nMy impression of her has totally changed, pal.\nPhoenix:\nUm... So, where is she right now...?\nGumshoe:\nI'm sure she's being questioned down at the precinct. At the very least about messing with the body, and obstructing the investigation. And she'll probably be staying over at the detention center...\nPhoenix:\n(The detention center, huh...)\nCeleste Inpax profile\nGumshoe:\nShe was Ms. Adrian Andrews' mentor.\nPhoenix:\n(Because of the suicide of the mentor she depended on, Adrian Andrews tried to follow her in an attempted suicide...

You can tell me... Hmm, yes...\n???:\nDirector Hotti!\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth...\nHotti:\nHmm, yes... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh. ...Oh, you're the man from this morning. Hmm, yes... What is it?... Uh huh...\nEdgeworth:\nDirector. Franziska... How is Franziska von Karma?\nHotti:\nHmm... You don't need to worry. Hmm, yes... She's in good hands... Because, you see... I'm personally taking good care of her... Hmm, yes... Hee hee. Hmm, yes... and that thing... that surgery... It went well.\nEdgeworth:\n...You have my gratitude.\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like Edgeworth doesn't know about this \"Director\" and his secret...)\nHotti:\nShe looked so pitiful -- absolutely terrified. Hmm, yes... But I understand, hmm... Hmm, yes... Her opponent was a gun, after all. Uh huh. And when I snuck up on her real secret-like, she would scream really loud. Hmm, yes.\nEdgeworth:\nI see.\nHotti:\nAh, but she's really cute too. When I'd do that, she'd whip me with her whip, uh huh... Boy did I cry like a baby. Hmm, yes... But I think I could get used to it. Hmm... Hmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nGo back to your room.\nHotti:\nYou're so mean, uh huh... So mean... my frisky Friska. But that's good too-- Hmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! OK, OK... I... Hmm, yes... It's time for my IV drops. Hmm, yes...\nvon Karma:\n... And what are those tulips doing in your hand, Mr. Phoenix Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! I knew I shouldn't have come here!)\nExamine\nWaiting room on left\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the waiting area. It's got the feeling of one and there are sofas lined up... but I don't see all that many patients.\nHotti:\nHmm, yes... well, visiting hours are over. That's why... Hmm... It's time for nightly consultations to begin... Mine, that is... Heh heh heh.\nPhoenix:\n(...Isn't there anyone keeping an eye on this guy...?)\nDoor at the back\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder where that door way down there leads to...?)\nHotti:\nOh, that's the X-ray room. Hmm, yes...\nPhoenix:\nH-H-How did you know what I was thinking!?\nHotti:\nHmm, yes... Well, it's... Because that's the X-ray room...

Don't just cut into my monologue like that! I'm explaining things here!\nHotti:\nAh, sorry. Hmm, yes... Most sorry... Yes... Uh, huh...\nReception area\nPhoenix:\nThis is the clinic's reception desk, but it doesn't look like there's anyone at the counter.

Hmph... It's no big deal. This sort of thing happens all the time. I even had full intentions of running the trial this morning.\nPearl:\nBut! But that would've been too much for you! (Changed from [But! But that would've been too much!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(There's no need to act tough in front of us, you know...) (Changed from [Yeah! You looked like you were deathly scared until only a few minutes ago...] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nRegardless, I was dragged here by THAT man over there. (Changed from [But I was dragged here by THAT prosecutor.] in the original release) He was so unyielding, one has to wonder if he was simply interested in stealing my case. (Changed from [He even went so far as to grab me by the wrist the whole way here.] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nIt was the only logical course of action given the bullet was still lodged in your shoulder. But by taking over the case... (Changed from [But with me doing so...] in the original release) I found myself having to clean up after you and that irresponsible deal you made.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(I think I know what \"deal\" he's referring to...)\nThe deal\nPhoenix:\nMs. von Karma. You made a deal with Ms. Andrews yesterday, didn't you?\nvon Karma:\nI don't know what you mean.\nPhoenix:\nIn order to make sure you got your guilty verdict on Mr. Engarde, you told Ms. Andrews to not testify in court today.\nvon Karma:\nHmph, I don't know what you're talking about. Do you have proof that I made such a deal?\nPhoenix:\nY-You're denying it!?\nvon Karma:\n... It looks like you were lucky, Mr. Phoenix Wright. If I had been in court today, this trial would already be over.\nPhoenix:\nAll while hiding Ms. Andrews' own crime?\nvon Karma:\nThat isn't my problem. Whether she had tampered with evidence or not... I have only one objective. To find Engarde guilty of murder. The end justifies the means, Mr. Phoenix Wright. The end justifies the means.\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nAah!\nvon Karma:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that's all I get...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n...Ms. von Karma. Adrian Andrews believed you when you said, \"If you don't tell the truth of what really happened, then Engarde will be found guilty.\"\nvon Karma:\nAnd what does that have to do with me?\nPhoenix:\nBecause of that, she is now in danger of being found guilty herself! All because she believed in your words until the very end...\nvon Karma:\n... That still has nothing to do with me. She's just a weak person, that's all.\nPhoenix:\nBut you had to know she was... OWWW!\nvon Karma:\n... I think visiting hours here are about over. So, if you'll excuse me.\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong? Why did she suddenly cut you off...?\nPhoenix:\n(Probably because she thinks I had the advantage in that argument... ...Edgeworth...)\nTalk\nToday's trial\nPhoenix:\nWhat happened today at the trial, Edgeworth? That was not like you at all...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI mean, I know you knew about Ms. Andrews' condition. You could have made her testify as many times as you wanted, but to go that far...!\nEdgeworth:\n...Ah, but she wouldn't testify about THAT until I said something. Listen, Wright. The courtroom is a garden of judgment. I am putting myself on the line when I stand in there. And that's why I made the witness do the same... It's only natural.\nAdrian's card\nPhoenix:\nBy the way, Edgeworth... You were really angry in court today... That's rare for you.\nEdgeworth:\nWitness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry!\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time!\nPhoenix:\nThat card... What in the world is it?\nEdgeworth:\n... You mean this...? ... Listen, Wright. This is top secret information. You absolutely cannot leak this. A special investigation team has existed for a number of years, but few know of it.\nPhoenix:\nI-I understand.\nEdgeworth:\nTheir task is to find the \"owner\" of this card... A man called Shelly de Killer. And just as his name states, he is a \"killer\", an assassin. The best, at that.\nPhoenix:\n(An assassin!?)\nPicture Card added to the Court Record.\nAdrian's card (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nBy the way, Edgeworth... You were really angry in court today... That's rare for you.\nEdgeworth:\nWitness! That card... Give it to me! Hurry!\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have any idea what you have stupidly, yet inadvertently done!? This... I can't believe you hid this from me all this time!\nPhoenix:\nThat card... What in the world is it?\nEdgeworth:\n... You mean this...? ... Listen, Wright. This is top secret information. You absolutely cannot leak this.

A man called Shelly de Killer. And just as his name states, he is a \"killer\", an assassin. The best, at that.\nPhoenix:\n(An assassin!?)\nAssassin (appears after \"Adrian's card\")\nPhoenix:\nSo who is this \"Shelly de Killer\"?\nEdgeworth:\n\"De Killer\" is the name of a long standing line of assassins.\nPearl:\nLong standing?\nEdgeworth:\nThe name first appeared about 100 years ago, I hear. Shelly is the professional name of the third heir to the De Killer name.\nPhoenix:\nSo because his professional name is \"Shelly\", he leaves cards with a shell on them...?\nEdgeworth:\nHe has a habit of making sure to leave a card by the body of his victims.\nPearl:\nWhy would he do something like that...?\nEdgeworth:\nWe think it is a part of his duty to his clients.\nPhoenix:\nHis \"duty\"?\nEdgeworth:\nIf he leaves a card, then his clients can be assured it was he who killed the victim. It also serves as insurance against any charges being pushed onto his clients.\nPhoenix:\n...I see...\nEdgeworth:\nDe Killer values the trust between his clients and himself above all else. It seems that this is one honorable assassin with a moral conscience.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that even honorable assassins can exist...) So, you think this assassin... You think he's the one who did the killing in this case?\nEdgeworth:\nIt would appear that way. The discovery of the card basically confirms it, wouldn't you agree?\nPhoenix:\n(Shelly de Killer, huh...)\nMaya's situation (appears after \"Assassin\")\nLeads to:\n\"I noticed something at the trial today.\"\nPresent\nAnything\nEdgeworth:\n...I've been put in charge of this case. So I can't give you any help with reagards to clues or evidence.\nPhoenix:\nYou sure are hardnosed. Totally different from Detective Gumshoe.\nEdgeworth:\n...And that is why he was fired.\nPhoenix:\n(He's got a point...)\nEdgeworth:\nI noticed something at the trial today. You were behaving in a very strange manner. ...Is something the matter?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess... I should just tell him.) Maya... She's been kidnapped.\nEdgeworth:\nK-Kidnapped? What does the kidnapper want!?\nPhoenix:\nAn acquittal.\nEdgeworth:\n... I see. I had no idea. ... I will prepare a rescue team as soon as possible, and resolve this by tomorrow.\nPearl:\nR-Really!? Did you hear that, Mr. Nick!? M-Mr. Edgeworth is going to...\nPhoenix:\nStop trying to console me, Edgeworth! I don't need your pity!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThere's no way you can find her. We don't have even a single clue to go on.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThere's only one way to save her. I... I have to get an acquittal somehow! It's the only way!\nEdgeworth:\n... Wright. Listen, you need to know something. Juan Corrida was killed by Shelly de Killer. And the client who ordered the job... is Matt Engarde... Your own client.\nPhoenix:\nPlease, stop! ...I can't listen to you. I can't believe that.\nEdgeworth:\n...I see. Well, if you want to continue your investigation, you will need this.\nPearl:\nWhat is it?\nEdgeworth:\nThe hotel right now is restricted to police personnel only, as we are looking for any clues that might lead us to Shelly de Killer. If you take this with you to the hotel, I'm sure they will let you enter.\nLetter of Introduction added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\n...In any case, I must attend to the preparations for Maya's rescue team. We'll meet again, if anything should happen. Now if you'll excuse me...\nPearl:\nMr. Nick? Do you... Do you think... Mr. Engarde hired an assassin...?\nPhoenix:\nNo way! (I mean, he doesn't have a Psyche-Lock...)\nPearl:\nY-Yeah, I guess not...\nPhoenix:\nMaya... Please... All I ask is you make it home, safe and sound!\nDate:\u00a0??? Time\u00a0???Location:\u00a0???\nMaya:\nHeh heh. I guess even kidnappers can be a little clumsy. Clumsy enough to drop a card like this for me. And even though he said he was an \"assassin\", I bet he's just making that up, like how Nick does with everything in court. Anyway, let's try out the card trick with this card I just found...\n...*click*...\nMaya:\nSounds like I got the door open... OK! Time to go take a look around!\nExamine\nDoor\nMaya:\nI've unlocked the door with this card... I should probably go and take a look around...\nDate:\u00a0??? Time\u00a0???Location:\u00a0???\nMaya:\nWh-What is this place...? I've got a feeling I'm not in the hotel anymore... Are those videos over there? ...Well, I'll worry about that later. For now, I should be looking for clues. That way, I can show them to sis and maybe get out of here!\nExamine\nTV\nMaya:\nWow, I've never seen a TV this big before. Now where's the power button... Hmm...\n...*click*...\nMaya:\n... Phooey. It's busted. I would so die a happy Samurai fan... if I ever got to see the Nickel Samurai on a TV like this. ... Ack! I can't believe I just made a joke about dying, all things considered...\nSatellite dish\nMaya:\nWhat is this thing? An antenna... I guess? And this is... a VCR? There sure are a lot of electronic gadgets here. But what is an antenna doing here...?\nComputer\nMaya:\nOh, hey. It's a computer. I've never really used one before. ... Um... I have no idea where the power switch on this thing is... Drat. There goes my plan to use this somehow to get out of here.\nTable\nMaya:\nThere's a framed picture sitting on this coffee table. It's a picture of a woman... She's kind of pretty. Hey, looks like something's written here... Let's see... I think it says, \"With love... Celeste\" I bet this could be a clue...\nSofa\nMaya:\n...That's weird. What's a figurine doing on a sofa in a place like this...? I think it's... a bear. Aww, how cute! But it's got a lot of cuts and slits on it... I wonder if it's some kind of puzzle or something...\nVideo tapes\nMaya:\nIt's so dark in here that I can barely see, but... these kinda feel like... video tapes... All of them... Just what kind of room is this...?\nDoor\nMaya:\nUnngh... Locked. Of course. And it doesn't look like I can use the card to open this door. There's a little hole at the bottom of the door. If only I was a little skinnier. Then maybe I'd be able to crawl through there...\nAfter examining satellite dish, table, sofa, and door:\n???:\nOh, this simply will not do... I cannot have you wandering around at will.\nMaya:\nEeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\n???:\n...It seems... that your Mr. Wright is truly concerned about you.\nMaya:\nHe is...?\n???:\nFor now, I would suggest you remain cooperative. If you cannot, there are ways in which I can help you...\nMaya:\nWays... You mean...\n???:\n\"Dead men tell no tales\" is how the saying goes, correct?\nMaya:\n\"D-D-D-D-Dead\"!?\n???:\nI'm almost certain I told you on our first meeting. I am... an assassin.\nMaya:\nN-No way... You're lying... I mean...

I've got something really important to tell you.'] in the original release) (Why do I feel uneasy all of a sudden...?)\nEngarde:\n... ... Oh, Mr. Wright. So actually... I have a favor to ask of you. I have this cat named Shoe. I didn't put out a lot of food when I left the house, so he's probably pretty hungry. You think you could drop by my house and feed Shoe for me, dude? My house is just a little ways down from the hotel, alright?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nTh-This is terrible! Let's hurry! We have to feed his cat!

Actually, I'm Mr. Engarde's lawyer.\n???:\nThe master's... Then, you must be Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes.\n???:\nAh, it's a pleasure to meet your wonderful self.\nDoe:\nI am the family butler, John Doe.\nPhoenix:\nNice to meet you.\nShoe:\nMeow.\nExamine\nFireplace\nPearl:\nOh! There's a giant cooking hearth here.\nPhoenix:\nThat's actually a fireplace.\nPearl:\nHow are they different, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n... (You know, I've never actually seen a hearth before, come to think of it...)\nPearl:\nYou should come and visit Fey Manor, then. I'll show you one when you do.\nMotorcycle\nPearl:\nA... A giant bicycle is flying through the air!\nPhoenix:\n... That bicycle, Pearls, is one where you don't have to pedal, and it moves on its own.\nPearl:\nReally!? Wow!\nPhoenix:\nBut sorry to disappoint you, it can't fly.\nPearl:\n...Oh. That's too bad.\nLounge set\nPhoenix:\nIt's a very comfortable and spacious lounge set. I wonder if famous stars drop by and sit around and have a good time. ...In any case, I don't really belong here, do I? ... Argh. What is with me and feeling inferior today...?\nPearl:\n?\nMasks\nPearl:\nAh! There are masks here!\nPhoenix:\nYeah. That one in the middle is the Steel Samurai. The ones next to that are the Pink Princess and the Evil Magistrate. They fought many battles against the backdrop of Neo Olde Tokyo.\nPearl:\nWow, you really know a lot about the Steel Samurai, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\n... (I don't know whether to laugh or cry that I know more about that show than a kid...)\nDoorway behind railing\nPhoenix:\nThere's another door over there.\nPearl:\nYou shouldn't go wandering off over there, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\n...Yes, Pearls. (Now I know how Maya feels when I tell her to stop playing around...)\nDoor\nPearl:\nThere's a small door at the bottom of this bigger door, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nI bet it's for Mr. Engarde's cat to use.\nPearl:\nOh, you mean Shoe.\nPhoenix:\n(The door... It's locked tight. Well, I guess that's to keep nosey people like me from entering it.)\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nYou must know all sorts of things about Mr. Engarde, right?\nDoe:\nHonestly, sir... I don't believe my master is capable of such a foul deed as murder.\nPhoenix:\n...\nDoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd, uh, anything else?\nDoe:\nNo, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master or his affairs.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... How typically \"butler-like\", as it were...)\nJohn Doe\nPhoenix:\nMr. Doe, how long have you served at this residence...?\nDoe:\nWell, sir, I would have to say... maybe about one year?\nPhoenix:\n...\nDoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd, uh, anything else?\nDoe:\nNo, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of himself and his affairs.\nPhoenix:\n(You know, I would've thought Mr. Engarde the kind to have a maid over a butler...) ([maid] in quotation marks in the original release)\nShoe\nPhoenix:\nThat's a very cute cat you've got here.\nDoe:\nIt is my duty to take care of him. The master rather fancies Shoe.\nPhoenix:\n...\nDoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd, uh, anything else?\nDoe:\nNo, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the family cat.\nPhoenix:\n(...Well then. I guess I don't need this piece of scrap paper anymore.)\nMatt's Note crumpled into a ball and thrown away.\nShoe (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThat's a very cute cat you've got here.\nDoe:\nIt is my duty to take care of him. The master rather fancies Shoe.\nPhoenix:\n...\nDoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd, uh, anything else?\nDoe:\nNo, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the family cat.\nPresent\nMatt Engarde profile\nPhoenix:\nYou must know all sorts of things about Mr. Engarde, right?\nDoe:\nHonestly, sir... I don't believe my master is capable of such a foul deed as murder.\nPhoenix:\n...\nDoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd, uh, anything else?\nDoe:\nNo, not especially. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master or his affairs.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... How typically \"butler-like\", as it were...)\nAny evidence\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking a look at this.\nDoe:\nI'm afraid I cannot offer up anything special about it. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of evidence for a trial.\nPhoenix:\n(Polite yet snotty with a touch of rude. He's the stereotypical butler alright.)\nAny other profiles\nPhoenix:\nWould you happen to know who this person is...?\nDoe:\nNo, I would not. It is not appropriate for a lowly servant to speak of the master's acquaintances.\nPhoenix:\n(Then what in the world CAN I talk to you about!?)\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Being angry is bad!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nDoe:\n...Well, I'm afraid I must take my leave of you now.\nPhoenix:\nOh, we should probably get going ourselves.\nDoe:\nAh, so young and yet already so accomplished. A master of law...\nPhoenix:\nBut there is also a lot to be proud of in being a butler, in charge of the house and all.\nDoe:\nThank you for the compliment, sir. ...People are not always who they appear to be. ...Now if you'll excuse me.\nShoe:\nMeow.\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like we're the only ones here.\nPearl:\nAnd yet... the hotel seems so busy somehow...\nPhoenix:\n(Probably because the police team is scouring for clues about \"De Killer\"...)\nExamine\nFront table\nPearl:\nI want to eat a meal with Mystic Maya again...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, me too...\nPearl:\nWhenever I watch Mystic Maya eat like she does... It makes me happy about eating, and then I can eat a lot.\nPhoenix:\nWell, then... How about after we wrap up this case, we all go out for a huge twenty-course feast!\nPearl:\nOK! Let's work really hard, then!\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelHallway\nLotta:\nHey, City Boy!\nPhoenix:\nL-Lotta... You're still here...\nLotta:\nReckon course! An investigative photographer eats or starves on her ability to snap up the scoop, yeah!? And this hotel just has that \"aura of mystery\". Ya know, like something's always about to happen.\nPearl:\nBut... Do you have a camera?\nLotta:\nReckgiven! A photographer's gotta have cameras out the ear like corn to be a real pro, ya know!? So I'm hangin' around here... ... ... Speaking of cameras and feedin' the mouth, do ya have mine, ya bread-thief!?\nPhoenix:\n(Why can't you drop that \"thief\" thing already?)\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPearl:\nAww, how lovely! The teddy bear looks happy to be surrounded by so many beautiful flowers.\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls really seems to like teddy bears a lot.)\nPhoenix:\nAh... I wonder if... Lotta also...\nLotta:\nI didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Although, other than sunflowers and tulips, I have no idea what any of them are.\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? What's this flower called?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a sunflower... I think.\nPearl:\nThis flower over here is pretty too.\nPhoenix:\nThat's a tulip, I guess.\nPearl:\n...\nLotta:\nCallin' everythin' a sunflower or a tulip; don't reckon even little kids'll fall for that!\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\".\nPearl:\nThe old lady told us about this, didn't she? That we can't go in this room tonight.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if an investigation briefing is going on right now inside... Without Detective Gumshoe...)\nTalk\nNight of the murder\nPhoenix:\nI want to ask you about the night of the murder.\nLotta:\nWhat? Ya really gonna shell out the bucks for the info I got!?\nPhoenix:\nLotta, you were loitering in this hallway the night of the murder, were you not?\nLotta:\nWell, kinda... But...\nPhoenix:\n(Brace yourself, Phoenix. Here it comes...) (Changed from [Brace yourself, Wright. Here it comes...] in the original release)\nLotta:\nI didn't exactly hang around here the entire time, ya know. Followed a few stars around... got a few autographs, shook a few hands, had a soda-pop with a few of 'em too.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like she wasn't here the entire time that night...)\nPearl:\nThe security lady also wasn't in this hallway the whole time either.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess this means there's no one who can tell us who came and went that night...)\nScandal\nPhoenix:\nSo, about the note that was inside your camera case.\nLotta:\nOh, that ditty I wrote?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Can I believe what you've written?\nLotta:\nYa mean the stuff about Engarde shovin' his manager lady onto Corrida?\nPhoenix:\nYeah...\nLotta:\nAh, well, I reckon ya best not be believin' that.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nLotta:\nLook, I sorta wrote that on a whim, ya know? Writin' whatever came to mind.\nPearl:\n\"Whatever came to mind\"...?\nLotta:\nYeah, when ya get down to it, it's just a lotta random bull dooders.\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\n...\nLotta:\nHey, what's with ya!? Why ya starin' at me like my grandpa used to!?\nPhoenix:\nHmph.\nLotta:\nHey, and why do you look like you suddenly got older too!? Or am I just shrinkin' here!?\nPearl:\nUmm...\nCamera\nLotta:\nAh! My baby! My $1,600 baby! What's with that red-coated prosecutor anyhow!? The guy told me it was \"evidence\" and refused to give it back to me!\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's kind of how it is...\nLotta:\nHey, hey. Yer that red-coat's friend, ain't ya? So put in a few good words for me and git me back my camera.\nPhoenix:\nY-You want me to do what!?\nLotta:\nListen, nag the guy real good fer 'bout five hours and I guarantee he'll give it back.\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you do your own dirty work...?\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nUm, would you please take a look at this?\nLotta:\nNope. Sorry. No can do. Only thing I wanna see is a steamin' hand towel.\nPhoenix:\nUm, what? A steaming hand towel...?\nLotta:\nNeed one for my eyes. Today just ain't a good day for my eyes to be lookin' at stuff.\nPhoenix:\n(How convenient! Maybe I'll have to use that one next time you show me something!)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nLotta:\n... Well, I reckon it's time for me to get going. A tabloid photographer without a camera is just a \"tabloid\", huh.\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Yeah, I guess so.\nLotta:\nKeep yerself together out there, ya hear!? I'm comin' to see ya in court tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nO-OK, I'll see you then...\nLotta:\nAnd you too there, little 'un. Keep up the good work, OK?\nPearl:\nOK!\nLotta:\nDon't be picky about yer food, now.\nPearl:\nOK!\nLotta:\nAnd make sure ya do all yer homework, ya hear?\nPearl:\nOK!\nLotta:\nAnd if you happen to find yerself a camera, make sure ya bring it right to me, ya--\nPhoenix:\nWould you please just leave already!?\nExamine\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". (I wonder what EXACTLY happened in the room behind this door...? Even now, no one really has any idea...)\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\n???:\n... Ooongh... Oooonnngh... Ooongh... Oooonnngh...\nPearl:\nM-M-Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is that otherworldly, ghastly moaning...!?\n???:\n... Ooonnnn... Oooo... Nnnghff... Ghfff...\nPearl:\nI... I hate evil ghosts... Waaaaaaaaaaaaah...\nPhoenix:\nI don't think it's a ghost... Maybe it's a demon!?\n???:\nE-Excuse me!? Watch who you're calling a demon, brat!\nPearl:\nAaaah!\nPhoenix:\nZoinks! It's the alien!!\nOldbag:\nWho are you calling an alien!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPhoenix:\nOh, it's just you, Ms. Oldbag. What are you doing here?\nOldbag:\nWhat is wrong with young'uns today!? I came down here to pay my respects to my poor Juan, and you're disturbing me!\nExamine\nBedroom\nPearl:\nSo that's a bed...\nPhoenix:\nYup. It's big, but it's a bed.\nPearl:\nAaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft!\nPhoenix:\n(How easily children are entertained.)\nFloor near guitar case\nPhoenix:\nBottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.\nPearl:\nThese glass shards...\nPhoenix:\nThey're probably from the glass vase Ms. Andrews knocked over.\nGuitar case\nPearl:\nSo, the Nickel Samurai's costume was in here?\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPearl:\nI can't believe Mr. Corrida went so far, just to say bad things about Mr. Engarde...\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, it was a \"press conference\", so he had to go in costume.\nPearl:\nBut weren't Mr. Engarde and Mr. Corrida friends?\nPhoenix:\nThey weren't friends. They couldn't be friends because they were rivals.\nPearl:\nSo, a \"rival\" is someone who is a \"strong enemy\"!?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is really fired up over this... And I don't have an answer for her.)\nWine glass\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nTalk\nNight of the murder\nPhoenix:\nPlease talk to me about the night of the murder just one more time.\nOldbag:\nI talked about it plenty at the trial! I was fooled, tricked... DECEIVED by that fraud of a photographer and her note! She was loitering around here with that imbecilic look on her face!\nPearl:\n\"With that imbecilic look on her face\"... OK, got it.\nOldbag:\nN-Now hold on a second there you little pipsqueak! If you're going to take notes, at least make me sound better than that!\nPearl:\nOh, alright.\nPhoenix:\n(Now I've seen everything...)\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I was working that night too, doing my job, minding my own business. So it's not like I had time to waste standing around here the whole night.\nMemories of Corrida\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about Mr. Corrida.\nOldbag:\nHe was the most popular star, you know... Especially where it counts -- in my book!\nPhoenix:\nBut I heard that he was lagging behind in the polls against Mr. Engarde...\nOldbag:\nUm, w-well, that's just a recent thing. Bad luck and all that, you know. But! He was going to become an even bigger star than he used to be! Look! Just look at this mountain of presents! It's a show of the mountain of feelings all his fans had for him!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, the mountain is pretty big, and certainly nothing to shake a stick at.\nPearl:\n...Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nHm? What is it, Pearls?\nPearl:\nThe presents. They're all bears... right?\nPhoenix:\n(She's got a point... There isn't a single thing here that isn't a bear...)\nPresents (appears after \"Memories of Corrida\")\nPhoenix:\nAll of Mr. Corrida's presents from his fans seem to be... bears...\nOldbag:\nOh, that's because you can't think of Juan without thinking about bears!\nPearl:\nBears...? Why bears?\nOldbag:\nYou don't know!? When my dear Juan was training, he fought barehanded with a bear. He refused to give in and let the bear win, but after the fight, they became friends.\nPearl:\nWow... What a heartwarming story.\nOldbag:\nLook, it's just like in those young people's dramas. I can see those two tuckered out, down by a river going, \"Heh... You... You sure can fight...\" \"You too, bub. You too.\"\nPhoenix:\nD-Did all that really happen?\nOldbag:\nIt's in his biography, bub.\nPhoenix:\n(What a load of crock!)\nOldbag:\nSo ever since then, fans have been giving him bears as presents.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Nice... Bears...\nAfter clearing all Talk options and visiting Living Room:\n*GROOOOOOOOOOWL!* I'm Uncle Bear, and I say it's \"bearly\" 8 o'clock!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What is that infernal racket!?\nOldbag:\nIt's one of the presents going off. Sounds like it's already 8 PM. Way past your bedtime!\nPhoenix:\nUrk... That startled me! I thought I was going to die for a second...\nPearl:\nEight PM... That's the time when the award ceremony ended that night, remember?\nPhoenix:\n(Time sure flies... Hard to believe it's been two days since the ceremony...)\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\n(The transceiver!)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nHello!? Hello!?\n???:\n...This is not a phone.\nPhoenix:\nMaya! How is Maya!? You haven't hurt her, have you!?\n???:\n...It seems you were not able to fulfill your end of the bargain, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [...It seems you were not able to fulfill your end of the bargain, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n...!\n???:\nI have heard the news. So it would seem my present did you no good...\nPearl:\nN-Noooo! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaa!\nPhoenix:\nOne more day! Please! All I ask is for one more day! I... I'll get a not guilty verdict for sure this time! Please...\n???:\n... I suppose if I must. I need that acquittal more than anything else, after all.\nPhoenix:\n...Please... Please let Maya say something! I want to hear she's alright!\n???:\nAlright... hissssss... then... hisssssss... ssssssssss... ssss... a little... sssssss...\nPhoenix:\n(What is with this static all of a sudden...!) Hello!? Hello!?\n???:\nIt seems... ssssss... hisss... sssss... bad... sssssss... hisssssssssss... ssssssssss... connect...sssssssssssss...\nPhoenix:\n(Dammit! Did the transceiver just suddenly break...!?)\n???:\nssssssssss... 'll excuse me... hisssssssssssssssss...\n...*beep*...\nPearl:\nWh-What happened...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know. All of a sudden, it became nothing but static.\nPearl:\nAaaah... Mystic Maya! Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\n(Why did the transceiver suddenly break like that...? I should probably have an electronics expert look at it... The sooner the better!)\nMarch 22Wright & Co. Law Offices\nGumshoe:\nHey! Welcome back, pal! I thought I'd make you a little something for dinner.\nPhoenix:\nTh...That's nice... Thanks.\nGumshoe:\nA rich-man's luxurious full course meal... out of a can, that is... (Changed from [It's a rich-man's luxurious full course meal... out of a can, that is...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry you went through all the trouble to cook, but I don't have the time to eat.\nGumshoe:\nOops... Looks like you don't have a can opener, pal. (Changed from [Oh, hey... You don't have a can opener here, pal.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(You've got to be kidding... And here I thought he had already whipped something up.)\nGumshoe:\nOh, I know! There is one way I know how to be helpful! Ask me about anything you want, pal!

So what is \"electromagnetic interference\"...?\"\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Corrida's Hotel Room)\nGumshoe:\nThe transceiver...?\nPearl:\nOh, Mr. Nick! You should ask Mr. Scruffy Detective about that thing.\nGumshoe:\nWhat thing?\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah! This thing just up and broke all of a sudden!\nGumshoe:\nIt... It broke, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWhen I was talking to the kidnapper, it just suddenly broke into static... Look, it sounded like this.\n...*beep*...\nGumshoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nI don't hear any static, pal.\nPhoenix:\nH-Huh??\nPearl:\nMaybe it fixed itself?\nPhoenix:\nThat's strange... I'm sure it was making a loud static noise.\nGumshoe:\nHmm... Maybe...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe what?\nGumshoe:\nMaybe it was \"electromagnetic interference\", pal.\nPhoenix:\n\"Electromagnetic interference\"?\nPicture Card\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah! Do you know about this card?\nGumshoe:\nCard?\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth, for some reason, went pale the instant he saw this card.\nGumshoe:\nHey, I know what this is, pal!\nPhoenix:\nYou do?\nGumshoe:\nNo matter what way you look at it, I'd say it's a picture of a shell.\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm, that's it?\nGumshoe:\nOh yeah! That's right! Mr. Edgeworth really likes those cooked snail things. Um, what are they called again...? \"Escargot\" or something like that...?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I think we just solved the mystery of why Mr. Edgeworth's face turned pale, right!?\nPhoenix:\n(As I suspected, Gumshoe has no clue...)\nPhoenix:\nUm... So what is \"electromagnetic interference\"...?\nGumshoe:\nIt's something that happens when a radio wave gets mixed up with another signal, pal.\nPhoenix:\nOh, when you put it that way...\nPearl:\nI don't understand what you're talking about...\nGumshoe:\nLike for example, when a cell phone goes off next to a computer screen, the stuff on the screen gets kinda fuzzy and starts acting funny, right?\nPearl:\nHuh? ...\"Kom-pu-ter\"?\nGumshoe:\n... Um, it's like when you use the dryer next to the TV, and the screen starts looking weird.\nPearl:\nO-Oh, yes, the TV does do that! Hmm... Oh, so that's what you're talking about!\nPhoenix:\n(She seems amazingly happy at being able to understand this...)\nGumshoe:\nSo the room you were in when that interference to the transceiver happened... There's gotta be something there that's sending out very strong radio waves, pal! Something like... Hmm... Like a listening device or something.\nPhoenix:\nAh!\nGumshoe:\nHey, speaking of that! Where were you when it happened?\nPearl:\nWe were in Mr. Corrida's room... The scene of the murder!\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? That's it! I'm going to sneak into the precinct and get a bug sweeper! I'll meet you at the crime scene later, alright pal!?\nPhoenix:\nAh, wait! Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nOh yeah, baby! It's investigating time! I'm on fire, pal! My fingers are itching to go! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah!\nPearl:\nWe should be going too, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nAlright, let's go!\nExamine\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk.

You're finally here, pal!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry to keep you waiting.\nPearl:\nDo you have the... um... \"bug sweeper\"?\nGumshoe:\nUm, well, you see... I got busted trying to sneak in, pal. Then suddenly, I'm staring at the precinct doors. ...From the outside, I mean. So yeah... I couldn't get one of the police bug sweepers...\nPhoenix:\n... What do you mean you couldn't get it!? We need that item!\nGumshoe:\nHey, hey, calm down, pal. I didn't say I didn't get one, just not the police's.\nPearl:\nWow... So this is a \"bug sweeper\"...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks a little... broken.\nGumshoe:\nHey, this was made when I was in elementary school, pal.\nPhoenix:\nOh? By who?\nGumshoe:\nMe, of course! Ah, seeing this sure brings back memories...\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nHey, don't look down on it, pal! Sure, it looks a little beat up... (Changed from [Hey, don't look down on it, pal! Sure, it looks a little run down...] in the original release) But I put my heart and soul into building this puppy here!\nPearl:\nYour heart and soul...?\nGumshoe:\nIt'll work! Trust me, pal, it'll do the job! But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nBut you can't set the sensitivity... So it's going to beep at anything that gives off electromagnetic waves.\nPearl:\nBut isn't it better that way?\nGumshoe:\nOh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho! Well, anyway, since I brought it all this way, might as well give it a whirl, right pal?\nPhoenix:\n(I'm getting that sinking feeling again...)\nGumshoe:\nOK, now I'll tell you how to use this baby! There's a listening device or some other sort of bug hidden in this room, pal.\nPearl:\nSo we're going to find it, right?\nGumshoe:\nRight. Now, first, let's turn the sweeper on. Next, move the sweeper around to give the room a real thorough lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the sweeper and take a real good look around the room with it, pal.] in the original release) The sweeper'll let you know how strong of a signal it's picking up, so keep an eye on it, OK? (Changed from [You can see how strong the radio waves are in an area by looking at the CHECK gauge.] in the original release) Once you find something that's giving off a lot of radio waves...

(Changed from [And when that happens, touch the gauge to really give the thing a long hard stare.] in the original release) There's a lot of things here that's going to give off radio waves, so let's take a good look at anything and everything that seems suspicious, OK pal!? Alright! I'm going to go stand outside and keep an eye out. Give me a yell if you find the bug. Got it, pal!?\nBug sweeper\nCalculator\nPhoenix:\nIt's a plain old calculator.\nPearl:\nIt says \"50\" on it. Maybe he was calculating his allowance?\nPhoenix:\n(A whole 50 cents?? Um, maybe if he was a spirit medium...)\nDryer\nPhoenix:\nAnd here we have a dryer... Nothing unusual here, I think.\nPearl:\nA dryer...? Oh! if you use it next to a TV, it'll make the screen look all weird right?\nPhoenix:\n...Y-Yeah.\nPearl:\nAnd when that happens, it's called \"electromagnetic interference\", right!?\nPhoenix:\nHey, good memory Pearls!\nPearl:\nI will never forget it for the rest of my life!\nClock bear\nPhoenix:\nWell, it certainly looks like an alarm clock.\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong? Why do you look troubled?\nPhoenix:\nI just can't imagine the listening device being inside this alarm clock. It just, um, sort of reminded me of something that happened a long time ago...\nPearl:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\nWell, anyway, it looks like the listening device isn't in here.\nBox next to clock bear\nPearl:\nWow, there's a really delicious loaf of bread in here!\nPhoenix:\nLooks like it's been on \"keep warm\" all this time since the murder.\nPearl:\nWell, Mr. Scruffy Detective always says, \"Got to keep the trail and crime scene warm.\"\nPhoenix:\n(I think the \"keep warm\" in that case is a little more metaphorical...)\nVideo camera\nPearl:\nWhat's this?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a small video camera. ...No listening device in this gizmo.\nPearl:\nEveryone's trying to make everything smaller and smaller lately, aren't they Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what it seems like.\nPearl:\nBut! I want to grow bigger and bigger!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, eating only vegetables isn't going to help you there. You have to eat meat too...)\nRemote control\nPhoenix:\nIt's the TV's remote control. But it doesn't look like the listening device is in here.\nPearl:\nUm, so I was thinking... I wonder if a TV remote works on other things... Like... Could I make you change your expressions like TV channels? Zap!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey! (Hmm, but if I could... Ooh, the people I would give the ol' mute button to!) Well, I don't think it's going to work on me... Why don't we try it on Maya tomorrow, OK?\nPearl:\n... OK!\nLaptop\nPhoenix:\nThere's no listening device in that notebook computer, huh.\nPearl:\nUmm... What's a \"notebook computer\"...?\nPhoenix:\n... Do you know what a \"notebook\" is?\nPearl:\nYes! It's a small book with paper that you can write on! ...So?\nPhoenix:\nWell, that thing is like a notebook in a way. It's basically a small laptop.\nPearl:\nUmm... Mr. Nick... What's a \"laptop\"...?\nRefrigerator\nPearl:\nThis is a... a refrigerator, right?\nPhoenix:\nI really don't think the listening device is in something like this.\nPearl:\nBecause it's filled with nothing but healty vegetable juices, right!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah, sure. (What does that have to do with listening devices?)\nCoffee pot\nPearl:\nWhat's this? It sort of looks like a hot water pot, but...\nPhoenix:\nOh, well, it's kind of like a hot water pot, I guess. But instead of hot water, coffee comes out.\nPearl:\nReally!? Th-This pot can do that!? ... Um, is there a pot that orange juice comes out of...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't think there's anything like that, Pearls. Sorry.\nWater pot\nPearl:\nOh, the water in this hot water pot has run out! I'll go get more water for it!\nPhoenix:\nO-OK. Sounds good. (Looks like she's forgotten all about looking for the listening device...)\nLarge bear near coffee machine\nLeads to:\n\"This is... This is just a giant stuffed teddy bear, right?\"\nAir conditioner\nPhoenix:\nWell, the listening device isn't in the air conditioner.\nPearl:\nAah! Yuck! This air filter is covered in dust and dirt...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nPearl:\n... Come on, Mr. Nick! Let's wash it!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if being a neat freak makes even the tiniest dust bunny look colossal...?)\nPearl:\n...What?\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh, nothing.\nTV\nPhoenix:\nI don't really think the listening device is in the TV of all places.\nPearl:\nLooks like the TV was left on, and it's now showing an old samurai movie.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. This channel plays all sorts of international movies, as well as domestic ones.\nPearl:\nYou know, every time I watch one of these old movies, I always think, \"Wow, these Japanese stars are really good at English!\"\nPhoenix:\n...Um, yeah.\nPearl:\nWhen I grow up, I want to study Japanese!\nPhoenix:\n(I should probably keep my mouth shut here, and not destroy her dream...)\nLamps\nPhoenix:\nLamp, check. Listening device... nope.\nPearl:\nThere are a lot of lamps in this room, aren't there Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPearl:\nAnd they're all on. You shouldn't do that, Mr. Nick. Don't you know that's wasteful?\nPhoenix:\n...Ah, yeah... I'll be more conscientious from now on. Sorry.\nCell phone\nPhoenix:\nA cell phone... Nope, no bugs in here.\nPearl:\nA \"cell phone\"...?\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!? Don't tell me you don't know what a cell phone is!\nPearl:\n...I'm sorry. I've never seen one before...\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, my cell phone couldn't get any reception while I was staying in Kurain Village... And Pearls has never lived outside of that village, so... Well, I guess I can't say it's impossible to live without one...)\nLandline phone\nPhoenix:\nWell, the phone is the most common place for a \"listening device\", I'd say. But, let's take the receiver apart first before we get ahead of ourselves here.\nPearl:\nWow, you know a lot about electronics, don't you Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know tons. Especially when it comes to taking them apart. It's my specialty. (I'll leave the fixing part up to Gumshoe...)\nPearl:\nSo...? Is there a \"listening device\" in there?\nPhoenix:\n...No. (And I really thought it had to be in the phone too...)\nBear between the two sofas\nPearl:\nAh, what a lovely bear...\n*GROOOOOOOOOOOOWL!*\nPearl:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!\nPhoenix:\nAh, this must be one of those fancy bear-shaped toy robots.\nPearl:\nI-It's a robot!? It's a REAL robot!?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, it's a real one.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nPearl:\nH-How many horse-powers is it? How many horsies!?\nPhoenix:\nHorsies...? ...\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well, look, it's a bear, so... uh...\nPearl:\nUm...\nRadio\nPearl:\nThe radio is on and playing something. Oh! It's \"Kids' Question Corner\"!\n\"Professor! Professor! Why is the Earth round?\"\nPearl:\n... Yes, why is it, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n... Why don't you listen to the radio program a little more, Pearls?\nPearl:\nThis is... This is just a giant stuffed teddy bear, right? It's the biggest one I have ever seen!\nGumshoe:\nHey! So did you guys find it yet? The listening device, I mean...\nPearl:\nNo, not yet. But this bear's eye is...\nGumshoe:\nLet's see, let's see... A perfectly normal stuffed bear with some really strong radio waves... Sounds like you found the device to me, pal. Let's dig this big fella's eye out and see what we've got.\nPearl:\nN-No! You can't! Such... Such a violent act...\nGumshoe:\nOomph! *rip!*\nPearl:\nNoooooooooo!\nGumshoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's!\nGumshoe:\nIt's a miniature camera... And it looks like there's more. There's a... transmitter, and a timer.\nPhoenix:\nA whattawhatta-mitter?\nGumshoe:\nA transmitter, pal.\nPearl:\nOh... Is this more of that \"high tech\" stuff...?\nTalk\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nSo this tiny thing is a camera...?\nGumshoe:\nYup. It's a pinhole CCD camera, pal. It's a small, high-grade video camera mostly used in security systems.\nPhoenix:\nSo it's a video camera...\nGumshoe:\nIt runs on a battery, which comes with it in a set.\nPhoenix:\nBut... there's no video tape in this camera...\nGumshoe:\nThis is only the camera part here, pal. The tape recorder with the tape inside it is somewhere else.\nPearl:\nSomewhere else?\nGumshoe:\nThe footage is changed into radio waves and then it's sent to that recorder.\nPearl:\nSo... It's sort of like a TV broadcast, isn't it?\nGumshoe:\nHey, you know, you're right!\nSpy Camera added to the Court Record.\nCamera (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo this tiny thing is a camera...?\nGumshoe:\nYup.

It's like a video version of a listening device, pal.\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's attached to a small, clock-like thing...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that's a timer, pal. You can set it to turn the camera on and record at a certain time with it.\nPearl:\nYou can set it for a certain time...?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Let's see... This looks like it was set to start at 8 PM and go for one hour.\nPhoenix:\nEight PM? (That was the time the award ceremony ended!)\nGumshoe:\nThere's no date set, so it's been recording every night, I'd guess.\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Detective! How long has this bear been here...?\nGumshoe:\nUm, I'm pretty sure it's been here since the night of the murder.\nPearl:\nThen... Then maybe...\nGumshoe:\nMaybe this camera caught the murder on tape!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nGumshoe:\nAnd if you think about the angle the bear is at... It's bound to have had a clear shot of the whole crime, pal!\nTransmitter added to the Court Record.\nTransmitter (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo... what is a \"transmitter\"?\nGumshoe:\nIt's a device that sends footage the camera took to a specific destination.

It's bound to have had a clear shot of the whole crime, pal!\nStuffed bear\nPearl:\nSo there was a camera... in this bear's eye...\nPhoenix:\nAnd it was disguised as a present.\nGumshoe:\nAnd I'm sure it was here on the night of the murder, pal. It's pretty big, so it stands out pretty well in my mind.\nPhoenix:\nBut... who gave Mr. Corrida this present?\nGumshoe:\nI, ah, don't know, pal. But! This means that someone out there's got a video of what happened here that night!\nPearl:\nIsn't there any way we can find out who that person is?\nGumshoe:\nIt's impossible, pal. Radio waves can be sent almost anywhere, so there's no real way to find out...\nPearl:\nOh... *sniffle*\nPhoenix:\n(Is there really no way to find out...?)\nStuffed Bear added to the Court Record.\nStuffed bear (subsequent times)\nPearl:\nSo there was a camera... in this bear's eye...\nPhoenix:\nAnd it was disguised as a present.\nGumshoe:\nAnd I'm sure it was here on the night of the murder, pal.

Ho ho ho ho! Oh, that's great. But you know, no matter how strange I may seem, at least my jokes don't make you cringe. Right, pal?\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... Yeah, you keep on thinking that...)\nSpy Camera\nPearl:\nIt's a really tiiiiny camera.\nGumshoe:\nA camera this size lasts about 3 hours with a fresh battery pack, pal.\nPhoenix:\nBut what would something like this be doing in...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'd say taking a secret video of the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(Which means... Someone knew there was going to be a murder here!)\nTransmitter\nGumshoe:\nThis device looks like it was made by the criminal themselves. If it's only sending images, then I'd say it'd last about 80 hours, pal.\nPearl:\nYou know a lot about these things, don't you Mr. Detective? Is spying on people a hobby of yours...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, no... I mean... You're making me embarrassed, putting me on the spot like this.\nPhoenix:\n(Why should he be embarrassed? Is there something I'm not getting here...?)\nStuffed Bear\nPearl:\nThe bear is really lovely, isn't it? It's so soft and fuzzy, and the face is really well-made...\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess when you compare it to all the other presents, it is well-made.)\nGumshoe:\nYeah, but I don't think the bear itself is a clue to this case at all.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nGumshoe:\n... ...I got it!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal. Let me borrow this mini camera for a bit!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you going to do?\nGumshoe:\nI'm going to go around to the electronic shops and see if I can find out who bought this!\nPhoenix:\nB-But that's impossible! I mean, it's already 9 PM!\nGumshoe:\nLeave it to me! Even if I have to search all night, I'll find your man, pal!\nSpy Camera and Transmitter given to Detective Gumshoe.\nGumshoe:\nOh yeah, baby! It's investigating time! I'm on fire, pal! My fingers are itching to go! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah!\nPearl:\n...He's gone.\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah.\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Scruffy Detective sure is a nice man. He's pushing himself so hard, all for Mystic Maya's sake...\n???:\nIt's a mystery how you always manage to do things in the most inefficient ways, Wright. (Changed from [...You always manage to do things in the most ineffective ways.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Ack!)\nEdgeworth:\nYou'll have to excuse me. I heard your conversation just now.\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth! What are you doing here!?\nEdgeworth:\nA rescue team has been created and deployed. I can't say I'm optimistic... but we have to move forward, one step at a time.\nPhoenix:\nI-I see... Thanks.\nEdgeworth:\nDon't thank me yet. We still have to find her.\nPearl:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... So, there was a spy camera hidden inside this stuffed animal, huh? You are one lucky man, Wright.\nPhoenix:\n?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know this stuffed bear, little girl?\nPearl:\nUm... I have no idea!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... Of course not. The maker of this bear is a very expensive, luxury brand from overseas. It's completely hand-made, and only a small number of these are exported here. (Changed from [It's completely hand-made and there are very few that are exported here.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nWh-What?\nEdgeworth:\nThe camera and transmitter that scatterbrained detective took with him are dead ends. Things like those can be bought anywhere... However, this bear is different. By tracking how it got into this country, this bear can tell us who the buyer is.\nPearl:\nC-Can you really do that!? Mr. Nick, can he really?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, I guess so...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... It's 9 PM. I think I can still make it in time.\nPhoenix:\n?\nEdgeworth:\nI'll be taking this for now. I'm sure you have other things you have to do.\nStuffed Bear snatched up by Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nSee you soon, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you doing this...?\nEdgeworth:\n... I have no interest in explaining myself to someone who cannot comprehend. But besides that, Wright. Until court reconvenes tomorrow, you should concern yourself with this question: \"Who was the person that murdered Juan Corrida?\"\nPhoenix:\nThe \"real killer\"...\nEdgeworth:\nDo you really still think it was Adrian Andrews?\nPhoenix:\nTo be honest... I don't know anymore.\nEdgeworth:\n... You still have a little time left... Find the truth, Wright. Everything begins with the truth.\nPhoenix:\n(Juan Corrida's real killer... Ms. Andrews' past... The kidnapper whose sole condition is an acquittal for Mr. Engarde... And... this card. Shelly de Killer...) ...Maya. The only way I can save you now, is to find all the answers to this case tonight! I don't understand what your real intentions are, Edgeworth... but as you said, all I can do for now is find the truth!\nTo be continued.\nMarch 22, 9:14 PMGatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nIt's past 9:00 PM already, isn't it? I wonder... I wonder if Mr. Edgeworth has already found Mystic Maya...?\nPhoenix:\n(These things take time. I'd say probably not...) The police are professionals, Pearls. They'll find her, so don't you worry. And if we can win a not guilty verdict tomorrow... then everything will be OK.\nPearl:\nY-You're right... ...\nTalk\nThe real killer\nPhoenix:\nSo the real person who killed Mr. Corrida was...\nPearl:\nThat assassin... Mr. Shelly de Killer, right?\nPhoenix:\nAnd the card Ms. Andrews found at the crime scene seems to be proof of that. But if that's the case, then a new question comes to mind. Who was the one that hired De Killer to begin with? Who is his client?\nPearl:\nYou mean... Who asked for the murder...?\nPhoenix:\nThat person didn't want to dirty their own hands in blood, but whoever this client is, they're still a killer.\nPearl:\n...\nThe assassin's client\nPearl:\nWho... Who could have hired the assassin? Do you think it was Ms. Andrews...?\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder... But if she was the client... then why go through the effort to stab the knife into the corpse herself...?)\nPearl:\nBut if Ms. Andrews wasn't the client... Then... No, it can't be...\nPhoenix:\n(...Matt Engarde himself...?)\nWas it Matt? (appears after \"The real killer\" and \"The assassin's client\")\nPearl:\nIf Mr. Engarde really did hire the assassin...\nPhoenix:\nThen he is not innocent at all. Far from it, he would be guilty of the crime.\nPearl:\nB-But it can't be Mr. Engarde, right!? I mean, when we first talked with him...\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Did you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?\nEngarde:\n... Alright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't see any Psyche-Locks at that time... Actually... That reminds me...)\nPearl:\nDid you remember something, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, something Ms. Andrews said at the trial today. She said something interesting.\nSomething interesting (appears after \"Was it Matt?\")\nPearl:\nUm... So what is this \"interesting thing\"?\nPhoenix:\nOh, that's right. You didn't hear it, did you Pearls?\nAndrews:\nJuan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway.\nAndrews:\nIt looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde's \"secret\"...!? Wh-What is this secret...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know yet. But for now, let's think about it this way. Mr. Corrida was going to reveal this \"secret\". That means... Mr. Engarde had plenty of motive to have Mr. Corrida silenced. ... (Which means we have to meet with Mr. Engarde. There's no way around it now.)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPearl:\nI... I believe in your lawyer powers, Mr. Nick. I know you can bring us a miracle.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm guessing by \"miracle\", she means a not guilty verdict... And she wouldn't be wrong either. It will take a miracle to pull this one off.)\nRadio Transceiver\nPearl:\nWhy... Why did the kidnapper have to take Mystic Maya...? Why couldn't he have taken me instead!?\nPhoenix:\nStop it, Pearls! Don't say things like that! If that had happened, then Maya would be hurting, I'm sure of it. Just like how you are hurting now, Pearls.\nPearl:\nY-You're right...\nMaya Fey profile\nPearl:\nOne more day...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... If we can bring the trial to its end, she'll be back. Don't worry.\nPearl:\nI decided I won't cry anymore, Mr. Nick. You're so brave and holding strong for Mystic Maya, so I have to do the same.\nPearl Fey profile\nPearl:\nIf only I had studied harder during my training... I could be a bigger help to you, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nAh, don't worry about it. Really. Pearls, you're doing a great job...\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Is there a waterfall around here!? I feel that I must be made new under the rushing spring waters!\nPhoenix:\nSorry, Pearls... The only body of water around here is a lake.\nPearl:\nOh... Thanks anyway...\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPearl:\nThis is the first time I've ever met someone who loves to eat instant noodles.\nPhoenix:\n(Something tells me Gumshoe isn't eating them because he genuinely likes them, but...)\nPearl:\nHe's working so hard, all for Mystic Maya's sake... I'm going to get him lots and lots of instant noodles as a thank your present!\nJuan Corrida profile\nPearl:\nUm... Is it really that important to be the Master of all the Stars? So important that you try to find your friends' weaknesses, and then expose them...?\nPhoenix:\nI... I wouldn't know...\nMatt Engarde profile\nPearl:\nI-Is it really alright for us to trust him? This person... Mr. Engarde...?\nPhoenix:\n... (I-I don't know... I can't even answer that for myself. We have to go see him one more time! That's the only way to know for sure!)\nSecurity Lady profile\nPearl:\nUm... I was wondering if that old lady is really a person from Earth. I mean, maybe she's really from waaaaaay out in outer space...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, actually, I was thinking the same exact thing. She's too strange to be from Earth.\nAdrian Andrews profile\nPearl:\nWhy did Ms. Andrews... Why did she frame Mr. Engarde, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(She has some sort of grudge against Mr. Engarde... But why is that? That's something we still have to figure out...) Let's go ask her, OK?\nCeleste Inpax profile\nPearl:\nThis person was Ms. Andrews' mentor... And she... killed herself, right?\nPhoenix:\n(Right. And Mr. Corrida hid Ms. Inpax's suicide note... So to get it back, Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... But the thing is, where is that suicide note now?)\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelHallway\nPearl:\nWow, it's really getting late, isn't it Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. It's past 9:00 PM already. But we still have some things to prepare for tomorrow's trial. (There's still the matter of this \"secret\" Mr. Corrida held about Mr. Engarde... And Ms. Andrews' real intentions. These are two things I must know tonight!)\nPearl:\nBut aren't visiting hours over at the detention center?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I'm sure we'll think of something, Pearls. Don't you worry.\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nOldbag:\n...\nPhoenix:\nHey! Wait!\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, whippersnapper!? All I know is nothing that has anything to do with you is ever good! Like just now. I was handed this strange device for who knows what reason. And I was told to use it to search the whole hotel.\nPhoenix:\nThat's... the bug sweeper, isn't it? (The one Gumshoe made...)\nOldbag:\nI don't know and frankly, I don't care. But the request came from Edgey-poo, so...\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth...?\nOldbag:\nAnd he said,\nEdgeworth:\n\"If you feel angry, direct your anger at that unsophisticated lawyer.\"\nOldbag:\nSo, I'm going to feel free to direct all my anger towards you!\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... Gee, thanks a bundle, Edgeworth! What a pal you are!)\nExamine\nTables at back\nPhoenix:\nThey haven't cleaned up all the food yet.\nOldbag:\nDon't you touch it without permission! I brought a lunch box today, so I could pack it.\nPearl:\nUm... But... Hasn't the food been out for two days already?\nOldbag:\nWhen it's in your stomach, it's all the same!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, the digestive powers of an alien are wondrous...)\nFront table\nPearl:\nI want to eat a meal with Mystic Maya again...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, me too...\nPearl:\nWhenever I watch Mystic Maya eat like she does... It makes me happy about eating, and then I can eat a lot.\nPhoenix:\nWell, then... How about after we wrap up this case, we all go out for a huge twenty-course feast!\nOldbag:\nMy mind's like a steel trap, so I'm going to hold you to that!\nPhoenix:\n(I was NOT talking to you!)\nTalk\nBug sweeper\nOldbag:\nThis is absolutely top secret, so you had better keep it to yourselves! I heard they found a spy camera hidden in one of the presents!\nPhoenix:\nHmm, very interesting.\nOldbag:\nI'm sure it was... you know... It was to catch poor Juan in the middle of a scandalous \"meeting\"!\nPearl:\n\"Scandalous\"...? What's that?\nOldbag:\nIt means... Well, you know, that gossip that's been going around about my dear Juan.\nPhoenix:\nOh... You mean that thing about Ms. Andrews. (But I'm sure she must've had some reason for getting close to Mr. Corrida...)\nOldbag:\nI'll let you in on another secret, young'un. I know who planted that spy camera! It was that obnoxious, puffy-haired photographer girl! The nerve of some people! Spying on people by herself! As if I wouldn't want to see it for myself too!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow! The alien actually admitted her true intentions for a change!)\nOldbag:\nI don't know what you're thinking exactly, but I can bet that it's nothing good!!\nPhoenix:\n(But I didn't say anything...)\nJuan and Adrian\nOldbag:\nSo you want to know about Juan and that manager, right? Actually, as I hear it, they were something of a refreshing pair, those two.\nPhoenix:\nOh?\nOldbag:\nI tell you, Juan really welcomed that manager with open arms, I heard.\nPearl:\nThat \"manager\"...? Who are you talking about?\nOldbag:\nYou don't know? That manager woman Juan had. It's a shame she killed herself, though...\nPhoenix:\nOh, you're talking about Ms. Celeste Inpax... Ms. Andrews' mentor, right?\nOldbag:\nYes, yes, that's the one! That Celeste girl. She was supposed to get married, you know.\nPhoenix:\nM-Married? You mean... to Mr. Corrida?\nOldbag:\n*sigh* Really, you young kids today don't know anything, do you? That girl Celeste killed herself three days after their marriage announcement!\nPhoenix:\n(Three days after their marriage announcement!? What in the...!?)\nCeleste's suicide (appears after \"Juan and Adrian\")\nPearl:\nWhy would Ms. Inpax want to kill herself!? She was going to get married!\nOldbag:\nWell, that's because... she was thrown away, you see, by Juan.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nPearl:\nB-But... They were going to get married, right? They promised each other, right?\nOldbag:\nThey held a grand announcement session... But... Three days later... Juan suddenly cancelled their marriage.\nPhoenix:\nI-Is that true?\nOldbag:\nIt was in the weekly magazines.\nPearl:\nB-But why!? Why did he do that!?\nOldbag:\nThat was not in the magazines, unfortunately.\nPhoenix:\n...I see.\nOldbag:\nThat night after Juan called off the wedding, that manager, Celeste, killed herself.\nPhoenix:\nHow terrible...\nPearl:\nI wonder what happened between those two...?\nMarch 22Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPhoenix:\nOn that night, there must've been at least a few hundred people here. Hmm... I guess the police are done with their questioning and investigating. It looks like things here in the lobby have finally calmed down.\nExamine\nSecond floor\nPhoenix:\nA lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. When the murder happened, it was abuzz with people running back and forth... But now since things have quieted down, it actually feels more eerie than before.\nMarch 22Engarde MansionLiving Room\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like no one is around...\nPearl:\nUm, what happened to that person with the stuffed teddy face...?\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, she must mean that butler with the stitches in his face.)\nPearl:\nShoooooe!\nShoe:\nMeow.\nPearl:\nOh, there you are. I guess you're still awake, huh Shoe?\nShoe:\nMeow.\nPearl:\nHee hee, come on, let's play.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that butler, Mr. Doe, is already asleep or not...)\nMarch 22Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPearl:\nIt doesn't look like Mr. Scruffy Detective is here.\nPhoenix:\nWell, he's out there with that camera asking around at all the electronic stores.\nPearl:\nThen, I'll make some salad for him for dinner.\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like Pearls really appreciates what Gumshoe is doing for us...)\nPearl:\n...Um, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nHm? Yes?\nPearl:\nWhere is the lettuce?\nPhoenix:\n...I don't think I've ever bought lettuce before.\nPearl:\n... Aww, I guess I have to give up on making a salad, then.\nPhoenix:\n(Guess the lack of lettuce is kind of a problem.)\nExamine\nCharley the plant\nPearl:\nOh! I'll water it!\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK... Gumshoe already gave it more than plenty earlier...\nPearl:\n...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...)\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh, I'll wipe it some more and make it super shiny! ...The wiping cloth... Where are you, Mr. wiping cloth...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's fine. Really. If you wipe it any more, it'll be so shiny I'll be using it as a mirror.\nMarch 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nVisiting hours ended a few hours ago. Looks like we're not going to get a chance to talk with Mr. Engarde tonight...\nPearl:\nB-But... Isn't what we have to ask very important?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, but I don't think that matters to the guard...)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nVisiting hours ended hours ago, so what's the camera watching over now?\nPearl:\nMaybe it's watching the Mr. Policeman who's standing over there.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think that's it...)\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nVisiting hours ended hours ago, so what's he watching over now?\nPearl:\nMaybe he did something bad and he's standing there as punishment.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think that's it...)\nMarch 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nPearl:\nIt feels sort of tense in here, doesn't it Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it does. I wonder if something happened...?)\nChief:\nYou're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, right?\nPhoenix:\nAh, yes sir.\nChief:\nWell, we've finally found just the person we've been looking for. A real decisive witness.\nPhoenix:\nA \"decisive witness\"? You mean for Mr. Engarde's case?\nChief:\nWe're taking the witness's statement right now. Gotta hand it to Mr. Edgeworth.\nPhoenix:\n(What's Edgeworth up to now...?)\nPearl:\nWh-Who is this witness?\nChief:\nI think you know this person quite well, Mr. Lawyer.\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(Between the kidnapper's demand and now this... I can't see any way to win here!)\nChief:\nOh, yeah... Mr. Edgeworth wanted me to tell you something.\nPhoenix:\nHe did?\nChief:\nEven though visiting hours are long over at the detention center, he wanted me to grant you special permission, so there you go.\nPearl:\nWhat!? (Changed from [Eh!?] in the original release)\nChief:\nI've already called them so they know. Go on, go talk to your heart's content.\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much.\nPearl:\nThis is such good news, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Go talk to your heart's content\"? It sounds like the police are pretty sure they have tomorrow's trial in the bag.)\nExamine\nDetective on left\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.\nDetective:\n\"It seems as though my true face has been revealed... I was an elite businessman who made deals with the entire world! I was the young successor and CEO of a colossal corporate conglomeration! But my real self is that of a regular everyday policeman!\"\nPhoenix:\n... Stop doing image training, and get yourself out there in the field!!\nChief\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.\nChief:\nWhaaat!? \"The real killer in the Corrida murder is an assassin...\"!? This must be someone's idea of a joke. I can't believe this garbage!\nPhoenix:\n(Have a little more faith in your own subordinates!)\nBlue Badger\nChief:\nThis mascot here is the \"Blue Badger\". I made him, you know. I'm finally gonna show him off to the Chief of Police tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nWow, that's really something.\nChief:\nYou have no idea how much time and effort I invested into him to get this far... But my hopes for this little guy go far beyond just this precinct, yessiree. I'll get him deployed to every precinct in the nation. Just you wait.\nPearl:\nI wish you luck, sir.\nAfter clearing \"Something interesting\" Talk option in Gatewater Hotel - Corrida's Hotel Room, clearing \"Celeste's suicide\" Talk option in Gatewater Hotel - Hotel Lobby, and visiting Criminal Affairs Dept.:\nMarch 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure they must have transferred Ms. Andrews here by now... So that means that both Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews are in this detention center. Now then, whose story do I want to hear?)\nMatt Engarde\nEngarde:\nDude! It's Mr. Wright! I hope you can get me off the hook tomorrow. I'm counting on you!\nPhoenix:\nI... hope so too... (Edgeworth just dropped a bombshell on me by saying... (Changed from [Edgeworth just dropped a bombshell on me and said...] in the original release) that Juan Corrida was killed by an assassin, and that the assassin's client is... (Changed from [that Juan Corrida was killed by an assassin, and that assassin's client is...] in the original release) this man... Matt Engarde...)\nEngarde:\nWhat's wrong?\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. Engarde. There is something I must know with one hundred percent certainty.\nEngarde:\nHmm, you seem kinda different. You're totally not like your usual lawyer dude self.\nExamine\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitor's the visitor's room. He's sleeping standing up. The night's pretty long, and he probably got tired. Hmm... I hope he doesn't fall over...\nTalk\nMatt's secret\nPhoenix:\nUm, about the \"press conference\"...\nEngarde:\nYou mean the one where Juan was gonna dress up as the Nickel Samurai?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I heard a little more about it from Ms. Andrews.\nAndrews:\nIt looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nCould you please fill me in on what this \"secret\" is? Please?\n5 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(I knew this was coming...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick? D-Don't tell me...\nPhoenix:\n(Psyche-Locks...) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock...] in the original release)\nEngarde:\nYou said a \"secret\", right? But I don't have any idea what it is. Do you dude...? (Changed from [You said a 'secret', right? But you don't have any idea what it is, do you dude...?] in the original release)\nMatt's secret (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis is a very important matter! Please! You must tell me! What is this \"secret\"!?\n5 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nEngarde:\nHmm... Well... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna consult my lawyer, OK?\nPhone:\n............\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nH-Hello? This is Phoenix Wright.\nEngarde:\nOh, hey Mr. Lawyer dude. Sorry, but you know dude, you totally don't have any idea. And I really didn't care at all about what Juan was up to, OK?\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nEngarde:\nSo, it's like that.\nPhoenix:\n... (Looks like I have no choice but to remove those Psyche-Locks...)\nJuan and Adrian\nPhoenix:\nDid you know about Mr. Corrida and Ms. Andrews' relationship...?\nEngarde:\nWell, it's all over the tabloids, dude. Ah, but I don't know any of the details, if that's what you mean. Look, how many times do I have to tell you? I don't care what Juan did with his life.\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews... She had a purpose in mind when she started seeing Mr. Corrida. Her mentor was Mr. Corrida's manager... and Ms. Andrews was going to get Ms. Celeste Inpax's suicide note from him.\nEngarde:\nCeleste...\nPhoenix:\nDoes that jog any memories...?\nEngarde:\n... Dude, I suddenly just got totally hungry. You up for a pizza? My treat.\nEngarde:\n... ...\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? What's a \"pea-za\"? Is it a kind of pea, like green peas?\nPhoenix:\nLet's go eat one later, OK?\nEngarde:\n...Argh, I got cut off by the pizza dude at the shop.\nPhoenix:\nThat's too bad...\nEngarde:\nWell, how about we get our minds off of this topic and talk about something else, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde... Are you connected to Ms. Inpax's suicide in some way...?)\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\nThat Juan... Posing as someone else and trying to hold a press conference...! And the person who set it all up was Adrian, wasn't it?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what I heard.\nEngarde:\nArgh... I can't believe... Why would she do such a thing, dude!?\nRadio Transceiver\nEngarde:\nThat's a very nice transceiver, dude. I'm kind of an expert in gadgety things...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does what he just said give me a sinking feeling?)\nPearl:\n?\nGuitar Case\nEngarde:\nHis signature item was a guitar. Hah! I mean, dude, what kind of ninja carries a guitar!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, I'm not someone who would know...\nEngarde:\nDude, it's such a kid thing to do. I mean, just my opinion and all.\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't your show a kid's show too?)\nCrime Photo\nEngarde:\nHe was a bit of a talentless hack when he was alive... But who knew he could play dead so well? Wouldn't you agree?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, that's because he really IS dead!\nEngarde:\nAnd quite pitifully indeed, yes?\nJammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo\nEngarde:\nThat Adrian... I never thought she'd go this far to frame me for the crime... I mean, what does she have against me? Dude, I don't get it.\nPhoenix:\nThat's something I would like to know too. Do you have any ideas at all? Even the slightest clue?\nEngarde:\nHuh!? What!? Me!? D-Don't be silly, Mr. Lawyer dude! How am I supposed to know something like that?\nSuicide Report or Celeste Inpax profile\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. Engarde?\nEngarde:\nDude, I know I asked you to be my lawyer and all... But I don't think I have to tell you anything and everything.\nPhoenix:\nUm... What do you mean by that?\nEngarde:\nIt just means I don't have to tell you anything and everything, dude.\nPearl:\n...\nAttempted Suicide Report\nPhoenix:\nUm, about this...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! You can't!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews said she doesn't want anyone to know about that, remember?\nEngarde:\nWhat's that?\nPhoenix:\nOh, this? Um... Nothing. It's nothing, really.\nPicture Card\nPhoenix:\n(... I'm kind of scared to show him this card...)\nEngarde:\nWhat's wrong, dude?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um... So about this picture card... Have you ever seen this before?\nEngarde:\n...? Nope, never saw it before in my life, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think he's lying... Or is he...? Then again, he looked like he gasped just now... Maybe I'm seeing things...?)\nEngarde:\n?\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nIt's true we debuted at the same time... so that's why people were always comparing us. But I totally didn't care what people were saying because he wasn't even close, dude. I mean, I won every contest we ever had, hands down!\nAdrian Andrews profile\nEngarde:\nI don't get it... Why would she want to frame me...? I mean, I've never done anything to her, dude...\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde sounds pretty sincere and he seems trustworthy... So I have to find out what Ms. Andrews' real intentions are!)\nJohn Doe profile\nPhoenix:\nAbout this person...\nEngarde:\n...H-He's...\nPearl:\nHe is your butler, Mr. Doe, right? We met him at your mansion.\nEngarde:\nOh... Yes, that's right. He's a pretty cool dude who can do lots of things. He takes real good care of me.\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nCould you please take a look at this...? I know it may not seem important to you...\nEngarde:\nWell, if it's not important, then I'd rather be in bed. If I don't get my 12 hours of beauty sleep, my skin's gonna wrinkle up like a prune, dude.\nPearl:\nYou know, he's right Mr. Nick. Your skin's kind of drying up here and there.\nPhoenix:\n(I swear... After this case is over, I'm going to get lots and lots of sleep...)\nAdrian Andrews\nAndrews:\n..Oh, it's you.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry to be visiting at such a late hour. But there are a few questions I absolutely have to ask you tonight.\nAndrews:\nMe? I thought your client was Matt.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure Ms. Andrews knows something... She can't be clueless about this \"secret\" Mr. Corrida had on Mr. Engarde...)\nAndrews:\n...\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nI'd like to ask you about Matt Engarde, if you don't mind...\nAndrews:\nMr. Wright... You still don't know, do you? The real him, I mean...\nPhoenix:\n... You seem to bear a lot of resentment towards Mr. Engarde. If that's the case, then why did you become his manager? And why would you become intimate with his rival?\nAndrews:\n... That... has nothing to do with this case. Nothing.\nCeleste Inpax\nPhoenix:\nAbout Ms. Celeste Inpax...\nAndrews:\nI had finally put her death behind me... And now, thanks to you, it's all come back to the surface.\nPhoenix:\nI... I'm sorry.\nAndrews:\nYes, I was shocked by her suicide. And it's true that when I heard the rumor that Juan was the one who had hidden her suicide note, I began to draw close to him. I wanted to get her suicide note back... and to burn it.\nPhoenix:\nYou wanted to \"burn it\"? But why?\nAndrews:\nI didn't want it to spread like just another piece of gossip. But... I never held any murderous intent towards Juan. I would never do something so stupid.\nPhoenix:\n(The suicide note, huh...? I wonder what it said?)\nWhy frame him? (appears after \"Matt Engarde\" and \"Celeste Inpax\")\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you try to frame Mr. Engarde?\nAndrews:\nThat's simple. Because he's the killer, that's why. Isn't it the duty of every good citizen to inform the police?\nPearl:\nB-But... there had to be another way.\nPhoenix:\nThe police are excellent at doing their job, so they'd figure it out, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, they're so good that they couldn't figure out the real truth behind Celeste's death.\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews...\nPhoenix:\nWell, um, I know you're not the type of person to do something without a reason, so please, tell me why you did what you did...\nAndrews:\n...Revenge.\nPearl:\nHuh...? Did you say something just now...?\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nPhoenix:\n(A Psyche-Lock, huh...)\nAndrews:\nDon't you understand yet? You're not my lawyer. To be honest, you're more like my enemy.\nPearl:\nBut...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure I just heard Ms. Andrews say, \"Revenge\".)\nWhy frame him? (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you frame Mr. Engarde...?\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nAndrews:\nHmm, I wonder why...? I don't really know myself. When I realized what I was doing, I had already stabbed the knife into the body.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm almost sure that just now... Ms. Andrews muttered, \"Revenge\" to herself.)\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nAndrews:\nI was the one who organized the whole press conference. Juan wanted to deal the most damage possible to Matt's career. And that's why he was killed. It's quite simply a story of cause and effect, yes?\nMagazine Clipping\nAndrews:\nIt appears to me that rumor was started by Juan himself.\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida...? But...\nAndrews:\nI'm Matt's manager, remember. I think he wanted to embarrass Matt through his relationship with me.\nPearl:\nBut... But didn't Mr. Corrida like you...!?\nAndrews:\nThere weren't any feelings of love between us. For me, it was about getting Celeste's suicide note... For him, it was about wounding Matt's pride. That's all it was.\nPearl:\nThat's... That's...\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls is in shock. She sees just how cruel the world can really be.)\nGuitar Case\nPhoenix:\nSo there was a Nickel Samurai costume inside of this case, correct?\nAndrews:\nYes, there was. I even personally carried it here from the studio. I always thought it was such a childish thing to dress up and wear a costume like that, but I never thought that I would wind up using it myself that night.\nWine Glass\nAndrews:\nWhen I was pouring that glass of juice... I honestly had no idea that Juan was dead...\nPearl:\nI see...\nAndrews:\nI really am a terrible woman, aren't I? One moment, I'm thinking of looking after him, and the next, I'm stabbing him in the chest with a knife.\nCrime Photo\nPhoenix:\nAbout this photo...\nAndrews:\nThe person who stabbed the body and opened the guitar case was me.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that was so you could get the Nickel Samurai's costume out so you could wear it...?\nAndrews:\nI thought I had executed that part quite well. But you showed me differently. You are a formidable lawyer, Mr. Wright.\nJammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo\nAndrews:\nYou know... There was only one thought running through my head at that time. \"With this, I can finally expose Matt's true nature to the world.\"\nPhoenix:\n(His \"true nature\"...? I wonder why she's saying that, but not telling me what his true nature is? If it were me, I think I'd be happy to finally get that kind of thing off my chest.)\nSuicide Report\nAndrews:\nI don't care what the reason was... It's unforgivable that he hid Celeste's suicide note.\nPhoenix:\nBut you don't have any proof that she left a suicide note behind, right?\nAndrews:\nCeleste... She always believed there was a right way and a wrong way to do anything. She would have left a note. I... I wholly believe that.\nAttempted Suicide Report\nAndrews:\nS-Stop it! I don't want to remember the hopelessness and the despair I felt back then!\nPearl:\nHurry up and put that away, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm so sorry!\nPicture Card\nAndrews:\nIt was near Juan's dead body. I... I noticed it when I went to fill the glass. And then when I realized that Juan was dead... I completely panicked. That's when I must have unconsciously picked this card up and put it into my pocket. As for why...? I simply don't know.\nWill Powers profile\nAndrews:\nThat's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be.\nPhoenix:\n(Urk... What a horrible thing to say...)\nAndrews:\n...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright.\nJuan Corrida profile\nAndrews:\nHe is a very prideful man... Or rather, was. He absolutely had to compete with Matt in everything, no matter what it was. He really was such an idiot.\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nWell, I guess maybe all stars are like that. Never giving any thought to other people's feelings.\nMatt Engarde profile\nAndrews:\n...\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nThat things have come to this... I have nothing left to say about that man. Not one word.\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAndrews:\nI hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nCeleste Inpax profile\nAndrews:\nCeleste... was my mentor. She was a strong woman... She wouldn't kill herself over any old trifling matter...\nPearl:\nS-So... You have some ideas of why she killed herself...?\nAndrews:\nYes, I suppose...\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, I'd like to ask you about this...\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...)\nDetention Center (subsequent visits, before clearing all Talk options in Wright & Co.

Uh, you see, I got roped into this somehow...\nPearl:\nWhat??\nPowers:\nAnd now I'm going to testify at tomorrow's trial.\nPhoenix:\n(So the decisive witness... is Mr. Powers?)\nPowers:\nI was talking with a detective until a little while ago, and I was on my way home... When all of a sudden, \"You there! You're under arrest!\" And I was brought back here.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh.\nPowers:\nThey said my face and whole self in general looked \"suspicious\" or something.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Well, I guess I can see how they thought you looked suspicious...)\nPowers:\n*sigh* I'm just a normal guy on an exercise show for kids... Is that a crime??\nExamine\nDetective on left\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.\nDetective:\n\"...I... I'm sorry, everyone. I've lied to you all...

What are you going to talk about?\nPowers:\nAh, I really don't know yet... But it sounds like I saw something pretty important from what they tell me.\nPhoenix:\nYou saw something important? What was it?\nPowers:\nAh, well, the detective told me not to talk about it. \"You can't tell anyone, and especially not that lawyer,\" he said.\nPearl:\nWho do you think is \"that lawyer\" the detective was talking about...?\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to take a wild guess and say it's me.\nPowers:\n...Y-Yeah, you got it.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mystic Maya and myself are your only two allies in this whole world, but it's alright!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch... I don't really have a lot of friends, do I...?)\nMatt Engarde\nPowers:\nThis is going to do a lot of damage to Matt, you know. Because he's got that \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" image going.\nPhoenix:\nBut what is he really like?\nPowers:\nWell, let's see. Matt's always been kind of a \"player\" with women... He would never really turn a pretty face away, if you know what I mean... He'd always say, \"It's just a game\" to justify himself.\nPearl:\nWhat!? H-How horrible! That's unforgivable!\nPowers:\nOww. S-Sorry. Didn't mean to offend you. But you know, he said once that, \"There's only one person in the world who won't swoon over me.\"\nPhoenix:\nOne person who wouldn't swoon over him?\nPowers:\nHis manager, you know. Ms. Adrian Andrews.\nPhoenix:\n(Why is Mr. Powers suddenly looking kind of... energetic?)\nGossip\nPowers:\nAh, you see, I'm actually a sucker for gossip. I mean, celebrities and their world have this dazzling sort of image, right?\nPhoenix:\nA dazzling sort of image? But aren't you a part of that dazzle, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nNo, I'm more of a hairy, sweaty, smelly, brutish kind of guy, you see. But it's OK, really. I get to hear plenty of gossip about a lot of the other stars around me as things happen.\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's true.\nPowers:\nOh, hey! So did you hear about this yet? About Ms. Andrews' mentor and her suicide...?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Ms. Inpax?\nPearl:\nWe heard something about how her wedding was cancelled...\nPowers:\nYeah, that's what I'm talking about! I thought about it a little the other day! About that mysterious death! Hey, Mr. Wright! Why don't you ask me about that!? Go on, go ahead!\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Powers is so charged up his skin is practically glowing with electricity...)\nCeleste's suicide (appears after \"Gossip\")\nPowers:\nHey, so have you heard this? Celeste left a suicide note! And they say that Juan went and hid it...\nPhoenix:\nWe heard about that in court today. (But there wasn't any actual proof that she had left a note...)\nPowers:\nWell, this is what I think. I think that something bad was written on that note. Something bad for Juan, that is.\nPearl:\nSomething bad for Mr. Corrida?\nPhoenix:\nWhy do you figure so?\nPowers:\nWell, before she died, Celeste talked with a few of her friends. And she said, \"It looks like I got caught up with a truly insidious man...\" (Changed from [And she said, 'It looks like I may have been caught by an insidious man...'] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nA \"truly insidious man\"...? Did she mean Mr. Corrida by that? (Changed from [An 'insidious man'...? Did she mean Mr. Corrida by that?] in the original release)\nPowers:\nWell, there's no one else that fits the bill, right? And that would be reason enough for him to hide the suicide note!\nPhoenix:\nI see... Well, that's some good info. Thank you.\nPowers:\nY-You're welcome!\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews; they're both at the detention center right now. There are still things I don't understand or know about, I'm sure... I have to get the two of them to tell me everything!)\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nPowers:\nUm... That kidnapper... Has he said anything since then...?\nPhoenix:\nWell... He tried, but there was a lot of interference.\nPowers:\nI see...\nPhoenix:\n(That radio interference... Who would've thought it was caused by a spy camera?)\nMagazine Clipping\nPowers:\nHey! That article! Is that from \"Gossip Land\"?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I guess so.\nPowers:\nAh, you too? I absolutely love this magazine!\nPhoenix:\nUm... \"You too\"...?\nPowers:\nOh, they wrote a little something about me once! \"Steel Samurai's Midnight Dine and Dash\".\nPearl:\nDine and dash...?\nPowers:\nI bought ten copies of that issue, you know.\nPhoenix:\n(Do you think we could somehow get back to THIS article...?)\nGuitar Case\nPowers:\nThe Jammin' Ninja made me want a bright red guitar, you know. I wanted to be cool like him, so I went out and bought one.\nPhoenix:\nOh... That's nice...\nPowers:\nAh, but you don't understand. I can't get a single sound to come out of it. Because I sort of tripped on it and crushed it... the day after I bought it.\nWine Glass, Crime Photo, Jammin' Ninja's Button, Knife, or Lotta's Photo\nPowers:\nI can't believe Ms. Andrews tried to frame Matt...

Here's the thing. I don't really KNOW her know her... you know? Ah!

Mr. Edgeworth couldn't stick around forever and had to go! (Changed from [Hey, pal! Mr. Edgeworth's already back!] in the original release)\nLeads to:\n\"Well? What happened?\"\nIf already in Wright & Co. Law Offices upon clearing all Talk options in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept. and clearing \"Matt's secret\" and \"Why frame him?\" Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room\nPhone:\n...\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Your phone!\nPhoenix:\nI don't like the sound of this ringtone right now... It sounds kind of ominous.\nPearl:\nIt's probably just your imagination. You should really pick it up, Mr. Nick! It could be important!\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nHello?\nGumshoe:\nWe've got a big problem, pal!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong??\nGumshoe:\nI'm on my way to your office right now!\nPhoenix:\nO-OK! (...Hey, wait a sec. Why is he coming here?)\nGumshoe:\nIt's terrible! I don't know what to say, pal! It's the end, I say. I'm going to... Oh. I got here faster than I thought...\nPhoenix:\nUm... H-Hey...\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nGumshoe:\nNo time to relax now, pal! I'm confused as anything here!\nLeads to:\n\"Well? What happened?\"\nPhoenix:\nWell? What happened?\nGumshoe:\nWe got 'em! We know who bought that spy camera!\nPearl:\nEh!?\nPhoenix:\nTh-This quickly?\nGumshoe:\nAnd this bear's what gave them away, pal!\nPhoenix:\nThe bear...\nGumshoe:\nI figured it out, pal! I figured that we should've been looking into the bear instead of the camera!\nPearl:\nUm... Wasn't that Mr. Edgeworth that figured...\nPhoenix:\nShh, Pearls. ...And? Go on.\nGumshoe:\nThere's only one person who bought one of those bears who's related to this crime!\nPearl:\nWh-Who is it!? Who would be so rude as to spy on another person in their room...?\nGumshoe:\n...Matt Engarde.\nPearl:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde. Your client, that's who, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(And here I thought things couldn't get any worse...)\nTalk\nStuffed bear\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure you heard right!? That the person who bought this bear was...\nGumshoe:\nI heard it from the department store clerk, pal. This is the credit card receipt for the purchase. It's for $3,800, pal. That's an exact match to the price of that stuffed bear.\nPhoenix:\nA receipt...? That's all you have?\nGumshoe:\nNah, it's not just the receipt, pal. The store clerk said so himself. He told me, \"I'm sure I sold the bear to Mr. Engarde.\" I mean, the clerk even got Mr. Engarde's autograph out of it, pal. So I'm sure the person that bought the stuffed bear was Mr. Engarde himself!\nPhoenix:\n(My... My sight is failing me... Th-This can't be!)\nCredit Card Receipt added to the Court Record.\nStuffed bear (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure you heard right!? That the person who bought this bear was...\nGumshoe:\nI heard it from the department store clerk, pal. This is the credit card receipt for the purchase. It's for $3,800, pal.

So I'm sure the person that bought the stuffed bear was Mr. Engarde himself!\nPhoenix:\n(My... My sight is failing me... Th-This can't be!)\nSpy camera\nPhoenix:\nSo what about the spy camera we found...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, that was a dead end, pal. I mean, you can get this kind of thing from anywhere. But for now, I guess I can give these back to you for you to file away into evidence.\nSpy Camera, Transmitter, and Stuffed Bear refiled into the Court Record.\nSpy camera (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo what about the spy camera we found...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, that was a dead end, pal. I mean, you can get this kind of thing from anywhere. But for now, I guess I can give these back to you for you to file away into evidence.\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nGumshoe:\nHave you heard anything from the kidnapper...?\nPhoenix:\nNope. Not a word since we were cut off by the radio interference.\nGumshoe:\nWell, we know his goal is to get an acquittal for Matt Engarde... So, I don't think he'll hurt Maya, because that's not going to help him at all. Come on! We can't lose hope, pal!\nPearl:\nY-Yeah!\nTransmitter, Stuffed Bear, or Spy Camera\nGumshoe:\nThat Engarde... What was he thinking?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean setting the spy camera up in the victim's room...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah! And it was recording at the time of the murder too, pal. Don't you find that just a tad suspicious? It doesn't sound like a coincidence to me...\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nAh! I mean, don't mind me! I didn't mean it that way, pal...\nPhoenix:\n(Then what \"way\" did you mean it?)\nAdrian Andrews profile\nGumshoe:\nMy impression of her has totally changed, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I wonder what she is doing right now...?\nGumshoe:\nI'm sure she's still being questioned. She sure got herself into quite a big mess trying to frame Mr. Engarde. She'll probably be spending the night at the detention center...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, that's right. She's still at the detention center.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nGumshoe:\nI know you don't want to give up, pal...\nPhoenix:\n(I never thought... I didn't think it was possible... The person who put the spy camera in Juan Corrida's room was Matt Engarde!)\nPearl:\nWhy... Why would Mr. Engarde do something like this!?\nGumshoe:\nI bet it was to catch Ms. Andrews and Mr. Corrida in one of their rendezvous.\nPhoenix:\n\"I bet\" is not good enough for me. I have to know the absolute truth behind this camera.\nGumshoe:\nAre you going to see him? Mr. Engarde, I mean.\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nPearl:\nI'm... I'm scared, Mr. Nick. I wonder... I wonder what we will find out next...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm scared myself, but I have to put on a good face for Pearls... Matt Engarde! What in the world have you done!?)\nCorrida's Hotel Room\nPresent\nSpy Camera or Transmitter\nPearl:\nI've learned a lot of things during this case. For example, if you want to spy on someone, there are devices like this you can use.\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's not really a device for the purpose of spying. The way any device is used is decided by the people who use them.\nPearl:\n...\nStuffed Bear\nPearl:\nPoor teddy... I feel bad for it. Its eye was... It was... And all for the criminal's mean plan...\nPhoenix:\n(This bear... It's an expensive luxury brand from overseas.) But it's OK, Pearls. Now it's helping us by giving us a clue... It's telling us who the real culprit is so we can get some justice.\nDetention Center (after clearing all Talk options in Wright & Co. Law Offices)\nEngarde:\nYou're working really late, you know. It's already past 10:00 PM, dude.\nPhoenix:\nI think it's time you told me the truth.\nEngarde:\n... Relax. Don't you know that \"ignorance is bliss\"? But if you really want to know, let's talk.\nTalk\nMatt's secret (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nEngarde:\nWell done, Mr. Wright. I bet it wasn't easy to gather as much information as you have.\nPhoenix:\nYou really... So you were Shelly de Killer's client!?\nEngarde:\nYou don't really think I would dirty my own hands in this, do you?\nPearl:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nEngarde:\nAnd that woman... Adrian was quite brave herself. Trying to stick the crime on me -- I didn't think she had it in her. But all I care about is that Juan is dead. Isn't that right, Mister Lawyer?\nPearl:\nTh-That's... You're lying!! What a terrible...!\nEngarde:\nIt's way past your bedtime... little girl. Go on, and let us grown-ups talk about more... adult things.\nPearl:\nBut why!? Why did you hide the video camera and...\nEngarde:\n... A weakling soon believes the words of others... just like that pathetic Adrian.\nPhoenix:\n(He knew about Ms. Andrews' secret...?)\nEngarde:\nBut I'm no weakling. I don't believe anyone... least of all assassins.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\nEngarde:\nOh, come now, Mr. Wright. Assassins aren't above blackmail. They turn their clients into cashcows by holding the sinful deed over their heads. And a superstar like me, how much do you think I'm worth? Care to guess?\nPearl:\nAnd... And that's why...?\nEngarde:\nYes, that's where the video comes in. It's got his face and the crime scene recorded on it, preserved for all time. With that, I can keep him at bay, and even blackmail him if I want. That's right. That video is my \"insurance\"... Isn't that what they call it, Mr. Wright?\nPearl:\nWhy would you do something so wrong...?\nEngarde:\nBecause I'm a grown-up, and I can. Good enough of an answer for you, little girl?\nMotive for murder (appears after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nPearl:\nWhy!? Why would you kill Mr. Corrida...?\nEngarde:\nBecause he was about to sling so much dung onto my beautiful public image. Scandals are a little annoying, aren't they?\nPhoenix:\nThis is all because of that press conference, isn't it...?\nPearl:\nIf Mr. Corrida had been able to give it, then Mr. Engarde's secret would've...\nEngarde:\nAh, well, that's what we call \"taking advantage of the situation\", you know? I had no interest in doing it, really, but bit by bit, it crept up on me. And then the situation just presented itself perfectly... \"How beautiful,\" I thought.\nPearl:\nAnd that's... That's how Mr. Corrida ended up dead...\nEngarde:\nLet me tell you something. I'm not like Adrian. I don't depend on anyone. People are simply things to be used. Used and thrown away. Put on a sweet, innocent face, and people will swallow anything you feed them. Adrian fell for it. The assassin too. Oh, and how can I forget. Even you fell for it, Mister Lawyer! Everyone, all working their butts off for me, Matt Engarde!\nPearl:\n...\nEngarde:\nAww, did that leave you speechless? What a shame.\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nPhoenix:\n5 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- Matt's Secret --\nPhoenix:\nNow, let's hear what this \"secret\" of yours is. What if Mr. Corrida had been successful in his plan? What would he have disclosed...?\nEngarde:\nI told you before, dude. I don't know! I don't know anything about Juan, OK? Look, Mr. Wright. I can keep on saying it until I'm blue in the face, but... I totally didn't pay Juan any attention the whole time that night! I mean, come on! I was in the middle of a nap!\nPhoenix:\nDon't lie to me.\nEngarde:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nI know you paid close attention to Mr. Corrida, especially on that night!\nPresent Spy Camera or Transmitter\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSomeone used this camera to secretly film Mr. Corrida's room the night of the murder.\nEngarde:\n...\"Secretly film\"...? What?\nPhoenix:\nAnd then sent the images the camera took with this transmitter.\nEngarde:\nWow... But dude, where was this camera you're talking about hidden?\nPresent Stuffed Bear\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The spy camera was hidden in this bear's eye!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEngarde:\nMr. Lawyer dude, I'm really tired...\nPhoenix:\nI know...\nEngarde:\nBut dude, you look even more tired than me. Why don't we call it quits for today and get some sleep? How does that sound?\nPhoenix:\nWhat made you say that all of a sudden?\nEngarde:\nWell, you're here showing me stuff that doesn't make any sense.\nPhoenix:\nOh, oops. (I guess I really must be tired...) But I'm not giving up just yet.\nLeads back to:\n\"Someone used this camera to secretly film Mr. Corrida's room the night of the murder.\"\nPhoenix:\nThe spy camera was hidden in this bear's eye!\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nA bear that was supposed to be a present from a fan!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nLeads to:\n\"...Hmph.\"\nPresent Stuffed Bear\nPhoenix:\nThis bear was in Mr. Corrida's room on the night of the murder. A bear that was supposed to be a present from a fan!\nEngarde:\nSo? It's a present, dude. It actually looks kinda classy, if you know what I mean.\nPhoenix:\nYes, I hear it's quite expensive. Which is why it is very odd that this gadget was found inside this bear!\nPresent Spy Camera or Transmitter\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This is a very small video camera.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEngarde:\nMr. Lawyer dude, I'm really tired...\nPhoenix:\nI know...\nEngarde:\nBut dude, you look even more tired than me.

And it was hidden inside this bear's eye.\nEngarde:\n...Maybe it's a really curious bear...?\nPhoenix:\nWell, whatever this \"bear\" saw was sent somewhere using this transmitter. Which means... Someone, on the night of the murder, was secretly filming Mr. Corrida's room!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nLeads to:\n\"...Hmph.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWell, Mr. Engarde?\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec.

Aha ha ha ha *snort!*\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe he can be so flippant at a time like this...) Um, Mr. Engarde... I don't think you need to snort while you laugh. Really.\nLeads back to:\n\"I know you paid close attention to Mr. Corrida, especially on that night!\"\nEngarde:\n...Hmph. I guess Juan had a few of those kinds of fans too, huh dude?\nPhoenix:\nActually, I wouldn't say this bear was a present from a \"fan\".\nEngarde:\n... Hmm... You sure, dude? Who else could it be from?\nPhoenix:\nThe person who gave this bear to Mr. Corrida was...\nPresent Matt Engarde profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Engarde. Don't you know this bear from somewhere...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWell, Mr. Engarde?\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my mom, OK? ... ... She says that I can't be friends with someone like you.\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nEngarde:\nGo home! If you don't go away, I'm gonna call the police on you!\nPhoenix:\n(...That's strange. I thought the answer was right there in front of me...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Actually, I wouldn't say this bear was a present from a \"fan\".\"\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde. Don't you know this bear from somewhere...?\nEngarde:\nI don't think I've ever met Mr. Bear before, dude.\nPhoenix:\nAww, but he says he knows you. How could you forget such a great friend?\nEngarde:\n... What else did the bear tell you?\nPhoenix:\nHe says that the one who put the camera in his eye was you, Mr. Engarde.\nEngarde:\n... If I didn't know how you work in court, I'd think I was in some serious trouble. Come on... This is all a joke, right dude? You're just pulling my leg.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like you're not ready to give up your secret yet.\nEngarde:\nWell, do you have any proof you want to show me first?\nPhoenix:\nHere is proof that it was you who put the camera inside the bear:\nPresent Credit Card Receipt\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I have here, one credit card receipt, Mr. Engarde.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWell, come on, Mr. Engarde!\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my grandma, OK? ... ... Did you know? It's bad to whistle at night, dude... Because snakes will come out if you do.\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nEngarde:\nMy grandma, she knows all sorts of stuff. I think you'd better learn from her example, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(Is he telling me to think carefully before I speak...? Argh! So close and yet so far!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Looks like you're not ready to give up your secret yet.\"\nPhoenix:\nI have here, one credit card receipt, Mr. Engarde. It's from when YOU bought that stuffed bear!\nEngarde:\nDude, all you can tell from this is that I spent $3,800. I go to that department store all the time, OK? This $3,800... This could be the toothbrush I bought that one time.\nPhoenix:\nA-A THIRTY-EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR TOOTHBRUSH!?\nEngarde:\n...It's ivory... And it's got elephant hair for bristles...\nPhoenix:\n(Eww... Elephant hair? Is that what rich people use nowadays...?) Anyway! The store clerk clearly remembers you and your purchase. After all, you even gave him an autograph, did you not!?\nEngarde:\n... Dude... You should've said that earlier.\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nEngarde:\n... Um, so can I ask you one thing?\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nEngarde:\nYou're my lawyer, right dude? So, if you are, then why are you looking into stuff like that?\nPhoenix:\nBecause if I don't know the truth, I can't help you.\nEngarde:\nSounds more like stupid lawyer talk to me... Hey, let's stop talking about this, OK?\nPhoenix:\nNo, not yet. I haven't asked why you set the camera up yet.\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd what your \"secret\" is. Of course, it would be strictly confidential...\nEngarde:\nSo...? What are you going to do now?\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to find out what I want to know... because I must. The reason you hid this camera in Mr. Corrida's room and filmed it in secret is...\nPresent Picture Card\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Wh-What is this card...?\"\nPresent Magazine Clipping or Adrian Andrews profile\nPhoenix:\nEngarde:\nAdrian Andrews?\nPhoenix:\nThere is a rumor going around... That Ms. Andrews and Mr. Corrida were having secret meetings.\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYou, who was keeping tabs on Mr. Corrida... You were going to reveal this as fact, and turn it into a scandal. Isn't that right!?\nEngarde:\n... ...Dude, you can be such a moron.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEngarde:\nOh man, Mr. Lawyer dude, that kind of scandal... That's the good stuff! That's what we in the industry call \"juicy\"!\nPhoenix:\n...The \"good stuff\"...? \"Juicy\"...?\nEngarde:\nLook, we can get publicity without spending a penny with that kind of stuff. I mean, if people stopped paying attention to us, then it'd be the end, dude.\nPhoenix:\n... Too bad that wasn't your intention.\nEngarde:\nWhat are you talking about?\nPhoenix:\nI wish your reason for spying was something so innocent. But it wasn't. You didn't spy on Mr. Corrida because of Ms. Andrews... Then there's only one reason I can think of for you to do such a thing.\nEngarde:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nThe real reason you set up that camera in Mr. Corrida's room was...\nPresent Picture Card\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Wh-What is this card...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEngarde:\n...If I really wanted to set up a spy camera... I wouldn't have set it up in Juan's room. It would be in your office, dude.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? My office...?\nEngarde:\nWell, dude, you're always saying really absurd things, right? It'd be like getting the comedy channel for free!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! I'm so close! I can feel it!) I-If you're done laughing!\nLeads back to:\n\"You didn't spy on Mr. Corrida because of Ms. Andrews...\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nEngarde:\n... ...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde?\nEngarde:\nDude, how about you take that bear home with you and talk to it? I'm sure Mr. Bear will talk with you about as much as I will, which is not at all.\nPhoenix:\nUm... (I have to somehow get it through his head I'm not giving up.)\nEngarde:\nSo, is it time to throw in the towel yet, dude?\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but no.\nLeads back to:\n\"I'm going to find out what I want to know... because I must.\"\nEngarde:\nWh-What is this card...?\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe he doesn't know about this card...) This is a certain man's \"calling card\"... The man's name is Shelly de Killer... and I'm sure you know of him, don't you?\nEngarde:\nShelly... de Killer... Th-Th-That's ridiculous! Wh-Why would I know some shady scumbag like him...?\nPhoenix:\nIf you really don't know him, then why are you acting so jumpy all of a sudden?\nEngarde:\nUmm!\nPhoenix:\n(This is it! I'm finally starting to get to the truth! I can't afford to make any more mistakes now...) Mr. Matt Engarde. I know why you know Mr. de Killer. It's because...\nyou're a hero of justice.\nPhoenix:\nIt's because you're the great hero of justice, the Nickel Samurai!\nEngarde:\nDuuuuude!?\nPhoenix:\nYou spied on that room to do one thing and one thing only! To expose Shelly de Killer's fiendish plot!\nEngarde:\n...I... ...Okay... If that's what you think, then whatever, dude.\nPhoenix:\n... (I get the feeling that wasn't quite it...) S-Sorry.

Slip of the tongue...\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Matt Engarde.\"\nPhoenix:\nSince you're the one who set up that camera... That means you knew... You knew exactly what was going to happen in that room!\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nSo... How? How would you know something like that...? It's because you're his client. That's why. You hired Shelly de Killer to assassinate Mr. Juan Corrida! The real mastermind behind this whole murder is... You, Matt Engarde!\nEngarde:\n... ... ... ...*sigh* And here I was, trying to be a good boy for you, dude.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEngarde:\nI thought if you didn't know, you'd be able to do your job without feeling bad. Well, that's what I thought, anyway...\nPhoenix:\nM-Mr. Engarde... You really did hire...!?\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna consult myself, OK? ... ...\nPhoenix:\n(Consult... \"myself\"...??)\nEngarde:\n...Well, I guess it's probably about time anyway.\nPhoenix:\nAbout time for what?\nEngarde:\nI think it's time for you to meet him now, Mr. Lawyer dude.\n3 LOCKS BROKEN\nEngarde:\nHow do you do... Mister Lawyer? I'm Matt Engarde.\nUnlock Successful\nAnything (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nEngarde:\nI don't care what you show... I think you've gotten enough out of me, don't you? Enough freebies for today. The rest is up to you, isn't that right...

You've grown awfully quiet...\nPhoenix:\nH-How could I have been so deceived by you all this time? When we first met, I asked if you had killed Juan Corrida... And you answered very clearly that you hadn't killed anyone.\nEngarde:\nHey now. I never told you any lies. The person who did the killing was that De Killer guy, right? All I'm guilty of is taking a catnap in my room.\nPhoenix:\nYou... You... You killed Mr. Corrida!\nEngarde:\nHahaha. I dare you to say that in court tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nGrr...\nEngarde:\nAww, but too bad. You can't. You're my lawyer, after all. Aren't you?\nPhoenix:\n...\nEngarde:\nYou could always drop my case and refuse to represent me. How does that sound? Aww, but you can't, can you? That would be the one thing you absolutely can't do.\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya...!\nEngarde:\nYou wouldn't want to test De Killer. He's a man of his word, or so I hear. You could end up getting a certain friend of yours rubbed out if you lose.\nPhoenix:\n...Y...You... scoundrel...\nEngarde:\nSo if I were you, Mr. Wright, esquire, I think I would give it my all tomorrow. Remember, everyone likes a happy win-win resolution.\nPhoenix:\nI... I'll get you for this!\nEngarde:\nThat's such a clich\u00e9 phrase. Juan said something just like that, if memory serves. Of course... Well, we all know how well things turned out for him, don't we? Good night, Mister Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... Maya, what am I supposed to do!?)\n???:\n... And now... Now you've finally found it.\nEdgeworth:\nThe starting line of this case.\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nI don't care for the horrid atmosphere here. Let's return to the precinct.\nMarch 22Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Wright? What are you going to do? If you plan on changing your defense...\nPearl:\nN...No! We can't do that...\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right... He's holding Maya hostage...\nPhoenix:\n... What... What should I do...?\nEdgeworth:\n... That's not something I can answer for you.\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nWright... Only you can decide where to go from here. One year ago... At that time, I didn't truly understand what a \"prosecutor\" was. And that is why... I had to leave the Prosecutor's Office. I felt that I couldn't stand in a court of law until I knew what a prosecutor really was. And now, Wright... It's your turn.\nPhoenix:\nMy... turn?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this thing called a \"lawyer\"? What can you do as one? You must find the answer... And you must find it on your own.\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nI'm a lawyer... But to fight for someone who is clearly a killer... Matt Engarde... That man is really... Argh!\nEdgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter who, every person deserves a proper defense and a fair trial. Isn't that the basis of our judicial system?\nPhoenix:\n\"Proper defense\"? But what exactly is that? Is it where a lawyer forcibly and blindly gets an acquittal through shouting and trickery?\nEdgeworth:\n...*sigh* Ironic that you of all people should say such a thing. Isn't that exactly how you have fought for your clients up until now?\nPhoenix:\nUh... W-Well, that may be true, but... But that's... That's because I've believed my clients to be innocent from the bottom of my heart! But if I were to get Engarde an acquittal... That... That isn't a proper defense at all!\nMaya's situation\nPhoenix:\nI became a lawyer because I thought... I thought I could save people who were suffering and in pain...\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\nBut... When I look at this mess we're in... I can't even protect the person closest to me. Even if I win the case, I still lose in the end... I just don't know what to do!\nEdgeworth:\n... Wright. Would you get a hold of yourself? You have it all wrong.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nWe aren't some sort of heroes. We're only human, you and I. You want to \"save someone\"? That's something easier said than done, wouldn't you say?\nPearl:\nTh-That's...\nEdgeworth:\nYou are a defense lawyer. You can't run away from that. You can only fight. That's all you can do.\nWhy fight? (appears after \"Matt Engarde\" and \"Maya's situation\")\nLeads to:\n\"People like you and Franziska von Karma are always using all you have to pin me down.\"\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\n(Now's not the time to talk about evidence...)\nPhoenix:\nPeople like you and Franziska von Karma are always using all you have to pin me down. You fight to the very end, even when you know the truth is not with you. But I'm not like you. I can't fight for a false verdict -- for a man I clearly know to be guilty!\nEdgeworth:\n... Franziska... She fights for herself. The only thing she fights for is her perfect win record. That's all.\nPhoenix:\nAnd!? Isn't that the same as you!? Isn't that why you ran away a year ago? Because your precious win record was destroyed!? You are so petty!\nEdgeworth:\n... I see... Now I understand why you despise me so. However, you are mistaken.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you...?\nEdgeworth:\nThanks to you, when you sealed off my path to a perfect win record... I began to realize the error of my ways. I realized that things such as a perfect record were meaningless.\nPearl:\nWhat!? (Changed from [Eh!?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nI don't believe you. Are you saying that is why you left the Prosecutor's Office? But then, why? Why are you here now?\nEdgeworth:\nThe answer to that... is something you will find out on your own. I have faith you will see it before the verdict is read tomorrow. But if you can't, then you will be powerless to change the ending of this story.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! The transceiver!\n...*beep*...\n???:\nI'm sorry for what happened earlier. Well then, Mr. Attorney. Do you wager you can obtain an acquittal tomorrow?\nPhoenix:\n...\n???:\nMy, my. What is the matter, Mr. Attorney? I don't sense your usual anger this time.\nPhoenix:\n...Tell me. Please. Why are you holding Maya hostage for Mr. Engarde's sake? Why are you... Why are you doing this for that cold-blooded killer!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright...\n???:\n... Please don't misunderstand things. He is my client.\nPhoenix:\nDon't toy with me! A man who hires an assassin is just as much of a killer himself!\n???:\n... ...I believe you were asking me for a reason as to why I am doing what I am...\nPhoenix:\n...Y-Yeah.\n???:\nThis is what I like to call my \"aftercare\".\nPhoenix:\nWh-What the heck is \"aftercare\"?\n???:\nMy name carries a certain amount of honor and dignity, Mr. Attorney. I take great care to insure that no suspicion falls upon my clients for my handiwork. That is what is called \"client relations\" and it is a part of an assassin's duty.\nPhoenix:\nAn assassin's... \"duty\"...?\n???:\nWe were unlucky this time and my client was arrested as a suspect. As a result, I did what I had to do to enlist your expert help, Mr. Attorney. And to ensure that you would do everything in your power to the very end.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is your name!?\n???:\nI believe I told you once before, however...\nPhoenix:\nYou did... But...\n???:\nMy name is... De Killer. Shelly de Killer.\nEdgeworth:\nY-You're Shelly de Killer!?\nde Killer:\nPlease keep in mind you do not have much space to maneuver with me. As a De Killer, I always finish what I set out to do. If you fail to keep up your end of the bargain...\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya!\nde Killer:\nIt would be my duty as an assassin to see to it she receives a nice long nap.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaaah! Noooooooooooo!\nde Killer:\nNow then, if you'll excuse me. If someone were to trace this signal back to me, it would be quite troublesome.\n...Meow.\n...*beep*...\nPearl:\nMystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaa!\nEdgeworth:\nI... I don't know what to say...\nPhoenix:\n...Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nHm?\nPhoenix:\nDid you hear that? At the end of that transmission...\n...Meow.\nEdgeworth:\nHuh? Oh, that... It sounded like a cat.\nPearl:\n...A cat?\nPhoenix:\n(It can't be... that cat... Can it...?)\nPearl:\nWhat is it...?\nPhoenix:\nI think... I know where Shelly de Killer is holding Maya hostage! Edgeworth! Have all police units head for Engarde Mansion immediately!\nEdgeworth:\n...! Alright. You hurry over as well, then!\nPhoenix:\nDon't lose hope yet, Pearls! The fight has only just begun!\nPearl:\nY-Yeah!\nDetention Center (after breaking Matt Engarde's Psyche-Locks, then clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)\nPhoenix:\n(Now then, whose story do I want to hear?)\nMatt Engarde\nJailer:\nI'm really sorry, but... Matt Engarde is refusing to meet with you.\nPhoenix:\n...I see.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess I don't really have anything left to talk to him about anyway...)\nPearl:\nShall we listen to what Ms. Andrews has to say...?\nMarch 22Engarde MansionLiving Room\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nPearl:\nPlease answer us! Mystic Mayaaaa!\nEdgeworth:\nWe have this area completely surrounded. There is no way for him to escape. Assuming he's still in the area...\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe it... That butler... All this time, he was De Killer...\nEdgeworth:\nHe and Engarde were working together all this time. I'm sure they had worked out a contingency plan ahead of time.\nExamine\nFireplace\nPhoenix:\nThis is the first time I've seen such a large fireplace.\nEdgeworth:\nI don't particularly care for large fireplaces. They remind me of my youth.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder, if memory serves, if it's because of that rich aunt he had?) Don't tell me you're still stuck on that incident...?\nEdgeworth:\nDon't take this personally, but I really do not wish to remember anything from that time in my life.\nMotorcycle\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems that Engarde was quite famous, even as a motorcycle racer.\nPhoenix:\nGenerally when a star like him tries to do something like that, they fail, but...\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems Engarde is no ordinary man.\nLounge set\nEdgeworth:\nThat Engarde... This is probably where he conducted business with De Killer.\nPhoenix:\nYeah...\nEdgeworth:\nShelly de Killer values his client relations more than anything else. So I'm sure he must meet with his clients in person to talk about any transactions.\nMasks\nEdgeworth:\nIt's Engarde's personal collection. I'd say it's a hobby of his to collect prop masks of shows related to his own.\nPhoenix:\nYou seem to know all sorts of details about Matt Engarde... Almost too many details...\nEdgeworth:\nHe's the defendant in this case. Of course I would know about him.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah... I guess that makes sense...\nDoorway behind railing\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like there's another room in the back.\nEdgeworth:\nLeave that to us. I'm sure the investigation team is already doing its job in there.\nDoor\nPearl:\nThere's a small door at the bottom of this bigger door, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nI bet it's for the cat to use.\nPearl:\nOh, you mean Shoe.\nBear figurine\nLeads to:\n\"Oh, it's a figurine of a bear!\"\nPearl:\nOh, it's a figurine of a bear! But there are a lot of cuts in it for some reason...\nFigurine added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nA bear...? Isn't that more of a thing for Mr. Corrida? Why would something like this be here...?\nEdgeworth:\nWright, look down. There's a little pet door installed here.\nPearl:\nAh, I'm sure that's for Shoe...\nPhoenix:\nDo you think that this... came through that little door...?\nEdgeworth:\nUmph! This door... It's locked!\nPhoenix:\nWell, I'm pretty used to breaking doors down by now. Let's go, Edgeworth!\n*SLAM* *SLAM* *CRASH!*\nPrivate Lounge\nPhoenix:\nArgh! There's no one here!\nEdgeworth:\nFrom the looks of this room, I would say this is Engarde's private lounge. ...Look at this, Wright!\nPhoenix:\nAn antennae for sending and receiving radio signals and a VCR... Check inside the deck! If there's a tape, it would be an important piece of evidence! (If we're lucky, it'll have the moment the crime was committed recorded on it!)\nEdgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but... The tape deck is empty. There's no tape to be found.\nPearl:\nNo...\nEdgeworth:\nBut there's no mistake that someone used this to record something. It looks like someone took the tape we're looking for, and escaped with it...\nExamine\nTV\nPhoenix:\nA huge television and speakers loom largely here. I'm sure if Maya saw this, she'd say,\nMaya:\n\"I would die a happy Samurai fan if I could see the Nickel Samurai on a TV like this!\"\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's what she'd say... ... Ack! I can't believe I just made a joke about Maya, all things considered...\nSatellite dish\nPhoenix:\nIt's a VCR and an antennae. The footage that the spy camera took at the scene of the crime... was beamed here and recorded on tape.\nPearl:\nIf only we had that tape, it would have been really helpful...\nComputer\nPhoenix:\nIt's Engarde's computer. Maya... Why couldn't you have used this to get help?\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Where's... Where's the power switch!?\nPhoenix:\n... (Oh, I get it... So that's what happened. She couldn't find the power switch...)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nIt's a very small table. I bet we could barely squeeze 3 Pearls on there.\nPearl:\nBut I wouldn't sit on a table to begin with, Mr. Nick...\nSofa\nPhoenix:\nWhat a spacious sofa. I bet 10 Pearls would fit on here.\nPearl:\nUm, I don't think 10 of me would fit, Mr. Nick...\nVideo tapes\nPhoenix:\nI can't read all the labels, but this is a very large collection of video tapes. Looks like Engarde taped all of his own shows...\nDoor\nPearl:\nThere's a little door for Shoe in this big door.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure Maya used this door to shove this out there... I'm sure it was her! (Every time you give me some piece of evidence, it's always the most crucial piece. This time too, I'm sure...)\nWine Cellar\nPhoenix:\n... (We've searched all over, but it looks like he got away...)\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry. It looks like he slipped out of our grasp this time.\nPhoenix:\nAnd now... we've lost our only lead.\nEdgeworth:\nDon't give up yet. That little girl is looking to you to be her pillar.\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, you're right.\nEdgeworth:\nWe're close, I can tell. We've already set up checkpoints along every route leading out of this district. Leave the rest to us.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya...)\nExamine\nBottles\nPearl:\nWow... I've never seen so many bottles all in one place before.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess when you're a star, you have so much money you can buy anything you want.\nBoxes\nPhoenix:\nThe light doesn't filter in all the way, so it's hard to see. It looks like there are crates and cardboard boxes tied up with wire here.\nDoor\nPearl:\nIt's a pretty heavy door, isn't it? I can't open it by myself. Please don't shut me in here by accident, OK Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(If I were locked in a place like this... I'd be plenty scared too. Trust me.)\nPhoto frame\nLeads to:\n\"This looks like a picture of Ms. Inpax...\"\nPhoenix:\nThis looks like a picture of Ms. Inpax... (\"With love... Celeste\")\nPearl:\nMs. Inpax? You mean...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Mr. Corrida's former manager.\nPearl:\nWhy would a picture of Ms. Inpax be here in Mr. Engarde's mansion?\nPhoenix:\n(And why does it say, \"With love\"...? Hmm, this might be a clue...)\nCeleste's Photo added to the Court Record.\nPearl:\nAh!\nPhoenix:\nWhat's wrong, Pearls?\nPearl:\nP-Please let me see that picture frame!\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? What's so special about the frame?)\nPearl:\nOn the back... There's something written on the back of the frame! ...\"Maya\" It's Mystic Maya! She left us a message!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nMaya:\nI thought you'd come. I knew you would. Now listen up! You'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!? If you get that creepy slimebag a not guilty, I'll never forgive you, ever! I'm fine, so you don't need to worry. ...There's so much I want to write, but I don't think I have a lot of time left. Pearly, you're there too, right? Make sure you help Nick, OK? Someone's gotta watch out for the helpless lunk. ... Um... That's it for now, Nick. I guess I'll talk to you guys later.\nPearl:\n...That's... I... Nooooooooo! Mystic Mayaaaaaaa... *sob*\nEdgeworth:\nWright!\nPhoenix:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's wrong? Why the blank stare?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, nothing.\nEdgeworth:\nWe've searched the house, and this is the last room. It looks like he eluded us.\nPhoenix:\n...Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nYes?\nPhoenix:\nAs far as clues go, I think this is about all I'm going to get.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nBut I'm still short one last thing...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what is that?\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Andrews' Psyche-Lock... If I could just find out what secret she's holding... Then I think I stand a chance in court tomorrow... To blow this case wide open and expose the truth.)\nEdgeworth:\nI think I know what you're thinking. I'll contact the detention center.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Thanks, Edgeworth. Well, let's go Pearls. It's time to open that last lock.\nMarch 22Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nAndrews:\nGood evening, Mr. Wright. ... What's wrong? You look ill...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews. I have come to remove your Psyche-Lock.\nAndrews:\nPsyche-Lock...?\nPhoenix:\nI want to know, and you will tell me... ...your secret.\nAndrews:\nFine, go ahead. Try to break me, if you can.\nTalk\nWhy frame him? (after breaking Psyche-Lock)\nAndrews:\nCeleste... She was supposed to get married to Juan.\nPhoenix:\nYes... But I heard that it didn't work out.\nPearl:\nBecause Mr. Corrida didn't want to get married to her anymore, right...?\nAndrews:\nYes... Because of Matt.\nPearl:\nB-Because of Mr. Engarde? What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\n(I think I can see where this is going.)\nAndrews:\nCeleste... She was Matt's manager a long time ago. She was the happiest woman in the world at that time. I was working part-time back then, and I often saw the two of them together.\nPhoenix:\nSo that's why... \"With love... Celeste\" is written on the frame of that picture.\nPearl:\nThey were a couple, weren't they?\nAndrews:\nIt wasn't anything as splendid as that. Celeste was being used; toyed with until she was... thrown away.\nPearl:\nThat's so horrible...\nAndrews:\nMatt's entire image is built around how nice and wonderful of a man he is. A scandal would have destroyed that. Which is why Celeste, in her kindness, moved over to Worldwide Studios. And that is where she met Juan. She seemed really happy with him; even happier than when she was with Matt. Celeste and Juan were such a good match that they were even planning to get married. And then it was suddenly called off. On the night Juan called their marriage off, Celeste... She killed herself. And that's why I framed Matt. It was revenge for Celeste and for myself.\nRevenge (appears after \"Why frame him?\")\nLeads to:\n\"I'm sure even you can guess why Juan called the wedding off, right?\"\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nPhoenix:\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\n-- Why Frame Him? --\nPhoenix:\nCan you please tell me why you framed Mr. Engarde for the murder?\nAndrews:\nI've already told you countless times. It's because I thought Matt was the killer.\nPhoenix:\n(No, that's not it! I know you have a personal reason to dislike Mr. Engarde.) Ms. Andrews. You may think I didn't hear it, but I know you said something earlier. You said, \"Revenge.\"\nAndrews:\nSo you are saying I was taking my revenge out on Matt, and that's why? Wh-What an absurd idea. I... I don't have anything I want to take revenge for.\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Andrews... A woman who lives by being dependent on other people...) (Changed from [Ms. Andrews...

And that is Ms. Inpax's suicide.\nAndrews:\nWh-What are you trying to say? Celeste was Juan's manager.\nPhoenix:\n...\nAndrews:\nOn top of that, the one who hid her suicide note was also Juan. What does all this have to do with Matt?\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. You haven't mentioned him... Yet. But for you to hate Mr. Engarde... It would mean that he must have had some relation to Ms. Inpax and her suicide.\nAndrews:\nCan you explain to me this \"relation\" between Celeste and Matt!?\nPresent Celeste's Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This... This is a photo of Ms. Inpax, correct?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nAndrews:\nThat's it?\nPhoenix:\nYes...\nAndrews:\nAnd what sort of relation is this supposed to explain?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde's...\nAndrews:\nBefore you start, Mr. Wright, perhaps I should first request to see proof that your brain is wired correctly.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. I can't afford to mess up something as big as this! I need evidence that clearly shows a connection between Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde. If I can find that, I can finally get the real story!)\nAndrews:\nI wonder if you'd like to try again, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"Can you explain to me this \"relation\" between Celeste and Matt!?\"\nPhoenix:\nThis... This is a photo of Ms. Inpax, correct? She looks younger than when she passed away though.\nAndrews:\n...W...\nPhoenix:\n\"With love... Celeste\". This is Ms. Inpax's handwriting, isn't it?\nAndrews:\n... Where did you find this...? No, that's alright. It was a rhetorical question...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it is. I found this at Mr. Engarde's mansion.\nAndrews:\n... ...And after all this time... My last remaining secret has been revealed...\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nAndrews:\nI'm sure even you can guess why Juan called the wedding off, right? Matt \"confessed\" to Juan... about his relationship with Celeste.\nPhoenix:\nI see... So that's what happened.\nPearl:\nBut... Then why did Mr. Corrida have to call off the wedding!? I don't understand at all...\nAndrews:\nIt was probably because of his worthless male pride. Juan and Matt were always fierce rivals. Matt waited for the wedding announcement and then unleashed the truth on Juan. He was aiming for when it would hurt Juan the most.\nPearl:\nPoor Ms. Inpax!\nAndrews:\n...That wasn't the end of it. That day, I'm almost certain that Celeste left a suicide note behind. And in that note, she left a detailed account of Matt's various misdeeds, and... So that she would never again be hurt by Matt, she chose... to die. Then, when Juan discovered her body, he hid her note.\nPearl:\nB-But why would he do that!?\nAndrews:\nIt's simple. Juan realized that note was a powerful weapon against Matt. And it would be especially damaging to his \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" image. In any case... With his pride hurt, Juan sought revenge.\nPhoenix:\nRevenge... There's that word again.\nAndrews:\nJuan wanted to publicly disclose the contents of that suicide note. At a time that would cause Matt the most damage, of course.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that was at the press conference after the stage show...\nAndrews:\nI know all about it, because I heard it all from Juan. It was so I could find out about all this that I drew close to Juan to begin with. They're quite a pair of hideous monsters, aren't they? Even Celeste's death was something for them to use in their game. That night, when I found Juan's body, it was only natural that I thought the murderer was Matt. Those two were always spying on one another, after all. As for me, I was frantically searching for Celeste's suicide note. I wanted to destroy it before it ever went public. I was going to burn it. I had even brought a lighter. But... I couldn't find the suicide note... And that's when revenge crossed my mind. Yes, I was going to bring to them my own kind of cruel revenge. Celeste was killed by those two monsters. So when I stabbed Juan's body with that knife... I didn't feel a single shred of guilt.\nPearl:\n...!\nAndrews:\n... And that's all I have to say.\nPhoenix:\n...\nAndrews:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Even knowing all this, are you still going to help that... \"man\"?\nPhoenix:\n... I... I'm a lawyer...\nAndrews:\nI see. What a foul profession.\nPhoenix:\n... Thank you very much for your time and for talking with me.\nAndrews:\nIt was no big deal. I couldn't sleep anyway.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't sleep either...

I would like you to retrieve that item for me.\"\nPhoenix:\n(He must be talking about this bear puzzle...)\nEdgeworth:\nInside that figurine was a suicide note. Naturally, the victim brought it with him to his hotel room. He was planning to publicly disclose its contents at the press conference, after all.\nde Killer:\nThat is correct. And if I had not done the job that night, I would not have known where that bear figurine was...\nPhoenix:\n(I see...)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Was the testimony just now of any importance?\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe testimony just now has made one thing clear. And that is...

I trust my memory, and I believe I have made no mistakes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo your client was Adrian Andrews...?\nde Killer:\nThat is correct.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, he says the two of them met... But if they did, then there shouldn't be anything wrong with De Killer's testimony...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\n(Well, there doesn't seem to be anything strange this time around...)Mia:\nYou have to draw more information from him, but you can't draw his suspicion. If you can do that, you should be able to find a flaw in his testimony somewhere.Phoenix:\n(Talk about a delicate balance...)Phoenix:\nI would like to go over this one more time. You met Adrian Andrews at a bar and took the request at that time?de Killer:\nYes, that is correct.Phoenix:\nAnd that's when you thought \"he\" was trustworthy...de Killer:\nHow many times must I repeat myself? Yes, that is correct.Phoenix:\nI'm sorry, but that is an impossible tale.de Killer:\nWh-What!?Phoenix:\nShelly de Killer. You have never met the real Adrian Andrews!de Killer:\n...! Wh-Why would you say that...?Phoenix:\nBecause you made one very big slip-up... ...about her.de Killer:\nSo what is the issue... ...! Wh-What did you say just now...? About \"her\"...?Phoenix:\nIf you had ever met Adrian Andrews in person... One look would have told you that she is a woman!de Killer:\nOhoooooo!Judge:\nO-Order! Order in the court! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?Phoenix:\nThis witness testified to the following: That he always meets face to face with his clients when taking their request.Judge:\nBut he has never met Adrian Andrews in person...Edgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor! That is exactly the point! That means Mr. de Killer's client could not have been Ms. Adrian Andrews!de Killer:\nUgnnn...Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth... I understand your logic on this one... However... Why would the assassin make such a basic mistake?Edgeworth:\nI believe it has to do with her name, Your Honor.Judge:\nHer name?Edgeworth:\nYes. Adrian Andrews is, without a doubt, a very androgynous name.Judge:\nHmm... Yes, I see...Edgeworth:\nUnluckily for Mr. de Killer, the entire time he was on the stand, no one had stated Adrian Andrews' gender. And so, he simply picked the wrong gender to go with.Judge:\nWh-What... What is going on...? Shelly de Killer! This court demands an explanation!de Killer:\nUmm... I-I think somehow... I must have mixed up this client with another.Edgeworth:\nSo does that mean you remember something different now?de Killer:\nYes, of course. Please, if you would allow me to testify once more...Phoenix:\n(Argh! I know he's just going to spit out more lies.)Judge:\nVery well. But this time, please give us the truth, and nothing but the truth!Witness Testimony-- Request Taking, Pt. 2 --de Killer:\nYes, now I remember. I took that request by mail.\nThere have been times when I took a job without having met my client.\nThe request was for the murder of Juan Corrida and 2 or 3 other small things.\nWhen I saw the name at the end of the letter, I thought my client to be a man.Judge:\nHmm... So you took this job through a letter...Phoenix:\n(He didn't mention anything about a letter in his earlier testimony... Which means he is definitely lying!)Mia:\nBe careful, Phoenix. If you break the assassin's testimony completely, it's over for us.Phoenix:\nI know... I can't make him suspicious. But... I think we're OK -- like we can do this. (As long as he's standing there across from me... No matter how strong of a punch I throw, he'll counter it...)Judge:\nNow then, let's begin the cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Request Taking, Pt. 2 --de Killer:\nYes, now I remember. I took that request by mail.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut didn't you just say that you always meet your clients?\nde Killer:\nYes, I suppose I did say that. However, there are some clients for whom a meeting is simply not possible.\nPhoenix:\nBut didn't you meet your client this time?\nde Killer:\nNo, I did not.\nPhoenix:\nOh, come now. Let's stop with this game of cat and mouse.\nde Killer:\nUsing your silkiest voice is not going to work on me.\nPhoenix:\nAlright then, just cough it up and confess!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! You can't badger a witness with such harsh words!\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nJudge:\nYou're a lawyer, so behave like one and present evidence instead of mindlessly yelling. Now then, do you have any proof that Mr. de Killer met with his client?\n\n\n\nI have proof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(We've come this far! I have to try to prove something here!) Very well, I will show you proof.\nMia:\nAre you sure about this, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nHere is the proof that the witness met with his client, who wished Mr. Corrida dead!\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo! What do you think!?\nde Killer:\n... You may say, \"What do you think?\"... However, I am for all intents and purposes, a transceiver radio.\nPhoenix:\nOh... That's right, you can't actually see the evidence...\nde Killer:\nWell, I don't think this was one I needed to see. I can hear the pure silence in the air there.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! How could I have picked the wrong piece at a time like this!?)\nJudge:\nHmm... In any case, let's continue with the testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't have any proof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, Your Honor. Unfortunately, I don't have any proof.\nJudge:\nHmm, I see. Then your line of questioning was just another waste of time.\nEdgeworth:\nSadly for us, Your Honor, that is the nature of Wright and wrong.\nLeads back to cross-examinationde Killer:\nThere have been times when I took a job without having met my client.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why could you not meet certain clients?\nde Killer:\nRecently, I have been receiving more requests. If I met each and every client, I would lose some nice business opportunities.\nJudge:\nNice business opportunities?\nde Killer:\nOn top of which, the times have changed. It is now the age of information and computers, correct? Well I have joined the times, and now take requests via electronic mail.\nJudge:\nElectronic mail? Do you have to mail that in a special insulated envelope?\nde Killer:\nAh, I'm very sorry. I despise the shortening of words. What I meant by electronic mail is what is commonly referred to as \"e-mail\".\nJudge:\n... E-mail...?\nPhoenix:\n(In a contest of mimicry, the judge would beat a parrot, hands down...)\nEdgeworth:\n*ahem* Anyway, so you took this job without having met your client, and...?de Killer:\nThe request was for the murder of Juan Corrida and 2 or 3 other small things.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nTwo or three other things...?\nde Killer:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what were these \"other things\"?\nde Killer:\nA few other things that have nothing to do with this case.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do...? Should I let him slide with that...? It'd be really bad if I push his buttons the wrong way and he gets mad...)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhether or not they're related to this case is for the court to decide.\nde Killer:\n...Mr. Attorney.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nde Killer:\nEverything I have said from the beginning has been nothing but beneficial to your client. Which is why I wonder what is pushing you to continue with this cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nde Killer:\nCould it be... That you are planning to betray your own client...?\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's...\nde Killer:\nI smell the stench of a backstabber. And should you turn out to be one...\nPhoenix:\nW-W-Wait! (Uh oh... This is looking really bad! I shouldn't press my luck. Alright, I have to think. Is this worth pursuing...?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWitness, this is a very important matter. Please cooperate and tell us what these other \"jobs\" your client requested were...\nde Killer:\n... If it's truly that important, I suppose I don't have much of a choice. The bear figurine.\nPhoenix:\nThe bear figurine...?\nde Killer:\nAfter the assassination of the target, I was to find that figurine. I was told that this job was just as important as the actual killing.\nPhoenix:\nAnd... Where was that figurine...?\nde Killer:\nIt was inside Mr. Corrida's suitcase.\nPhoenix:\nAnd then... what did you do next?\nde Killer:\nI handed it over to my client right away.\nPhoenix:\nYou gave it to your \"client\"... Interesting.\nJudge:\nHmm... This information certainly sounds important to me. Witness, please include what you just stated in your testimony.\nde Killer:\nAs you wish.\nAdds statement \"One of these was to find the bear figurine and to give it to Adrian Andrews.\"\n\n\n\n\nLet it go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(De Killer sounds like one sharp man... I should try to find a better way to do this without making him suspicious.)\nJudge:\nLet's continue with the testimony. Witness, if you please.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nLet it go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(De Killer sounds like one sharp man... I should try to find a better way to do this without making him suspicious.)\nJudge:\nLet's continue with the testimony. Witness, if you please.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nTwo or three other things...?\nde Killer:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what were these \"other things\"?\nde Killer:\nA few other things that have nothing to do with this case.\nJudge:\nHmm...de Killer:\nOne of these was to find the bear figurine and to give it to Adrian Andrews.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI found this figurine at Mr. Engarde's mansion. If you gave it to Ms. Andrews, then what was it doing there?\nde Killer:\nI was waiting for her there. That was also part of the plan to frame Mr. Engarde, I'm sure...\nJudge:\nHmm... That makes a lot of sense. Well, Mr. Wright? Do you have any problems with this piece of testimony?\n\n\n\nThere is a contradiction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(So De Killer says he gave the figurine to Ms. Andrews. But I know somewhere in that statement there is a contradiction... And yet... I know that if I present something trivial here...)\nMia:\n...He will cut the connection on his end. If you want to make a strong point, Phoenix... You have to present strong evidence.\nPhoenix:\n(She's right. So now what, Dr. Wright!?)\n\n\n\nPresent evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWitness, let's go over this one more time. You gave Ms. Andrews the bear figurine. And she told you to take the bear and wait for her at Engarde Mansion. Is that correct?\nde Killer:\nYes... Where are you going with this...?\nPhoenix:\nWell, I think maybe you might have remembered a few things incorrectly.\nJudge:\nWh-What!?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(This is a battle of wits! I can't let up on him!) I don't think it is possible for Ms. Andrews to have been the recipient of this bear!\n\n\n\nPresent Figurine or Celeste's Suicide Note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Shelly de Killer.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo! What do you think!?\nde Killer:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWitness!\nde Killer:\n...\nPhoenix:\nMr. de Killer!\nde Killer:\nOh, I'm sorry. I went to visit the water closet for a second.\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nde Killer:\nMr. Attorney, I think it's time I stated this in terms even you can comprehend.\nPhoenix:\n!\nde Killer:\nIf you ask me any more of these pointless questions... There will be no mercy!\nPhoenix:\nUrk!\nde Killer:\nNow, I would like to move on with my testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nThink it over again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It's no use... As long as I can't put my finger on the central problem here, pressing this witness any more would be extremely dangerous!)\nJudge:\nHmm... It appears that Mr. Wright has no problems. Well then, witness. Please continue.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nNo objections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It's no use... As long as I can't put my finger on the central problem here, pressing this witness any more would be extremely dangerous!)\nJudge:\nHmm... It appears that Mr. Wright has no problems. Well then, witness. Please continue.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPresent Figurine or Celeste's Suicide Note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Shelly de Killer.\"de Killer:\nWhen I saw the name at the end of the letter, I thought my client to be a man.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're saying that you never saw your client's face. Not even once?\nde Killer:\n... I did... Once. It was when I went to give my client the figurine.\nJudge:\nHmm. Yes, I see.\nde Killer:\nBut Ms. Andrews was wearing a mask at the time.\nJudge:\nA mask?\nPhoenix:\n(The Nickel Samurai mask, I'm guessing...?)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... What do you have to say about this? Do you have any problems with this piece of testimony?\n\n\n\nThere is a contradiction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOne thing does sort of stick out at me, Your Honor. Witness. I think you most definitely saw your client's face.\nde Killer:\n...\nPhoenix:\nLet's recall Mr. Powers' testimony.\n\n\nPowers:\nAfter the award ceremony, I went by myself to Matt's room. Matt was standing there in front of his room, still in his Nickel Samurai costume. Matt gave the bellboy a tip.\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou received quite a large roll of cash from Mr. Engarde! And at the time, he was not wearing his Nickel Samurai mask!\nde Killer:\nOhoooooo!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Yes, now that you mention it, I do remember that...\nJudge:\nWitness!\nde Killer:\n... Yes, that night I did wander the floor as a bellboy. I received plenty of tips that night for carrying juice to the various rooms. Is that so wrong?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nde Killer:\nThe man who gave me that tip was not my client. He was probably just a very generous person.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but sadly, we are not nearly so generous here. If I could receive large rolls of cash by simply bringing people things on trays... Then why on Earth would I stand around here prosecuting!?\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu... And isn't his salary more than enough for one man...?)\nJudge:\nHmm... And where is your evidence that the large roll of cash was not in fact, a tip...? Come, Mr. Edgeworth. Show me the money!\nEdgeworth:\nWhaaaat!?\nde Killer:\nMr. Attorney.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nde Killer:\nYou know, I think your line of questioning has been a little strange... In fact, I would say you don't seem to believe Ms. Andrews is my client.\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, it's not like that at all. I just think lies aren't a good thing, you know...?\nde Killer:\nOh, I know and agree. Lies are not a good thing at all...\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nde Killer:\nI think we are on the same page now, aren't we Mr. Attorney? Remember. If I feel threatened in any way... I am free to cut contact at any time...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry! Please forgive my foolishness!\nJudge:\nHmm... If only you were this apologetic all the time... Anyway, I do not see a huge contradiction here. Therefore, you may continue, witness.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nNo objections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I can pull something out of what he said... But it would be real bad if I did something and made him mad over something trivial!) There are no problems with the testimony, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nLeads back to cross-examinationMia:\nWe've pretty much reached the end of our rope here...Phoenix:\nHuh? Seems like we're still OK to me.Mia:\nAnd that's exactly what is so bad. At the rate we're going, we will end up completely destroying De Killer's lie. If we do that... You already know how serious of a situation that will put us in.Phoenix:\nO-Oh yeah...

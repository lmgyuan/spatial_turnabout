The moment you've all been waiting for! Who will be this year's Grand Prix Champion? Who will be our \"Hero of Heroes\"!? Will it be last year's runner-up, Jammin' Ninja!? Or maybe Captain Saipan all the way from the lovely tropical island of Saipan!? I see the students of a certain Starry School are raring to win! And Global Hero Onyankopon doesn't want to go home without the prize! We hope Lady Luck is with all our heroes tonight! And now! The winner of the third annual Hero of Heroes Grand Prix... IS ME!!\nWhoooooooooa! The true hero of the night has appeared in our midst! It looks like this year's Grand Prix goes to this fantastic warrior! The Nickel Samurai! Too bad, Jammin' Ninja. Looks like the title eluded you again this year!\nMarch 20, 7:42 PMGatewater HotelViola Hall\nMaya:\nAlright! Yes! Did you hear that, Nick!? Did you!? The Nickel Samurai! He did it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.\nPowers:\nAh, I'm proud of the guy for doing the series justice.\nPearl:\nU-Um... So the person everyone was cheering for... I guess he got the prize?\nMaya:\nYup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? \"The Nickel Samurai\"!\nPearl:\nNo. Every Sunday, I only watch the Educational Channel's \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nOK, that's it! From now on, it's \"The Nickel Samurai\"! All the kids watch it!\nPearl:\nDo you like \"The Nickel Samurai\" too, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nNah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. But I do like \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nHey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed to watch it anymore! You're supposed to act your age and have interests that match. ...It's very important.\nMaya:\nAw, give it a rest, Pearly!\nPowers:\nLooks like I made the right choice in inviting everyone here. I'm glad you're all having a good time.\nMaya:\nAaaaah... It's like a dream!\nPowers:\nToo bad for the Jammin' Ninja, though. Last year, he lost to The Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo. I thought this might be his year...\nMaya:\nYeah... Oh, hey, did anyone else think that the Jammin' Ninja was a bit different today?\nPearl:\nDifferent? What do you mean?\nMaya:\nUm, well, he wasn't carrying his bright red guitar.\nPowers:\nHey, you're right! Strange he'd walk around without his signature guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh* I will never understand these people and their shows...) Anyway, Mr. Powers, thank you very much for tonight.\nPowers:\nA-Aw, it was nothing... I owe you one, so it's just my way of saying thanks.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! It's time to get going to the lobby! There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.\nPowers:\nAnd then, I heard there's going to be a press conference after that.\nPhoenix:\nA press conference? Is he going to make a speech about winning this year's prize?\nPowers:\nUh, well, not exactly... Something about the Nickel Samurai confessing something.\nPhoenix:\nConfessing...? Sounds pretty serious.\nMaya:\nArgh! Nick! COME ON! You don't want us to be the last ones there, do you!?\nPearl:\nYeah, Mr. Nick! Do you!?\nPhoenix:\n(Why me...? The show doesn't even start for another 20 minutes...)\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there.\nPowers:\nAnd behind those doors is an equally grand lobby.\nPearl:\nShall we go and take a look, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nHey, wait up! This grand dessert is calling to me... It's saying, \"Eat me now!\"\nWalls or ceiling\nPhoenix:\nThis sure is one luxurious hotel. Almost to the point of gaudy, with how it blends together everything \"fancy\" imaginable. (Speaking of fancy, didn't that bellboy give me something like that last year?)\nChandelier\nMaya:\nThat chandelier is really something, isn't it?\nPearl:\nI thought it was a kind of space ship...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. How about we get one of these for the office?\nPhoenix:\nOne of those hanging from our poor, weak ceiling? I don't think so.\nTables at back\nMaya:\nIf this is all a dream, I don't ever want to wake up! And all the directors and stars that were here to see the heroes, wow.\nPhoenix:\nI had no idea who most of them were.\nPearl:\nNeither did I.\nMaya:\nNick, you've got to cut that \"news only\" habit out. Your new show is going to be \"The Nickel Samurai!\" Every Sunday morning at 8! Oh, I know! We can watch it together starting next week! I'll come wake you up extra early to make sure, OK?\nPhoenix:\nAh, I'm fine... You know, you really don't have to on my account...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second.\nMaya:\nWell, shows like that are guaranteed to be good, you know?\nFront table\nMaya:\nWhat can I say? This is a really high-class hotel!\nPearl:\nI've never eaten this kind of salad before.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nMaya:\nDon't worry! Any leftovers belong in my happily awaiting stomach anyway!\nPhoenix:\nYou're such a glutton, Maya.\nPowers:\nAh, I lose this one to Maya. You sure can eat.\nMaya:\nWell, a growing girl needs her nutrients!\nPhoenix:\n(A growing girl? Exactly how big do you plan on getting...?)\nTalk\nWill Powers\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much for inviting us today.\nPowers:\nAww, it was nothing really. Guys like us don't get to come to a place like this often, so I thought I'd invite you all.\nMaya:\nHey, Mr. Powers! What have you been up to lately?\nPowers:\nWell, since \"The Pink Princess\" successfully wrapped up last month, I've been on a kid's exercise show... ...while wearing a rabbit mask over my face...\nMaya:\nOh, I see.\nPowers:\nI'm still really sorry about all the headaches I caused you that time, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nAh, well. What's done is done, so let's forget about it. (This is Will Powers. He's an action star. His popularity exploded when he was the Steel Samurai. And he was the first case Maya worked on with me.)\nMaya:\nIt's too bad you look scary, or people'd know you're a real softy who's good with kids. (Changed from [You can't tell by looking at you, but you're a really nice guy with a love of kids.] in the original release)\nPowers:\nUm, thanks. (Changed from [Ah, thanks.] in the original release)\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe they're going to make a movie based on the Nickel Samurai.\nMaya:\nI can't believe it either, but for a different reason!\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai. An epic story of one hero in a desperate fight against his arch-enemy, the Evil Magistrate in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo. And last year, they started a new series, \"The Nickel Samurai\". The new series seems to be a hit with the kids, too.\nPowers:\nI'm really attached to the Steel Samurai as a show, (Changed from [The Steel Samurai is a show I have a lot of strong feelings for,] in the original release) so I was hoping that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one... (Changed from [so I hoped that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nYeah, it's too bad... It'd been [sic] awesome to see you with the new actor, Matt Engarde. (Changed from [Yeah... It's too bad... It'd be great to see you on the show...] in the original release) He's super popular right now. (Changed from [With the new actor, Matt Engarde. He's super popular right now.] in the original release)\nPearl:\nMr. Un-gard...?\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Pearls doesn't know who he is.)\nMaya:\nThis year it's going to be the Nickel Samurai vs. the Jammin' Ninja at the box office!\nPhoenix:\n...Jammin' Ninja...? Who's that again?\nJammin' Ninja (appears after \"The Nickel Samurai\")\nPhoenix:\nSo who is this \"Jammin' Ninja\" again?\nMaya:\nHe's a hero, duh. His symbol is a bright red guitar he's always carrying.\nPhoenix:\n(A ninja who's always carrying around a bright red guitar...? How does that even work!?)\nMaya:\nWith a scarf around his neck and a guitar in hand, he rises to stardom in an ancient time.\nPhoenix:\nA ninja... Who becomes a star??\nMaya:\nYeah! A ninja who becomes a star!\nPowers:\nThere's a strong rivalry between the two of them. Global Studios' Nickel Samurai and Worldwide Studios' Jammin' Ninja. They even air at the same time.\nMaya:\nYou know what I heard? I heard those two don't get along at all. The Nickel Samurai's Engarde and the guy who plays the Jammin' Ninja, I mean.\nPhoenix:\n(The Nickel Samurai speaks French!? Oh, you mean Matt Engarde, the actor...) I guess even the world of heroes isn't a sparkling, happy place.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPowers:\nAh, I really owe you one. If it wasn't for you guys, I don't know what would've happened. What you did... It was a real tight spot I was in, and you fought so hard to get me out. I don't care what happens. I'll never forget everything you've done for me.\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo, you're going to study to become a lawyer too. Am I right or am I right?\nMaya:\nUmm...\nPowers:\nIt must be real tough. There's all those thick books with hard words you have to read...\nMaya:\nUh, um... Well...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, yeah. Mr. Powers doesn't know that Maya's a spirit medium...)\nMaya:\nI thought he'd be able to tell by my clothes.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he thinks that you've got some strange hobby on the side or something.\nMaya:\n...Hey, wait a sec. What's that's supposed to mean!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo are you Maya's little sister?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but no.\nPowers:\nOh, then you must be Mr. Wright's little sister!\nPearl:\nAgain, I'm sorry, but...\nPowers:\nThen... Whose little sister are you?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but I'm an only child.\nPowers:\nOh, I see... S-Sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(Pearl looks so sad... She looks really sorry too...)\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, they're all shocked because then they figure out who I am.\nMaya:\nHmm... Well, I don't think you look scary.\nPearl:\nMe either. I think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Those two are making Mr. Powers tear up...)\nAnything else\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Thanks for taking the time to take it out and show it to me, but I'm really sorry, I don't know a thing about it.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nPhoenix:\nWow, what is with this place? Looks like I've stumbled into Oz or something. Way in the back, there's a sign for the bathroom. Maybe I should visit it while I can before the show starts... (Changed from [I bet we have a little time to look around before the show starts...] in the original release)\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...? Could it be that there's an action star who has a soft spot for teddy bears...? ...Nah, can't be.\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". \"Juan Corrida\"... His name just sounds like a star's name. I've heard it before, but I don't know anything about him at all.\nEnd of hallway\nPhoenix:\nThere are toilets in each room in this hotel, but since all sorts of events are held here, there are bathrooms for people who aren't staying here to use as well. Perfect for people like me, who can't afford a stay here in the first place...\nFlowers on right\nPhoenix:\n\"To Mr. Engarde From the Global Studio Staff\" Ah, it'd be nice if lawyers got flowers too. Something like, \"To Mr. Wright From All Your Grateful Clients\".\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\". \"Matt Engarde\"... I've heard that name before. Oh, yeah. Maya's always yammering about him like the obsessed fan she is...\nViola Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Viola Hall and visiting Hallway)\nPowers:\nSounds like the post-ceremony show is about to start.\nMaya:\nAlright! I'm so pumped! I wonder if he's going to show off his special move today? \"Nickel Samurai Smelting!\"\nPowers:\nActually, what I'm interested in most is the press conference.\nMaya:\nYou mean the \"big confession\" the Nickel Samurai's going to make after the show? So what is it? Don't you know what it's about, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nUh, well, I'm not the Steel Samurai anymore, so I don't have any idea.\nMaya:\nBah.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Ah, so I guess you are all going to the press conference then?\nMaya:\nYeah, of course!\nPowers:\nIf that's the case, then here, take these tickets so you can get in.\nPress Conference Ticket added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much. Well, let's get going to the lobby.\nPearl:\nIt looks like it's over this way, Mr. Nick!\nMaya:\nOK! For great justice!\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPowers:\nThey called this so suddenly that something about it just seems off, you know?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the press conference?\nPowers:\nYeah. He said, \"There's something I'd like to confess if I win.\" I heard he faxed his request for a conference in to the office only yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nYesterday... (Yeah, that is kind of sudden.)\nPowers:\nBut I guess his manager set everything up somehow, so he was lucky.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Nice manager.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Only a really gaudy hotel would have such a large, gaudy lobby to match.\nPearl:\nAh, I think they're going to have the post-ceremony show over there.\nPhoenix:\nThey're using a compact stage, I see.\nMaya:\nOoh... I'm all ready to use my special \"Samurai Power\".\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks like she's ready to start a fight...)\nPA Notice:\nYour attention please, your attention please. The Nickel Samurai's Post-Ceremony Stage Show will not be held tonight due to unforeseen circumstances.\nMaya:\nWHAAAT!? WHYYYYY!?\nPhoenix:\nOww! You didn't have to pinch me! Pinch yourself if you don't believe it!\nPA Notice:\nWe are asking for everyone's cooperation at this time. So please stay where you are. ...This is a special request from the police.\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nP-Police? Did they just say the police?\nPowers:\nD-Do you want me to go check out what's going on?\nPhoenix:\nUm, wait, I'll come with you...\n???:\nFreeze! You two! Didn't you hear the announcement just now!? It just finished telling you not to move!\nMaya:\nTh-That voice... I've heard that voice somewhere before...\n???:\nHonestly, youth these days can't be bothered to listen to other people when they talk! Just the other day it was the same thing! There was a small footbridge with a sign next to it that said, \"Beware, Bridge Out!\" And along comes a snot-nosed little punk kid right up to the bridge. I tried to tell the boy the bridge was out and it was dangerous, but would he listen!? No, of course not! He said he'd be careful and only walk on the \"in\" part of the bridge since the \"out\" part is what was dangerous! I am not kidding you here! The kid said that and really meant it! WELL! I really let him have it then, and knocked him clear off of that bridge! Honestly, kids these days don't know right from wrong, I tell you!\nPowers:\nThis non-stop chatter...\nPhoenix:\nI-It can't be... ...Ms. Oldbag?\n???:\n...\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, you young whipper-snappers!? Do I know you!? ...Wait. YOU! You're Powers, aren't you!?\nPowers:\nY-Yeah. Um, about what happened back then...\nOldbag:\nYou didn't even get nominated this year, did you? (Changed from [You didn't get nominated last year either, did you?] in the original release) Oh, that's right. You're doing that children's exercise program, trying to play nice.\nPowers:\nAh, yeah, that's me. Thankfully I still have a job...\nOldbag:\nI love that show, and you're a hoot! You're the \"big brother\" character, right? Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You're that giant rabbit! (Changed from [Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You ended up with a rabbit face.] in the original release) What a work of art, but that's how it is, you know? I mean, if you didn't wear the mask, who knows how many TVs you'd break? Really, and shame on those kids exercising around you. They're getting what they deserve. This is why I thought you shouldn't be anywhere...\nPhoenix:\nUm... What are you doing here?\nOldbag:\nLook at my uniform and tell me you can't tell I'm a member of security!\nMaya:\nBut that outfit...\nOldbag:\nAnnoying, noisy brats get the blaster!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nSecond floor\nMaya:\nWow, it looks like there's a fancy restaurant on the second floor!\nPhoenix:\nYou STILL feel like eating?\nMaya:\nI mean, since we're here, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't pull the \"since we're here\" trick on me...)\nPearl:\nWhat a beautiful mansion. Do you live in this wonderful world every day, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, this is my first time in a place like this.\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to say these cameras were set up to cover the post-ceremony stage show.\nMaya:\nBut I wonder where everyone's gone, abandoning their cameras like this...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess something big must have happened...)\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage for the post-ceremony stage show.\nPowers:\nThere was supposed to be a press meeting after the show, but now...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like no one will hear what the Nickel Samurai had to confess after all.\nSeats\nMaya:\nWe're here, so we might as well take some pictures. OK, everyone, sit in a chair!\nPhoenix:\nBut we're all out of film...\nMaya:\nDon't worry about it. There's a zillion cameras over there we can borrow.\nPhoenix:\nHey, hey! You can't just go and \"borrow\" an expensive professional camera like that!\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nMaya:\nWhat incident? What did you do?\nOldbag:\nI didn't do anything, you young'un! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I plead the fifth.\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me!?\nOldbag:\nI thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.\nMaya:\nYou? A bodyguard?\nOldbag:\nFor your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles.\nMaya:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth?\nOldbag:\nBut...\nEdgeworth:\nThat sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me.\nOldbag:\nThat's what he said to me. What did I ever do to deserve that!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nWhat happened?\nMaya:\nUm... So, did something happen?\nOldbag:\nI don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those \"incidents\" happened again.\nPowers:\nA-An \"incident\"? Like a \"murder\" kind of \"incident\"?\nOldbag:\nMaybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, showers of blood are sure to follow. Bet you didn't know that! (Changed from [So wherever I go, a rain of blood will come pouring down. Bet you didn't know that!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUm, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake?\nOldbag:\nSilence, whippersnapper!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nThese eyes of mine are real pros now!\nPhoenix:\n\"Pros\"? Pros at doing what?\nOldbag:\nAt doing police work, of course! My eyes are like a hawk! And my professional eyes spot a messy incident! A messy, bloody incident! That's why I don't have time for you meddling kids and your petty little things!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\n...Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it? I don't like that devilish smile playing on your lips...\nMaya:\nLet's make like we're going to the bathroom, and check things out!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way. The police told us not go [sic] anywhere, remember?\nMaya:\nHuh!? How B-O-R-I-N-G! You're such a boring guy! You've got no motivation! No spirit!\nPearl:\nHuh? What? What's going on? Are you giving Mystic Maya trouble again, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Not you too, Pearls... Please don't stick your little nose into this one...)\nMaya:\nSo listen to this, Pearly. This one time at lawyer camp, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nO-OK! I get it! Let's go take a look.\nMaya:\nYay! I know you couldn't say no to me, Nick!\nPearl:\nThat's right. You'd walk over miles of hot coals for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That would be EVERY time we work a case together...)\nMaya:\nWell, what are we waiting for? Let's go already! You can come along too, Pearly.\nPearl:\nGoody! I get to come! I get to come!\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nThere's nothing really out of the ordinary here...\nPearl:\nAre you looking for the \"in-si-dent\" that the old lady was talking about? (Changed from [Are you looking for the 'something' that the old lady was talking about?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't look like it happened here. Well, we'd better go look somewhere else.\nMaya:\nAlright! Then, let's try...\nBellboy:\nExcuse me.\nMaya:\nAck!\nBellboy:\nAre you by chance, Ms. Maya Fey?\nMaya:\nUm, yeah... That's me.\nBellboy:\nYou have a phone call waiting for you at the front desk.\nMaya:\nA call? I wonder if it's someone from Kurain Village...\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mystic Maya?\nMaya:\nOh, nothing. You guys go on ahead and I'll be right there, OK? (Changed from [Oh, nothing. I'll just go on ahead to check it out, OK?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nOK.\nBellboy:\nRight this way, Ms. Fey.\nPearl:\nLet's go look somewhere else now, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, OK.\nPearl:\nThis is a little exciting... And a little scary...\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of.\nChandelier\nPearl:\nSo, that's called a \"shan-deh leer\", right?\nPhoenix:\nYup.\nPearl:\nWhat is that for? What does it do?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's for lighting up a room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? Can I look down now? My neck hurts...\nTables at the back\nPhoenix:\nThey haven't cleaned up all the food yet. There's a sad feeling hanging in the air now that the party is over...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nIt's a feast fit for a king!\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPearl:\nIt was the first time I ate that food. What was it called again? I think it started with \"key\". Key... Wee?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, a \"kiwi\".\nPearl:\nI don't know what to say. It's a sweet but sour fruit all in one.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nHotel Lobby\nExamine\nSecond floor\nPhoenix:\nA lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. But right now, the only thing filling this enormous room is anxiety about the murder. ...I really hope nothing else bad happens here...\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nThese cameras must belong to the press that came to cover the conference. They're all basically doing the same thing: staring at the empty stage.\nSeats\nPhoenix:\nSeats for the spectators of the post-ceremony show and the press conference. But it's too bad neither event is going to be held now.\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nPearl:\nUm, I guess you must have done something... um... \"deh-plor-ible\"...\nOldbag:\n\"Deplorable!?\" I would never do such a thing! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I plead the fifth.\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me!?\nOldbag:\nI thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.\nPearl:\n\"Body...guard?\"\nOldbag:\nFor your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles.\nPhoenix:\n(She's not talking about Edgeworth, is she...?)\nOldbag:\nBut...\nEdgeworth:\nThat sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me.\nOldbag:\nThat's what he said to me. What did I ever do to deserve that!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nWhat happened?\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, but what in the world just happened?\nOldbag:\nI don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those \"incidents\" happened again.\nPowers:\nA-An \"incident\"? Like a \"murder\" kind of \"incident\"?\nOldbag:\nMaybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, showers of blood are sure to follow. Bet you didn't know that!

TOLD. YOU. I get people the info they want! Which means that I've got a right to know!\nNope! Don't care who you are, pal, we're still investigating, so you can't go in!\nWhat's yer problem!? Just ya wait! It'll be all over the morning paper! \"Scruffy Detective's Secret Scandal Revealed!\" You'll see! I'll git ya back!\nPearl:\nThose two sound pretty serious...\nPhoenix:\n(That southern accent can only mean...)\nHey, Wright!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey... Lotta...\nLotta:\nCome on, do a gal a favor and tell this cop I'm just doin' my job and I've got rights...\nGumshoe:\nAh, YOU!\nPhoenix:\nAh... Detective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, help a guy out! Tell her that only the police are allowed here! This is the scene of a murder, so she should leave this to us pros...\nPearl:\nA... A murder!?\nGumshoe:\nAw, shoot! Me and my big mouth!\nLotta:\nSee! I knew it! My gut instinct told me so! I always trust my gut! A murder, it said! And that's what it is! A genuine murder!\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, wait...\nYeehaw, a murder! Of a big star, no less!\nGumshoe:\nOh, man... I'm in trouble now...\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nSo... Detective Gumshoe... A murder...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, no, that's not it. I got my facts mixed up for a second there, pal.\nPearl:\nU-Um... Mr. Nick? Is the dead person the Nickel Samurai...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Why do you ask?\nPearl:\nWell, Mystic Maya was rooting for him, so...\nGumshoe:\nIt wasn't the Nickel Samurai that got bumped. Actually, the Nickel Samurai is the one under suspicion of doing the bumping off...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nThe guy that died was this hero named the Jammin' Ninja, pal.\nPhoenix:\nThe Jammin' Ninja...\nLotta Hart\nPearl:\nUm, that woman with the big puffy hair that looks like cotton candy...\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Lotta?\nPearl:\nThat woman... She was there that time too, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat time?\nPearl:\n...When Mystic Maya did that channeling...\nPhoenix:\nOh, that time... Well, Lotta's a journalist, so that's why she was there.\nPearl:\nJer-nal-ist...\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like she was hanging around here before the murder happened.\nPhoenix:\n\"Hanging around\"...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, hiding in wait in front of the Jammin' Ninja's door, pal.\nPhoenix:\nB-But why would she...?\nGumshoe:\nShe wouldn't tell me, pal. Just said something about \"Gettin' my big scoop\"...\nPhoenix:\n(Scoop? What sort of news could she be after...?)\nThe victim (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nSo the victim was the Jammin' Ninja?\nPearl:\nMr. Jammin' Ninja...?\nGumshoe:\nHe was on a really popular rival TV show to \"The Nickel Samurai\".\nPearl:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nThe victim was the action star, Juan Corrida. He got a huge push and rode the express train to stardom. I mean, even I know who he is!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, even I recognize his face...)\nGumshoe:\nBut I heard lately that Matt Engarde's been taking the wind out of his sail. I'm telling you, pal, as far as who's popular, those two are hogging all the limelight.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess there's no space for Mr. Powers at all, huh... Poor guy...)\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde... Um... That's the Nickel Samurai, right...?\nGumshoe:\nYup. I mean, no! You've got to say it with more umph! \"The Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n...Anyway, so now that Juan Corrida's gone, that means Mr. Engarde has the whole stage to himself, wouldn't you say?\nGumshoe:\nI wouldn't bet on it, pal. We can't have that happen, you know?\nPhoenix:\n\"Can't have that happen\"? (What's that supposed to mean, I wonder...)\nArrested? (appears after presenting Matt Engarde profile)\nPhoenix:\nWh-Why was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's not something I can tell you. We just started the investigation, so we don't want any leaks.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like yet another \"Steel Samurai\" hero is in hot water...)\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick... If Mystic Maya knew about this...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know. She'd make me take this case... I know...\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI was really shocked by what happened to her in that one case. I didn't know she had such an awesome power!\nPearl:\nAwesome power...?\nGumshoe:\nI thought maybe I should do some self-improvement and take up a hobby. So I went out and bought some Morning Glory seeds and planted them, pal.\nPhoenix:\n...That's a good way to improve yourself.\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. Well, it's nothing really...\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nThat girl is number three on my \"People I've Seen A Lot Of Lately\" list.\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then who's number one...?\nGumshoe:\nAs if you need to ask. It's YOU, pal!\nPhoenix:\nA-Ah... So who's number two?\nGumshoe:\nMaya Fey. ...But it looks like she's not around this time.\nPearl:\nIt must be nice to be such good friends with each other, isn't it Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think that's the real meaning of Detective Gumshoe's list...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nI look good! I think I've lost some weight, pal!\nPhoenix:\nIt's only wishful thinking.\nGumshoe:\nWishful thinking, huh? ... In that case, I wishfully think I've lost some weight!\nPhoenix:\n(I wishfully think he might face the facts one day...)\nGumshoe:\nLately, I've been on the instant noodles only diet, pal!\nJuan Corrida profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm not a real fan of action shows or anything... But I know who Juan Corrida and Matt Engarde are.\nPhoenix:\nYou can't talk about one without talking about the other, I guess.\nGumshoe:\nThey even debuted around the same time. So they have this real fiery rivalry with each other. Kinda like you and me, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(I never knew he thought of me as a rival...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nThe Nickel Samurai! He really took the Grand Prix tonight!\nPhoenix:\nMaya's a big fan of his.\nGumshoe:\nReally? ...Oh, I'm sorry then.\nPearl:\nWhy are you sorry?\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde was just arrested, pal. ...On suspicion of murdering Juan Corrida.\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nAny evidence\nPhoenix:\nWould you take a look at this for me?\nGumshoe:\nListen, pal... I'm not leaking any info about the evidence to you this time. If I do, my salary's really gonna get it... And then I won't even be able to get those instant noodles down at the discount market!\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nDo you know this person?\nGumshoe:\nYou meet a lot of people as a detective, pal. So we make extra sure to not forget people because that's our job. ...Now, having said that, I don't remember ever seeing this person before.\nPearl:\nWhich means that you're kind of forgetful, aren't you Mr. Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThat's not what it means... Not exactly anyway...\nAfter clearing \"The victim\" and \"Arrested?\" Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Hallway:\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPowers:\nHey! So what's going on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Juan Corrida has been killed.\nPowers:\nWh-Wh-What!? Juan is... He's...!?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde.\nPowers:\nY-You're joking, right!?\nPhoenix:\nNope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja.\nPowers:\nOoogh... Not again... I feel sick.\nPearl:\n\"Again\"...?\nPhoenix:\n...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls.\nPowers:\nI still can't believe... No way... No way Matt would...\nPhoenix:\n(...? What's Mr. Powers got in his hand...?)\nPowers:\n...Oh, before I forget... This... This is for you, Mr. Wright. I got this from the bellboy that came by earlier.\nRadio Transceiver received from Mr. Powers.\nPhoenix:\n...For me...? But why?\nPowers:\nI don't know. All he said was it was for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney.\nTalk\nMatt and Juan\nPowers:\nMatt is the most energetic and active actor out there right now. The Nickel Samurai really sealed his place as a pop idol, but... he kept adding fuel to the fire of his rivalry with Juan anyway.\nPearl:\nMr. Juan... He's the Jammin' Ninja, right?\nPowers:\nThose two would butt heads over everything they could think of. But I'd say that Matt was the one who almost always came out on top.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess some people only know how to relate to others by butting heads like a ram...)\nPowers:\nJuan said that he'd take Matt on this time too, so he joined a rival TV show.\nPearl:\nAnd that was \"The Jammin' Ninja\"...?\nPowers:\nThe stylish Nickel Samurai and the burning Jammin' Ninja... Well, things turned messy real fast with those two using their shows for their \"war\". And the final tally... Look around... It's pretty obvious how things ended up.\nPhoenix:\n(Matt even won the Grand Prix this year... The final win over his rival, I guess...)\nPress conference\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde was going to hold a press conference, wasn't he?\nPowers:\nThat's what I heard. Though if you wanted to get technical about it, it was the Nickel Samurai's conference.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai's...?\nPowers:\nYeah. He was supposed to wear his costume and give the press conference that way.\nPhoenix:\nHe was going to be in costume...? But why? (Changed from [So he was supposed to be in-costume...? But why?] in the original release)\nPowers:\nI'm not sure... They don't keep me in the loop anymore.\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nPowers:\nIt was almost right after you guys left. An old man who's a bellboy at this hotel showed up.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when he told you to give this to me...?\nPowers:\nYeah...\nPhoenix:\n(Why... Why give me this transceiver...?)\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nHey, where did Maya go off to?\nPhoenix:\nShe got a phone call.\nPowers:\nOh yeah, that's right. She was heading for the front desk just now. She sure stands out in a crowd, doesn't she?\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, then they're all shocked because they figure out who I am...\nPearl:\nI think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Mr. Powers is getting teary eyed.)\nJuan Corrida profile\nPowers:\nHe debuted around the same time as Matt in everything, you know.\nPearl:\nReally?\nPowers:\nYeah, it started out small... First it was singing contests, then swimming competitions... Then it was bowling tournaments, and then it was who could throw the best New Year's parties... Juan was always trying to one-up Matt. But lately, those two were escalating to more and more dangerous things... I thought that no good would come of it all, so I began to worry.\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad Juan's story ended so soon...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nPowers:\nMatt's younger than me, but you can practically see his star potential.\nPearl:\nHis star po-ten-shial...?\nPowers:\nI got his autograph the other day.\nPhoenix:\n...Feels kind of wrong now, doesn't it?\nPowers:\nI don't care what people say! Matt didn't kill Juan! I know he didn't!\nAny other profile\nPowers:\nUmm... I'm honored you're asking me, But I have no idea who this person is. Umm... Sorry...\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPearl:\nUm... I was just wondering... Where's Mystic Maya? She's been gone a long time.\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, she was only going to answer a phone call...)\nPearl:\nMaybe she got lost. I'll take a quick look around for her.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nPearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I... I'm not sure... (It's coming from this transceiver...) (Changed from [Did this transceiver just...?] in the original release)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, hello? Wright here...\n???:\nIs this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney?\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are...!?\n???:\nYou don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMaya:\nHeeelp! Niiiiick!\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\nMaya...?\n???:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Wouldn't you agree that the more important issue is the fate of the girl?\nPhoenix:\n(Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?) Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?\n???:\nCome now. Don't fall apart on me yet.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This... No! This can't be!)\n???:\nNow that I have your attention, Mr. Attorney, I have a modest proposal for you. If you do what I require, then I will return to you your valuable \"item\" unharmed. ...What is this called again in your fancy lawyer terms?\nPhoenix:\n...\"Kidnapping for ransom\"...\n???:\nYes, that's it. This is a kidnapping.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nPhoenix:\n(M-My sight... Everything's fading away... Maya... Maya... Maya's been kidnapped!)\n???:\n...--re you there? Mr. Attorney, are you there? (Changed from [You there? Mr. Wright, are you there?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nH-How much!? How much do you want!?\n???:\nVery good, Mr. Attorney. I'm glad you have such a good grasp of the situation.\nPhoenix:\nHurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya--\n???:\nMoney is not what I seek.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\n???:\nWhat I want is a certain verdict. I would like a complete acquittal.\nPhoenix:\nComplete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!?\n???:\nI am not the person you will be representing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\n???:\nYou are currently at the Gatewater Hotel, are you not? And I know that a murder has just taken place there.\nPhoenix:\nJuan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde...\n???:\nYou are, as expected, quite on top of things, Mr. Attorney. Now then. What I want is very simple. I want you to obtain a complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nM-Matt Engarde? But why?\n???:\nHe did not kill anyone. I can attest to that. However...\nPhoenix:\nH-However!? However what!?\n???:\nHowever, someone is framing him for the murder. A very smart someone who is setting him up to take the fall...\nPhoenix:\n... (If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?)\n???:\nYou are, of course, at liberty to take me at my word or not. (Changed from [You are, of course, at liberty to believe me or not.] in the original release) However, there is one thing you can take as fact. Right now, your very precious \"item\" is with me, in my possession.\nMaya:\nMmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\n???:\nYou have two days. Of course, tonight, he will be in questioning with the police. But the trial is in two days. At that trial, you will win a not guilty verdict. Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nO-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!?\n???:\nYes, exactly. I don't believe I was wrong in choosing you, so don't let me down.\nPhoenix:\nAagh!\n???:\nOh, yes, that's right. Now that I am playing the role of the kidnapper, I can't pass up this chance to say, \"And don't even think about callin' the cops!\" ...Hmm, not great, but you get the idea.\nPhoenix:\nD-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!?\n???:\nAlright, I'll tell you that much. My name is... ...De Killer.\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Wh-Where is Mystic Maya!?\nPhoenix:\n...She's been kidnapped.\nPearl:\nN-No... ... It's all my fault! If only I had gone with Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault, Pearls.\nPearl:\nBut it is! It is! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nPowers:\nMr. Wright... I think we... I think we should tell the police what it's [sic] going on...!\nPhoenix:\n(No! We can't do that! If we do, who knows what will happen to Maya...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What about the detective we saw earlier...?\nPhoenix:\n(...Detective Gumshoe!) Yes, that's it! Wait here, and I'll be right back!\nPowers:\nAlright! I'll take care of Pearl while you're away!\nHallway\nGumshoe:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANSOM!?\nPhoenix:\nShhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nGumshoe:\nWait, the deal is \"complete acquittal\" in exchange for Maya, you mean...? Then this means Matt Engarde is obviously the killer, pal! No doubt about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent...\nGumshoe:\nYou really believe what a KIDNAPPER tells you, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd on top of everything else, there's all this evidence we keep finding.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nThe forensics team's having a field day back there. (Changed from [The guys with the eagle eyes are really lapping it up like they just caught a huge fish.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nGumshoe:\nBut it's strange. There's so much evidence that it feels like something's wrong.\nPhoenix:\nThere's too much evidence? Is that possible? (Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being \"set-up\"...?)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, looks like you won't be leaving here tonight, pal. Just sit tight and cooperate with the investigation. Tomorrow you can start yours.\nPhoenix:\n...A-Alright... (Isn't there another way...?)\nGumshoe:\nWe've also got to be careful about pushing the kidnapper the wrong way.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right...\nDate:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0???\nMaya:\nNnngh... Oww, my head... (Wh-Where... Where am I!? I wonder if I'm still in that hotel... Wh-What happened to me...?) Nick... Pearly! ... (Come on, you guys. This isn't funny anymore...)\n...*ka-click*...\n???:\nI see you have awoken.\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you!?\n???:\nMe? ...I am known as \"De Killer\".\nMaya:\n\"D-De Killer\"!? You mean like an \"ASSASSIN\"!? (I... I'm too young to die!)\n???:\nDon't worry. You are not my target. ...For now anyway.\nMaya:\nA-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nick! Nick! Where are you!? ...Help me...\n???:\nYes, that's right. Only one person can save you now, and that is Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\n...Huh? Wh-What? Nick... Nick's going to save me...?\n???:\nCalm down and be a good girl. Think of this as a business transaction.\nMaya:\nA... A business transaction?\n???:\nI am going to contact him now. I hope you'll cooperate and play your assigned role well.\nMaya:\n...Nick... What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearly... (Changed from [What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearls...] in the original release) ...Sis...\n???:\n... Is this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney? ... You don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with...

Let's hurry and go see Mr. Engarde!\nPhoenix:\nWe have to wait a bit, Pearls. Visiting hours don't start until 9 AM, so...\nPearl:\nOh, I see. Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I had gone with you... (Changed from [Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I went with you that time...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls... She's been like this since last night... We managed to get home somehow, yesterday evening... Thanks to Detective Gumshoe gently holding her by the hand and leading her here... But by the looks of it, I don't think Pearls got any sleep at all last night.)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mystic Maya... She's alright, right!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she's alright. Either way, I'm going to save her. You can trust me on that.\nPearl:\nPlease... Please... Help her...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm only able to stay this calm and collected... Because Pearls is doing the crying for the both of us...)\nExamine\nAnywhere\nPhoenix:\n...No matter where I look in this familiar space I call my office... No, I can't let my mind wander now!

I have a thought...\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nPearl:\nYou're going to represent Mr. Engarde... aren't you?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I don't really seem to have a choice.\nPearl:\nUm, but what if... What if he... ...is the real murderer? What would you do then, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWould you fight to get a not guilty for a murderer to save Mystic Maya...?\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Let's talk to Mr. Engarde first, OK? ...We can think all the bad things we want, but it doesn't change a thing.\nPearl:\nY-Yeah, you're right... I'm sorry. I... I can't stop thinking about it...\nMaya's situation\nPhoenix:\nPearls... You're really worried about Maya, aren't you?\nPearl:\nI... I don't have anyone else left in this world.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean...?\nPearl:\nMy family's all gone...\nPhoenix:\n(...Her family...)\nPearl:\nMy father... He left my mother and the village behind and went away.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry...\nPearl:\nAnd... my mother... She did that thing... all for me...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nMystic Maya...

How are you today?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI know this situation might be a little tough for you...\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... We're...\nEngarde:\nOh, sorry dude...\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nI already signed up...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me...?\nEngarde:\nI already have life insurance. I signed up a long time ago cause my job is, you know...\nPhoenix:\n... Oh! No no no... We're not insurance salespeople!\nEngarde:\nReally...? Dude, I really don't need that right now either.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nFire extinguishers. I mean, this building isn't my house, so...\nPhoenix:\n... No no no... We're not here to sell you fire extinguishers either! I'm a lawyer. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nEngarde:\nA lawyer...? ... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my manager, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nThe Nickel Samurai sure is a strange person, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(I think \"strange\" is an understatement.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. You're just in time.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\nEngarde:\nYou're a lawyer dude, right? My manager's looking for a good one right now, so how about it?\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! This is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to make him let me take his case! I have to!)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera. Mr. Engarde keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nSorry to intrude, but I would like to ask you a few personal questions.\nEngarde:\nUm, that's OK, but dude, my autobiography's coming out soon, so... If I say stuff without the publisher's approval, then I'm gonna be in real hot water... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my publisher, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde is so lucky! He has so many people he can talk to.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... I don't know if he actually has anyone he can really talk to...)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. Like I thought, the publisher said it'd be \"real bad\" if I said anything, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(Does he have a mind of his own!?)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, I would like to ask you about the murder...\nEngarde:\nOh, are you covering this for a tabloid as a side job, dude? Um, um... Well, if you want my statement on this, you should ask through my staff...\nPhoenix:\nNo no no... I'm not asking on behalf of a tabloid...\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the president of the studio, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nIs he alright, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(If we're talking about Mr. Engarde's brain here, I wouldn't put my money on it.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. The studio president said, \"Even Neo Mt. Fuji itself knows that I'm not the murderer!\"\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? What's \"Neo Mt. Fuji\"...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a mountain in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo; the city the Nickel Samurai protects.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, this is an attorney's badge.\nEngarde:\nDude, I'm sorry, but I don't have the free time to be looking at things like that.\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nEngarde:\nI'm much too busy with Nickel Samurai stuff right now.\nEngarde:\nI don't have the time to take a lawyer's correspondence course...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does he believe I'm a salesman!? Insurance, then extinguishers... Now this!!)\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\n...? What's that?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a ticket for the press conference. You were going to give one after winning the Grand Prix, right?\nEngarde:\nHuh? Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. While you were in costume, no less. ([in costume] hyphenated in the original release)\nEngarde:\nUm, I never heard anything like that, dude. I only heard about the stage show. I always leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't know...? That's odd...)\nRadio Transceiver\nPearl:\n...Mr. Nick? What are you going to do with that?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know yet, but I figured I could at least show it to him...\nEngarde:\nIs that a transceiver? Hey, it looks like a real nice one, too.\nPhoenix:\nI got it as a \"present\" from someone.\nEngarde:\nHmm? Interesting.\nPhoenix:\nI've also been instructed to take your case.\nEngarde:\nIs that what you heard from the transceiver?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nEngarde:\nDude, that's terrible!

Is he a member of my fan club?\nPhoenix:\nThat's Mr. Powers. Isn't he supposed to be kind of like a mentor to you?\nEngarde:\nPowers...? Oh yeah! He's the guy on that kid's exercise program. I gave him an autograph just the other day.\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't see Mr. Powers as a mentor at all...)\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nMan, it's too bad he's dead...\nPhoenix:\nYou killed him... That's the most logical conclusion, don't you agree?\nEngarde:\nDude, what are you talking about!? You're making a huge mistake.\nPhoenix:\nIf that's such a mistake, then why did they issue an arrest warrant for you!?\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the guy in charge of this place, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nStars sure know a lot of people, don't they?\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that phone even really gets reception in here...)\nEngarde:\n...Um, I guess you're right about the warrant after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we might be making some progress here!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nEngarde:\nYeah... I'm such a handsome devil.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um, yeah...\nEngarde:\nAnd I'm way good at sports! Karate, tennis, judo, soccer, football, hockey, fencing...

Now you dudes use kids to pull in clients, too?\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't take me as your lawyer, then De Killer is going to...!\nEngarde:\n... Wait... What did you just say?\nPhoenix:\n\"De Killer\"...\nEngarde:\nD-De Killer!?\nPhoenix:\n(...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...)\nEngarde:\n... Alright, dude. I accept your terms.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEngarde:\nI'll let you represent me in court.\nPearl:\nW-We did it! We did it, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...)\nEngarde:\nGo ahead, ask me anything. I'll help out as much as I can...\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nEngarde:\nMan, I thank my lucky stars that people know my name.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're quite the hero, and you're in the national spotlight.\nPearl:\nI didn't know who he is... Does that mean I'm not a good citizen...?\nEngarde:\nAh, it's really great to be the Nickel Samurai. Dude, lately, I just keep on getting more and more popular.\nPhoenix:\n(True enough... \"The Nickel Samurai\" is very popular among high schoolers and secretaries right now. I guess Mr. Engarde has a way of catching the eyes of women...)\nEngarde:\nDo you know my motto? \"Refreshing like a spring breeze.\" That's what I am.\nPearl:\nA spring breeze...\nEngarde:\nThat's why this kind of scandal is disastrous, dude. I mean, even if I get out of here tomorrow, it's still gonna look bad.\nPhoenix:\n(But everyone loves a good scandal...) (Changed from [Everyone loves a good scandal...] in the original release)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me about your activities last night?\nEngarde:\nAfter I got the award, I took a break and went back to my room. I had that post-ceremony stage show to do. So I was in my Nickel Samurai costume.\nPhoenix:\nAnd you were alone the entire time?\nEngarde:\nMy manager was running around being busy, so yeah.\nPhoenix:\nBecause of the press conference you were supposed to have after the show?\nEngarde:\nI told you, dude. I have no idea about any press conference, alright?\nPhoenix:\n(That's strange... I thought the Nickel Samurai was going to confess something...)\nEngarde:\nAnyway, when I was leaving my room, that's when I noticed it was kinda noisy...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida was already dead at that time...?\nEngarde:\nYeah, that's what I gathered anyway from my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm beginning to gather that this guy can't do a thing on his own...) (Changed from [With the way he's always talking about his manager, it's as if she runs his life.] in the original release)\nEngarde:\nAnd that's when the detective in the green coat showed up. He searched me... And then, out of the blue, the dude arrested me.\nThe victim (appears after \"Matt Engarde\")\nPhoenix:\nAbout you and the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida, what sort of...\nEngarde:\nThat's got nothing to do with anything, dude. Man, with that face of his, you can't even tell he's the same age as me. And he wanted to try making a \"Jammin' Ninja\" movie, even though we all know it'd fail.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai still won in the end, right?\nEngarde:\nYeah. I took the Grand Prix by storm. So why would I, the winner, have any reason to kill the guy anyway? Dude, you'd think it'd be the other way around, you know?\nThe charge of murder (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know why you were arrested?\nEngarde:\nI guess maybe my full body search went badly.\nPhoenix:\nDid they find something on you?\nEngarde:\nThey found a button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nPhoenix:\nA button...?\nEngarde:\nI don't get it either. It was caught in the pleats of my samurai pants, or \"hakama\".\nPearl:\nAaah!\nEngarde:\nDude, I really think someone planted it there though. I'm serious.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that's what really happened...?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nPearl:\nLet's ask one last thing. Let's test Mr. Engarde to see if he really is innocent or not...\nPhoenix:\nW-We can do that...?\nPearl:\nYes. If you use this...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's Magatama!)\nPearl:\nHe won't be able to hide any secrets from you, Mr. Nick. I'm sure of it.\nPhoenix:\n(I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly.\nEngarde:\nWhat is it, dude?\nPhoenix:\nDid you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nPlease put the phone away and answer this question yourself.\nEngarde:\nAlright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWell, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nNothing. Not a chain or lock in sight.\nPearl:\nWhich means... I think it is alright to trust him.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.)\nEngarde:\nUm... The trial's tomorrow, right? I'm counting on you, dude.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 21, 11:34 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWell, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important...\nPearl:\nSo! So now what should we do!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer.\nPearl:\nOK! Then let's start looking!\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Actually, the crime happened at the recently completed hotel in the center of town, the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. ...Just how far are they going to expand their empire...?\nCharley the plant\nPearl:\nOh! I'll water it!\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK... I already did that...\nPearl:\n...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...)\nPoster\nPearl:\nThis is the Nickel Samurai... right?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's right.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!?\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.\nPearl:\nOh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either...\nPhoenix:\nI-It's OK, Pearls. Really.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh! I cleaned it up some more for you last night! ...Because I couldn't sleep...\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSince there were no Psyche-Locks, then that means we can trust Mr. Engarde to be innocent.\nPearl:\nI really feel much better knowing that. Ever since last night, I was so worried that I kept wondering... \"What if he is the real killer...? What then...?\"\nAny ideas\nPhoenix:\nHey, I have something I want to ask you, Pearls.\nPearl:\nOK, what is it?\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you so interested in how Maya and I get along? I mean, she and I don't have anything special go--\nPearl:\nHuh!? Wh-What do you mean!? B-But I thought... I thought you and Mystic Maya were... I-I've been mistaken all this time!? No way...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aaaah! She really wasn't kidding! Pearls actually believes Maya and I are... ...Maybe I should've just left it alone...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Stop it! Don't hide your true feelings from me!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! She slapped me!!)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPearl:\nThat's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nI guess?\nPearl:\nI feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...)\nMaya Fey profile\nPearl:\nOh, Mystic Maya... I wonder if you're alright...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure she's OK. We have to be patient for just one more day. I'm sure we can save her. Trust me.\nPearl:\nIf there's anything I can do, please tell me, OK!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPearl:\nTo tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me.\nPhoenix:\nI think your hair now suits you perfectly.\nPearl:\nR-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget*\nPhoenix:\n*fidget, fidget*\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPearl:\nI'm sure that Mr. Detective would be our ally if we asked!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I think so too. (Looking back, we've known each other for a while now... He's always been trustworthy... A bit \"off\", but still trustworthy. What a paradox.)\nWill Powers profile\nPearl:\nHe's a really kind and nice old man, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is really perceptive when it comes to people... But what does she mean by \"old man\"...?) Hey, Pearls? What about me...?\nPearl:\nWhat about you, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, I don't think I want to hear this...)\nAnything else\nPearl:\nUm, there are still so many things in this world that I don't understand yet. ...Honestly, I still don't have enough training.\nPhoenix:\nAh, no, it's OK. I don't have any ideas myself...\nPearl:\nI'm sorry. I'm really sorry!\nMarch 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEngarde:\nAh, the lawyer dude. So what did you find out?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... I'm still in the middle of investigating...\nEngarde:\nI see. ...But I've already told you everything I know, dude.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\nDude, like I told you, I don't know anything about that press conference. I leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(...This is harder than pulling bass from a river...)\nRadio Transceiver\nEngarde:\nSo, why are you carrying around that transceiver...?\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about it.\nEngarde:\nAnd why do you do everything it tells you to do? You know, the messages it sends you, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, he probably doesn't have anything to do with Maya's kidnapping.) ...That's a secret.\nEngarde:\nOK, whatever, dude.\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nLook, dude, I didn't kill him. I mean, the Nickel Samurai kicked the Jammin' Ninja's butt, right? So it's not like I felt threatened by the likes of him.\nPearl:\nBeing rivals sounds like a sad way to relate to another person...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nOldbag:\nHey! What do you think you're doing!? You can't come in without...\nPearl:\nGood morning.\nOldbag:\nHold on, it's YOU! What is going on around here!?\nPhoenix:\nU-Uh... Um...\nOldbag:\nI heard poor Juan was killed. Is that true!? It's a bad rerun is what this is. Another \"Steel Samurai\" doing the most evil of deeds.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you know... That's not entirely...\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know that I was a huge fan of Juan's! Why, oh why, do all the stars I'm interested in drop one by one like flies!? It's always been that way! Ever since I was a little girl in elementary school! The class hamster was fine until it was my turn to clean its cage, and then it died! The other kids started calling me the \"Queen Reaper\". I swear that's what they dubbed me! \"Whoever you name in your evil spell dies within three minutes,\" they would taunt.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened...\nOldbag:\nHmph! Don't push me, boy!\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? I... Um... I couldn't hear everything she said... because she was talking too fast...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...?\nOldbag:\nDon't boss me around, you spiky-haired, smarty-pants!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but...\nPearl:\n...Even Mr. Engarde himself didn't seem to know, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(How does the person who's supposed to give a conference not know about it...?)\nTalk\nThe victim\nOldbag:\nMy dear Hammer died a year ago in that dreadful murder. And only recently did I finally find a star that makes this heart go *badump* again.\nPhoenix:\n...I don't know what to say...\nOldbag:\nI ask you, why does every star I cheer for always ends [sic] up kicking the bucket?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nI'd watch your words! No one's going to get away with saying anything bad about my Juan!\nPhoenix:\nBut I haven't said anything...\nOldbag:\nWell, I don't believe a word that woman says anyway!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What woman?\nOldbag:\nThat irritating, backwater girl with the afro and the horrible country accent. I mean, what is that manner of speaking supposed to be? And why does she never stop? Honestly, women these days. They don't know the meaning of the word \"modesty\". When I was a young maiden, I was so beautiful even the flowers of the field blushed. But despite this, I pressed flowers, or read the stars, or wrote beautiful love poems or\nPhoenix:\n...Pearls? Are you thirsty?\nPearl:\nUm, a little.\nPhoenix:\nOK. I'll go get you some juice or something.\nPearl:\nTh-Thank you very much.\nOldbag:\nHey! Are you paying attention!? Young'uns today!\nPhoenix:\n(So I'm guessing Ms. Oldbag heard everything from Lotta...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nI want to ask you about what happened around the time of the murder...\nOldbag:\nAh, I don't know anything about that. I was here getting ready.\nPhoenix:\nGetting ready? For what...?\nOldbag:\nThe show, of course! ...Well, and the press conference afterwards.\nPhoenix:\n(Cue mysterious music for the magical press conference.)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I don't know anything about the murder.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see...\nOldbag:\n... But.\nPhoenix:\n?\nOldbag:\nBut if you're talking about what I saw, that's different. I saw it very clearly!\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nOldbag:\nI saw the most important moment of the night!\nWhat you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nTh-The most important moment!? You don't mean...!?\nOldbag:\nOh, so now you treat me with respect, you disrespectful child. When you speak to your elders, you should always be polite. Really, kids today.\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see!?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nOldbag:\nThe murder last night was gruesome, wasn't it? But then, what murder isn't?\nPhoenix:\n(Please don't stray onto another tangent... Please...)\nOldbag:\nIf you want to hear more, then show your respect and bring this lady a present!\nWhat you witnessed (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see on the night of the murder!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPearl:\nP-Please! Mystic Maya's life is...\nOldbag:\nAh, but you haven't given me my present yet. ...Hmm... Let's see... I'll only tell it to you if you can bring me Juan's autograph!\nPhoenix:\n(What an unreasonable request... You might as well have asked for the moon!)\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nI don't have anything to say to delinquents like you!\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr... She's clamming up like the old clam she is...)\nPearl:\nPlease! Anything would be helpful!\nOldbag:\nWell then, how about I tell you my measurements?\nPhoenix:\n...Um... No, that's okay... Really.\nPearl:\nShe really doesn't like you, does she Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI know, I know...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like the investigation is still in full swing. The hotel staff and the police are running around like a bunch of headless chickens.\nPearl:\nI wonder if we can do any investigating of our own in this kind of atmosphere...\nPhoenix:\n...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess.\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of, only to disappear... ...If only we had all gone together...\nChandelier\nPearl:\nThat is such a beautiful sight.\nPhoenix:\nThe chandelier?\nPearl:\nYes. But I can't believe it... I can't believe that such a terrible murder happened under such beautiful lights... It's shocking.\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was held on that stage just last night. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nWe ate at this table last night, didn't we?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nPearl:\nI was really happy then.\nPhoenix:\n(I wish I could make you smile again... Even for a second...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHallway\nLotta:\nHey! Yer here! Been waitin' for ya, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nLotta...\nLotta:\nHey! Mr. Cop fella! The thief's showed his face!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!?\nLotta:\nArrest him! Put him on trial! Find him guilty! Give him the death penalty!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong, Lotta!? Are you feeling alright?\nLotta:\nLooked here and there and up and down the mountain, but it ain't here! So why don'tcha just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep! (Changed from [So why don't ya just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep!] in the original release)\nPearl:\nUm, what are you looking for...?\nLotta:\nMy CAMERA! C-A-M-E-R-A! It's my life blood! I'm gonna die without my $700 camera!!\nPhoenix:\nY-Your camera...?\nLotta:\nLook, don't lots of people say the criminal always goes back to the scene of the crime!? And lookie lookie, here ya are!\nPhoenix:\nYep. Here I am... Faced with a Lotta trouble.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...?\nLotta:\nI didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nLotta:\nYeah, that's what I thought too, so I was a nice enough gal to lend a helpin' hand! ...Secretly, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(I have a feeling one of these days, I'm going to end up defending her in court...)\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\".\nLotta:\nSo that's the scene of the murder, I reckon. I thought somethin' had gone on that night, but I didn't never think it was murder.\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\".\nPearl:\nSo Mr. Engarde was here during his break, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what he claims. (Hmm... The crime scene... If he had wanted to get to Mr. Corrida's room... He would have had to pass through this hallway.)\nTalk\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!\nPearl:\nHuh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?\nLotta:\nI had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon. I made this itty-bitty scratch on it and the manager got all huffed up in the face... He gave me his talkin' to and was real mean about it too. He done made me cry at that!\nPearl:\nWhen did you lose your camera?\nLotta:\nLast night, after the murder happened. Musta been when I was busy runnin' around lookin' into things! That's when I lost sight of my dear, darlin' expensive sweetie!\nPhoenix:\nLotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours?\nLotta:\nI don't rightly know. I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?)\nLotta's Camera added to the Court Record.\nCamera (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera!

Yeah, actually I was here until around the time Mr. Engarde was arrested.\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you doing here...?\nLotta:\nYou sure you went to school, City Boy? Wherever Lotta Hart goes, there's a story to be found! A big scoop to be had!\nPhoenix:\nA big scoop...?\nLotta:\nI told ya before. I'm gonna be the best tabloid photographer the world's ever seen! Reckon course that means I'm always lookin' for the perfect shot!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what \"scoop\" she was after this time...?)\nLotta:\nAlthough, I was also on the look out for the other stars that were here, so... maybe I wasn't here the entire time...\nBig scoop (appears after \"Camera\" and \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nLotta... Are you sure you weren't here the entire time? So you could take a picture for your big scoop?\nLotta:\nWell... Maybe I was. But that's what real journalists do! I got some juicy inside info, so I thought to myself, why not get a picture for proof?\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of story was it that you would hang around here...?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nOops, sorry, Mr. Lawyer. Can't be tellin' you that. Trade secret, ya know?\nPhoenix:\n(Not again... Why does everyone have something to hide...?)\nPearl:\nWe've been stopped, haven't we?\nLotta:\nHa ha, yeah! Take that, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here is happy... Ms. Lotta and your \"I rule!\" smile...)\nBig scoop (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou were on the hunt for your big scoop last night?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nIt's just a bunch of tabloid photos. They ain't got nothing to do with the murder.\nPearl:\nIt looks like we have no choice but to remove the Psyche-Locks.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I guess so.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nLotta:\nHey, what's that? ...A press conference ticket? How come I ain't got myself one of them!?\nPhoenix:\nP-Please don't direct your anger at me...\nLotta:\nWhy in tarnations wasn't I invited to that!? How come someone on the bottom of the popularity chart like you got the info, but not me!? Info like that is worth nothin' to ya, am I right or what!?\nPhoenix:\n(...Is that the kind of person she thinks I am...?)\nPearl:\nAre you going to stand there and take that, Mr. Nick!?\nLotta's Camera\nLotta:\nNngh... And I just bought that camera... Who did it!? The thievin' rascal!\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't look straight at me while you're saying that...\nLotta:\nWhen I find the bugger who went and done this, they're gonna pay with a bullet!\nPhoenix:\n(And if you do that, don't expect me to defend you...)\nMaya Fey profile\nLotta:\nNow that I think about it, she isn't with y'all today, is she...?\nPearl:\nUm...\nLotta:\nShe's a spunky one! You shouldn't have been lettin' her outta yer sight. Who knows what she's up to now...\nPhoenix:\n(Like you're one to talk...)\nPearl:\n...\nPearl Fey profile\nLotta:\nAh, just wanna say sorry to ya.\nPearl:\nFor...?\nLotta:\nWell, I really, absolutely thought you were the murderer.\nPearl:\n...Huh?\nLotta:\nYou know... Last time, that thing with Maya Fey...\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!? But why!?\nLotta:\nI mean, you were all worked up, ya know?\nPearl:\n*sniffle* ...Meanie...\nPhoenix:\nLotta, that was very insensitive of you!\nLotta Hart profile\nLotta:\nThis kind of hairstyle is pretty hard to get, ya know. Hard to care for too. Just the other day, I ran my hand through my hair to fix it up, and suddenly, out pops this dollar coin! That's gotta be like hittin' the jackpot!\nPearl:\nWow, that's really lucky!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* What a deep conversation that was...)\nJuan Corrida or Matt Engarde profile\nLotta:\nI don't really care for 'em \"heroes\" or whatnot.\nPearl:\nOh, I see...\nLotta:\nAnd shows they got for kids, those adventures are just plain ol' borin'! Now, adults. We get more caught up in messy, sticky, real situations! ...Even me...\nPearl:\nO-Oh...\nLotta:\nSounds like the tyke's gettin' what I'm goin' with this!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a sec here! Don't go around getting her mixed up in things like that!\nSecurity Lady profile\nLotta:\nThis old granny? Ah, she kept on glarin' at me with those eyes of hers. As if it's my fault. Kept babblin' how she won't forgive people who write \"trash\" about her Juan... ...Ah, yeah, we sorta got into a little fight, ya know...\nPhoenix:\n(A \"little\" fight? Knowing those two, it was probably more of a blabbering contest.)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know anything...\nLotta:\n...*sigh*... I've told ya how many times now? I'm a journalist. I've got so much info runnin' laps in my head I forget things here and there!\nPearl:\nPlease don't get so worked up over this...\nLotta:\nHah! I don't care if ya beg me! \"Be extra tough on kids!\" That's this gal's motto on learnin' youngsters.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nUm... Where are we?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room.\n???:\nMay I help you with something?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... We're...\n???:\nYou're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail.\nPhoenix:\nUm... How did you know I'm his lawyer...?\n???:\nYou were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer.\nPearl:\nWow...\n???:\nIt's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either.\nPearl:\nIt's really not the time to be showing off, Mr. Nick.\nAndrews:\nI am Adrian Andrews. I hate to waste time, so let's get down to business.\nPhoenix:\nA-Alright... (She may be of small stature, but appearances can be deceiving...)\nExamine\nRed suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's probably Mr. Engarde's suitcase. For someone who was only going to be here for the award show, this is a lot of stuff. Looks like he has about three days' worth of clothes in here.\nPearl:\nStars really are different from us, aren't they...?\nBedroom\nPhoenix:\nThat's the bedroom over there.\nPearl:\nThat's a bed...? Wow, they have really big beds here!\nSofa\nPhoenix:\nThere's some samurai-looking clothes on the sofa here.\nPearl:\nUm, I think that jacket looking thing is called a \"happi\".\nPhoenix:\n(Whatever it is, I'm sure something like that would make a great souvenir. Maya would be absolutely thrilled...)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nLooks like dishes left over from dinner... A dinner for two, at that.\nPearl:\nI'm sure they're Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews' plates.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they had T-bone steaks... What's with Global Studios and T-bone steaks...?\nPlate on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a giant bone sitting on the plate.\nPearl:\nI... I don't really like meat...\nPhoenix:\n(...? There's something... weird about this plate... I just wish I could put my finger on what it is...)\nTalk\nNight of the murder\nAndrews:\nI assume the first thing you need to know is what everyone was doing that night, correct?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, that is correct.\nAndrews:\nThen I will tell you. Before the award ceremony, I had dinner with Mr. Engarde. In this very room, I might add.\nPhoenix:\n\"Dinner\"? What did you eat?\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate to waste time with trifling details. If you took a look at the table yourself, you wouldn't need to ask me.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet she's a lot of fun at parties...)\nAndrews:\nWhen the award show was starting, I headed for Viola Hall.\nPhoenix:\nAnd after the show ended, you came back to this room...?\nAndrews:\nNo, I had some small errands to run. I helped with the preparations in the lobby.\nPhoenix:\nOh... (Preparations for the post-ceremony show, I guess...)\nAndrews:\nWhen it was time for the post-ceremony show, I came back to call for Mr. Engarde. After that, I went to visit Mr. Corrida...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you found his body, isn't it?\nAndrews:\n...\nPearl:\nYou really held strong through everything...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... She does seem to be mentally tough as nails...)\nRelation to Engarde\nPhoenix:\nUm, so... About you and...\nAndrews:\nStop right there. You aren't seriously about to ask how Mr. Engarde and I are related, are you? (Changed from [Don't expect me to believe you have been talking to me without knowing how we relate.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nAndrews:\nI have no idea how he could chose [sic] you as his lawyer. (Changed from [I have no idea why Mr. Engarde chose you as his lawyer.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Why did she have to go and say something like that...?)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Calm down and hang in there. I'll give you a shoulder rub to relieve your stress later, alright?\nAndrews:\nI already gave you my name earlier, but I'll add that I'm Mr. Engarde's manager.\nPhoenix:\nHis manager... Speaking of managers, did the victim, Mr. Corrida have one?\nAndrews:\nNo, he did not.\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't?\nAndrews:\nGlobal Studios has a very different policy from Worldwide Studios in that Worldwide Studios does not assign individual managers to their stars.\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nAndrews:\nThis industry is very ruthless and unforgiving. Actually, you look quite ruthless and unforgiving yourself to your poor partner. Dragging a little girl like her to places like this. Honestly.\nPearl:\nYou're wrong! I... I'm doing this to help Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Calm down and hang in there. I'll buy you a juice later, alright?\nPearl:\nNngh...\nMotive for murder (appears after presenting Juan Corrida profile)\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any ideas?\nAndrews:\nAs to...?\nPhoenix:\nAs to why Mr. Corrida was murdered?\nAndrews:\nWhy would you ask me about such a thing...?\nPhoenix:\nI'm just doing my job. So, do you have any ideas?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nSorry, but there's nothing more I have to add to this conversation.\nPearl:\nIs it a Psyche-Lock, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYes... There's getting to be more and more of these lately.\nMotive for murder (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou know something, don't you? About why Mr. Corrida was murdered...\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nAndrews:\nWhy are you asking me? Don't tell me you can see inside my heart.\nPhoenix:\n(No, but I can see the locks you have on your psyche.)\nPearl:\nIf you don't remove her locks...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it's worthless to even ask...)\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one taking care of the arrangements for this press conference, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, that's right.\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Engarde said he \"didn't know\" about it.\nAndrews:\n... Is that what he said...?\nPearl:\nHuh...?\nAndrews:\nActually, I didn't know all the details either. It was a request from the publicity department. All I did was help out and do what I was asked.\nPearl:\nOh... I see.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder about that... I wouldn't take her to be the type of person to do something without knowing the details.)\nWill Powers profile\nAndrews:\nThat's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be.\nPhoenix:\n(Urk... What a horrible thing to say...)\nAndrews:\n...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? For a second, her face twisted in pain...)\nPearl:\nI wonder if something happened to Ms. Andrews...\nJuan Corrida profile\nPhoenix:\nDid you know the victim, Mr. Corrida?\nAndrews:\nYes, I knew him. The world is such a small place, after all.\nPearl:\nDid you know about his rivalry with the Nickel Samurai?\nAndrews:\nHonestly, they were like children when it came to that. Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most trivial things. (Changed from [Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most uninteresting things.] in the original release) ... If either one of them wasn't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die. (Changed from [If either one of them weren't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n! (...I've got a hunch that this woman knows more than she's letting on... She must know why Juan Corrida was killed!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nAndrews:\nI asked to become Mr. Engarde's manager. He's a pleasure to manage with his nice disposition.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Mr. Engarde does seem like a rather weak-willed man; always doing as he's told...)\nPearl:\nHe's always saying, \"my manager,\" right Mr. Nick?\nAndrews:\n...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAndrews:\nI hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... (Take away that layer of sarcasm and she really does seem to hate herself...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, I'd like to ask you about this...\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Where are we...?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Juan Corrida's room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Corrida...?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim... Which makes this the crime scene, too.\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's you! So!? What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!?\nPhoenix:\nNot yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there?\nPhoenix:\n(I just want Maya to be alright...)\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nWe don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal.\nPhoenix:\nCan you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...?\nGumshoe:\nJust this once... \"Special circumstances\" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here.\nPhoenix:\nThank you.\nGumshoe:\nOh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy.\nPearl:\nWow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you!\nGumshoe:\nHa ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I got a map!\nPhoenix:\nThat's great, Pearls!\nPearl:\n... Um... But Mr. Nick, I can't read what it says...\nHotel Guidemap added to the Court Record.\nExamine\nRefrigerator\nPhoenix:\nThere are all sorts of things in this refrigerator...\nPearl:\nThe carrot juice bottle and the tomato juice bottle are both empty...\nPhoenix:\nEmpty...? (It's too much of a hassle to throw them away, I guess.) They're all vegetable juices. I guess he must've been a real health nut.\nPearl:\n...Oh! There's a beet, some ketchup, and a bottle of strawberry jam too!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe red was his favorite color...?\nStuffed bears\nPearl:\nWow, there are a lot of bears!\nPhoenix:\n(Alarm clock ones, collector's editions, stuffed teddies, plastic models... It's pretty overwhelming... Is there a kind of bear he doesn't have...?)\nPearl:\nThere's even a few in the trash can...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I get the feeling maybe the guy didn't really like bears.\nPearl:\nPoor teddies...\nIt's hard to \"bear\" with all these problems... Growl! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n... (I don't think I want to \"bear\" with the trauma the last case caused me...)\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mr. Nick?\nDesk\nPearl:\nHmph! It's so messy here!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls really likes things neat and tidy, I take it...)\nPearl:\nThere are a lot of electronic things in here that I've never seen before. Hey, Mr. Nick! Tell me what they are, pretty please?\nPhoenix:\nOK. That over there is a \"watch\". You wear it on your wrist.\nPearl:\n... I know what a watch is...\nPhoenix:\n(Oops. For a second there, I forgot I was talking with Pearls, not Maya...)\nBlue suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's a suitcase. There are so many things in it that I bet it barely closes. There's his clothes, a dryer, an electric shaver, a calculator...\nPearl:\nDo all stars pack too much stuff like Mr. Corrida?\nTable on right\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Mr. Corrida had dinner last night.\nPearl:\nThis bottle... It's tomato juice.\nPhoenix:\n(We had a lot of food at the award show last night... But I wonder if the stars had gone onstage after only eating a meager meal like this...)\nBedroom\nPearl:\nSo that's a bed, right?\nPhoenix:\nYup. It's big, but it's a bed.\nPearl:\nAaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft!\nPhoenix:\n(Big beds must be a rarity for her...)\nScattered items near guitar case\nPhoenix:\nBottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.\nPearl:\nWhat's this glass fragment from...?\nPhoenix:\nA flower vase maybe? There are flowers on the floor, but I don't know what they are.\nPearl:\nYou don't know much about flowers, do you Mr. Nick?\nGuitar case\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.\nPearl:\nThat's strange. The guitar is not here...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he forgot to bring it to the show?\nPearl:\nBut Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item...\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid...\nPearl:\nYeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nGuitar Case added to the Court Record.\nGuitar case (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess.

There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nWine glass\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nPearl:\nBut doesn't it seem weird?\nPhoenix:\n...What seems weird?\nPearl:\nI mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor.\nPhoenix:\n... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)\nPearl:\nWhy is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?\nWine Glass added to the Court Record.\nWine glass (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww.

(She's right.

(Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIt should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Here's a picture.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a knife in his chest.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal, that's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was stabbed to death...)\nGumshoe:\nThey're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now.\nPhoenix:\nThere were fingerprints on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nYup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nCause of death (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what was the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nWell, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal.

And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nReason for arrest\nPhoenix:\nWhy was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nBecause we had evidence on him.\nPearl:\nEvidence...?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the victim, Juan Corrida, really put up a big fight.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, one look at the crime scene and you can tell. There's signs of a struggle everywhere.\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah. During the fight, his button came off...\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde said something about a button... Something like, one of the Jammin' Ninja's buttons got caught in his \"hakama\"...)\nGumshoe:\nBut that's not all...\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nThere was a witness, pal.\nPhoenix:\nA witness!? Wh-Who is it!?\nGumshoe:\nThat lady... Ms. Oldbag.\nPhoenix:\n(Please... Anyone but her!)\nGumshoe:\nThe prosecution has plenty of evidence to make a solid case... Not to mention there's something around where the vic was that's a little off. (Changed from [Not to mention there's something at the crime scene that was a little off.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nSomething that's a little off...? As in...? (Changed from [Something that was a little off...? As in...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nAs in, that's for you to figure out, pal!\nPearl:\nAlright, let's try to figure it out, Mr. Nick!\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nGumshoe:\nThat's your \"present\" from the kidnapper, huh? While you're talking, it sends and receives radio waves... If we could trace that...\nPearl:\nYeah! We could use it to find out where the bad guy is!\nPhoenix:\n(It uses radio waves, huh?)\nGumshoe:\nI got it! I'll go find a radio scanner, and let you borrow it, pal!\nGuitar Case\nPhoenix:\nWhat can you tell me about this guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nOh, that. This is just what I heard, pal, but that's the Jammin' Ninja's signature item.\nPhoenix:\nThe guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nNo, not that! What do you take me as? I mean the guitar inside, of course!\nPearl:\nBut... The guitar is missing.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, we looked for it too. It's not normal for a person to forget to bring their most famous item to an award show.\nPhoenix:\n(It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...)\nWine Glass\nPhoenix:\nSo about this wine glass...\nGumshoe:\nAh, so you noticed it, pal. The whole crime scene was a mess, but this glass was the only thing that was untouched.\nPhoenix:\nYou noticed that too, Detective Gumshoe...?\nGumshoe:\nNo, actually Ms. von Karma noticed it first.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Pearls noticed it before me too... Hey, wait a minute. So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's here at the hotel...? (Changed from [So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's coming here...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah, she's around. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal. (Changed from [Yeah, she's coming. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal.] in the original release) Especially if she catches you in here. (Changed from [I think it'd be best if you didn't bump into her here.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou can bet the instant I see her, I'll be running the 1,000 meter dash.\nCrime Photo\nGumshoe:\nYou look at this photo and you can't help it. It makes you want to say, \"I can't believe this is the scene of a murder.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Stabbed with a knife after a struggle... A clue is sleeping in this photo somewhere... I know it.)\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm sorry.\nPhoenix:\n...For what?\nGumshoe:\nI really want to help you look for her, pal.\nPearl:\nMr. Detective...\nGumshoe:\nIf anything happens, let me know, OK? I want to help in any way I can!\nPearl Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, little missy. Listen good, OK?\nPearl:\nOK. What is it?\nGumshoe:\nDon't ever pick up a whip, OK? Don't even think about it.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nGumshoe:\nIf you ever find yourself thinking you want one, try to make due with a good slap to the face. Got that? Slap the person in the face. Promise me, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(Personal experience tells me Gumshoe should be careful what he wishes for...)\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nIf I had a choice, she would be number three on my list of people I don't want to see.\nPhoenix:\n...Because I'm in the number one spot?\nGumshoe:\nDon't get all high and mighty on me here. You've taken a tumble into second place, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really? Then who's in first...?\nGumshoe:\nMs. von Karma's miles and miles ahead of you in this race.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh...\nGumshoe:\nShe's really scary... Right now... M-Ms. von Karma... You really don't...\nPhoenix:\n(He's so scared of her that he's whispering now...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, why don't we let bygones be bygones, pal? Look, this guy is guilty. A buck says so.\nPhoenix:\nOne dollar...? Sure you're not talking about Pearls' allowance money?\nGumshoe:\nI... I can't bet any more than that... My salary... It's...\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't matter what we think... I still have to defend Mr. Engarde in court or else!)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick...\nSecurity Lady profile\nGumshoe:\nI thought she was an alien from outer space.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, probably because she's wearing that strange helmet.\nGumshoe:\nNah, even with her helmet off, I thought she was an alien, pal.\nPhoenix:\n... I think that's probably best kept to yourself, if you know what I mean...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nGumshoe:\nShe's Mr. Engarde's manager, right? No matter what I do, I really stink at talking with people like her. As soon as I open my mouth, I get all flustered. See, she's one of those women with a brain. She's someone who \"gets things done\".\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she does give that sort of impression, like she's got it all together.\nGumshoe:\nCompared to her, you can easily tell I'm a \"can't do anything right\" kind of guy. That's why I get all nervous and start messing up.\nPhoenix:\n(I feel sort of bad for him...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you know about this?\nGumshoe:\nUm... There's nothing special I can tell you about this, pal. Look pal, we don't have a lot of time. Why don't you show me something more important? If Ms. von Karma saw me here like this... I'd have to switch sides real fast...\nAfter clearing all Talk options, examining guitar case, and presenting Wine Glass:\n...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*...\nPearl:\nWh-What's that beeping noise, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I've heard this sound somewhere before...)\nGumshoe:\nIt's Ms. von Karma...\nPearl:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nFor some reason, whenever I hear that sound, she pops out of nowhere and whips me! (Changed from [Whenever I hear that sound, for some reason, she pops out of nowhere and whips me!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, that's exactly what happen [sic] the last time...) (Changed from [Come to think of it, that did happen the last time...] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nS-Sorry! I've gotta make myself scarce! Later, pal! Eowww!\nvon Karma:\nAt last, you reveal your true nature... Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(*gulp* Would it be too much to ask for you to be nice to me for a change...?)\nvon Karma:\nSo you're the type to steal information from pitifully hopeless detectives! That's very dishonorable of you!\nPhoenix:\n(Owww!)\nvon Karma:\nHey! Don't you dare run away, Scruffy McTrenchcoat!\nGumshoe:\nAh!\nvon Karma:\nI didn't think the detectives of this country could be this pitiful...\nGumshoe:\nUwaah!\nvon Karma:\nDetective! Come over here for a second!\nGumshoe:\nYeooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!\nvon Karma:\n...Hmph. I feel better knowing at least you were man enough to face your punishment.\nPhoenix:\n(He was so scared, he just froze up on the spot...)\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright! You... You have soiled my perfect prosecution record. I'll never forget that. This time... Victory is mine!\nPhoenix:\n... Victory is yours? Is that all this means to you...?\nvon Karma:\nWh-What...!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nvon Karma:\n... H-Hmph! Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin. (Changed from [Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!\nvon Karma:\nThis isn't over yet... I swear on my family's honor!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! What did she throw at me NOW...!? (Changed from [Ow! Now what did she throw at me...!?] in the original release) What is this...?)\nGumshoe:\n...Well, I guess this means I've gotta get back to the precinct now, pal. If you ever need me, come down to the Criminal Affairs Department, alright? And if you can, try not to let Ms. von Karma see you...\nExamine\nPaper on desk\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, what's this piece of paper...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's called an \"autograph\".\nPearl:\nAuto-graff?\nPhoenix:\nIt's got Mr. Corrida's name written on it, so it's his autograph.\nPearl:\nI can't read it at all. To be honest, I've never seen writing that looks like this.\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's a special way of writing called \"cursive\". Look here. See how it says, \"To my dearest Wendy\" in more normal letters here?\nPearl:\nTh-This sloppy, unreadable writing! It's crazy and cruel to give this to someone!\nPhoenix:\n(Hold on...)\nPearl:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nWendy... I've heard that name somewhere before...\nMr. Corrida's Autograph added to the Court Record.\nAfter visiting Enguarde's Hotel Room:\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPowers:\nOh, Mr. Wright! How are you?\nPhoenix:\nAh, Mr. Powers. Have you been here the entire time?\nPowers:\nYeah. People connected to the murder aren't allowed to go home, let alone leave...\nTalk\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me a little more about the Nickel Samurai TV show?\nPowers:\nOK. \"The Nickel Samurai\" is an action hero program aimed towards kids. It's the sequel to \"The Steel Samurai\".\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nPowers:\nThis time, there are three Samurai Brothers: Aluminum Samurai, Tin Samurai... And of course, the Nickel Samurai. It's a love \"Y\" in Neo Olde Tokyo!\nPhoenix:\nI see... ... W-Wait... A love what...?\nPowers:\nA love \"Y\". This girl, Sayo, works at a tea shop and all three guys fall for her at the same time.\nPhoenix:\nOh... I guess the \"Y\" shape is like the 3 brothers colliding over this one girl?\nPowers:\nAnyway, Sayo is actually the daughter of the evil Strawberry Clan's leader!\nPhoenix:\nSounds like an unusual situation. Like Romeo and Juliet... times three.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah... Strange thing is, this sort of forbidden love story is really big with the office ladies.\nPearl:\nUm...\nPowers:\nYes, Pearl?\nPearl:\nWh-What happens next!? I want to know! Ms. Sayo... Does Ms. Sayo fall in love? She does, doesn't she?\nPowers:\nEvery Sunday at 8 AM.\nPearl:\nI'm going to stop watching \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\" starting this week!\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe she's really considering it!)\nJammin' Ninja\nPhoenix:\nSo what's the \"Jammin' Ninja\" TV show like?\nPowers:\nIt started from a remake of an old movie, to tell you the truth. The Jammin' Ninja is, like the Samurai shows, aimed towards kids. It's the story of a ninja who can't climb a wall, but became a big pop star.\nPhoenix:\n...Uh, what?\nPowers:\nHe was a really lousy ninja. Absolutely couldn't do any ninja things right at all. But boy could he sing! With his trusty bright red guitar in hand, he took the ancient world by storm.\nPhoenix:\nA... A ninja... With a bright red guitar...!?\nPowers:\nAnd then, the final fight in front of his beloved Princess Misola! \"Jammin' versus the Muromachi Five!\" Suddenly! Our brave hero catches a not so Jammin' cold the night before Battle 3!\nPhoenix:\nAww, that's too bad for him...\nPowers:\nY-Yeah... But this kind of pop music-based love story is something high school girls really like.\nPearl:\nUm...\nPowers:\nYes, Pearl?\nPearl:\nWh-What happens next!? I want to know!\nPearl:\nJammin'... The Jammin' Ninja! Will he be able to sing!? What about Princess Misola!?\nPowers:\nEvery Sunday at 8 AM.\nPearl:\nUmm... Which show should I watch...? Hmm...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe she's really  considering it!)\nThe gossip on Adrian (appears after presenting Adrian Andrews profile)\nPhoenix:\nWould you mind telling me about this \"gossip\"?\nPowers:\nAh, so you ARE interested in it! I figured you would be! (Changed from [Ah, so you're interested in it too! I figured you would be!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPowers:\nI have such a weakness for celebrity gossip, too.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh really... You too, huh...?\nPowers:\nYeah. So take a look at this!\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like a tabloid Ms. Oldbag would read...) Alright, let's see here... \"Jammin' Midnight Rendezvous!?\"\nPowers:\n\"...to the mysterious, yet beautiful manager to the stars, Ms. A. A.!\" ...Y-You see now, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\nPowers:\nYou can stop pretending to be in the dark, Mr. Wright! Juan Corrida didn't have a manager of his own.

I've made too many mistakes!)\nNothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Maya Fey)\nMaya:\nI can't see very well in this darkness, but it doesn't seem like there's anything there...\n-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you please give us a brief timeline of what happened after the ceremony?\nGumshoe:\nOK, pal. The ceremony started at 6 PM. It ended around 8 PM... and then there was a short break. A special post-ceremony show was supposed to start in the lobby 30 minutes later.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when the victim's body was found, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nWhich is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period.\nJudge:\nHmm... Please continue with your testimony, Detective.Gumshoe:\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe person who discovered the victim's body was Adrian Andrews, correct?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Adrian Andrews\" you're talking about?\nGumshoe:\nShe's the defendant, Matt Engarde's, manager. She's a really pretty lady... sir.\nJudge:\nAh, so she's a pretty lady... I wonder if she will grace us with her presence...\nGumshoe:\nWhen the post-ceremony show was about to start, she went to get Mr. Engarde. After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir.\nJudge:\nI see... And that's when she found the victim's body...Gumshoe:\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana.\nJudge:\nMmm... \"Banana\"...\nGumshoe:\nUm, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir.\nJudge:\nAh, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana.\nPhoenix:\nThen, what about the knife...?\nGumshoe:\nIt seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death.\nJudge:\nHmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death...

We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.Gumshoe:\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...\nGuitar Case updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal.

Ah, so much for my theory then...Gumshoe:\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat convinced you it had nothing to do with the case?\nGumshoe:\nThe guitar wasn't at the Gatewater Hotel that night.\nJudge:\nWell then, where was it?\nGumshoe:\nThe bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir.\nJudge:\nSo you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar.\nPhoenix:\nSo that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all.\nJudge:\nHmm...Mia:\nOur first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.Phoenix:\nBut there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...Mia:\nMaybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.Phoenix:\nIf you say so...Mia:\nOf course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?After pressing third, fourth, and fifth statements:Edgeworth:\nI believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWhich brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.Phoenix:\n(Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)Judge:\nVery well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Judge:\nHmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.Gumshoe:\nIt was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.Knife added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\n...And there's this button.Judge:\nThat was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?Gumshoe:\nYes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Jammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAll of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?Edgeworth:\nYes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?Phoenix:\nHmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!Edgeworth:\nYou can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.Phoenix:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown.\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end...\nJudge:\nThat is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing.\nEdgeworth:\n...Gumshoe:\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls!\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah, I guess, but...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all!\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUm, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired.\nGumshoe:\nEh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's...\nEdgeworth:\nI look forward to your pension negotiations.\nGumshoe:\nN-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony.\nGumshoe:\n*sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too...\nEdgeworth:\nDetective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)Gumshoe:\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any proof that button belonged to the victim?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nOh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\".\nGumshoe:\nHuh? But can't you tell by just looking at it?\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nA-And the victim's blood is on it.\nPhoenix:\nAnyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward.\nGumshoe:\n... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Thread.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nThe button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal!\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nMia:\nThat's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.Gumshoe:\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhen was this button found?\nGumshoe:\nPretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder...\nEdgeworth:\nThe police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people...\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe:\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow were the fingerprints arranged on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nBy examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...?\nGumshoe:\nOh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe the bumbling of this department...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe:\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife!\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...)\nMia:\n...Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nThere's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"Phoenix:\n(A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)Mia:\nBe grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix:\nWe're still in a world of trouble...Mia:\nWell, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Pearl Fey\nDescription: Maya's cousin.

    "response": "Okay, I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in the given cross-examination. Let's start by reviewing the testimonies and the evidence provided.\n\nThe testimony in question is from Detective Gumshoe, specifically the fifth statement: \"The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!\" The key here is that the prosecution is claiming the knife was purchased by the defendant (Matt Engarde) specifically for the murder, implying premeditation.\n\nLooking at the evidence, the Knife (evidence 15) has the engraving \"Gatewater\" on the grip. If the knife was bought at the Gatewater Hotel, that would mean Engarde purchased it there. However, considering the timeline, the award ceremony and subsequent events all took place at the Gatewater Hotel. If the knife was purchased there, it would have to be during their stay, suggesting it was bought on the spot rather than premeditated. This contradicts the idea that Engarde bought it beforehand with the intent to commit murder, as the purchase would have been made at the same location and time as the murder, possibly indicating a spontaneous act rather than a pre-planned one.\n\nSo the contradiction lies between the testimony about premeditation (the defendant buying the knife for the crime) and the evidence showing the knife was from Gatewater, implying it was acquired at the scene, thus challenging the premeditation claim.\n\n{\"evidence\": 15, \"testimony\": 5}",

Or maybe Captain Saipan all the way from the lovely tropical island of Saipan!? I see the students of a certain Starry School are raring to win! And Global Hero Onyankopon doesn't want to go home without the prize! We hope Lady Luck is with all our heroes tonight! And now! The winner of the third annual Hero of Heroes Grand Prix... IS ME!!\nWhoooooooooa! The true hero of the night has appeared in our midst! It looks like this year's Grand Prix goes to this fantastic warrior! The Nickel Samurai! Too bad, Jammin' Ninja. Looks like the title eluded you again this year!\nMarch 20, 7:42 PMGatewater HotelViola Hall\nMaya:\nAlright! Yes! Did you hear that, Nick!? Did you!? The Nickel Samurai! He did it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.\nPowers:\nAh, I'm proud of the guy for doing the series justice.\nPearl:\nU-Um... So the person everyone was cheering for... I guess he got the prize?\nMaya:\nYup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? \"The Nickel Samurai\"!\nPearl:\nNo. Every Sunday, I only watch the Educational Channel's \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nOK, that's it! From now on, it's \"The Nickel Samurai\"! All the kids watch it!\nPearl:\nDo you like \"The Nickel Samurai\" too, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nNah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. But I do like \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nHey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed to watch it anymore! You're supposed to act your age and have interests that match. ...It's very important.\nMaya:\nAw, give it a rest, Pearly!\nPowers:\nLooks like I made the right choice in inviting everyone here.

I thought this might be his year...\nMaya:\nYeah... Oh, hey, did anyone else think that the Jammin' Ninja was a bit different today?\nPearl:\nDifferent? What do you mean?\nMaya:\nUm, well, he wasn't carrying his bright red guitar.\nPowers:\nHey, you're right! Strange he'd walk around without his signature guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh* I will never understand these people and their shows...) Anyway, Mr. Powers, thank you very much for tonight.\nPowers:\nA-Aw, it was nothing... I owe you one, so it's just my way of saying thanks.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! It's time to get going to the lobby! There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.\nPowers:\nAnd then, I heard there's going to be a press conference after that.\nPhoenix:\nA press conference?

I don't think so.\nTables at back\nMaya:\nIf this is all a dream, I don't ever want to wake up! And all the directors and stars that were here to see the heroes, wow.\nPhoenix:\nI had no idea who most of them were.\nPearl:\nNeither did I.\nMaya:\nNick, you've got to cut that \"news only\" habit out. Your new show is going to be \"The Nickel Samurai!\" Every Sunday morning at 8! Oh, I know! We can watch it together starting next week! I'll come wake you up extra early to make sure, OK?\nPhoenix:\nAh, I'm fine... You know, you really don't have to on my account...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage.

She's been missing out...)\nMaya:\nDon't worry! Any leftovers belong in my happily awaiting stomach anyway!\nPhoenix:\nYou're such a glutton, Maya.\nPowers:\nAh, I lose this one to Maya. You sure can eat.\nMaya:\nWell, a growing girl needs her nutrients!\nPhoenix:\n(A growing girl? Exactly how big do you plan on getting...?)\nTalk\nWill Powers\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much for inviting us today.\nPowers:\nAww, it was nothing really. Guys like us don't get to come to a place like this often, so I thought I'd invite you all.\nMaya:\nHey, Mr. Powers! What have you been up to lately?\nPowers:\nWell, since \"The Pink Princess\" successfully wrapped up last month, I've been on a kid's exercise show... ...while wearing a rabbit mask over my face...\nMaya:\nOh, I see.\nPowers:\nI'm still really sorry about all the headaches I caused you that time, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nAh, well. What's done is done, so let's forget about it. (This is Will Powers. He's an action star. His popularity exploded when he was the Steel Samurai. And he was the first case Maya worked on with me.)\nMaya:\nIt's too bad you look scary, or people'd know you're a real softy who's good with kids. (Changed from [You can't tell by looking at you, but you're a really nice guy with a love of kids.] in the original release)\nPowers:\nUm, thanks. (Changed from [Ah, thanks.] in the original release)\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe they're going to make a movie based on the Nickel Samurai.\nMaya:\nI can't believe it either, but for a different reason!\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai. An epic story of one hero in a desperate fight against his arch-enemy, the Evil Magistrate in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo. And last year, they started a new series, \"The Nickel Samurai\". The new series seems to be a hit with the kids, too.\nPowers:\nI'm really attached to the Steel Samurai as a show, (Changed from [The Steel Samurai is a show I have a lot of strong feelings for,] in the original release) so I was hoping that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one... (Changed from [so I hoped that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nYeah, it's too bad... It'd been [sic] awesome to see you with the new actor, Matt Engarde. (Changed from [Yeah... It's too bad... It'd be great to see you on the show...] in the original release) He's super popular right now. (Changed from [With the new actor, Matt Engarde. He's super popular right now.] in the original release)\nPearl:\nMr. Un-gard...?\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Pearls doesn't know who he is.)\nMaya:\nThis year it's going to be the Nickel Samurai vs. the Jammin' Ninja at the box office!\nPhoenix:\n...Jammin' Ninja...? Who's that again?\nJammin' Ninja (appears after \"The Nickel Samurai\")\nPhoenix:\nSo who is this \"Jammin' Ninja\" again?\nMaya:\nHe's a hero, duh. His symbol is a bright red guitar he's always carrying.\nPhoenix:\n(A ninja who's always carrying around a bright red guitar...? How does that even work!?)\nMaya:\nWith a scarf around his neck and a guitar in hand, he rises to stardom in an ancient time.\nPhoenix:\nA ninja... Who becomes a star??\nMaya:\nYeah! A ninja who becomes a star!\nPowers:\nThere's a strong rivalry between the two of them. Global Studios' Nickel Samurai and Worldwide Studios' Jammin' Ninja. They even air at the same time.\nMaya:\nYou know what I heard? I heard those two don't get along at all. The Nickel Samurai's Engarde and the guy who plays the Jammin' Ninja, I mean.\nPhoenix:\n(The Nickel Samurai speaks French!? Oh, you mean Matt Engarde, the actor...) I guess even the world of heroes isn't a sparkling, happy place.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPowers:\nAh, I really owe you one. If it wasn't for you guys, I don't know what would've happened. What you did... It was a real tight spot I was in, and you fought so hard to get me out. I don't care what happens. I'll never forget everything you've done for me.\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo, you're going to study to become a lawyer too. Am I right or am I right?\nMaya:\nUmm...\nPowers:\nIt must be real tough. There's all those thick books with hard words you have to read...\nMaya:\nUh, um... Well...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, yeah. Mr. Powers doesn't know that Maya's a spirit medium...)\nMaya:\nI thought he'd be able to tell by my clothes.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he thinks that you've got some strange hobby on the side or something.\nMaya:\n...Hey, wait a sec. What's that's supposed to mean!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo are you Maya's little sister?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but no.\nPowers:\nOh, then you must be Mr. Wright's little sister!\nPearl:\nAgain, I'm sorry, but...\nPowers:\nThen... Whose little sister are you?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but I'm an only child.\nPowers:\nOh, I see... S-Sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(Pearl looks so sad... She looks really sorry too...)\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, they're all shocked because then they figure out who I am.\nMaya:\nHmm... Well, I don't think you look scary.\nPearl:\nMe either. I think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Those two are making Mr. Powers tear up...)\nAnything else\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Thanks for taking the time to take it out and show it to me, but I'm really sorry, I don't know a thing about it.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nPhoenix:\nWow, what is with this place? Looks like I've stumbled into Oz or something. Way in the back, there's a sign for the bathroom. Maybe I should visit it while I can before the show starts... (Changed from [I bet we have a little time to look around before the show starts...] in the original release)\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...? Could it be that there's an action star who has a soft spot for teddy bears...? ...Nah, can't be.\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". \"Juan Corrida\"... His name just sounds like a star's name. I've heard it before, but I don't know anything about him at all.\nEnd of hallway\nPhoenix:\nThere are toilets in each room in this hotel, but since all sorts of events are held here, there are bathrooms for people who aren't staying here to use as well. Perfect for people like me, who can't afford a stay here in the first place...\nFlowers on right\nPhoenix:\n\"To Mr. Engarde From the Global Studio Staff\" Ah, it'd be nice if lawyers got flowers too. Something like, \"To Mr. Wright From All Your Grateful Clients\".\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\". \"Matt Engarde\"... I've heard that name before. Oh, yeah. Maya's always yammering about him like the obsessed fan she is...\nViola Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Viola Hall and visiting Hallway)\nPowers:\nSounds like the post-ceremony show is about to start.\nMaya:\nAlright! I'm so pumped! I wonder if he's going to show off his special move today? \"Nickel Samurai Smelting!\"\nPowers:\nActually, what I'm interested in most is the press conference.\nMaya:\nYou mean the \"big confession\" the Nickel Samurai's going to make after the show? So what is it? Don't you know what it's about, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nUh, well, I'm not the Steel Samurai anymore, so I don't have any idea.\nMaya:\nBah.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Ah, so I guess you are all going to the press conference then?\nMaya:\nYeah, of course!\nPowers:\nIf that's the case, then here, take these tickets so you can get in.\nPress Conference Ticket added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much. Well, let's get going to the lobby.\nPearl:\nIt looks like it's over this way, Mr. Nick!\nMaya:\nOK! For great justice!\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPowers:\nThey called this so suddenly that something about it just seems off, you know?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the press conference?\nPowers:\nYeah. He said, \"There's something I'd like to confess if I win.\" I heard he faxed his request for a conference in to the office only yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nYesterday... (Yeah, that is kind of sudden.)\nPowers:\nBut I guess his manager set everything up somehow, so he was lucky.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Nice manager.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Only a really gaudy hotel would have such a large, gaudy lobby to match.\nPearl:\nAh, I think they're going to have the post-ceremony show over there.\nPhoenix:\nThey're using a compact stage, I see.\nMaya:\nOoh... I'm all ready to use my special \"Samurai Power\".\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks like she's ready to start a fight...)\nPA Notice:\nYour attention please, your attention please. The Nickel Samurai's Post-Ceremony Stage Show will not be held tonight due to unforeseen circumstances.\nMaya:\nWHAAAT!? WHYYYYY!?\nPhoenix:\nOww! You didn't have to pinch me! Pinch yourself if you don't believe it!\nPA Notice:\nWe are asking for everyone's cooperation at this time. So please stay where you are. ...This is a special request from the police.\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nP-Police? Did they just say the police?\nPowers:\nD-Do you want me to go check out what's going on?\nPhoenix:\nUm, wait, I'll come with you...\n???:\nFreeze! You two! Didn't you hear the announcement just now!? It just finished telling you not to move!\nMaya:\nTh-That voice... I've heard that voice somewhere before...\n???:\nHonestly, youth these days can't be bothered to listen to other people when they talk! Just the other day it was the same thing! There was a small footbridge with a sign next to it that said, \"Beware, Bridge Out!\" And along comes a snot-nosed little punk kid right up to the bridge. I tried to tell the boy the bridge was out and it was dangerous, but would he listen!? No, of course not! He said he'd be careful and only walk on the \"in\" part of the bridge since the \"out\" part is what was dangerous! I am not kidding you here! The kid said that and really meant it! WELL! I really let him have it then, and knocked him clear off of that bridge! Honestly, kids these days don't know right from wrong, I tell you!\nPowers:\nThis non-stop chatter...\nPhoenix:\nI-It can't be... ...Ms. Oldbag?\n???:\n...\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, you young whipper-snappers!? Do I know you!? ...Wait. YOU! You're Powers, aren't you!?\nPowers:\nY-Yeah. Um, about what happened back then...\nOldbag:\nYou didn't even get nominated this year, did you? (Changed from [You didn't get nominated last year either, did you?] in the original release) Oh, that's right. You're doing that children's exercise program, trying to play nice.\nPowers:\nAh, yeah, that's me. Thankfully I still have a job...\nOldbag:\nI love that show, and you're a hoot! You're the \"big brother\" character, right? Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You're that giant rabbit! (Changed from [Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You ended up with a rabbit face.] in the original release) What a work of art, but that's how it is, you know? I mean, if you didn't wear the mask, who knows how many TVs you'd break? Really, and shame on those kids exercising around you. They're getting what they deserve. This is why I thought you shouldn't be anywhere...\nPhoenix:\nUm... What are you doing here?\nOldbag:\nLook at my uniform and tell me you can't tell I'm a member of security!\nMaya:\nBut that outfit...\nOldbag:\nAnnoying, noisy brats get the blaster!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nSecond floor\nMaya:\nWow, it looks like there's a fancy restaurant on the second floor!\nPhoenix:\nYou STILL feel like eating?\nMaya:\nI mean, since we're here, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't pull the \"since we're here\" trick on me...)\nPearl:\nWhat a beautiful mansion. Do you live in this wonderful world every day, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, this is my first time in a place like this.\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to say these cameras were set up to cover the post-ceremony stage show.\nMaya:\nBut I wonder where everyone's gone, abandoning their cameras like this...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess something big must have happened...)\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage for the post-ceremony stage show.\nPowers:\nThere was supposed to be a press meeting after the show, but now...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like no one will hear what the Nickel Samurai had to confess after all.\nSeats\nMaya:\nWe're here, so we might as well take some pictures. OK, everyone, sit in a chair!\nPhoenix:\nBut we're all out of film...\nMaya:\nDon't worry about it. There's a zillion cameras over there we can borrow.\nPhoenix:\nHey, hey! You can't just go and \"borrow\" an expensive professional camera like that!\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nMaya:\nWhat incident? What did you do?\nOldbag:\nI didn't do anything, you young'un! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I plead the fifth.\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me!?\nOldbag:\nI thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.\nMaya:\nYou? A bodyguard?\nOldbag:\nFor your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles.\nMaya:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth?\nOldbag:\nBut...\nEdgeworth:\nThat sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me.\nOldbag:\nThat's what he said to me. What did I ever do to deserve that!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nWhat happened?\nMaya:\nUm... So, did something happen?\nOldbag:\nI don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those \"incidents\" happened again.\nPowers:\nA-An \"incident\"? Like a \"murder\" kind of \"incident\"?\nOldbag:\nMaybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, showers of blood are sure to follow. Bet you didn't know that! (Changed from [So wherever I go, a rain of blood will come pouring down. Bet you didn't know that!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUm, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake?\nOldbag:\nSilence, whippersnapper!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nThese eyes of mine are real pros now!\nPhoenix:\n\"Pros\"? Pros at doing what?\nOldbag:\nAt doing police work, of course! My eyes are like a hawk! And my professional eyes spot a messy incident! A messy, bloody incident! That's why I don't have time for you meddling kids and your petty little things!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\n...Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it? I don't like that devilish smile playing on your lips...\nMaya:\nLet's make like we're going to the bathroom, and check things out!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way. The police told us not go [sic] anywhere, remember?\nMaya:\nHuh!? How B-O-R-I-N-G! You're such a boring guy! You've got no motivation! No spirit!\nPearl:\nHuh? What? What's going on? Are you giving Mystic Maya trouble again, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Not you too, Pearls... Please don't stick your little nose into this one...)\nMaya:\nSo listen to this, Pearly. This one time at lawyer camp, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nO-OK! I get it! Let's go take a look.\nMaya:\nYay! I know you couldn't say no to me, Nick!\nPearl:\nThat's right. You'd walk over miles of hot coals for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That would be EVERY time we work a case together...)\nMaya:\nWell, what are we waiting for? Let's go already! You can come along too, Pearly.\nPearl:\nGoody! I get to come! I get to come!\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nThere's nothing really out of the ordinary here...\nPearl:\nAre you looking for the \"in-si-dent\" that the old lady was talking about? (Changed from [Are you looking for the 'something' that the old lady was talking about?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't look like it happened here. Well, we'd better go look somewhere else.\nMaya:\nAlright! Then, let's try...\nBellboy:\nExcuse me.\nMaya:\nAck!\nBellboy:\nAre you by chance, Ms. Maya Fey?\nMaya:\nUm, yeah... That's me.\nBellboy:\nYou have a phone call waiting for you at the front desk.\nMaya:\nA call? I wonder if it's someone from Kurain Village...\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mystic Maya?\nMaya:\nOh, nothing. You guys go on ahead and I'll be right there, OK? (Changed from [Oh, nothing. I'll just go on ahead to check it out, OK?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nOK.\nBellboy:\nRight this way, Ms. Fey.\nPearl:\nLet's go look somewhere else now, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, OK.\nPearl:\nThis is a little exciting... And a little scary...\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of.\nChandelier\nPearl:\nSo, that's called a \"shan-deh leer\", right?\nPhoenix:\nYup.\nPearl:\nWhat is that for? What does it do?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's for lighting up a room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? Can I look down now? My neck hurts...\nTables at the back\nPhoenix:\nThey haven't cleaned up all the food yet. There's a sad feeling hanging in the air now that the party is over...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nIt's a feast fit for a king!\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPearl:\nIt was the first time I ate that food. What was it called again? I think it started with \"key\". Key... Wee?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, a \"kiwi\".\nPearl:\nI don't know what to say. It's a sweet but sour fruit all in one.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nHotel Lobby\nExamine\nSecond floor\nPhoenix:\nA lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. But right now, the only thing filling this enormous room is anxiety about the murder. ...I really hope nothing else bad happens here...\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nThese cameras must belong to the press that came to cover the conference. They're all basically doing the same thing: staring at the empty stage.\nSeats\nPhoenix:\nSeats for the spectators of the post-ceremony show and the press conference. But it's too bad neither event is going to be held now.\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nPearl:\nUm, I guess you must have done something... um... \"deh-plor-ible\"...\nOldbag:\n\"Deplorable!?\" I would never do such a thing! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm...

TOLD. YOU. I get people the info they want! Which means that I've got a right to know!\nNope! Don't care who you are, pal, we're still investigating, so you can't go in!\nWhat's yer problem!? Just ya wait! It'll be all over the morning paper! \"Scruffy Detective's Secret Scandal Revealed!\" You'll see! I'll git ya back!\nPearl:\nThose two sound pretty serious...\nPhoenix:\n(That southern accent can only mean...)\nHey, Wright!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey... Lotta...\nLotta:\nCome on, do a gal a favor and tell this cop I'm just doin' my job and I've got rights...\nGumshoe:\nAh, YOU!\nPhoenix:\nAh... Detective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, help a guy out! Tell her that only the police are allowed here! This is the scene of a murder, so she should leave this to us pros...\nPearl:\nA... A murder!?\nGumshoe:\nAw, shoot! Me and my big mouth!\nLotta:\nSee! I knew it! My gut instinct told me so! I always trust my gut! A murder, it said! And that's what it is! A genuine murder!\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, wait...\nYeehaw, a murder! Of a big star, no less!\nGumshoe:\nOh, man... I'm in trouble now...\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nSo... Detective Gumshoe... A murder...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, no, that's not it. I got my facts mixed up for a second there, pal.\nPearl:\nU-Um... Mr. Nick? Is the dead person the Nickel Samurai...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Why do you ask?\nPearl:\nWell, Mystic Maya was rooting for him, so...\nGumshoe:\nIt wasn't the Nickel Samurai that got bumped. Actually, the Nickel Samurai is the one under suspicion of doing the bumping off...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nThe guy that died was this hero named the Jammin' Ninja, pal.\nPhoenix:\nThe Jammin' Ninja...\nLotta Hart\nPearl:\nUm, that woman with the big puffy hair that looks like cotton candy...\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Lotta?\nPearl:\nThat woman... She was there that time too, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat time?\nPearl:\n...When Mystic Maya did that channeling...\nPhoenix:\nOh, that time... Well, Lotta's a journalist, so that's why she was there.\nPearl:\nJer-nal-ist...\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like she was hanging around here before the murder happened.\nPhoenix:\n\"Hanging around\"...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, hiding in wait in front of the Jammin' Ninja's door, pal.\nPhoenix:\nB-But why would she...?\nGumshoe:\nShe wouldn't tell me, pal. Just said something about \"Gettin' my big scoop\"...\nPhoenix:\n(Scoop? What sort of news could she be after...?)\nThe victim (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nSo the victim was the Jammin' Ninja?\nPearl:\nMr. Jammin' Ninja...?\nGumshoe:\nHe was on a really popular rival TV show to \"The Nickel Samurai\".\nPearl:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nThe victim was the action star, Juan Corrida. He got a huge push and rode the express train to stardom. I mean, even I know who he is!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, even I recognize his face...)\nGumshoe:\nBut I heard lately that Matt Engarde's been taking the wind out of his sail. I'm telling you, pal, as far as who's popular, those two are hogging all the limelight.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess there's no space for Mr. Powers at all, huh... Poor guy...)\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde... Um... That's the Nickel Samurai, right...?\nGumshoe:\nYup. I mean, no! You've got to say it with more umph! \"The Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n...Anyway, so now that Juan Corrida's gone, that means Mr. Engarde has the whole stage to himself, wouldn't you say?\nGumshoe:\nI wouldn't bet on it, pal. We can't have that happen, you know?\nPhoenix:\n\"Can't have that happen\"? (What's that supposed to mean, I wonder...)\nArrested? (appears after presenting Matt Engarde profile)\nPhoenix:\nWh-Why was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's not something I can tell you. We just started the investigation, so we don't want any leaks.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like yet another \"Steel Samurai\" hero is in hot water...)\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick... If Mystic Maya knew about this...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know. She'd make me take this case... I know...\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI was really shocked by what happened to her in that one case. I didn't know she had such an awesome power!\nPearl:\nAwesome power...?\nGumshoe:\nI thought maybe I should do some self-improvement and take up a hobby. So I went out and bought some Morning Glory seeds and planted them, pal.\nPhoenix:\n...That's a good way to improve yourself.\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. Well, it's nothing really...\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nThat girl is number three on my \"People I've Seen A Lot Of Lately\" list.\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then who's number one...?\nGumshoe:\nAs if you need to ask. It's YOU, pal!\nPhoenix:\nA-Ah... So who's number two?\nGumshoe:\nMaya Fey. ...But it looks like she's not around this time.\nPearl:\nIt must be nice to be such good friends with each other, isn't it Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think that's the real meaning of Detective Gumshoe's list...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nI look good! I think I've lost some weight, pal!\nPhoenix:\nIt's only wishful thinking.\nGumshoe:\nWishful thinking, huh? ... In that case, I wishfully think I've lost some weight!\nPhoenix:\n(I wishfully think he might face the facts one day...)\nGumshoe:\nLately, I've been on the instant noodles only diet, pal!\nJuan Corrida profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm not a real fan of action shows or anything... But I know who Juan Corrida and Matt Engarde are.\nPhoenix:\nYou can't talk about one without talking about the other, I guess.\nGumshoe:\nThey even debuted around the same time. So they have this real fiery rivalry with each other. Kinda like you and me, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(I never knew he thought of me as a rival...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nThe Nickel Samurai! He really took the Grand Prix tonight!\nPhoenix:\nMaya's a big fan of his.\nGumshoe:\nReally? ...Oh, I'm sorry then.\nPearl:\nWhy are you sorry?\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde was just arrested, pal. ...On suspicion of murdering Juan Corrida.\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nAny evidence\nPhoenix:\nWould you take a look at this for me?\nGumshoe:\nListen, pal... I'm not leaking any info about the evidence to you this time. If I do, my salary's really gonna get it... And then I won't even be able to get those instant noodles down at the discount market!\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nDo you know this person?\nGumshoe:\nYou meet a lot of people as a detective, pal. So we make extra sure to not forget people because that's our job. ...Now, having said that, I don't remember ever seeing this person before.\nPearl:\nWhich means that you're kind of forgetful, aren't you Mr. Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThat's not what it means... Not exactly anyway...\nAfter clearing \"The victim\" and \"Arrested?\" Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Hallway:\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPowers:\nHey! So what's going on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Juan Corrida has been killed.\nPowers:\nWh-Wh-What!? Juan is... He's...!?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde.\nPowers:\nY-You're joking, right!?\nPhoenix:\nNope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja.\nPowers:\nOoogh... Not again... I feel sick.\nPearl:\n\"Again\"...?\nPhoenix:\n...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls.\nPowers:\nI still can't believe... No way... No way Matt would...\nPhoenix:\n(...? What's Mr. Powers got in his hand...?)\nPowers:\n...Oh, before I forget... This... This is for you, Mr. Wright. I got this from the bellboy that came by earlier.\nRadio Transceiver received from Mr. Powers.\nPhoenix:\n...For me...? But why?\nPowers:\nI don't know. All he said was it was for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney.\nTalk\nMatt and Juan\nPowers:\nMatt is the most energetic and active actor out there right now. The Nickel Samurai really sealed his place as a pop idol, but... he kept adding fuel to the fire of his rivalry with Juan anyway.\nPearl:\nMr. Juan... He's the Jammin' Ninja, right?\nPowers:\nThose two would butt heads over everything they could think of. But I'd say that Matt was the one who almost always came out on top.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess some people only know how to relate to others by butting heads like a ram...)\nPowers:\nJuan said that he'd take Matt on this time too, so he joined a rival TV show.\nPearl:\nAnd that was \"The Jammin' Ninja\"...?\nPowers:\nThe stylish Nickel Samurai and the burning Jammin' Ninja... Well, things turned messy real fast with those two using their shows for their \"war\". And the final tally... Look around... It's pretty obvious how things ended up.\nPhoenix:\n(Matt even won the Grand Prix this year... The final win over his rival, I guess...)\nPress conference\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde was going to hold a press conference, wasn't he?\nPowers:\nThat's what I heard. Though if you wanted to get technical about it, it was the Nickel Samurai's conference.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai's...?\nPowers:\nYeah. He was supposed to wear his costume and give the press conference that way.\nPhoenix:\nHe was going to be in costume...? But why? (Changed from [So he was supposed to be in-costume...? But why?] in the original release)\nPowers:\nI'm not sure... They don't keep me in the loop anymore.\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nPowers:\nIt was almost right after you guys left. An old man who's a bellboy at this hotel showed up.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when he told you to give this to me...?\nPowers:\nYeah...\nPhoenix:\n(Why... Why give me this transceiver...?)\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nHey, where did Maya go off to?\nPhoenix:\nShe got a phone call.\nPowers:\nOh yeah, that's right. She was heading for the front desk just now. She sure stands out in a crowd, doesn't she?\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, then they're all shocked because they figure out who I am...\nPearl:\nI think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Mr. Powers is getting teary eyed.)\nJuan Corrida profile\nPowers:\nHe debuted around the same time as Matt in everything, you know.\nPearl:\nReally?\nPowers:\nYeah, it started out small... First it was singing contests, then swimming competitions... Then it was bowling tournaments, and then it was who could throw the best New Year's parties... Juan was always trying to one-up Matt. But lately, those two were escalating to more and more dangerous things... I thought that no good would come of it all, so I began to worry.\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad Juan's story ended so soon...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nPowers:\nMatt's younger than me, but you can practically see his star potential.\nPearl:\nHis star po-ten-shial...?\nPowers:\nI got his autograph the other day.\nPhoenix:\n...Feels kind of wrong now, doesn't it?\nPowers:\nI don't care what people say! Matt didn't kill Juan! I know he didn't!\nAny other profile\nPowers:\nUmm... I'm honored you're asking me, But I have no idea who this person is. Umm... Sorry...\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPearl:\nUm... I was just wondering... Where's Mystic Maya? She's been gone a long time.\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, she was only going to answer a phone call...)\nPearl:\nMaybe she got lost. I'll take a quick look around for her.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nPearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I... I'm not sure... (It's coming from this transceiver...) (Changed from [Did this transceiver just...?] in the original release)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, hello? Wright here...\n???:\nIs this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney?\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are...!?\n???:\nYou don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMaya:\nHeeelp! Niiiiick!\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\nMaya...?\n???:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Wouldn't you agree that the more important issue is the fate of the girl?\nPhoenix:\n(Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?) Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?\n???:\nCome now. Don't fall apart on me yet.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This... No! This can't be!)\n???:\nNow that I have your attention, Mr. Attorney, I have a modest proposal for you. If you do what I require, then I will return to you your valuable \"item\" unharmed. ...What is this called again in your fancy lawyer terms?\nPhoenix:\n...\"Kidnapping for ransom\"...\n???:\nYes, that's it. This is a kidnapping.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nPhoenix:\n(M-My sight... Everything's fading away... Maya... Maya... Maya's been kidnapped!)\n???:\n...--re you there? Mr. Attorney, are you there? (Changed from [You there? Mr. Wright, are you there?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nH-How much!? How much do you want!?\n???:\nVery good, Mr. Attorney. I'm glad you have such a good grasp of the situation.\nPhoenix:\nHurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya--\n???:\nMoney is not what I seek.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\n???:\nWhat I want is a certain verdict. I would like a complete acquittal.\nPhoenix:\nComplete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!?\n???:\nI am not the person you will be representing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\n???:\nYou are currently at the Gatewater Hotel, are you not? And I know that a murder has just taken place there.\nPhoenix:\nJuan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde...\n???:\nYou are, as expected, quite on top of things, Mr. Attorney. Now then. What I want is very simple. I want you to obtain a complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nM-Matt Engarde? But why?\n???:\nHe did not kill anyone. I can attest to that. However...\nPhoenix:\nH-However!? However what!?\n???:\nHowever, someone is framing him for the murder. A very smart someone who is setting him up to take the fall...\nPhoenix:\n... (If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?)\n???:\nYou are, of course, at liberty to take me at my word or not. (Changed from [You are, of course, at liberty to believe me or not.] in the original release) However, there is one thing you can take as fact. Right now, your very precious \"item\" is with me, in my possession.\nMaya:\nMmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\n???:\nYou have two days. Of course, tonight, he will be in questioning with the police. But the trial is in two days. At that trial, you will win a not guilty verdict. Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nO-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!?\n???:\nYes, exactly. I don't believe I was wrong in choosing you, so don't let me down.\nPhoenix:\nAagh!\n???:\nOh, yes, that's right. Now that I am playing the role of the kidnapper, I can't pass up this chance to say, \"And don't even think about callin' the cops!\" ...Hmm, not great, but you get the idea.\nPhoenix:\nD-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!?\n???:\nAlright, I'll tell you that much. My name is... ...De Killer.\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Wh-Where is Mystic Maya!?\nPhoenix:\n...She's been kidnapped.\nPearl:\nN-No... ... It's all my fault! If only I had gone with Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault, Pearls.\nPearl:\nBut it is! It is! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nPowers:\nMr. Wright... I think we... I think we should tell the police what it's [sic] going on...!\nPhoenix:\n(No! We can't do that! If we do, who knows what will happen to Maya...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What about the detective we saw earlier...?\nPhoenix:\n(...Detective Gumshoe!) Yes, that's it! Wait here, and I'll be right back!\nPowers:\nAlright! I'll take care of Pearl while you're away!\nHallway\nGumshoe:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANSOM!?\nPhoenix:\nShhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nGumshoe:\nWait, the deal is \"complete acquittal\" in exchange for Maya, you mean...? Then this means Matt Engarde is obviously the killer, pal! No doubt about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent...\nGumshoe:\nYou really believe what a KIDNAPPER tells you, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd on top of everything else, there's all this evidence we keep finding.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nThe forensics team's having a field day back there. (Changed from [The guys with the eagle eyes are really lapping it up like they just caught a huge fish.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nGumshoe:\nBut it's strange. There's so much evidence that it feels like something's wrong.\nPhoenix:\nThere's too much evidence? Is that possible? (Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being \"set-up\"...?)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, looks like you won't be leaving here tonight, pal. Just sit tight and cooperate with the investigation. Tomorrow you can start yours.\nPhoenix:\n...A-Alright... (Isn't there another way...?)\nGumshoe:\nWe've also got to be careful about pushing the kidnapper the wrong way.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right...\nDate:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0???\nMaya:\nNnngh... Oww, my head... (Wh-Where... Where am I!? I wonder if I'm still in that hotel... Wh-What happened to me...?) Nick... Pearly! ... (Come on, you guys. This isn't funny anymore...)\n...*ka-click*...\n???:\nI see you have awoken.\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you!?\n???:\nMe? ...I am known as \"De Killer\".\nMaya:\n\"D-De Killer\"!? You mean like an \"ASSASSIN\"!? (I... I'm too young to die!)\n???:\nDon't worry. You are not my target. ...For now anyway.\nMaya:\nA-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nick! Nick! Where are you!? ...Help me...\n???:\nYes, that's right. Only one person can save you now, and that is Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\n...Huh? Wh-What? Nick... Nick's going to save me...?\n???:\nCalm down and be a good girl. Think of this as a business transaction.\nMaya:\nA... A business transaction?\n???:\nI am going to contact him now. I hope you'll cooperate and play your assigned role well.\nMaya:\n...Nick... What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearly... (Changed from [What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearls...] in the original release) ...Sis...\n???:\n... Is this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney? ... You don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with...

Let's hurry and go see Mr. Engarde!\nPhoenix:\nWe have to wait a bit, Pearls. Visiting hours don't start until 9 AM, so...\nPearl:\nOh, I see. Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I had gone with you... (Changed from [Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I went with you that time...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls... She's been like this since last night... We managed to get home somehow, yesterday evening... Thanks to Detective Gumshoe gently holding her by the hand and leading her here... But by the looks of it, I don't think Pearls got any sleep at all last night.)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mystic Maya... She's alright, right!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she's alright. Either way, I'm going to save her. You can trust me on that.\nPearl:\nPlease... Please... Help her...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm only able to stay this calm and collected...

I have a thought...\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nPearl:\nYou're going to represent Mr. Engarde... aren't you?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I don't really seem to have a choice.\nPearl:\nUm, but what if... What if he... ...is the real murderer? What would you do then, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWould you fight to get a not guilty for a murderer to save Mystic Maya...?\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Let's talk to Mr. Engarde first, OK? ...We can think all the bad things we want, but it doesn't change a thing.\nPearl:\nY-Yeah, you're right... I'm sorry. I... I can't stop thinking about it...\nMaya's situation\nPhoenix:\nPearls... You're really worried about Maya, aren't you?\nPearl:\nI... I don't have anyone else left in this world.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean...?\nPearl:\nMy family's all gone...\nPhoenix:\n(...Her family...)\nPearl:\nMy father...

To visit one Nickel Samurai, charged with the murder of the Jammin' Ninja...)\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nG-Good morning. How are you today?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI know this situation might be a little tough for you...\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... We're...\nEngarde:\nOh, sorry dude...\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nI already signed up...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me...?\nEngarde:\nI already have life insurance. I signed up a long time ago cause my job is, you know...\nPhoenix:\n... Oh! No no no... We're not insurance salespeople!\nEngarde:\nReally...? Dude, I really don't need that right now either.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nFire extinguishers. I mean, this building isn't my house, so...\nPhoenix:\n... No no no... We're not here to sell you fire extinguishers either! I'm a lawyer. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nEngarde:\nA lawyer...? ... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my manager, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nThe Nickel Samurai sure is a strange person, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(I think \"strange\" is an understatement.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. You're just in time.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\nEngarde:\nYou're a lawyer dude, right? My manager's looking for a good one right now, so how about it?\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! This is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to make him let me take his case! I have to!)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera. Mr. Engarde keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nSorry to intrude, but I would like to ask you a few personal questions.\nEngarde:\nUm, that's OK, but dude, my autobiography's coming out soon, so... If I say stuff without the publisher's approval, then I'm gonna be in real hot water... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my publisher, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde is so lucky! He has so many people he can talk to.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... I don't know if he actually has anyone he can really talk to...)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. Like I thought, the publisher said it'd be \"real bad\" if I said anything, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(Does he have a mind of his own!?)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, I would like to ask you about the murder...\nEngarde:\nOh, are you covering this for a tabloid as a side job, dude? Um, um... Well, if you want my statement on this, you should ask through my staff...\nPhoenix:\nNo no no... I'm not asking on behalf of a tabloid...\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the president of the studio, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nIs he alright, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(If we're talking about Mr. Engarde's brain here, I wouldn't put my money on it.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. The studio president said, \"Even Neo Mt. Fuji itself knows that I'm not the murderer!\"\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? What's \"Neo Mt. Fuji\"...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a mountain in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo; the city the Nickel Samurai protects.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, this is an attorney's badge.\nEngarde:\nDude, I'm sorry, but I don't have the free time to be looking at things like that.\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nEngarde:\nI'm much too busy with Nickel Samurai stuff right now.\nEngarde:\nI don't have the time to take a lawyer's correspondence course...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does he believe I'm a salesman!? Insurance, then extinguishers... Now this!!)\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\n...? What's that?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a ticket for the press conference. You were going to give one after winning the Grand Prix, right?\nEngarde:\nHuh? Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. While you were in costume, no less. ([in costume] hyphenated in the original release)\nEngarde:\nUm, I never heard anything like that, dude. I only heard about the stage show. I always leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't know...? That's odd...)\nRadio Transceiver\nPearl:\n...Mr. Nick? What are you going to do with that?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know yet, but I figured I could at least show it to him...\nEngarde:\nIs that a transceiver? Hey, it looks like a real nice one, too.\nPhoenix:\nI got it as a \"present\" from someone.\nEngarde:\nHmm? Interesting.\nPhoenix:\nI've also been instructed to take your case.\nEngarde:\nIs that what you heard from the transceiver?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nEngarde:\nDude, that's terrible! Don't let some disembodied voice boss you around!\nPhoenix:\n(This coming from a man with a cell phone on his wrist...)\nWill Powers profile\nEngarde:\nI've seen him somewhere before... Is he a member of my fan club?\nPhoenix:\nThat's Mr. Powers. Isn't he supposed to be kind of like a mentor to you?\nEngarde:\nPowers...? Oh yeah! He's the guy on that kid's exercise program. I gave him an autograph just the other day.\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't see Mr. Powers as a mentor at all...)\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nMan, it's too bad he's dead...\nPhoenix:\nYou killed him... That's the most logical conclusion, don't you agree?\nEngarde:\nDude, what are you talking about!? You're making a huge mistake.\nPhoenix:\nIf that's such a mistake, then why did they issue an arrest warrant for you!?\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the guy in charge of this place, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nStars sure know a lot of people, don't they?\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that phone even really gets reception in here...)\nEngarde:\n...Um, I guess you're right about the warrant after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we might be making some progress here!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nEngarde:\nYeah... I'm such a handsome devil.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um, yeah...\nEngarde:\nAnd I'm way good at sports! Karate, tennis, judo, soccer, football, hockey, fencing...

What did you just say?\nPhoenix:\n\"De Killer\"...\nEngarde:\nD-De Killer!?\nPhoenix:\n(...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...)\nEngarde:\n... Alright, dude. I accept your terms.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEngarde:\nI'll let you represent me in court.\nPearl:\nW-We did it! We did it, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...)\nEngarde:\nGo ahead, ask me anything. I'll help out as much as I can...\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nEngarde:\nMan, I thank my lucky stars that people know my name.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're quite the hero, and you're in the national spotlight.\nPearl:\nI didn't know who he is... Does that mean I'm not a good citizen...?\nEngarde:\nAh, it's really great to be the Nickel Samurai. Dude, lately, I just keep on getting more and more popular.\nPhoenix:\n(True enough... \"The Nickel Samurai\" is very popular among high schoolers and secretaries right now. I guess Mr. Engarde has a way of catching the eyes of women...)\nEngarde:\nDo you know my motto? \"Refreshing like a spring breeze.\" That's what I am.\nPearl:\nA spring breeze...\nEngarde:\nThat's why this kind of scandal is disastrous, dude. I mean, even if I get out of here tomorrow, it's still gonna look bad.\nPhoenix:\n(But everyone loves a good scandal...) (Changed from [Everyone loves a good scandal...] in the original release)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me about your activities last night?\nEngarde:\nAfter I got the award, I took a break and went back to my room. I had that post-ceremony stage show to do. So I was in my Nickel Samurai costume.\nPhoenix:\nAnd you were alone the entire time?\nEngarde:\nMy manager was running around being busy, so yeah.\nPhoenix:\nBecause of the press conference you were supposed to have after the show?\nEngarde:\nI told you, dude. I have no idea about any press conference, alright?\nPhoenix:\n(That's strange... I thought the Nickel Samurai was going to confess something...)\nEngarde:\nAnyway, when I was leaving my room, that's when I noticed it was kinda noisy...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida was already dead at that time...?\nEngarde:\nYeah, that's what I gathered anyway from my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm beginning to gather that this guy can't do a thing on his own...) (Changed from [With the way he's always talking about his manager, it's as if she runs his life.] in the original release)\nEngarde:\nAnd that's when the detective in the green coat showed up. He searched me... And then, out of the blue, the dude arrested me.\nThe victim (appears after \"Matt Engarde\")\nPhoenix:\nAbout you and the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida, what sort of...\nEngarde:\nThat's got nothing to do with anything, dude. Man, with that face of his, you can't even tell he's the same age as me. And he wanted to try making a \"Jammin' Ninja\" movie, even though we all know it'd fail.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai still won in the end, right?\nEngarde:\nYeah. I took the Grand Prix by storm. So why would I, the winner, have any reason to kill the guy anyway? Dude, you'd think it'd be the other way around, you know?\nThe charge of murder (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know why you were arrested?\nEngarde:\nI guess maybe my full body search went badly.\nPhoenix:\nDid they find something on you?\nEngarde:\nThey found a button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nPhoenix:\nA button...?\nEngarde:\nI don't get it either. It was caught in the pleats of my samurai pants, or \"hakama\".\nPearl:\nAaah!\nEngarde:\nDude, I really think someone planted it there though. I'm serious.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that's what really happened...?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nPearl:\nLet's ask one last thing. Let's test Mr. Engarde to see if he really is innocent or not...\nPhoenix:\nW-We can do that...?\nPearl:\nYes. If you use this...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's Magatama!)\nPearl:\nHe won't be able to hide any secrets from you, Mr. Nick. I'm sure of it.\nPhoenix:\n(I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly.\nEngarde:\nWhat is it, dude?\nPhoenix:\nDid you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nPlease put the phone away and answer this question yourself.\nEngarde:\nAlright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWell, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nNothing. Not a chain or lock in sight.\nPearl:\nWhich means... I think it is alright to trust him.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.)\nEngarde:\nUm... The trial's tomorrow, right? I'm counting on you, dude.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 21, 11:34 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWell, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important...\nPearl:\nSo! So now what should we do!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer.\nPearl:\nOK! Then let's start looking!\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Actually, the crime happened at the recently completed hotel in the center of town, the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. ...Just how far are they going to expand their empire...?\nCharley the plant\nPearl:\nOh! I'll water it!\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK... I already did that...\nPearl:\n...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...)\nPoster\nPearl:\nThis is the Nickel Samurai... right?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's right.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!?\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.\nPearl:\nOh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either...\nPhoenix:\nI-It's OK, Pearls. Really.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh! I cleaned it up some more for you last night! ...Because I couldn't sleep...\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSince there were no Psyche-Locks, then that means we can trust Mr. Engarde to be innocent.\nPearl:\nI really feel much better knowing that. Ever since last night, I was so worried that I kept wondering... \"What if he is the real killer...? What then...?\"\nAny ideas\nPhoenix:\nHey, I have something I want to ask you, Pearls.\nPearl:\nOK, what is it?\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you so interested in how Maya and I get along? I mean, she and I don't have anything special go--\nPearl:\nHuh!? Wh-What do you mean!? B-But I thought... I thought you and Mystic Maya were... I-I've been mistaken all this time!? No way...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aaaah! She really wasn't kidding! Pearls actually believes Maya and I are... ...Maybe I should've just left it alone...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Stop it! Don't hide your true feelings from me!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! She slapped me!!)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPearl:\nThat's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nI guess?\nPearl:\nI feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...)\nMaya Fey profile\nPearl:\nOh, Mystic Maya... I wonder if you're alright...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure she's OK. We have to be patient for just one more day. I'm sure we can save her. Trust me.\nPearl:\nIf there's anything I can do, please tell me, OK!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPearl:\nTo tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me.\nPhoenix:\nI think your hair now suits you perfectly.\nPearl:\nR-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget*\nPhoenix:\n*fidget, fidget*\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPearl:\nI'm sure that Mr. Detective would be our ally if we asked!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I think so too. (Looking back, we've known each other for a while now... He's always been trustworthy... A bit \"off\", but still trustworthy. What a paradox.)\nWill Powers profile\nPearl:\nHe's a really kind and nice old man, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is really perceptive when it comes to people... But what does she mean by \"old man\"...?) Hey, Pearls? What about me...?\nPearl:\nWhat about you, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, I don't think I want to hear this...)\nAnything else\nPearl:\nUm, there are still so many things in this world that I don't understand yet. ...Honestly, I still don't have enough training.\nPhoenix:\nAh, no, it's OK. I don't have any ideas myself...\nPearl:\nI'm sorry. I'm really sorry!\nMarch 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEngarde:\nAh, the lawyer dude. So what did you find out?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... I'm still in the middle of investigating...\nEngarde:\nI see. ...But I've already told you everything I know, dude.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\nDude, like I told you, I don't know anything about that press conference. I leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(...This is harder than pulling bass from a river...)\nRadio Transceiver\nEngarde:\nSo, why are you carrying around that transceiver...?\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about it.\nEngarde:\nAnd why do you do everything it tells you to do? You know, the messages it sends you, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, he probably doesn't have anything to do with Maya's kidnapping.) ...That's a secret.\nEngarde:\nOK, whatever, dude.\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nLook, dude, I didn't kill him. I mean, the Nickel Samurai kicked the Jammin' Ninja's butt, right? So it's not like I felt threatened by the likes of him.\nPearl:\nBeing rivals sounds like a sad way to relate to another person...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nOldbag:\nHey! What do you think you're doing!? You can't come in without...\nPearl:\nGood morning.\nOldbag:\nHold on, it's YOU! What is going on around here!?\nPhoenix:\nU-Uh... Um...\nOldbag:\nI heard poor Juan was killed. Is that true!? It's a bad rerun is what this is. Another \"Steel Samurai\" doing the most evil of deeds.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you know... That's not entirely...\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know that I was a huge fan of Juan's! Why, oh why, do all the stars I'm interested in drop one by one like flies!? It's always been that way! Ever since I was a little girl in elementary school! The class hamster was fine until it was my turn to clean its cage, and then it died! The other kids started calling me the \"Queen Reaper\". I swear that's what they dubbed me! \"Whoever you name in your evil spell dies within three minutes,\" they would taunt.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened...\nOldbag:\nHmph! Don't push me, boy!\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? I... Um... I couldn't hear everything she said... because she was talking too fast...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...?\nOldbag:\nDon't boss me around, you spiky-haired, smarty-pants!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but...\nPearl:\n...Even Mr. Engarde himself didn't seem to know, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(How does the person who's supposed to give a conference not know about it...?)\nTalk\nThe victim\nOldbag:\nMy dear Hammer died a year ago in that dreadful murder. And only recently did I finally find a star that makes this heart go *badump* again.\nPhoenix:\n...I don't know what to say...\nOldbag:\nI ask you, why does every star I cheer for always ends [sic] up kicking the bucket?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nI'd watch your words! No one's going to get away with saying anything bad about my Juan!\nPhoenix:\nBut I haven't said anything...\nOldbag:\nWell, I don't believe a word that woman says anyway!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What woman?\nOldbag:\nThat irritating, backwater girl with the afro and the horrible country accent. I mean, what is that manner of speaking supposed to be? And why does she never stop? Honestly, women these days. They don't know the meaning of the word \"modesty\". When I was a young maiden, I was so beautiful even the flowers of the field blushed. But despite this, I pressed flowers, or read the stars, or wrote beautiful love poems or\nPhoenix:\n...Pearls? Are you thirsty?\nPearl:\nUm, a little.\nPhoenix:\nOK. I'll go get you some juice or something.\nPearl:\nTh-Thank you very much.\nOldbag:\nHey! Are you paying attention!? Young'uns today!\nPhoenix:\n(So I'm guessing Ms. Oldbag heard everything from Lotta...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nI want to ask you about what happened around the time of the murder...\nOldbag:\nAh, I don't know anything about that. I was here getting ready.\nPhoenix:\nGetting ready? For what...?\nOldbag:\nThe show, of course! ...Well, and the press conference afterwards.\nPhoenix:\n(Cue mysterious music for the magical press conference.)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I don't know anything about the murder.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see...\nOldbag:\n... But.\nPhoenix:\n?\nOldbag:\nBut if you're talking about what I saw, that's different. I saw it very clearly!\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nOldbag:\nI saw the most important moment of the night!\nWhat you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nTh-The most important moment!? You don't mean...!?\nOldbag:\nOh, so now you treat me with respect, you disrespectful child. When you speak to your elders, you should always be polite. Really, kids today.\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see!?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nOldbag:\nThe murder last night was gruesome, wasn't it? But then, what murder isn't?\nPhoenix:\n(Please don't stray onto another tangent... Please...)\nOldbag:\nIf you want to hear more, then show your respect and bring this lady a present!\nWhat you witnessed (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see on the night of the murder!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPearl:\nP-Please! Mystic Maya's life is...\nOldbag:\nAh, but you haven't given me my present yet. ...Hmm... Let's see... I'll only tell it to you if you can bring me Juan's autograph!\nPhoenix:\n(What an unreasonable request... You might as well have asked for the moon!)\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nI don't have anything to say to delinquents like you!\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr... She's clamming up like the old clam she is...)\nPearl:\nPlease! Anything would be helpful!\nOldbag:\nWell then, how about I tell you my measurements?\nPhoenix:\n...Um... No, that's okay... Really.\nPearl:\nShe really doesn't like you, does she Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI know, I know...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like the investigation is still in full swing. The hotel staff and the police are running around like a bunch of headless chickens.\nPearl:\nI wonder if we can do any investigating of our own in this kind of atmosphere...\nPhoenix:\n...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess.\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of, only to disappear... ...If only we had all gone together...\nChandelier\nPearl:\nThat is such a beautiful sight.\nPhoenix:\nThe chandelier?\nPearl:\nYes. But I can't believe it... I can't believe that such a terrible murder happened under such beautiful lights... It's shocking.\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was held on that stage just last night. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nWe ate at this table last night, didn't we?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nPearl:\nI was really happy then.\nPhoenix:\n(I wish I could make you smile again... Even for a second...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHallway\nLotta:\nHey! Yer here! Been waitin' for ya, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nLotta...\nLotta:\nHey! Mr. Cop fella! The thief's showed his face!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!?\nLotta:\nArrest him! Put him on trial! Find him guilty! Give him the death penalty!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong, Lotta!? Are you feeling alright?\nLotta:\nLooked here and there and up and down the mountain, but it ain't here! So why don'tcha just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep! (Changed from [So why don't ya just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep!] in the original release)\nPearl:\nUm, what are you looking for...?\nLotta:\nMy CAMERA! C-A-M-E-R-A! It's my life blood! I'm gonna die without my $700 camera!!\nPhoenix:\nY-Your camera...?\nLotta:\nLook, don't lots of people say the criminal always goes back to the scene of the crime!? And lookie lookie, here ya are!\nPhoenix:\nYep. Here I am... Faced with a Lotta trouble.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...?\nLotta:\nI didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nLotta:\nYeah, that's what I thought too, so I was a nice enough gal to lend a helpin' hand! ...Secretly, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(I have a feeling one of these days, I'm going to end up defending her in court...)\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\".\nLotta:\nSo that's the scene of the murder, I reckon. I thought somethin' had gone on that night, but I didn't never think it was murder.\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\".\nPearl:\nSo Mr. Engarde was here during his break, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what he claims. (Hmm... The crime scene... If he had wanted to get to Mr. Corrida's room... He would have had to pass through this hallway.)\nTalk\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!\nPearl:\nHuh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?\nLotta:\nI had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon. I made this itty-bitty scratch on it and the manager got all huffed up in the face... He gave me his talkin' to and was real mean about it too. He done made me cry at that!\nPearl:\nWhen did you lose your camera?\nLotta:\nLast night, after the murder happened. Musta been when I was busy runnin' around lookin' into things! That's when I lost sight of my dear, darlin' expensive sweetie!\nPhoenix:\nLotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours?\nLotta:\nI don't rightly know. I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?)\nLotta's Camera added to the Court Record.\nCamera (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!\nPearl:\nHuh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?\nLotta:\nI had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon.

So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nLotta, please tell me what you know about what happened at the time of the murder.\nLotta:\nWell, from before the ceremony last night, I was hangin' around here in this area. Yeah, actually I was here until around the time Mr. Engarde was arrested.\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you doing here...?\nLotta:\nYou sure you went to school, City Boy? Wherever Lotta Hart goes, there's a story to be found! A big scoop to be had!\nPhoenix:\nA big scoop...?\nLotta:\nI told ya before. I'm gonna be the best tabloid photographer the world's ever seen! Reckon course that means I'm always lookin' for the perfect shot!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what \"scoop\" she was after this time...?)\nLotta:\nAlthough, I was also on the look out for the other stars that were here, so... maybe I wasn't here the entire time...\nBig scoop (appears after \"Camera\" and \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nLotta... Are you sure you weren't here the entire time? So you could take a picture for your big scoop?\nLotta:\nWell... Maybe I was. But that's what real journalists do! I got some juicy inside info, so I thought to myself, why not get a picture for proof?\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of story was it that you would hang around here...?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nOops, sorry, Mr. Lawyer. Can't be tellin' you that. Trade secret, ya know?\nPhoenix:\n(Not again... Why does everyone have something to hide...?)\nPearl:\nWe've been stopped, haven't we?\nLotta:\nHa ha, yeah! Take that, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here is happy... Ms. Lotta and your \"I rule!\" smile...)\nBig scoop (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou were on the hunt for your big scoop last night?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nIt's just a bunch of tabloid photos. They ain't got nothing to do with the murder.\nPearl:\nIt looks like we have no choice but to remove the Psyche-Locks.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I guess so.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nLotta:\nHey, what's that? ...A press conference ticket? How come I ain't got myself one of them!?\nPhoenix:\nP-Please don't direct your anger at me...\nLotta:\nWhy in tarnations wasn't I invited to that!? How come someone on the bottom of the popularity chart like you got the info, but not me!? Info like that is worth nothin' to ya, am I right or what!?\nPhoenix:\n(...Is that the kind of person she thinks I am...?)\nPearl:\nAre you going to stand there and take that, Mr. Nick!?\nLotta's Camera\nLotta:\nNngh... And I just bought that camera... Who did it!? The thievin' rascal!\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't look straight at me while you're saying that...\nLotta:\nWhen I find the bugger who went and done this, they're gonna pay with a bullet!\nPhoenix:\n(And if you do that, don't expect me to defend you...)\nMaya Fey profile\nLotta:\nNow that I think about it, she isn't with y'all today, is she...?\nPearl:\nUm...\nLotta:\nShe's a spunky one! You shouldn't have been lettin' her outta yer sight. Who knows what she's up to now...\nPhoenix:\n(Like you're one to talk...)\nPearl:\n...\nPearl Fey profile\nLotta:\nAh, just wanna say sorry to ya.\nPearl:\nFor...?\nLotta:\nWell, I really, absolutely thought you were the murderer.\nPearl:\n...Huh?\nLotta:\nYou know... Last time, that thing with Maya Fey...\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!? But why!?\nLotta:\nI mean, you were all worked up, ya know?\nPearl:\n*sniffle* ...Meanie...\nPhoenix:\nLotta, that was very insensitive of you!\nLotta Hart profile\nLotta:\nThis kind of hairstyle is pretty hard to get, ya know. Hard to care for too. Just the other day, I ran my hand through my hair to fix it up, and suddenly, out pops this dollar coin! That's gotta be like hittin' the jackpot!\nPearl:\nWow, that's really lucky!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* What a deep conversation that was...)\nJuan Corrida or Matt Engarde profile\nLotta:\nI don't really care for 'em \"heroes\" or whatnot.\nPearl:\nOh, I see...\nLotta:\nAnd shows they got for kids, those adventures are just plain ol' borin'! Now, adults. We get more caught up in messy, sticky, real situations! ...Even me...\nPearl:\nO-Oh...\nLotta:\nSounds like the tyke's gettin' what I'm goin' with this!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a sec here! Don't go around getting her mixed up in things like that!\nSecurity Lady profile\nLotta:\nThis old granny? Ah, she kept on glarin' at me with those eyes of hers. As if it's my fault. Kept babblin' how she won't forgive people who write \"trash\" about her Juan... ...Ah, yeah, we sorta got into a little fight, ya know...\nPhoenix:\n(A \"little\" fight? Knowing those two, it was probably more of a blabbering contest.)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know anything...\nLotta:\n...*sigh*... I've told ya how many times now? I'm a journalist. I've got so much info runnin' laps in my head I forget things here and there!\nPearl:\nPlease don't get so worked up over this...\nLotta:\nHah! I don't care if ya beg me! \"Be extra tough on kids!\" That's this gal's motto on learnin' youngsters.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nUm... Where are we?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room.\n???:\nMay I help you with something?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... We're...\n???:\nYou're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail.\nPhoenix:\nUm... How did you know I'm his lawyer...?\n???:\nYou were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer.\nPearl:\nWow...\n???:\nIt's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either.\nPearl:\nIt's really not the time to be showing off, Mr. Nick.\nAndrews:\nI am Adrian Andrews. I hate to waste time, so let's get down to business.\nPhoenix:\nA-Alright... (She may be of small stature, but appearances can be deceiving...)\nExamine\nRed suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's probably Mr. Engarde's suitcase. For someone who was only going to be here for the award show, this is a lot of stuff. Looks like he has about three days' worth of clothes in here.\nPearl:\nStars really are different from us, aren't they...?\nBedroom\nPhoenix:\nThat's the bedroom over there.\nPearl:\nThat's a bed...? Wow, they have really big beds here!\nSofa\nPhoenix:\nThere's some samurai-looking clothes on the sofa here.\nPearl:\nUm, I think that jacket looking thing is called a \"happi\".\nPhoenix:\n(Whatever it is, I'm sure something like that would make a great souvenir. Maya would be absolutely thrilled...)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nLooks like dishes left over from dinner... A dinner for two, at that.\nPearl:\nI'm sure they're Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews' plates.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they had T-bone steaks... What's with Global Studios and T-bone steaks...?\nPlate on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a giant bone sitting on the plate.\nPearl:\nI... I don't really like meat...\nPhoenix:\n(...? There's something... weird about this plate... I just wish I could put my finger on what it is...)\nTalk\nNight of the murder\nAndrews:\nI assume the first thing you need to know is what everyone was doing that night, correct?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, that is correct.\nAndrews:\nThen I will tell you. Before the award ceremony, I had dinner with Mr. Engarde. In this very room, I might add.\nPhoenix:\n\"Dinner\"? What did you eat?\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate to waste time with trifling details. If you took a look at the table yourself, you wouldn't need to ask me.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet she's a lot of fun at parties...)\nAndrews:\nWhen the award show was starting, I headed for Viola Hall.\nPhoenix:\nAnd after the show ended, you came back to this room...?\nAndrews:\nNo, I had some small errands to run. I helped with the preparations in the lobby.\nPhoenix:\nOh... (Preparations for the post-ceremony show, I guess...)\nAndrews:\nWhen it was time for the post-ceremony show, I came back to call for Mr. Engarde. After that, I went to visit Mr. Corrida...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you found his body, isn't it?\nAndrews:\n...\nPearl:\nYou really held strong through everything...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... She does seem to be mentally tough as nails...)\nRelation to Engarde\nPhoenix:\nUm, so... About you and...\nAndrews:\nStop right there. You aren't seriously about to ask how Mr. Engarde and I are related, are you? (Changed from [Don't expect me to believe you have been talking to me without knowing how we relate.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nAndrews:\nI have no idea how he could chose [sic] you as his lawyer. (Changed from [I have no idea why Mr. Engarde chose you as his lawyer.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Why did she have to go and say something like that...?)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Calm down and hang in there. I'll give you a shoulder rub to relieve your stress later, alright?\nAndrews:\nI already gave you my name earlier, but I'll add that I'm Mr. Engarde's manager.\nPhoenix:\nHis manager... Speaking of managers, did the victim, Mr. Corrida have one?\nAndrews:\nNo, he did not.\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't?\nAndrews:\nGlobal Studios has a very different policy from Worldwide Studios in that Worldwide Studios does not assign individual managers to their stars.\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nAndrews:\nThis industry is very ruthless and unforgiving. Actually, you look quite ruthless and unforgiving yourself to your poor partner. Dragging a little girl like her to places like this. Honestly.\nPearl:\nYou're wrong! I... I'm doing this to help Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Calm down and hang in there. I'll buy you a juice later, alright?\nPearl:\nNngh...\nMotive for murder (appears after presenting Juan Corrida profile)\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any ideas?\nAndrews:\nAs to...?\nPhoenix:\nAs to why Mr. Corrida was murdered?\nAndrews:\nWhy would you ask me about such a thing...?\nPhoenix:\nI'm just doing my job. So, do you have any ideas?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nSorry, but there's nothing more I have to add to this conversation.\nPearl:\nIs it a Psyche-Lock, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYes... There's getting to be more and more of these lately.\nMotive for murder (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou know something, don't you? About why Mr. Corrida was murdered...\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nAndrews:\nWhy are you asking me? Don't tell me you can see inside my heart.\nPhoenix:\n(No, but I can see the locks you have on your psyche.)\nPearl:\nIf you don't remove her locks...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it's worthless to even ask...)\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one taking care of the arrangements for this press conference, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, that's right.\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Engarde said he \"didn't know\" about it.\nAndrews:\n... Is that what he said...?\nPearl:\nHuh...?\nAndrews:\nActually, I didn't know all the details either. It was a request from the publicity department. All I did was help out and do what I was asked.\nPearl:\nOh... I see.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder about that... I wouldn't take her to be the type of person to do something without knowing the details.)\nWill Powers profile\nAndrews:\nThat's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be.\nPhoenix:\n(Urk... What a horrible thing to say...)\nAndrews:\n...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? For a second, her face twisted in pain...)\nPearl:\nI wonder if something happened to Ms. Andrews...\nJuan Corrida profile\nPhoenix:\nDid you know the victim, Mr. Corrida?\nAndrews:\nYes, I knew him. The world is such a small place, after all.\nPearl:\nDid you know about his rivalry with the Nickel Samurai?\nAndrews:\nHonestly, they were like children when it came to that. Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most trivial things. (Changed from [Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most uninteresting things.] in the original release) ... If either one of them wasn't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die. (Changed from [If either one of them weren't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n! (...I've got a hunch that this woman knows more than she's letting on... She must know why Juan Corrida was killed!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nAndrews:\nI asked to become Mr. Engarde's manager. He's a pleasure to manage with his nice disposition.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Mr. Engarde does seem like a rather weak-willed man; always doing as he's told...)\nPearl:\nHe's always saying, \"my manager,\" right Mr. Nick?\nAndrews:\n...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAndrews:\nI hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... (Take away that layer of sarcasm and she really does seem to hate herself...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, I'd like to ask you about this...\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Where are we...?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Juan Corrida's room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Corrida...?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim... Which makes this the crime scene, too.\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's you! So!? What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!?\nPhoenix:\nNot yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there?\nPhoenix:\n(I just want Maya to be alright...)\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nWe don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal.\nPhoenix:\nCan you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...?\nGumshoe:\nJust this once... \"Special circumstances\" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here.\nPhoenix:\nThank you.\nGumshoe:\nOh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy.\nPearl:\nWow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you!\nGumshoe:\nHa ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I got a map!\nPhoenix:\nThat's great, Pearls!\nPearl:\n... Um... But Mr. Nick, I can't read what it says...\nHotel Guidemap added to the Court Record.\nExamine\nRefrigerator\nPhoenix:\nThere are all sorts of things in this refrigerator...\nPearl:\nThe carrot juice bottle and the tomato juice bottle are both empty...\nPhoenix:\nEmpty...? (It's too much of a hassle to throw them away, I guess.) They're all vegetable juices. I guess he must've been a real health nut.\nPearl:\n...Oh! There's a beet, some ketchup, and a bottle of strawberry jam too!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe red was his favorite color...?\nStuffed bears\nPearl:\nWow, there are a lot of bears!\nPhoenix:\n(Alarm clock ones, collector's editions, stuffed teddies, plastic models... It's pretty overwhelming... Is there a kind of bear he doesn't have...?)\nPearl:\nThere's even a few in the trash can...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I get the feeling maybe the guy didn't really like bears.\nPearl:\nPoor teddies...\nIt's hard to \"bear\" with all these problems... Growl! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n... (I don't think I want to \"bear\" with the trauma the last case caused me...)\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mr. Nick?\nDesk\nPearl:\nHmph! It's so messy here!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls really likes things neat and tidy, I take it...)\nPearl:\nThere are a lot of electronic things in here that I've never seen before. Hey, Mr. Nick! Tell me what they are, pretty please?\nPhoenix:\nOK. That over there is a \"watch\". You wear it on your wrist.\nPearl:\n... I know what a watch is...\nPhoenix:\n(Oops. For a second there, I forgot I was talking with Pearls, not Maya...)\nBlue suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's a suitcase. There are so many things in it that I bet it barely closes. There's his clothes, a dryer, an electric shaver, a calculator...\nPearl:\nDo all stars pack too much stuff like Mr. Corrida?\nTable on right\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Mr. Corrida had dinner last night.\nPearl:\nThis bottle... It's tomato juice.\nPhoenix:\n(We had a lot of food at the award show last night... But I wonder if the stars had gone onstage after only eating a meager meal like this...)\nBedroom\nPearl:\nSo that's a bed, right?\nPhoenix:\nYup. It's big, but it's a bed.\nPearl:\nAaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft!\nPhoenix:\n(Big beds must be a rarity for her...)\nScattered items near guitar case\nPhoenix:\nBottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.\nPearl:\nWhat's this glass fragment from...?\nPhoenix:\nA flower vase maybe? There are flowers on the floor, but I don't know what they are.\nPearl:\nYou don't know much about flowers, do you Mr. Nick?\nGuitar case\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.\nPearl:\nThat's strange. The guitar is not here...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he forgot to bring it to the show?\nPearl:\nBut Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item...\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid...\nPearl:\nYeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nGuitar Case added to the Court Record.\nGuitar case (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess.

There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nWine glass\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nPearl:\nBut doesn't it seem weird?\nPhoenix:\n...What seems weird?\nPearl:\nI mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor.\nPhoenix:\n... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)\nPearl:\nWhy is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?\nWine Glass added to the Court Record.\nWine glass (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww.

(Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIt should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Here's a picture.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a knife in his chest.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal, that's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was stabbed to death...)\nGumshoe:\nThey're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now.\nPhoenix:\nThere were fingerprints on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nYup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nCause of death (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what was the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nWell, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal.

And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nReason for arrest\nPhoenix:\nWhy was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nBecause we had evidence on him.\nPearl:\nEvidence...?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the victim, Juan Corrida, really put up a big fight.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, one look at the crime scene and you can tell. There's signs of a struggle everywhere.\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah. During the fight, his button came off...\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde said something about a button... Something like, one of the Jammin' Ninja's buttons got caught in his \"hakama\"...)\nGumshoe:\nBut that's not all...\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nThere was a witness, pal.\nPhoenix:\nA witness!? Wh-Who is it!?\nGumshoe:\nThat lady... Ms. Oldbag.\nPhoenix:\n(Please... Anyone but her!)\nGumshoe:\nThe prosecution has plenty of evidence to make a solid case... Not to mention there's something around where the vic was that's a little off. (Changed from [Not to mention there's something at the crime scene that was a little off.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nSomething that's a little off...? As in...? (Changed from [Something that was a little off...? As in...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nAs in, that's for you to figure out, pal!\nPearl:\nAlright, let's try to figure it out, Mr. Nick!\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nGumshoe:\nThat's your \"present\" from the kidnapper, huh? While you're talking, it sends and receives radio waves... If we could trace that...\nPearl:\nYeah! We could use it to find out where the bad guy is!\nPhoenix:\n(It uses radio waves, huh?)\nGumshoe:\nI got it! I'll go find a radio scanner, and let you borrow it, pal!\nGuitar Case\nPhoenix:\nWhat can you tell me about this guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nOh, that. This is just what I heard, pal, but that's the Jammin' Ninja's signature item.\nPhoenix:\nThe guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nNo, not that! What do you take me as? I mean the guitar inside, of course!\nPearl:\nBut... The guitar is missing.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, we looked for it too. It's not normal for a person to forget to bring their most famous item to an award show.\nPhoenix:\n(It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...)\nWine Glass\nPhoenix:\nSo about this wine glass...\nGumshoe:\nAh, so you noticed it, pal. The whole crime scene was a mess, but this glass was the only thing that was untouched.\nPhoenix:\nYou noticed that too, Detective Gumshoe...?\nGumshoe:\nNo, actually Ms. von Karma noticed it first.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Pearls noticed it before me too... Hey, wait a minute. So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's here at the hotel...? (Changed from [So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's coming here...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah, she's around. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal. (Changed from [Yeah, she's coming. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal.] in the original release) Especially if she catches you in here. (Changed from [I think it'd be best if you didn't bump into her here.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou can bet the instant I see her, I'll be running the 1,000 meter dash.\nCrime Photo\nGumshoe:\nYou look at this photo and you can't help it. It makes you want to say, \"I can't believe this is the scene of a murder.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Stabbed with a knife after a struggle... A clue is sleeping in this photo somewhere... I know it.)\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm sorry.\nPhoenix:\n...For what?\nGumshoe:\nI really want to help you look for her, pal.\nPearl:\nMr. Detective...\nGumshoe:\nIf anything happens, let me know, OK? I want to help in any way I can!\nPearl Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, little missy. Listen good, OK?\nPearl:\nOK. What is it?\nGumshoe:\nDon't ever pick up a whip, OK? Don't even think about it.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nGumshoe:\nIf you ever find yourself thinking you want one, try to make due with a good slap to the face. Got that? Slap the person in the face. Promise me, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(Personal experience tells me Gumshoe should be careful what he wishes for...)\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nIf I had a choice, she would be number three on my list of people I don't want to see.\nPhoenix:\n...Because I'm in the number one spot?\nGumshoe:\nDon't get all high and mighty on me here. You've taken a tumble into second place, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really? Then who's in first...?\nGumshoe:\nMs. von Karma's miles and miles ahead of you in this race.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh...\nGumshoe:\nShe's really scary... Right now... M-Ms. von Karma... You really don't...\nPhoenix:\n(He's so scared of her that he's whispering now...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, why don't we let bygones be bygones, pal? Look, this guy is guilty. A buck says so.\nPhoenix:\nOne dollar...? Sure you're not talking about Pearls' allowance money?\nGumshoe:\nI... I can't bet any more than that... My salary... It's...\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't matter what we think... I still have to defend Mr. Engarde in court or else!)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick...\nSecurity Lady profile\nGumshoe:\nI thought she was an alien from outer space.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, probably because she's wearing that strange helmet.\nGumshoe:\nNah, even with her helmet off, I thought she was an alien, pal.\nPhoenix:\n... I think that's probably best kept to yourself, if you know what I mean...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nGumshoe:\nShe's Mr. Engarde's manager, right? No matter what I do, I really stink at talking with people like her. As soon as I open my mouth, I get all flustered. See, she's one of those women with a brain. She's someone who \"gets things done\".\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she does give that sort of impression, like she's got it all together.\nGumshoe:\nCompared to her, you can easily tell I'm a \"can't do anything right\" kind of guy. That's why I get all nervous and start messing up.\nPhoenix:\n(I feel sort of bad for him...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you know about this?\nGumshoe:\nUm... There's nothing special I can tell you about this, pal. Look pal, we don't have a lot of time. Why don't you show me something more important? If Ms. von Karma saw me here like this... I'd have to switch sides real fast...\nAfter clearing all Talk options, examining guitar case, and presenting Wine Glass:\n...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*...\nPearl:\nWh-What's that beeping noise, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I've heard this sound somewhere before...)\nGumshoe:\nIt's Ms. von Karma...\nPearl:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nFor some reason, whenever I hear that sound, she pops out of nowhere and whips me! (Changed from [Whenever I hear that sound, for some reason, she pops out of nowhere and whips me!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, that's exactly what happen [sic] the last time...) (Changed from [Come to think of it, that did happen the last time...] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nS-Sorry! I've gotta make myself scarce! Later, pal! Eowww!\nvon Karma:\nAt last, you reveal your true nature... Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(*gulp* Would it be too much to ask for you to be nice to me for a change...?)\nvon Karma:\nSo you're the type to steal information from pitifully hopeless detectives! That's very dishonorable of you!\nPhoenix:\n(Owww!)\nvon Karma:\nHey! Don't you dare run away, Scruffy McTrenchcoat!\nGumshoe:\nAh!\nvon Karma:\nI didn't think the detectives of this country could be this pitiful...\nGumshoe:\nUwaah!\nvon Karma:\nDetective! Come over here for a second!\nGumshoe:\nYeooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!\nvon Karma:\n...Hmph. I feel better knowing at least you were man enough to face your punishment.\nPhoenix:\n(He was so scared, he just froze up on the spot...)\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright! You... You have soiled my perfect prosecution record. I'll never forget that. This time... Victory is mine!\nPhoenix:\n... Victory is yours? Is that all this means to you...?\nvon Karma:\nWh-What...!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nvon Karma:\n... H-Hmph! Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin. (Changed from [Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!\nvon Karma:\nThis isn't over yet... I swear on my family's honor!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! What did she throw at me NOW...!? (Changed from [Ow! Now what did she throw at me...!?] in the original release) What is this...?)\nGumshoe:\n...Well, I guess this means I've gotta get back to the precinct now, pal. If you ever need me, come down to the Criminal Affairs Department, alright? And if you can, try not to let Ms. von Karma see you...\nExamine\nPaper on desk\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, what's this piece of paper...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's called an \"autograph\".\nPearl:\nAuto-graff?\nPhoenix:\nIt's got Mr. Corrida's name written on it, so it's his autograph.\nPearl:\nI can't read it at all. To be honest, I've never seen writing that looks like this.\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's a special way of writing called \"cursive\". Look here. See how it says, \"To my dearest Wendy\" in more normal letters here?\nPearl:\nTh-This sloppy, unreadable writing! It's crazy and cruel to give this to someone!\nPhoenix:\n(Hold on...)\nPearl:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nWendy... I've heard that name somewhere before...\nMr. Corrida's Autograph added to the Court Record.\nAfter visiting Enguarde's Hotel Room:\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPowers:\nOh, Mr. Wright! How are you?\nPhoenix:\nAh, Mr. Powers. Have you been here the entire time?\nPowers:\nYeah. People connected to the murder aren't allowed to go home, let alone leave...\nTalk\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me a little more about the Nickel Samurai TV show?\nPowers:\nOK. \"The Nickel Samurai\" is an action hero program aimed towards kids. It's the sequel to \"The Steel Samurai\".\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nPowers:\nThis time, there are three Samurai Brothers: Aluminum Samurai, Tin Samurai... And of course, the Nickel Samurai. It's a love \"Y\" in Neo Olde Tokyo!\nPhoenix:\nI see... ... W-Wait... A love what...?\nPowers:\nA love \"Y\". This girl, Sayo, works at a tea shop and all three guys fall for her at the same time.\nPhoenix:\nOh... I guess the \"Y\" shape is like the 3 brothers colliding over this one girl?\nPowers:\nAnyway, Sayo is actually the daughter of the evil Strawberry Clan's leader!\nPhoenix:\nSounds like an unusual situation. Like Romeo and Juliet... times three.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah... Strange thing is, this sort of forbidden love story is really big with the office ladies.\nPearl:\nUm...\nPowers:\nYes, Pearl?\nPearl:\nWh-What happens next!? I want to know! Ms. Sayo... Does Ms. Sayo fall in love? She does, doesn't she?\nPowers:\nEvery Sunday at 8 AM.\nPearl:\nI'm going to stop watching \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\" starting this week!\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe she's really considering it!)\nJammin' Ninja\nPhoenix:\nSo what's the \"Jammin' Ninja\" TV show like?\nPowers:\nIt started from a remake of an old movie, to tell you the truth. The Jammin' Ninja is, like the Samurai shows, aimed towards kids. It's the story of a ninja who can't climb a wall, but became a big pop star.\nPhoenix:\n...Uh, what?\nPowers:\nHe was a really lousy ninja. Absolutely couldn't do any ninja things right at all. But boy could he sing! With his trusty bright red guitar in hand, he took the ancient world by storm.\nPhoenix:\nA... A ninja... With a bright red guitar...!?\nPowers:\nAnd then, the final fight in front of his beloved Princess Misola! \"Jammin' versus the Muromachi Five!\" Suddenly! Our brave hero catches a not so Jammin' cold the night before Battle 3!\nPhoenix:\nAww, that's too bad for him...\nPowers:\nY-Yeah... But this kind of pop music-based love story is something high school girls really like.\nPearl:\nUm...\nPowers:\nYes, Pearl?\nPearl:\nWh-What happens next!? I want to know!\nPearl:\nJammin'... The Jammin' Ninja! Will he be able to sing!? What about Princess Misola!?\nPowers:\nEvery Sunday at 8 AM.\nPearl:\nUmm... Which show should I watch...? Hmm...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe she's really  considering it!)\nThe gossip on Adrian (appears after presenting Adrian Andrews profile)\nPhoenix:\nWould you mind telling me about this \"gossip\"?\nPowers:\nAh, so you ARE interested in it! I figured you would be! (Changed from [Ah, so you're interested in it too!

That was Juan's...\nPhoenix:\nI'm guessing you've seen this case before?\nPowers:\nIt's pretty famous by now. It stands out because it holds THE bright red guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(The bright red guitar...

I saw him coming out of Juan's room.\nPhoenix:\nYou're kidding!\nPearl:\nOh no!\nOldbag:\nIt was about ten minutes before Juan's body was discovered. It was just a coincidence.

That's according to Adrian Andrews herself.\nPhoenix:\nThen... That means her super-confident attitude...\nEdgeworth:\nIt's all a fa\u00e7ade. She's only copying her mentor's behavior to hold herself together.\nPhoenix:\n(How terrible...)\nPresent\nSuicide Report\nEdgeworth:\nI don't like to look through reports. I like suicide reports even less. Worst of all are the reports that have multiple parts like that one. That has two.\nPhoenix:\n...Two parts?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat you just handed me is the first part of the report... Here is the second part.\nPhoenix:\n(The second part of the report is about an attempted suicide...) The attempter's name...! It's \"Adrian Andrews\"!\nPearl:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?

He must have been pretty downhearted after losing.\nEdgeworth:\n...Gumshoe:\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls!\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah, I guess, but...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all!\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUm, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired.\nGumshoe:\nEh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's...\nEdgeworth:\nI look forward to your pension negotiations.\nGumshoe:\nN-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Detective.

Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\".\nGumshoe:\nHuh? But can't you tell by just looking at it?\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nA-And the victim's blood is on it.\nPhoenix:\nAnyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward.\nGumshoe:\n... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Thread.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nThe button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal!\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nMia:\nThat's Edgeworth for you.

And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder...\nEdgeworth:\nThe police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people...\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe:\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow were the fingerprints arranged on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nBy examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...?\nGumshoe:\nOh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe the bumbling of this department...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe:\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife!\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...)\nMia:\n...Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nThere's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"Phoenix:\n(A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)Mia:\nBe grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix:\nWe're still in a world of trouble...Mia:\nWell, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?Phoenix:\nWait a second!Gumshoe:\nWh-What?Phoenix:\nSo the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?Gumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The defendant...Phoenix:\n...Did not buy this knife.Gumshoe:\nH-Huh!?Phoenix:\nTake a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe:\n...Huh?Judge:\nIt has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...Gumshoe:\n\"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.Phoenix:\nThat's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.Gumshoe:\n... Uh oh.Phoenix:\nThe murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!Judge:\nYes, that is very true! This is a very big...Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...Judge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nI think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.Phoenix:\nH-How so!?Edgeworth:\nI admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.Gumshoe:\n...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*Edgeworth:\nThe question is... Where did this knife come from?Judge:\nWh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...Edgeworth:\nSorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.Judge:\nThere is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?Edgeworth:\nIf it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.Phoenix:\nUrk...Edgeworth:\nMr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.Judge:\nAmazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.Mia:\nIt seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...Phoenix:\n(This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)Judge:\nA murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.Edgeworth:\nI can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.Phoenix:\n(Evidence not yet shown...?)Mia:\nHe means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.Judge:\nWhat does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nUm, well...Mia:\nPhoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...Phoenix:\n(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)Judge:\nMr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?Actually, I do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"No, not right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.)\nJudge:\nLooks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means this court is adjourned.\nMia:\nPhoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!)\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"Phoenix:\nThere's one...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nOne piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!Judge:\nMr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.Edgeworth:\nWhat the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.Phoenix:\n(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)Judge:\nYou may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?Present Wine Glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong.\nJudge:\nI can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nI am a man of my word, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penaltyJudge:\nThis... is a wine glass, is it not?Phoenix:\nPlease look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... Well, yes, I see your point.Phoenix:\nHowever! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!Judge:\n...Gumshoe:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nW-Well? What do you all have to say...?Judge:\nAh, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...Phoenix:\nY-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!Judge:\nYou can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nWhat is it, Your Honor?Judge:\nYour opinion...Edgeworth:\n...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.Phoenix:\n...What!?Edgeworth:\nIt's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.Judge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)It's possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...)\nMia:\nYou can't think like that, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nRight now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(So in other words, push as far as we can go...)\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"There's no way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!)\nMia:\nThey just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough!\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"Phoenix:\nThe defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!Judge:\nHmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?Phoenix:\n(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)Edgeworth:\nUnlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Edgeworth:\nYou're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?Phoenix:\nTh-Then...Edgeworth:\nOf course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.Phoenix:\nFingerprints...Edgeworth:\nThere were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.Judge:\nOnly one? Well, whose were they!?Edgeworth:\nThey were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nThat is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)Edgeworth:\nMs. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.Phoenix:\nGrrr!Edgeworth:\nI've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!Judge:\nW-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...Edgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.Phoenix:\n\"Another witness\"...?Edgeworth:\nYes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!Mia:\nWhat in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?Edgeworth:\nNow then, witness, please state your name and occupation...Oldbag:\n...Edgeworth:\n... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Edgeworth:\nUurrngh!Oldbag:\n...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!Edgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Phoenix:\n(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)Oldbag:\nOh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!Edgeworth:\nI saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?Oldbag:\nI tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.Judge:\nMs... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nOof!Oldbag:\nShush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!Judge:\nYes, madam.Edgeworth:\nNo no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.Oldbag:\nIt's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?Edgeworth:\nThe witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag:\nIt was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!Judge:\nYou mean... You were a fan of the victim?Oldbag:\nLook, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!Phoenix:\n(Um... But those two were the same age...)Oldbag:\nAnyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.Edgeworth:\nVery well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.Oldbag:\nLeave it to me, Edgey-poo!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Judge:\nHmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...Oldbag:\nSee! It has to be him! He's the murderer!Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what was your post on that night?\nOldbag:\nThe lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...)\nOldbag:\nBesides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?Oldbag:\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSomething you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that?\nOldbag:\nIt's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course.\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Gossip\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nIf this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony.\nMia:\nIt looks like we shouldn't force it right now.\nJudge:\nHmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?Oldbag:\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room?\nOldbag:\nI have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am!\nJudge:\n...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?Oldbag:\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho in the world was that!?\nOldbag:\nI'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was...\nJudge:\nYes...? He was...?\nOldbag:\n... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...)\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.Oldbag:\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release))\n\n\n\nThe person's face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's face in more detail!\nOldbag:\nYou don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth!\nPhoenix:\nHis teeth were... shining?\nOldbag:\nWell, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie.\nPhoenix:\n... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!?\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the person was carrying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was the man you saw carrying?\nOldbag:\nIn which hand? His right or his left?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nAh, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand?\nOldbag:\nAh, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand.\nPhoenix:\nThen how about his left?\nOldbag:\nEmpty.\nPhoenix:\n... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable?

Really, as if something like that matters.\nPhoenix:\nBut it does.\nOldbag:\nUm... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat thing?\nOldbag:\nThat gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...)\nOldbag:\nThat thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!!\nPhoenix:\nUm, right...\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright.

It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nPerson: Oldbag\nTestimony 4\nTestimony: It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!\nPerson: Oldbag\nTestimony 5\nTestimony: He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\nPerson: Oldbag\n\nWhich evidence and testimony contradict each other? You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other in the given case. They provided a lot of information from the game transcript, characters, evidence, and testimonies.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, the key one here is Oldbag's testimony where she claims that Matt Engarde was seen coming out of Juan Corrida's room wearing his flashy racing jacket. The relevant testimony is number 5: \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\"\n\nNow, checking the evidence, the Jammin' Ninja's Button (evidence 16) is mentioned as being found in Engarde's hakama. However, if Engarde was wearing his racing jacket at the time, as Oldbag testified, then his hakama (part of the Nickel Samurai costume) wouldn't be worn with the racing jacket. The button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume being found in the hakama suggests that Engarde was in his Nickel Samurai costume, not the racing jacket, which contradicts Oldbag's claim about the jacket.\n\nWait, but the evidence list shows that evidence 16 is the Jammin' Ninja's button, which was found in Engarde's hakama. If Engarde was wearing the racing jacket, he wouldn't have been wearing the hakama (which is part of the samurai costume). Therefore, Oldbag's testimony about the jacket conflicts with the presence of the button in the hakama, implying that the person she saw wasn't Engarde in his samurai outfit but someone else, perhaps in different clothing. This contradiction would undermine her identification of Engarde as the person leaving the room.\n\nSo the contradiction is between testimony 5 (about the racing jacket) and evidence 16 (button found in hakama). The presence of the button in the hakama suggests Engarde was in his samurai costume, not the racing jacket, thus contradicting Oldbag's testimony.\n\n{\"evidence\": 16, \"testimony\": 5}",

The moment you've all been waiting for! Who will be this year's Grand Prix Champion? Who will be our \"Hero of Heroes\"!? Will it be last year's runner-up, Jammin' Ninja!? Or maybe Captain Saipan all the way from the lovely tropical island of Saipan!? I see the students of a certain Starry School are raring to win! And Global Hero Onyankopon doesn't want to go home without the prize! We hope Lady Luck is with all our heroes tonight! And now! The winner of the third annual Hero of Heroes Grand Prix... IS ME!!\nWhoooooooooa! The true hero of the night has appeared in our midst! It looks like this year's Grand Prix goes to this fantastic warrior! The Nickel Samurai! Too bad, Jammin' Ninja. Looks like the title eluded you again this year!\nMarch 20, 7:42 PMGatewater HotelViola Hall\nMaya:\nAlright! Yes! Did you hear that, Nick!? Did you!? The Nickel Samurai! He did it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.\nPowers:\nAh, I'm proud of the guy for doing the series justice.\nPearl:\nU-Um... So the person everyone was cheering for... I guess he got the prize?\nMaya:\nYup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? \"The Nickel Samurai\"!\nPearl:\nNo. Every Sunday, I only watch the Educational Channel's \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nOK, that's it! From now on, it's \"The Nickel Samurai\"! All the kids watch it!\nPearl:\nDo you like \"The Nickel Samurai\" too, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nNah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. But I do like \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nHey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed to watch it anymore! You're supposed to act your age and have interests that match. ...It's very important.\nMaya:\nAw, give it a rest, Pearly!\nPowers:\nLooks like I made the right choice in inviting everyone here. I'm glad you're all having a good time.\nMaya:\nAaaaah... It's like a dream!\nPowers:\nToo bad for the Jammin' Ninja, though. Last year, he lost to The Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo. I thought this might be his year...\nMaya:\nYeah... Oh, hey, did anyone else think that the Jammin' Ninja was a bit different today?\nPearl:\nDifferent? What do you mean?\nMaya:\nUm, well, he wasn't carrying his bright red guitar.\nPowers:\nHey, you're right! Strange he'd walk around without his signature guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh* I will never understand these people and their shows...) Anyway, Mr. Powers, thank you very much for tonight.\nPowers:\nA-Aw, it was nothing... I owe you one, so it's just my way of saying thanks.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! It's time to get going to the lobby! There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.\nPowers:\nAnd then, I heard there's going to be a press conference after that.\nPhoenix:\nA press conference? Is he going to make a speech about winning this year's prize?\nPowers:\nUh, well, not exactly... Something about the Nickel Samurai confessing something.\nPhoenix:\nConfessing...? Sounds pretty serious.\nMaya:\nArgh! Nick! COME ON! You don't want us to be the last ones there, do you!?\nPearl:\nYeah, Mr. Nick! Do you!?\nPhoenix:\n(Why me...? The show doesn't even start for another 20 minutes...)\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there.\nPowers:\nAnd behind those doors is an equally grand lobby.\nPearl:\nShall we go and take a look, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nHey, wait up! This grand dessert is calling to me... It's saying, \"Eat me now!\"\nWalls or ceiling\nPhoenix:\nThis sure is one luxurious hotel. Almost to the point of gaudy, with how it blends together everything \"fancy\" imaginable. (Speaking of fancy, didn't that bellboy give me something like that last year?)\nChandelier\nMaya:\nThat chandelier is really something, isn't it?\nPearl:\nI thought it was a kind of space ship...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. How about we get one of these for the office?\nPhoenix:\nOne of those hanging from our poor, weak ceiling? I don't think so.\nTables at back\nMaya:\nIf this is all a dream, I don't ever want to wake up! And all the directors and stars that were here to see the heroes, wow.\nPhoenix:\nI had no idea who most of them were.\nPearl:\nNeither did I.\nMaya:\nNick, you've got to cut that \"news only\" habit out. Your new show is going to be \"The Nickel Samurai!\" Every Sunday morning at 8! Oh, I know! We can watch it together starting next week! I'll come wake you up extra early to make sure, OK?\nPhoenix:\nAh, I'm fine... You know, you really don't have to on my account...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second.\nMaya:\nWell, shows like that are guaranteed to be good, you know?\nFront table\nMaya:\nWhat can I say? This is a really high-class hotel!\nPearl:\nI've never eaten this kind of salad before.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nMaya:\nDon't worry! Any leftovers belong in my happily awaiting stomach anyway!\nPhoenix:\nYou're such a glutton, Maya.\nPowers:\nAh, I lose this one to Maya. You sure can eat.\nMaya:\nWell, a growing girl needs her nutrients!\nPhoenix:\n(A growing girl? Exactly how big do you plan on getting...?)\nTalk\nWill Powers\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much for inviting us today.\nPowers:\nAww, it was nothing really. Guys like us don't get to come to a place like this often, so I thought I'd invite you all.\nMaya:\nHey, Mr. Powers! What have you been up to lately?\nPowers:\nWell, since \"The Pink Princess\" successfully wrapped up last month, I've been on a kid's exercise show... ...while wearing a rabbit mask over my face...\nMaya:\nOh, I see.\nPowers:\nI'm still really sorry about all the headaches I caused you that time, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nAh, well. What's done is done, so let's forget about it. (This is Will Powers. He's an action star. His popularity exploded when he was the Steel Samurai. And he was the first case Maya worked on with me.)\nMaya:\nIt's too bad you look scary, or people'd know you're a real softy who's good with kids. (Changed from [You can't tell by looking at you, but you're a really nice guy with a love of kids.] in the original release)\nPowers:\nUm, thanks. (Changed from [Ah, thanks.] in the original release)\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe they're going to make a movie based on the Nickel Samurai.\nMaya:\nI can't believe it either, but for a different reason!\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai. An epic story of one hero in a desperate fight against his arch-enemy, the Evil Magistrate in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo. And last year, they started a new series, \"The Nickel Samurai\". The new series seems to be a hit with the kids, too.\nPowers:\nI'm really attached to the Steel Samurai as a show, (Changed from [The Steel Samurai is a show I have a lot of strong feelings for,] in the original release) so I was hoping that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one... (Changed from [so I hoped that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nYeah, it's too bad... It'd been [sic] awesome to see you with the new actor, Matt Engarde. (Changed from [Yeah... It's too bad... It'd be great to see you on the show...] in the original release) He's super popular right now. (Changed from [With the new actor, Matt Engarde. He's super popular right now.] in the original release)\nPearl:\nMr. Un-gard...?\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Pearls doesn't know who he is.)\nMaya:\nThis year it's going to be the Nickel Samurai vs. the Jammin' Ninja at the box office!\nPhoenix:\n...Jammin' Ninja...? Who's that again?\nJammin' Ninja (appears after \"The Nickel Samurai\")\nPhoenix:\nSo who is this \"Jammin' Ninja\" again?\nMaya:\nHe's a hero, duh. His symbol is a bright red guitar he's always carrying.\nPhoenix:\n(A ninja who's always carrying around a bright red guitar...? How does that even work!?)\nMaya:\nWith a scarf around his neck and a guitar in hand, he rises to stardom in an ancient time.\nPhoenix:\nA ninja... Who becomes a star??\nMaya:\nYeah! A ninja who becomes a star!\nPowers:\nThere's a strong rivalry between the two of them. Global Studios' Nickel Samurai and Worldwide Studios' Jammin' Ninja. They even air at the same time.\nMaya:\nYou know what I heard? I heard those two don't get along at all. The Nickel Samurai's Engarde and the guy who plays the Jammin' Ninja, I mean.\nPhoenix:\n(The Nickel Samurai speaks French!? Oh, you mean Matt Engarde, the actor...) I guess even the world of heroes isn't a sparkling, happy place.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPowers:\nAh, I really owe you one. If it wasn't for you guys, I don't know what would've happened. What you did... It was a real tight spot I was in, and you fought so hard to get me out. I don't care what happens. I'll never forget everything you've done for me.\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo, you're going to study to become a lawyer too. Am I right or am I right?\nMaya:\nUmm...\nPowers:\nIt must be real tough. There's all those thick books with hard words you have to read...\nMaya:\nUh, um... Well...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, yeah. Mr. Powers doesn't know that Maya's a spirit medium...)\nMaya:\nI thought he'd be able to tell by my clothes.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he thinks that you've got some strange hobby on the side or something.\nMaya:\n...Hey, wait a sec. What's that's supposed to mean!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo are you Maya's little sister?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but no.\nPowers:\nOh, then you must be Mr. Wright's little sister!\nPearl:\nAgain, I'm sorry, but...\nPowers:\nThen... Whose little sister are you?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but I'm an only child.\nPowers:\nOh, I see... S-Sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(Pearl looks so sad... She looks really sorry too...)\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, they're all shocked because then they figure out who I am.\nMaya:\nHmm... Well, I don't think you look scary.\nPearl:\nMe either. I think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Those two are making Mr. Powers tear up...)\nAnything else\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Thanks for taking the time to take it out and show it to me, but I'm really sorry, I don't know a thing about it.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nPhoenix:\nWow, what is with this place? Looks like I've stumbled into Oz or something. Way in the back, there's a sign for the bathroom. Maybe I should visit it while I can before the show starts... (Changed from [I bet we have a little time to look around before the show starts...] in the original release)\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...? Could it be that there's an action star who has a soft spot for teddy bears...? ...Nah, can't be.\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". \"Juan Corrida\"... His name just sounds like a star's name. I've heard it before, but I don't know anything about him at all.\nEnd of hallway\nPhoenix:\nThere are toilets in each room in this hotel, but since all sorts of events are held here, there are bathrooms for people who aren't staying here to use as well. Perfect for people like me, who can't afford a stay here in the first place...\nFlowers on right\nPhoenix:\n\"To Mr. Engarde From the Global Studio Staff\" Ah, it'd be nice if lawyers got flowers too. Something like, \"To Mr. Wright From All Your Grateful Clients\".\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\". \"Matt Engarde\"... I've heard that name before. Oh, yeah. Maya's always yammering about him like the obsessed fan she is...\nViola Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Viola Hall and visiting Hallway)\nPowers:\nSounds like the post-ceremony show is about to start.\nMaya:\nAlright! I'm so pumped! I wonder if he's going to show off his special move today? \"Nickel Samurai Smelting!\"\nPowers:\nActually, what I'm interested in most is the press conference.\nMaya:\nYou mean the \"big confession\" the Nickel Samurai's going to make after the show? So what is it? Don't you know what it's about, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nUh, well, I'm not the Steel Samurai anymore, so I don't have any idea.\nMaya:\nBah.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Ah, so I guess you are all going to the press conference then?\nMaya:\nYeah, of course!\nPowers:\nIf that's the case, then here, take these tickets so you can get in.\nPress Conference Ticket added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much. Well, let's get going to the lobby.\nPearl:\nIt looks like it's over this way, Mr. Nick!\nMaya:\nOK! For great justice!\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPowers:\nThey called this so suddenly that something about it just seems off, you know?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the press conference?\nPowers:\nYeah. He said, \"There's something I'd like to confess if I win.\" I heard he faxed his request for a conference in to the office only yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nYesterday... (Yeah, that is kind of sudden.)\nPowers:\nBut I guess his manager set everything up somehow, so he was lucky.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Nice manager.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Only a really gaudy hotel would have such a large, gaudy lobby to match.\nPearl:\nAh, I think they're going to have the post-ceremony show over there.\nPhoenix:\nThey're using a compact stage, I see.\nMaya:\nOoh... I'm all ready to use my special \"Samurai Power\".\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks like she's ready to start a fight...)\nPA Notice:\nYour attention please, your attention please. The Nickel Samurai's Post-Ceremony Stage Show will not be held tonight due to unforeseen circumstances.\nMaya:\nWHAAAT!? WHYYYYY!?\nPhoenix:\nOww! You didn't have to pinch me! Pinch yourself if you don't believe it!\nPA Notice:\nWe are asking for everyone's cooperation at this time. So please stay where you are. ...This is a special request from the police.\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nP-Police? Did they just say the police?\nPowers:\nD-Do you want me to go check out what's going on?\nPhoenix:\nUm, wait, I'll come with you...\n???:\nFreeze! You two! Didn't you hear the announcement just now!? It just finished telling you not to move!\nMaya:\nTh-That voice... I've heard that voice somewhere before...\n???:\nHonestly, youth these days can't be bothered to listen to other people when they talk! Just the other day it was the same thing! There was a small footbridge with a sign next to it that said, \"Beware, Bridge Out!\" And along comes a snot-nosed little punk kid right up to the bridge. I tried to tell the boy the bridge was out and it was dangerous, but would he listen!? No, of course not! He said he'd be careful and only walk on the \"in\" part of the bridge since the \"out\" part is what was dangerous! I am not kidding you here! The kid said that and really meant it! WELL! I really let him have it then, and knocked him clear off of that bridge! Honestly, kids these days don't know right from wrong, I tell you!\nPowers:\nThis non-stop chatter...\nPhoenix:\nI-It can't be... ...Ms. Oldbag?\n???:\n...\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, you young whipper-snappers!? Do I know you!? ...Wait. YOU! You're Powers, aren't you!?\nPowers:\nY-Yeah. Um, about what happened back then...\nOldbag:\nYou didn't even get nominated this year, did you? (Changed from [You didn't get nominated last year either, did you?] in the original release) Oh, that's right. You're doing that children's exercise program, trying to play nice.\nPowers:\nAh, yeah, that's me. Thankfully I still have a job...\nOldbag:\nI love that show, and you're a hoot! You're the \"big brother\" character, right? Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You're that giant rabbit! (Changed from [Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You ended up with a rabbit face.] in the original release) What a work of art, but that's how it is, you know? I mean, if you didn't wear the mask, who knows how many TVs you'd break? Really, and shame on those kids exercising around you. They're getting what they deserve. This is why I thought you shouldn't be anywhere...\nPhoenix:\nUm... What are you doing here?\nOldbag:\nLook at my uniform and tell me you can't tell I'm a member of security!\nMaya:\nBut that outfit...\nOldbag:\nAnnoying, noisy brats get the blaster!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nSecond floor\nMaya:\nWow, it looks like there's a fancy restaurant on the second floor!\nPhoenix:\nYou STILL feel like eating?\nMaya:\nI mean, since we're here, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't pull the \"since we're here\" trick on me...)\nPearl:\nWhat a beautiful mansion. Do you live in this wonderful world every day, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, this is my first time in a place like this.\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to say these cameras were set up to cover the post-ceremony stage show.\nMaya:\nBut I wonder where everyone's gone, abandoning their cameras like this...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess something big must have happened...)\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage for the post-ceremony stage show.\nPowers:\nThere was supposed to be a press meeting after the show, but now...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like no one will hear what the Nickel Samurai had to confess after all.\nSeats\nMaya:\nWe're here, so we might as well take some pictures. OK, everyone, sit in a chair!\nPhoenix:\nBut we're all out of film...\nMaya:\nDon't worry about it. There's a zillion cameras over there we can borrow.\nPhoenix:\nHey, hey! You can't just go and \"borrow\" an expensive professional camera like that!\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nMaya:\nWhat incident? What did you do?\nOldbag:\nI didn't do anything, you young'un! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I plead the fifth.\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me!?\nOldbag:\nI thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.\nMaya:\nYou? A bodyguard?\nOldbag:\nFor your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles.\nMaya:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth?\nOldbag:\nBut...\nEdgeworth:\nThat sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me.\nOldbag:\nThat's what he said to me. What did I ever do to deserve that!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nWhat happened?\nMaya:\nUm... So, did something happen?\nOldbag:\nI don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those \"incidents\" happened again.\nPowers:\nA-An \"incident\"? Like a \"murder\" kind of \"incident\"?\nOldbag:\nMaybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, showers of blood are sure to follow. Bet you didn't know that! (Changed from [So wherever I go, a rain of blood will come pouring down. Bet you didn't know that!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUm, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake?\nOldbag:\nSilence, whippersnapper!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nThese eyes of mine are real pros now!\nPhoenix:\n\"Pros\"? Pros at doing what?\nOldbag:\nAt doing police work, of course! My eyes are like a hawk! And my professional eyes spot a messy incident! A messy, bloody incident! That's why I don't have time for you meddling kids and your petty little things!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\n...Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it? I don't like that devilish smile playing on your lips...\nMaya:\nLet's make like we're going to the bathroom, and check things out!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way. The police told us not go [sic] anywhere, remember?\nMaya:\nHuh!? How B-O-R-I-N-G! You're such a boring guy! You've got no motivation! No spirit!\nPearl:\nHuh? What? What's going on? Are you giving Mystic Maya trouble again, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Not you too, Pearls... Please don't stick your little nose into this one...)\nMaya:\nSo listen to this, Pearly. This one time at lawyer camp, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nO-OK! I get it! Let's go take a look.\nMaya:\nYay! I know you couldn't say no to me, Nick!\nPearl:\nThat's right. You'd walk over miles of hot coals for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That would be EVERY time we work a case together...)\nMaya:\nWell, what are we waiting for? Let's go already! You can come along too, Pearly.\nPearl:\nGoody! I get to come! I get to come!\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nThere's nothing really out of the ordinary here...\nPearl:\nAre you looking for the \"in-si-dent\" that the old lady was talking about? (Changed from [Are you looking for the 'something' that the old lady was talking about?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't look like it happened here. Well, we'd better go look somewhere else.\nMaya:\nAlright! Then, let's try...\nBellboy:\nExcuse me.\nMaya:\nAck!\nBellboy:\nAre you by chance, Ms. Maya Fey?\nMaya:\nUm, yeah... That's me.\nBellboy:\nYou have a phone call waiting for you at the front desk.\nMaya:\nA call? I wonder if it's someone from Kurain Village...\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mystic Maya?\nMaya:\nOh, nothing. You guys go on ahead and I'll be right there, OK? (Changed from [Oh, nothing. I'll just go on ahead to check it out, OK?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nOK.\nBellboy:\nRight this way, Ms. Fey.\nPearl:\nLet's go look somewhere else now, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, OK.\nPearl:\nThis is a little exciting... And a little scary...\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of.\nChandelier\nPearl:\nSo, that's called a \"shan-deh leer\", right?\nPhoenix:\nYup.\nPearl:\nWhat is that for? What does it do?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's for lighting up a room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? Can I look down now? My neck hurts...\nTables at the back\nPhoenix:\nThey haven't cleaned up all the food yet. There's a sad feeling hanging in the air now that the party is over...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nIt's a feast fit for a king!\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPearl:\nIt was the first time I ate that food. What was it called again? I think it started with \"key\". Key... Wee?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, a \"kiwi\".\nPearl:\nI don't know what to say. It's a sweet but sour fruit all in one.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nHotel Lobby\nExamine\nSecond floor\nPhoenix:\nA lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. But right now, the only thing filling this enormous room is anxiety about the murder. ...I really hope nothing else bad happens here...\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nThese cameras must belong to the press that came to cover the conference. They're all basically doing the same thing: staring at the empty stage.\nSeats\nPhoenix:\nSeats for the spectators of the post-ceremony show and the press conference. But it's too bad neither event is going to be held now.\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nPearl:\nUm, I guess you must have done something... um... \"deh-plor-ible\"...\nOldbag:\n\"Deplorable!?\" I would never do such a thing! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I plead the fifth.\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me!?\nOldbag:\nI thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.\nPearl:\n\"Body...guard?\"\nOldbag:\nFor your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles.\nPhoenix:\n(She's not talking about Edgeworth, is she...?)\nOldbag:\nBut...\nEdgeworth:\nThat sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me.\nOldbag:\nThat's what he said to me. What did I ever do to deserve that!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nWhat happened?\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, but what in the world just happened?\nOldbag:\nI don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those \"incidents\" happened again.\nPowers:\nA-An \"incident\"? Like a \"murder\" kind of \"incident\"?\nOldbag:\nMaybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, showers of blood are sure to follow. Bet you didn't know that! (Changed from [So wherever I go, a rain of blood will come pouring down. Bet you didn't know that!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUm, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake?\nOldbag:\nSilence, whippersnapper!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nI. TOLD. YOU. I get people the info they want! Which means that I've got a right to know!\nNope! Don't care who you are, pal, we're still investigating, so you can't go in!\nWhat's yer problem!? Just ya wait! It'll be all over the morning paper! \"Scruffy Detective's Secret Scandal Revealed!\" You'll see! I'll git ya back!\nPearl:\nThose two sound pretty serious...\nPhoenix:\n(That southern accent can only mean...)\nHey, Wright!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey... Lotta...\nLotta:\nCome on, do a gal a favor and tell this cop I'm just doin' my job and I've got rights...\nGumshoe:\nAh, YOU!\nPhoenix:\nAh... Detective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, help a guy out! Tell her that only the police are allowed here! This is the scene of a murder, so she should leave this to us pros...\nPearl:\nA... A murder!?\nGumshoe:\nAw, shoot! Me and my big mouth!\nLotta:\nSee! I knew it! My gut instinct told me so! I always trust my gut! A murder, it said! And that's what it is! A genuine murder!\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, wait...\nYeehaw, a murder! Of a big star, no less!\nGumshoe:\nOh, man... I'm in trouble now...\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nSo... Detective Gumshoe... A murder...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, no, that's not it. I got my facts mixed up for a second there, pal.\nPearl:\nU-Um... Mr. Nick? Is the dead person the Nickel Samurai...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Why do you ask?\nPearl:\nWell, Mystic Maya was rooting for him, so...\nGumshoe:\nIt wasn't the Nickel Samurai that got bumped. Actually, the Nickel Samurai is the one under suspicion of doing the bumping off...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nThe guy that died was this hero named the Jammin' Ninja, pal.\nPhoenix:\nThe Jammin' Ninja...\nLotta Hart\nPearl:\nUm, that woman with the big puffy hair that looks like cotton candy...\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Lotta?\nPearl:\nThat woman... She was there that time too, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat time?\nPearl:\n...When Mystic Maya did that channeling...\nPhoenix:\nOh, that time... Well, Lotta's a journalist, so that's why she was there.\nPearl:\nJer-nal-ist...\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like she was hanging around here before the murder happened.\nPhoenix:\n\"Hanging around\"...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, hiding in wait in front of the Jammin' Ninja's door, pal.\nPhoenix:\nB-But why would she...?\nGumshoe:\nShe wouldn't tell me, pal. Just said something about \"Gettin' my big scoop\"...\nPhoenix:\n(Scoop? What sort of news could she be after...?)\nThe victim (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nSo the victim was the Jammin' Ninja?\nPearl:\nMr. Jammin' Ninja...?\nGumshoe:\nHe was on a really popular rival TV show to \"The Nickel Samurai\".\nPearl:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nThe victim was the action star, Juan Corrida. He got a huge push and rode the express train to stardom. I mean, even I know who he is!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, even I recognize his face...)\nGumshoe:\nBut I heard lately that Matt Engarde's been taking the wind out of his sail. I'm telling you, pal, as far as who's popular, those two are hogging all the limelight.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess there's no space for Mr. Powers at all, huh... Poor guy...)\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde... Um... That's the Nickel Samurai, right...?\nGumshoe:\nYup. I mean, no! You've got to say it with more umph! \"The Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n...Anyway, so now that Juan Corrida's gone, that means Mr. Engarde has the whole stage to himself, wouldn't you say?\nGumshoe:\nI wouldn't bet on it, pal. We can't have that happen, you know?\nPhoenix:\n\"Can't have that happen\"? (What's that supposed to mean, I wonder...)\nArrested? (appears after presenting Matt Engarde profile)\nPhoenix:\nWh-Why was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's not something I can tell you. We just started the investigation, so we don't want any leaks.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like yet another \"Steel Samurai\" hero is in hot water...)\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick... If Mystic Maya knew about this...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know. She'd make me take this case... I know...\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI was really shocked by what happened to her in that one case. I didn't know she had such an awesome power!\nPearl:\nAwesome power...?\nGumshoe:\nI thought maybe I should do some self-improvement and take up a hobby. So I went out and bought some Morning Glory seeds and planted them, pal.\nPhoenix:\n...That's a good way to improve yourself.\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. Well, it's nothing really...\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nThat girl is number three on my \"People I've Seen A Lot Of Lately\" list.\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then who's number one...?\nGumshoe:\nAs if you need to ask. It's YOU, pal!\nPhoenix:\nA-Ah... So who's number two?\nGumshoe:\nMaya Fey. ...But it looks like she's not around this time.\nPearl:\nIt must be nice to be such good friends with each other, isn't it Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think that's the real meaning of Detective Gumshoe's list...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nI look good! I think I've lost some weight, pal!\nPhoenix:\nIt's only wishful thinking.\nGumshoe:\nWishful thinking, huh? ... In that case, I wishfully think I've lost some weight!\nPhoenix:\n(I wishfully think he might face the facts one day...)\nGumshoe:\nLately, I've been on the instant noodles only diet, pal!\nJuan Corrida profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm not a real fan of action shows or anything... But I know who Juan Corrida and Matt Engarde are.\nPhoenix:\nYou can't talk about one without talking about the other, I guess.\nGumshoe:\nThey even debuted around the same time. So they have this real fiery rivalry with each other. Kinda like you and me, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(I never knew he thought of me as a rival...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nThe Nickel Samurai! He really took the Grand Prix tonight!\nPhoenix:\nMaya's a big fan of his.\nGumshoe:\nReally? ...Oh, I'm sorry then.\nPearl:\nWhy are you sorry?\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde was just arrested, pal. ...On suspicion of murdering Juan Corrida.\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nAny evidence\nPhoenix:\nWould you take a look at this for me?\nGumshoe:\nListen, pal... I'm not leaking any info about the evidence to you this time. If I do, my salary's really gonna get it... And then I won't even be able to get those instant noodles down at the discount market!\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nDo you know this person?\nGumshoe:\nYou meet a lot of people as a detective, pal. So we make extra sure to not forget people because that's our job. ...Now, having said that, I don't remember ever seeing this person before.\nPearl:\nWhich means that you're kind of forgetful, aren't you Mr. Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThat's not what it means... Not exactly anyway...\nAfter clearing \"The victim\" and \"Arrested?\" Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Hallway:\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPowers:\nHey! So what's going on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Juan Corrida has been killed.\nPowers:\nWh-Wh-What!? Juan is... He's...!?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde.\nPowers:\nY-You're joking, right!?\nPhoenix:\nNope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja.\nPowers:\nOoogh... Not again... I feel sick.\nPearl:\n\"Again\"...?\nPhoenix:\n...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls.\nPowers:\nI still can't believe... No way... No way Matt would...\nPhoenix:\n(...? What's Mr. Powers got in his hand...?)\nPowers:\n...Oh, before I forget... This... This is for you, Mr. Wright. I got this from the bellboy that came by earlier.\nRadio Transceiver received from Mr. Powers.\nPhoenix:\n...For me...? But why?\nPowers:\nI don't know. All he said was it was for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney.\nTalk\nMatt and Juan\nPowers:\nMatt is the most energetic and active actor out there right now. The Nickel Samurai really sealed his place as a pop idol, but... he kept adding fuel to the fire of his rivalry with Juan anyway.\nPearl:\nMr. Juan... He's the Jammin' Ninja, right?\nPowers:\nThose two would butt heads over everything they could think of. But I'd say that Matt was the one who almost always came out on top.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess some people only know how to relate to others by butting heads like a ram...)\nPowers:\nJuan said that he'd take Matt on this time too, so he joined a rival TV show.\nPearl:\nAnd that was \"The Jammin' Ninja\"...?\nPowers:\nThe stylish Nickel Samurai and the burning Jammin' Ninja... Well, things turned messy real fast with those two using their shows for their \"war\". And the final tally... Look around... It's pretty obvious how things ended up.\nPhoenix:\n(Matt even won the Grand Prix this year... The final win over his rival, I guess...)\nPress conference\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde was going to hold a press conference, wasn't he?\nPowers:\nThat's what I heard. Though if you wanted to get technical about it, it was the Nickel Samurai's conference.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai's...?\nPowers:\nYeah. He was supposed to wear his costume and give the press conference that way.\nPhoenix:\nHe was going to be in costume...? But why? (Changed from [So he was supposed to be in-costume...? But why?] in the original release)\nPowers:\nI'm not sure... They don't keep me in the loop anymore.\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nPowers:\nIt was almost right after you guys left. An old man who's a bellboy at this hotel showed up.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when he told you to give this to me...?\nPowers:\nYeah...\nPhoenix:\n(Why... Why give me this transceiver...?)\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nHey, where did Maya go off to?\nPhoenix:\nShe got a phone call.\nPowers:\nOh yeah, that's right. She was heading for the front desk just now. She sure stands out in a crowd, doesn't she?\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, then they're all shocked because they figure out who I am...\nPearl:\nI think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Mr. Powers is getting teary eyed.)\nJuan Corrida profile\nPowers:\nHe debuted around the same time as Matt in everything, you know.\nPearl:\nReally?\nPowers:\nYeah, it started out small... First it was singing contests, then swimming competitions... Then it was bowling tournaments, and then it was who could throw the best New Year's parties... Juan was always trying to one-up Matt. But lately, those two were escalating to more and more dangerous things... I thought that no good would come of it all, so I began to worry.\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad Juan's story ended so soon...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nPowers:\nMatt's younger than me, but you can practically see his star potential.\nPearl:\nHis star po-ten-shial...?\nPowers:\nI got his autograph the other day.\nPhoenix:\n...Feels kind of wrong now, doesn't it?\nPowers:\nI don't care what people say! Matt didn't kill Juan! I know he didn't!\nAny other profile\nPowers:\nUmm... I'm honored you're asking me, But I have no idea who this person is. Umm... Sorry...\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPearl:\nUm... I was just wondering... Where's Mystic Maya? She's been gone a long time.\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, she was only going to answer a phone call...)\nPearl:\nMaybe she got lost. I'll take a quick look around for her.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nPearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I... I'm not sure... (It's coming from this transceiver...) (Changed from [Did this transceiver just...?] in the original release)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, hello? Wright here...\n???:\nIs this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney?\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are...!?\n???:\nYou don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMaya:\nHeeelp! Niiiiick!\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\nMaya...?\n???:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Wouldn't you agree that the more important issue is the fate of the girl?\nPhoenix:\n(Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?) Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?\n???:\nCome now. Don't fall apart on me yet.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This... No! This can't be!)\n???:\nNow that I have your attention, Mr. Attorney, I have a modest proposal for you. If you do what I require, then I will return to you your valuable \"item\" unharmed. ...What is this called again in your fancy lawyer terms?\nPhoenix:\n...\"Kidnapping for ransom\"...\n???:\nYes, that's it. This is a kidnapping.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nPhoenix:\n(M-My sight... Everything's fading away... Maya... Maya... Maya's been kidnapped!)\n???:\n...--re you there? Mr. Attorney, are you there? (Changed from [You there? Mr. Wright, are you there?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nH-How much!? How much do you want!?\n???:\nVery good, Mr. Attorney. I'm glad you have such a good grasp of the situation.\nPhoenix:\nHurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya--\n???:\nMoney is not what I seek.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\n???:\nWhat I want is a certain verdict. I would like a complete acquittal.\nPhoenix:\nComplete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!?\n???:\nI am not the person you will be representing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\n???:\nYou are currently at the Gatewater Hotel, are you not? And I know that a murder has just taken place there.\nPhoenix:\nJuan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde...\n???:\nYou are, as expected, quite on top of things, Mr. Attorney. Now then. What I want is very simple. I want you to obtain a complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nM-Matt Engarde? But why?\n???:\nHe did not kill anyone. I can attest to that. However...\nPhoenix:\nH-However!? However what!?\n???:\nHowever, someone is framing him for the murder. A very smart someone who is setting him up to take the fall...\nPhoenix:\n... (If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?)\n???:\nYou are, of course, at liberty to take me at my word or not. (Changed from [You are, of course, at liberty to believe me or not.] in the original release) However, there is one thing you can take as fact. Right now, your very precious \"item\" is with me, in my possession.\nMaya:\nMmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\n???:\nYou have two days. Of course, tonight, he will be in questioning with the police. But the trial is in two days. At that trial, you will win a not guilty verdict. Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nO-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!?\n???:\nYes, exactly. I don't believe I was wrong in choosing you, so don't let me down.\nPhoenix:\nAagh!\n???:\nOh, yes, that's right. Now that I am playing the role of the kidnapper, I can't pass up this chance to say, \"And don't even think about callin' the cops!\" ...Hmm, not great, but you get the idea.\nPhoenix:\nD-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!?\n???:\nAlright, I'll tell you that much. My name is... ...De Killer.\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Wh-Where is Mystic Maya!?\nPhoenix:\n...She's been kidnapped.\nPearl:\nN-No... ... It's all my fault! If only I had gone with Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault, Pearls.\nPearl:\nBut it is! It is! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nPowers:\nMr. Wright... I think we... I think we should tell the police what it's [sic] going on...!\nPhoenix:\n(No! We can't do that! If we do, who knows what will happen to Maya...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What about the detective we saw earlier...?\nPhoenix:\n(...Detective Gumshoe!) Yes, that's it! Wait here, and I'll be right back!\nPowers:\nAlright! I'll take care of Pearl while you're away!\nHallway\nGumshoe:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANSOM!?\nPhoenix:\nShhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nGumshoe:\nWait, the deal is \"complete acquittal\" in exchange for Maya, you mean...? Then this means Matt Engarde is obviously the killer, pal! No doubt about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent...\nGumshoe:\nYou really believe what a KIDNAPPER tells you, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd on top of everything else, there's all this evidence we keep finding.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nThe forensics team's having a field day back there. (Changed from [The guys with the eagle eyes are really lapping it up like they just caught a huge fish.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nGumshoe:\nBut it's strange. There's so much evidence that it feels like something's wrong.\nPhoenix:\nThere's too much evidence? Is that possible? (Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being \"set-up\"...?)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, looks like you won't be leaving here tonight, pal. Just sit tight and cooperate with the investigation. Tomorrow you can start yours.\nPhoenix:\n...A-Alright... (Isn't there another way...?)\nGumshoe:\nWe've also got to be careful about pushing the kidnapper the wrong way.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right...\nDate:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0???\nMaya:\nNnngh... Oww, my head... (Wh-Where... Where am I!? I wonder if I'm still in that hotel... Wh-What happened to me...?) Nick... Pearly! ... (Come on, you guys. This isn't funny anymore...)\n...*ka-click*...\n???:\nI see you have awoken.\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you!?\n???:\nMe? ...I am known as \"De Killer\".\nMaya:\n\"D-De Killer\"!? You mean like an \"ASSASSIN\"!? (I... I'm too young to die!)\n???:\nDon't worry. You are not my target. ...For now anyway.\nMaya:\nA-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nick! Nick! Where are you!? ...Help me...\n???:\nYes, that's right. Only one person can save you now, and that is Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\n...Huh? Wh-What? Nick... Nick's going to save me...?\n???:\nCalm down and be a good girl. Think of this as a business transaction.\nMaya:\nA... A business transaction?\n???:\nI am going to contact him now. I hope you'll cooperate and play your assigned role well.\nMaya:\n...Nick... What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearly... (Changed from [What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearls...] in the original release) ...Sis...\n???:\n... Is this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney? ... You don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with...

If only I had gone with you... (Changed from [Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I went with you that time...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls... She's been like this since last night... We managed to get home somehow, yesterday evening... Thanks to Detective Gumshoe gently holding her by the hand and leading her here... But by the looks of it, I don't think Pearls got any sleep at all last night.)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mystic Maya... She's alright, right!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she's alright. Either way, I'm going to save her. You can trust me on that.\nPearl:\nPlease... Please... Help her...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm only able to stay this calm and collected...

What if he... ...is the real murderer? What would you do then, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWould you fight to get a not guilty for a murderer to save Mystic Maya...?\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Let's talk to Mr. Engarde first, OK? ...We can think all the bad things we want, but it doesn't change a thing.\nPearl:\nY-Yeah, you're right... I'm sorry. I... I can't stop thinking about it...\nMaya's situation\nPhoenix:\nPearls... You're really worried about Maya, aren't you?\nPearl:\nI...

How are you today?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI know this situation might be a little tough for you...\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... We're...\nEngarde:\nOh, sorry dude...\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nI already signed up...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me...?\nEngarde:\nI already have life insurance. I signed up a long time ago cause my job is, you know...\nPhoenix:\n... Oh! No no no... We're not insurance salespeople!\nEngarde:\nReally...? Dude, I really don't need that right now either.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nFire extinguishers. I mean, this building isn't my house, so...\nPhoenix:\n... No no no... We're not here to sell you fire extinguishers either! I'm a lawyer. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nEngarde:\nA lawyer...? ... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my manager, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nThe Nickel Samurai sure is a strange person, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(I think \"strange\" is an understatement.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. You're just in time.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\nEngarde:\nYou're a lawyer dude, right? My manager's looking for a good one right now, so how about it?\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! This is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to make him let me take his case! I have to!)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera.

He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nSorry to intrude, but I would like to ask you a few personal questions.\nEngarde:\nUm, that's OK, but dude, my autobiography's coming out soon, so... If I say stuff without the publisher's approval, then I'm gonna be in real hot water... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my publisher, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde is so lucky! He has so many people he can talk to.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... I don't know if he actually has anyone he can really talk to...)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. Like I thought, the publisher said it'd be \"real bad\" if I said anything, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(Does he have a mind of his own!?)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, I would like to ask you about the murder...\nEngarde:\nOh, are you covering this for a tabloid as a side job, dude? Um, um... Well, if you want my statement on this, you should ask through my staff...\nPhoenix:\nNo no no... I'm not asking on behalf of a tabloid...\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the president of the studio, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nIs he alright, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(If we're talking about Mr. Engarde's brain here, I wouldn't put my money on it.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. The studio president said, \"Even Neo Mt. Fuji itself knows that I'm not the murderer!\"\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? What's \"Neo Mt. Fuji\"...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a mountain in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo; the city the Nickel Samurai protects.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, this is an attorney's badge.\nEngarde:\nDude, I'm sorry, but I don't have the free time to be looking at things like that.\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nEngarde:\nI'm much too busy with Nickel Samurai stuff right now.\nEngarde:\nI don't have the time to take a lawyer's correspondence course...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does he believe I'm a salesman!? Insurance, then extinguishers... Now this!!)\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\n...? What's that?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a ticket for the press conference. You were going to give one after winning the Grand Prix, right?\nEngarde:\nHuh? Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. While you were in costume, no less. ([in costume] hyphenated in the original release)\nEngarde:\nUm, I never heard anything like that, dude. I only heard about the stage show. I always leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't know...? That's odd...)\nRadio Transceiver\nPearl:\n...Mr. Nick? What are you going to do with that?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know yet, but I figured I could at least show it to him...\nEngarde:\nIs that a transceiver? Hey, it looks like a real nice one, too.\nPhoenix:\nI got it as a \"present\" from someone.\nEngarde:\nHmm? Interesting.\nPhoenix:\nI've also been instructed to take your case.\nEngarde:\nIs that what you heard from the transceiver?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nEngarde:\nDude, that's terrible! Don't let some disembodied voice boss you around!\nPhoenix:\n(This coming from a man with a cell phone on his wrist...)\nWill Powers profile\nEngarde:\nI've seen him somewhere before... Is he a member of my fan club?\nPhoenix:\nThat's Mr. Powers. Isn't he supposed to be kind of like a mentor to you?\nEngarde:\nPowers...? Oh yeah! He's the guy on that kid's exercise program. I gave him an autograph just the other day.\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't see Mr. Powers as a mentor at all...)\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nMan, it's too bad he's dead...\nPhoenix:\nYou killed him... That's the most logical conclusion, don't you agree?\nEngarde:\nDude, what are you talking about!? You're making a huge mistake.\nPhoenix:\nIf that's such a mistake, then why did they issue an arrest warrant for you!?\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the guy in charge of this place, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nStars sure know a lot of people, don't they?\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that phone even really gets reception in here...)\nEngarde:\n...Um, I guess you're right about the warrant after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we might be making some progress here!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nEngarde:\nYeah... I'm such a handsome devil.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um, yeah...\nEngarde:\nAnd I'm way good at sports! Karate, tennis, judo, soccer, football, hockey, fencing... Dude, it's no wonder I'm so popular.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um, yeah... (You're also good at sitting in a jail cell, Mr. Popular.)\nAny other evidence\nEngarde:\nDude, I know I like to throw money around, but it's not like I buy anything and everything.\nPhoenix:\n(That's nice, because it's not up for sale anyway!)\nAny other profile\nEngarde:\nUm, dude, this person looks like a member of my fan club. Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the fan club president, OK? ... ...\nPhoenix:\nUm, \"dude\", you know what...? Forget I asked...\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Press Conference Ticket and Radio Transceiver:\nEngarde:\n... ...Well, dude, I think it's about time for me to get going.\nPhoenix:\nPlease, wait! ...I really need to take your case!\nEngarde:\nThere's always other people in need of a lawyer, right? Want me to introduce you to a few?\nPearl:\nPlease! Please let Mr. Nick represent you!\nEngarde:\nMan, oh man. Lawyers these days. Now you dudes use kids to pull in clients, too?\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't take me as your lawyer, then De Killer is going to...!\nEngarde:\n... Wait... What did you just say?\nPhoenix:\n\"De Killer\"...\nEngarde:\nD-De Killer!?\nPhoenix:\n(...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...)\nEngarde:\n... Alright, dude. I accept your terms.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEngarde:\nI'll let you represent me in court.\nPearl:\nW-We did it! We did it, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...)\nEngarde:\nGo ahead, ask me anything. I'll help out as much as I can...\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nEngarde:\nMan, I thank my lucky stars that people know my name.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're quite the hero, and you're in the national spotlight.\nPearl:\nI didn't know who he is... Does that mean I'm not a good citizen...?\nEngarde:\nAh, it's really great to be the Nickel Samurai. Dude, lately, I just keep on getting more and more popular.\nPhoenix:\n(True enough... \"The Nickel Samurai\" is very popular among high schoolers and secretaries right now. I guess Mr. Engarde has a way of catching the eyes of women...)\nEngarde:\nDo you know my motto? \"Refreshing like a spring breeze.\" That's what I am.\nPearl:\nA spring breeze...\nEngarde:\nThat's why this kind of scandal is disastrous, dude. I mean, even if I get out of here tomorrow, it's still gonna look bad.\nPhoenix:\n(But everyone loves a good scandal...) (Changed from [Everyone loves a good scandal...] in the original release)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me about your activities last night?\nEngarde:\nAfter I got the award, I took a break and went back to my room. I had that post-ceremony stage show to do. So I was in my Nickel Samurai costume.\nPhoenix:\nAnd you were alone the entire time?\nEngarde:\nMy manager was running around being busy, so yeah.\nPhoenix:\nBecause of the press conference you were supposed to have after the show?\nEngarde:\nI told you, dude. I have no idea about any press conference, alright?\nPhoenix:\n(That's strange... I thought the Nickel Samurai was going to confess something...)\nEngarde:\nAnyway, when I was leaving my room, that's when I noticed it was kinda noisy...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida was already dead at that time...?\nEngarde:\nYeah, that's what I gathered anyway from my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm beginning to gather that this guy can't do a thing on his own...) (Changed from [With the way he's always talking about his manager, it's as if she runs his life.] in the original release)\nEngarde:\nAnd that's when the detective in the green coat showed up. He searched me... And then, out of the blue, the dude arrested me.\nThe victim (appears after \"Matt Engarde\")\nPhoenix:\nAbout you and the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida, what sort of...\nEngarde:\nThat's got nothing to do with anything, dude. Man, with that face of his, you can't even tell he's the same age as me. And he wanted to try making a \"Jammin' Ninja\" movie, even though we all know it'd fail.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai still won in the end, right?\nEngarde:\nYeah. I took the Grand Prix by storm. So why would I, the winner, have any reason to kill the guy anyway? Dude, you'd think it'd be the other way around, you know?\nThe charge of murder (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know why you were arrested?\nEngarde:\nI guess maybe my full body search went badly.\nPhoenix:\nDid they find something on you?\nEngarde:\nThey found a button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nPhoenix:\nA button...?\nEngarde:\nI don't get it either. It was caught in the pleats of my samurai pants, or \"hakama\".\nPearl:\nAaah!\nEngarde:\nDude, I really think someone planted it there though. I'm serious.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that's what really happened...?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nPearl:\nLet's ask one last thing. Let's test Mr. Engarde to see if he really is innocent or not...\nPhoenix:\nW-We can do that...?\nPearl:\nYes. If you use this...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's Magatama!)\nPearl:\nHe won't be able to hide any secrets from you, Mr. Nick. I'm sure of it.\nPhoenix:\n(I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly.\nEngarde:\nWhat is it, dude?\nPhoenix:\nDid you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nPlease put the phone away and answer this question yourself.\nEngarde:\nAlright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWell, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nNothing. Not a chain or lock in sight.\nPearl:\nWhich means... I think it is alright to trust him.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.)\nEngarde:\nUm... The trial's tomorrow, right? I'm counting on you, dude.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 21, 11:34 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWell, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important...\nPearl:\nSo! So now what should we do!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer.\nPearl:\nOK! Then let's start looking!\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Actually, the crime happened at the recently completed hotel in the center of town, the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. ...Just how far are they going to expand their empire...?\nCharley the plant\nPearl:\nOh! I'll water it!\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK... I already did that...\nPearl:\n...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...)\nPoster\nPearl:\nThis is the Nickel Samurai... right?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's right.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!?\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.\nPearl:\nOh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either...\nPhoenix:\nI-It's OK, Pearls. Really.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh! I cleaned it up some more for you last night! ...Because I couldn't sleep...\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSince there were no Psyche-Locks, then that means we can trust Mr. Engarde to be innocent.\nPearl:\nI really feel much better knowing that. Ever since last night, I was so worried that I kept wondering... \"What if he is the real killer...? What then...?\"\nAny ideas\nPhoenix:\nHey, I have something I want to ask you, Pearls.\nPearl:\nOK, what is it?\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you so interested in how Maya and I get along? I mean, she and I don't have anything special go--\nPearl:\nHuh!? Wh-What do you mean!? B-But I thought... I thought you and Mystic Maya were... I-I've been mistaken all this time!? No way...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aaaah! She really wasn't kidding! Pearls actually believes Maya and I are... ...Maybe I should've just left it alone...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Stop it! Don't hide your true feelings from me!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! She slapped me!!)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPearl:\nThat's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nI guess?\nPearl:\nI feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...)\nMaya Fey profile\nPearl:\nOh, Mystic Maya... I wonder if you're alright...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure she's OK. We have to be patient for just one more day. I'm sure we can save her. Trust me.\nPearl:\nIf there's anything I can do, please tell me, OK!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPearl:\nTo tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me.\nPhoenix:\nI think your hair now suits you perfectly.\nPearl:\nR-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget*\nPhoenix:\n*fidget, fidget*\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPearl:\nI'm sure that Mr. Detective would be our ally if we asked!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I think so too. (Looking back, we've known each other for a while now... He's always been trustworthy... A bit \"off\", but still trustworthy. What a paradox.)\nWill Powers profile\nPearl:\nHe's a really kind and nice old man, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is really perceptive when it comes to people... But what does she mean by \"old man\"...?) Hey, Pearls? What about me...?\nPearl:\nWhat about you, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, I don't think I want to hear this...)\nAnything else\nPearl:\nUm, there are still so many things in this world that I don't understand yet. ...Honestly, I still don't have enough training.\nPhoenix:\nAh, no, it's OK. I don't have any ideas myself...\nPearl:\nI'm sorry. I'm really sorry!\nMarch 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEngarde:\nAh, the lawyer dude. So what did you find out?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... I'm still in the middle of investigating...\nEngarde:\nI see. ...But I've already told you everything I know, dude.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\nDude, like I told you, I don't know anything about that press conference. I leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(...This is harder than pulling bass from a river...)\nRadio Transceiver\nEngarde:\nSo, why are you carrying around that transceiver...?\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about it.\nEngarde:\nAnd why do you do everything it tells you to do? You know, the messages it sends you, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, he probably doesn't have anything to do with Maya's kidnapping.) ...That's a secret.\nEngarde:\nOK, whatever, dude.\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nLook, dude, I didn't kill him. I mean, the Nickel Samurai kicked the Jammin' Ninja's butt, right? So it's not like I felt threatened by the likes of him.\nPearl:\nBeing rivals sounds like a sad way to relate to another person...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nOldbag:\nHey! What do you think you're doing!? You can't come in without...\nPearl:\nGood morning.\nOldbag:\nHold on, it's YOU! What is going on around here!?\nPhoenix:\nU-Uh... Um...\nOldbag:\nI heard poor Juan was killed. Is that true!? It's a bad rerun is what this is. Another \"Steel Samurai\" doing the most evil of deeds.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you know... That's not entirely...\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know that I was a huge fan of Juan's! Why, oh why, do all the stars I'm interested in drop one by one like flies!? It's always been that way! Ever since I was a little girl in elementary school! The class hamster was fine until it was my turn to clean its cage, and then it died! The other kids started calling me the \"Queen Reaper\". I swear that's what they dubbed me! \"Whoever you name in your evil spell dies within three minutes,\" they would taunt.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened...\nOldbag:\nHmph! Don't push me, boy!\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? I... Um... I couldn't hear everything she said... because she was talking too fast...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...?\nOldbag:\nDon't boss me around, you spiky-haired, smarty-pants!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but...\nPearl:\n...Even Mr. Engarde himself didn't seem to know, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(How does the person who's supposed to give a conference not know about it...?)\nTalk\nThe victim\nOldbag:\nMy dear Hammer died a year ago in that dreadful murder. And only recently did I finally find a star that makes this heart go *badump* again.\nPhoenix:\n...I don't know what to say...\nOldbag:\nI ask you, why does every star I cheer for always ends [sic] up kicking the bucket?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nI'd watch your words! No one's going to get away with saying anything bad about my Juan!\nPhoenix:\nBut I haven't said anything...\nOldbag:\nWell, I don't believe a word that woman says anyway!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What woman?\nOldbag:\nThat irritating, backwater girl with the afro and the horrible country accent. I mean, what is that manner of speaking supposed to be? And why does she never stop? Honestly, women these days. They don't know the meaning of the word \"modesty\". When I was a young maiden, I was so beautiful even the flowers of the field blushed. But despite this, I pressed flowers, or read the stars, or wrote beautiful love poems or\nPhoenix:\n...Pearls? Are you thirsty?\nPearl:\nUm, a little.\nPhoenix:\nOK. I'll go get you some juice or something.\nPearl:\nTh-Thank you very much.\nOldbag:\nHey! Are you paying attention!? Young'uns today!\nPhoenix:\n(So I'm guessing Ms. Oldbag heard everything from Lotta...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nI want to ask you about what happened around the time of the murder...\nOldbag:\nAh, I don't know anything about that. I was here getting ready.\nPhoenix:\nGetting ready? For what...?\nOldbag:\nThe show, of course! ...Well, and the press conference afterwards.\nPhoenix:\n(Cue mysterious music for the magical press conference.)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I don't know anything about the murder.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see...\nOldbag:\n... But.\nPhoenix:\n?\nOldbag:\nBut if you're talking about what I saw, that's different. I saw it very clearly!\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nOldbag:\nI saw the most important moment of the night!\nWhat you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nTh-The most important moment!? You don't mean...!?\nOldbag:\nOh, so now you treat me with respect, you disrespectful child. When you speak to your elders, you should always be polite. Really, kids today.\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see!?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nOldbag:\nThe murder last night was gruesome, wasn't it? But then, what murder isn't?\nPhoenix:\n(Please don't stray onto another tangent... Please...)\nOldbag:\nIf you want to hear more, then show your respect and bring this lady a present!\nWhat you witnessed (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see on the night of the murder!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPearl:\nP-Please! Mystic Maya's life is...\nOldbag:\nAh, but you haven't given me my present yet. ...Hmm... Let's see... I'll only tell it to you if you can bring me Juan's autograph!\nPhoenix:\n(What an unreasonable request... You might as well have asked for the moon!)\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nI don't have anything to say to delinquents like you!\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr... She's clamming up like the old clam she is...)\nPearl:\nPlease! Anything would be helpful!\nOldbag:\nWell then, how about I tell you my measurements?\nPhoenix:\n...Um... No, that's okay... Really.\nPearl:\nShe really doesn't like you, does she Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI know, I know...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like the investigation is still in full swing. The hotel staff and the police are running around like a bunch of headless chickens.\nPearl:\nI wonder if we can do any investigating of our own in this kind of atmosphere...\nPhoenix:\n...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess.\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of, only to disappear... ...If only we had all gone together...\nChandelier\nPearl:\nThat is such a beautiful sight.\nPhoenix:\nThe chandelier?\nPearl:\nYes. But I can't believe it... I can't believe that such a terrible murder happened under such beautiful lights... It's shocking.\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was held on that stage just last night. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nWe ate at this table last night, didn't we?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nPearl:\nI was really happy then.\nPhoenix:\n(I wish I could make you smile again... Even for a second...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHallway\nLotta:\nHey! Yer here! Been waitin' for ya, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nLotta...\nLotta:\nHey! Mr. Cop fella! The thief's showed his face!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!?\nLotta:\nArrest him! Put him on trial! Find him guilty! Give him the death penalty!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong, Lotta!? Are you feeling alright?\nLotta:\nLooked here and there and up and down the mountain, but it ain't here! So why don'tcha just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep! (Changed from [So why don't ya just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep!] in the original release)\nPearl:\nUm, what are you looking for...?\nLotta:\nMy CAMERA! C-A-M-E-R-A! It's my life blood! I'm gonna die without my $700 camera!!\nPhoenix:\nY-Your camera...?\nLotta:\nLook, don't lots of people say the criminal always goes back to the scene of the crime!? And lookie lookie, here ya are!\nPhoenix:\nYep. Here I am... Faced with a Lotta trouble.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...?\nLotta:\nI didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nLotta:\nYeah, that's what I thought too, so I was a nice enough gal to lend a helpin' hand! ...Secretly, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(I have a feeling one of these days, I'm going to end up defending her in court...)\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\".\nLotta:\nSo that's the scene of the murder, I reckon. I thought somethin' had gone on that night, but I didn't never think it was murder.\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\".\nPearl:\nSo Mr. Engarde was here during his break, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what he claims. (Hmm... The crime scene... If he had wanted to get to Mr. Corrida's room... He would have had to pass through this hallway.)\nTalk\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!\nPearl:\nHuh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?\nLotta:\nI had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon. I made this itty-bitty scratch on it and the manager got all huffed up in the face... He gave me his talkin' to and was real mean about it too. He done made me cry at that!\nPearl:\nWhen did you lose your camera?\nLotta:\nLast night, after the murder happened. Musta been when I was busy runnin' around lookin' into things! That's when I lost sight of my dear, darlin' expensive sweetie!\nPhoenix:\nLotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours?\nLotta:\nI don't rightly know. I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?)\nLotta's Camera added to the Court Record.\nCamera (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera!

Yeah, actually I was here until around the time Mr. Engarde was arrested.\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you doing here...?\nLotta:\nYou sure you went to school, City Boy? Wherever Lotta Hart goes, there's a story to be found! A big scoop to be had!\nPhoenix:\nA big scoop...?\nLotta:\nI told ya before. I'm gonna be the best tabloid photographer the world's ever seen! Reckon course that means I'm always lookin' for the perfect shot!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what \"scoop\" she was after this time...?)\nLotta:\nAlthough, I was also on the look out for the other stars that were here, so... maybe I wasn't here the entire time...\nBig scoop (appears after \"Camera\" and \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nLotta... Are you sure you weren't here the entire time? So you could take a picture for your big scoop?\nLotta:\nWell... Maybe I was. But that's what real journalists do! I got some juicy inside info, so I thought to myself, why not get a picture for proof?\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of story was it that you would hang around here...?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nOops, sorry, Mr. Lawyer. Can't be tellin' you that. Trade secret, ya know?\nPhoenix:\n(Not again... Why does everyone have something to hide...?)\nPearl:\nWe've been stopped, haven't we?\nLotta:\nHa ha, yeah! Take that, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here is happy... Ms. Lotta and your \"I rule!\" smile...)\nBig scoop (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou were on the hunt for your big scoop last night?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nIt's just a bunch of tabloid photos. They ain't got nothing to do with the murder.\nPearl:\nIt looks like we have no choice but to remove the Psyche-Locks.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I guess so.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nLotta:\nHey, what's that? ...A press conference ticket? How come I ain't got myself one of them!?\nPhoenix:\nP-Please don't direct your anger at me...\nLotta:\nWhy in tarnations wasn't I invited to that!? How come someone on the bottom of the popularity chart like you got the info, but not me!? Info like that is worth nothin' to ya, am I right or what!?\nPhoenix:\n(...Is that the kind of person she thinks I am...?)\nPearl:\nAre you going to stand there and take that, Mr. Nick!?\nLotta's Camera\nLotta:\nNngh... And I just bought that camera... Who did it!? The thievin' rascal!\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't look straight at me while you're saying that...\nLotta:\nWhen I find the bugger who went and done this, they're gonna pay with a bullet!\nPhoenix:\n(And if you do that, don't expect me to defend you...)\nMaya Fey profile\nLotta:\nNow that I think about it, she isn't with y'all today, is she...?\nPearl:\nUm...\nLotta:\nShe's a spunky one! You shouldn't have been lettin' her outta yer sight. Who knows what she's up to now...\nPhoenix:\n(Like you're one to talk...)\nPearl:\n...\nPearl Fey profile\nLotta:\nAh, just wanna say sorry to ya.\nPearl:\nFor...?\nLotta:\nWell, I really, absolutely thought you were the murderer.\nPearl:\n...Huh?\nLotta:\nYou know... Last time, that thing with Maya Fey...\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!? But why!?\nLotta:\nI mean, you were all worked up, ya know?\nPearl:\n*sniffle* ...Meanie...\nPhoenix:\nLotta, that was very insensitive of you!\nLotta Hart profile\nLotta:\nThis kind of hairstyle is pretty hard to get, ya know. Hard to care for too. Just the other day, I ran my hand through my hair to fix it up, and suddenly, out pops this dollar coin! That's gotta be like hittin' the jackpot!\nPearl:\nWow, that's really lucky!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* What a deep conversation that was...)\nJuan Corrida or Matt Engarde profile\nLotta:\nI don't really care for 'em \"heroes\" or whatnot.\nPearl:\nOh, I see...\nLotta:\nAnd shows they got for kids, those adventures are just plain ol' borin'! Now, adults. We get more caught up in messy, sticky, real situations! ...Even me...\nPearl:\nO-Oh...\nLotta:\nSounds like the tyke's gettin' what I'm goin' with this!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a sec here! Don't go around getting her mixed up in things like that!\nSecurity Lady profile\nLotta:\nThis old granny? Ah, she kept on glarin' at me with those eyes of hers. As if it's my fault. Kept babblin' how she won't forgive people who write \"trash\" about her Juan... ...Ah, yeah, we sorta got into a little fight, ya know...\nPhoenix:\n(A \"little\" fight? Knowing those two, it was probably more of a blabbering contest.)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know anything...\nLotta:\n...*sigh*... I've told ya how many times now? I'm a journalist. I've got so much info runnin' laps in my head I forget things here and there!\nPearl:\nPlease don't get so worked up over this...\nLotta:\nHah! I don't care if ya beg me! \"Be extra tough on kids!\" That's this gal's motto on learnin' youngsters.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nUm... Where are we?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room.\n???:\nMay I help you with something?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... We're...\n???:\nYou're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail.\nPhoenix:\nUm... How did you know I'm his lawyer...?\n???:\nYou were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer.\nPearl:\nWow...\n???:\nIt's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either.\nPearl:\nIt's really not the time to be showing off, Mr. Nick.\nAndrews:\nI am Adrian Andrews. I hate to waste time, so let's get down to business.\nPhoenix:\nA-Alright... (She may be of small stature, but appearances can be deceiving...)\nExamine\nRed suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's probably Mr. Engarde's suitcase. For someone who was only going to be here for the award show, this is a lot of stuff. Looks like he has about three days' worth of clothes in here.\nPearl:\nStars really are different from us, aren't they...?\nBedroom\nPhoenix:\nThat's the bedroom over there.\nPearl:\nThat's a bed...? Wow, they have really big beds here!\nSofa\nPhoenix:\nThere's some samurai-looking clothes on the sofa here.\nPearl:\nUm, I think that jacket looking thing is called a \"happi\".\nPhoenix:\n(Whatever it is, I'm sure something like that would make a great souvenir. Maya would be absolutely thrilled...)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nLooks like dishes left over from dinner... A dinner for two, at that.\nPearl:\nI'm sure they're Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews' plates.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they had T-bone steaks... What's with Global Studios and T-bone steaks...?\nPlate on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a giant bone sitting on the plate.\nPearl:\nI... I don't really like meat...\nPhoenix:\n(...? There's something... weird about this plate... I just wish I could put my finger on what it is...)\nTalk\nNight of the murder\nAndrews:\nI assume the first thing you need to know is what everyone was doing that night, correct?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, that is correct.\nAndrews:\nThen I will tell you. Before the award ceremony, I had dinner with Mr. Engarde. In this very room, I might add.\nPhoenix:\n\"Dinner\"? What did you eat?\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate to waste time with trifling details. If you took a look at the table yourself, you wouldn't need to ask me.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet she's a lot of fun at parties...)\nAndrews:\nWhen the award show was starting, I headed for Viola Hall.\nPhoenix:\nAnd after the show ended, you came back to this room...?\nAndrews:\nNo, I had some small errands to run. I helped with the preparations in the lobby.\nPhoenix:\nOh... (Preparations for the post-ceremony show, I guess...)\nAndrews:\nWhen it was time for the post-ceremony show, I came back to call for Mr. Engarde. After that, I went to visit Mr. Corrida...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you found his body, isn't it?\nAndrews:\n...\nPearl:\nYou really held strong through everything...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... She does seem to be mentally tough as nails...)\nRelation to Engarde\nPhoenix:\nUm, so... About you and...\nAndrews:\nStop right there. You aren't seriously about to ask how Mr. Engarde and I are related, are you? (Changed from [Don't expect me to believe you have been talking to me without knowing how we relate.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nAndrews:\nI have no idea how he could chose [sic] you as his lawyer. (Changed from [I have no idea why Mr. Engarde chose you as his lawyer.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Why did she have to go and say something like that...?)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Calm down and hang in there. I'll give you a shoulder rub to relieve your stress later, alright?\nAndrews:\nI already gave you my name earlier, but I'll add that I'm Mr. Engarde's manager.\nPhoenix:\nHis manager... Speaking of managers, did the victim, Mr. Corrida have one?\nAndrews:\nNo, he did not.\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't?\nAndrews:\nGlobal Studios has a very different policy from Worldwide Studios in that Worldwide Studios does not assign individual managers to their stars.\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nAndrews:\nThis industry is very ruthless and unforgiving. Actually, you look quite ruthless and unforgiving yourself to your poor partner. Dragging a little girl like her to places like this. Honestly.\nPearl:\nYou're wrong! I... I'm doing this to help Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Calm down and hang in there. I'll buy you a juice later, alright?\nPearl:\nNngh...\nMotive for murder (appears after presenting Juan Corrida profile)\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any ideas?\nAndrews:\nAs to...?\nPhoenix:\nAs to why Mr. Corrida was murdered?\nAndrews:\nWhy would you ask me about such a thing...?\nPhoenix:\nI'm just doing my job. So, do you have any ideas?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nSorry, but there's nothing more I have to add to this conversation.\nPearl:\nIs it a Psyche-Lock, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYes... There's getting to be more and more of these lately.\nMotive for murder (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou know something, don't you? About why Mr. Corrida was murdered...\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nAndrews:\nWhy are you asking me? Don't tell me you can see inside my heart.\nPhoenix:\n(No, but I can see the locks you have on your psyche.)\nPearl:\nIf you don't remove her locks...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it's worthless to even ask...)\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one taking care of the arrangements for this press conference, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, that's right.\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Engarde said he \"didn't know\" about it.\nAndrews:\n... Is that what he said...?\nPearl:\nHuh...?\nAndrews:\nActually, I didn't know all the details either. It was a request from the publicity department. All I did was help out and do what I was asked.\nPearl:\nOh... I see.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder about that... I wouldn't take her to be the type of person to do something without knowing the details.)\nWill Powers profile\nAndrews:\nThat's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be.\nPhoenix:\n(Urk... What a horrible thing to say...)\nAndrews:\n...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? For a second, her face twisted in pain...)\nPearl:\nI wonder if something happened to Ms. Andrews...\nJuan Corrida profile\nPhoenix:\nDid you know the victim, Mr. Corrida?\nAndrews:\nYes, I knew him. The world is such a small place, after all.\nPearl:\nDid you know about his rivalry with the Nickel Samurai?\nAndrews:\nHonestly, they were like children when it came to that. Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most trivial things. (Changed from [Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most uninteresting things.] in the original release) ... If either one of them wasn't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die. (Changed from [If either one of them weren't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n! (...I've got a hunch that this woman knows more than she's letting on... She must know why Juan Corrida was killed!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nAndrews:\nI asked to become Mr. Engarde's manager. He's a pleasure to manage with his nice disposition.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Mr. Engarde does seem like a rather weak-willed man; always doing as he's told...)\nPearl:\nHe's always saying, \"my manager,\" right Mr. Nick?\nAndrews:\n...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAndrews:\nI hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... (Take away that layer of sarcasm and she really does seem to hate herself...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, I'd like to ask you about this...\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Where are we...?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Juan Corrida's room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Corrida...?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim... Which makes this the crime scene, too.\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's you! So!? What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!?\nPhoenix:\nNot yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there?\nPhoenix:\n(I just want Maya to be alright...)\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nWe don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal.\nPhoenix:\nCan you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...?\nGumshoe:\nJust this once... \"Special circumstances\" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here.\nPhoenix:\nThank you.\nGumshoe:\nOh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy.\nPearl:\nWow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you!\nGumshoe:\nHa ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I got a map!\nPhoenix:\nThat's great, Pearls!\nPearl:\n... Um... But Mr. Nick, I can't read what it says...\nHotel Guidemap added to the Court Record.\nExamine\nRefrigerator\nPhoenix:\nThere are all sorts of things in this refrigerator...\nPearl:\nThe carrot juice bottle and the tomato juice bottle are both empty...\nPhoenix:\nEmpty...? (It's too much of a hassle to throw them away, I guess.) They're all vegetable juices. I guess he must've been a real health nut.\nPearl:\n...Oh! There's a beet, some ketchup, and a bottle of strawberry jam too!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe red was his favorite color...?\nStuffed bears\nPearl:\nWow, there are a lot of bears!\nPhoenix:\n(Alarm clock ones, collector's editions, stuffed teddies, plastic models... It's pretty overwhelming... Is there a kind of bear he doesn't have...?)\nPearl:\nThere's even a few in the trash can...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I get the feeling maybe the guy didn't really like bears.\nPearl:\nPoor teddies...\nIt's hard to \"bear\" with all these problems... Growl! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n... (I don't think I want to \"bear\" with the trauma the last case caused me...)\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mr. Nick?\nDesk\nPearl:\nHmph! It's so messy here!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls really likes things neat and tidy, I take it...)\nPearl:\nThere are a lot of electronic things in here that I've never seen before. Hey, Mr. Nick! Tell me what they are, pretty please?\nPhoenix:\nOK. That over there is a \"watch\". You wear it on your wrist.\nPearl:\n... I know what a watch is...\nPhoenix:\n(Oops. For a second there, I forgot I was talking with Pearls, not Maya...)\nBlue suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's a suitcase. There are so many things in it that I bet it barely closes. There's his clothes, a dryer, an electric shaver, a calculator...\nPearl:\nDo all stars pack too much stuff like Mr. Corrida?\nTable on right\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Mr. Corrida had dinner last night.\nPearl:\nThis bottle... It's tomato juice.\nPhoenix:\n(We had a lot of food at the award show last night... But I wonder if the stars had gone onstage after only eating a meager meal like this...)\nBedroom\nPearl:\nSo that's a bed, right?\nPhoenix:\nYup. It's big, but it's a bed.\nPearl:\nAaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft!\nPhoenix:\n(Big beds must be a rarity for her...)\nScattered items near guitar case\nPhoenix:\nBottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.\nPearl:\nWhat's this glass fragment from...?\nPhoenix:\nA flower vase maybe? There are flowers on the floor, but I don't know what they are.\nPearl:\nYou don't know much about flowers, do you Mr. Nick?\nGuitar case\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.\nPearl:\nThat's strange. The guitar is not here...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he forgot to bring it to the show?\nPearl:\nBut Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item...\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid...\nPearl:\nYeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nGuitar Case added to the Court Record.\nGuitar case (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.\nPearl:\nThat's strange. The guitar is not here...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he forgot to bring it to the show?\nPearl:\nBut Mystic Maya...

There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nWine glass\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nPearl:\nBut doesn't it seem weird?\nPhoenix:\n...What seems weird?\nPearl:\nI mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor.\nPhoenix:\n... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)\nPearl:\nWhy is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?\nWine Glass added to the Court Record.\nWine glass (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nPearl:\nBut doesn't it seem weird?\nPhoenix:\n...What seems weird?\nPearl:\nI mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor.\nPhoenix:\n... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)\nPearl:\nWhy is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?\nTalk\nCause of death\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what was the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nWell, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal. (Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIt should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Here's a picture.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a knife in his chest.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal, that's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was stabbed to death...)\nGumshoe:\nThey're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now.\nPhoenix:\nThere were fingerprints on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nYup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nCause of death (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what was the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nWell, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal.

And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nReason for arrest\nPhoenix:\nWhy was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nBecause we had evidence on him.\nPearl:\nEvidence...?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the victim, Juan Corrida, really put up a big fight.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, one look at the crime scene and you can tell. There's signs of a struggle everywhere.\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah. During the fight, his button came off...\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde said something about a button... Something like, one of the Jammin' Ninja's buttons got caught in his \"hakama\"...)\nGumshoe:\nBut that's not all...\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nThere was a witness, pal.\nPhoenix:\nA witness!? Wh-Who is it!?\nGumshoe:\nThat lady... Ms. Oldbag.\nPhoenix:\n(Please... Anyone but her!)\nGumshoe:\nThe prosecution has plenty of evidence to make a solid case... Not to mention there's something around where the vic was that's a little off. (Changed from [Not to mention there's something at the crime scene that was a little off.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nSomething that's a little off...? As in...? (Changed from [Something that was a little off...? As in...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nAs in, that's for you to figure out, pal!\nPearl:\nAlright, let's try to figure it out, Mr. Nick!\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nGumshoe:\nThat's your \"present\" from the kidnapper, huh? While you're talking, it sends and receives radio waves... If we could trace that...\nPearl:\nYeah! We could use it to find out where the bad guy is!\nPhoenix:\n(It uses radio waves, huh?)\nGumshoe:\nI got it! I'll go find a radio scanner, and let you borrow it, pal!\nGuitar Case\nPhoenix:\nWhat can you tell me about this guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nOh, that. This is just what I heard, pal, but that's the Jammin' Ninja's signature item.\nPhoenix:\nThe guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nNo, not that! What do you take me as? I mean the guitar inside, of course!\nPearl:\nBut... The guitar is missing.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, we looked for it too. It's not normal for a person to forget to bring their most famous item to an award show.\nPhoenix:\n(It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...)\nWine Glass\nPhoenix:\nSo about this wine glass...\nGumshoe:\nAh, so you noticed it, pal. The whole crime scene was a mess, but this glass was the only thing that was untouched.\nPhoenix:\nYou noticed that too, Detective Gumshoe...?\nGumshoe:\nNo, actually Ms. von Karma noticed it first.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Pearls noticed it before me too... Hey, wait a minute. So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's here at the hotel...? (Changed from [So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's coming here...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah, she's around. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal. (Changed from [Yeah, she's coming. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal.] in the original release) Especially if she catches you in here. (Changed from [I think it'd be best if you didn't bump into her here.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou can bet the instant I see her, I'll be running the 1,000 meter dash.\nCrime Photo\nGumshoe:\nYou look at this photo and you can't help it. It makes you want to say, \"I can't believe this is the scene of a murder.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Stabbed with a knife after a struggle... A clue is sleeping in this photo somewhere... I know it.)\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm sorry.\nPhoenix:\n...For what?\nGumshoe:\nI really want to help you look for her, pal.\nPearl:\nMr. Detective...\nGumshoe:\nIf anything happens, let me know, OK? I want to help in any way I can!\nPearl Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, little missy. Listen good, OK?\nPearl:\nOK. What is it?\nGumshoe:\nDon't ever pick up a whip, OK? Don't even think about it.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nGumshoe:\nIf you ever find yourself thinking you want one, try to make due with a good slap to the face. Got that? Slap the person in the face. Promise me, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(Personal experience tells me Gumshoe should be careful what he wishes for...)\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nIf I had a choice, she would be number three on my list of people I don't want to see.\nPhoenix:\n...Because I'm in the number one spot?\nGumshoe:\nDon't get all high and mighty on me here. You've taken a tumble into second place, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really? Then who's in first...?\nGumshoe:\nMs. von Karma's miles and miles ahead of you in this race.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh...\nGumshoe:\nShe's really scary... Right now... M-Ms. von Karma... You really don't...\nPhoenix:\n(He's so scared of her that he's whispering now...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, why don't we let bygones be bygones, pal? Look, this guy is guilty. A buck says so.\nPhoenix:\nOne dollar...? Sure you're not talking about Pearls' allowance money?\nGumshoe:\nI... I can't bet any more than that... My salary... It's...\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't matter what we think... I still have to defend Mr. Engarde in court or else!)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick...\nSecurity Lady profile\nGumshoe:\nI thought she was an alien from outer space.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, probably because she's wearing that strange helmet.\nGumshoe:\nNah, even with her helmet off, I thought she was an alien, pal.\nPhoenix:\n... I think that's probably best kept to yourself, if you know what I mean...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nGumshoe:\nShe's Mr. Engarde's manager, right? No matter what I do, I really stink at talking with people like her. As soon as I open my mouth, I get all flustered. See, she's one of those women with a brain. She's someone who \"gets things done\".\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she does give that sort of impression, like she's got it all together.\nGumshoe:\nCompared to her, you can easily tell I'm a \"can't do anything right\" kind of guy. That's why I get all nervous and start messing up.\nPhoenix:\n(I feel sort of bad for him...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you know about this?\nGumshoe:\nUm... There's nothing special I can tell you about this, pal. Look pal, we don't have a lot of time. Why don't you show me something more important? If Ms. von Karma saw me here like this... I'd have to switch sides real fast...\nAfter clearing all Talk options, examining guitar case, and presenting Wine Glass:\n...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*...\nPearl:\nWh-What's that beeping noise, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I've heard this sound somewhere before...)\nGumshoe:\nIt's Ms. von Karma...\nPearl:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nFor some reason, whenever I hear that sound, she pops out of nowhere and whips me! (Changed from [Whenever I hear that sound, for some reason, she pops out of nowhere and whips me!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, that's exactly what happen [sic] the last time...) (Changed from [Come to think of it, that did happen the last time...] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nS-Sorry! I've gotta make myself scarce! Later, pal! Eowww!\nvon Karma:\nAt last, you reveal your true nature... Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(*gulp* Would it be too much to ask for you to be nice to me for a change...?)\nvon Karma:\nSo you're the type to steal information from pitifully hopeless detectives! That's very dishonorable of you!\nPhoenix:\n(Owww!)\nvon Karma:\nHey! Don't you dare run away, Scruffy McTrenchcoat!\nGumshoe:\nAh!\nvon Karma:\nI didn't think the detectives of this country could be this pitiful...\nGumshoe:\nUwaah!\nvon Karma:\nDetective! Come over here for a second!\nGumshoe:\nYeooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!\nvon Karma:\n...Hmph. I feel better knowing at least you were man enough to face your punishment.\nPhoenix:\n(He was so scared, he just froze up on the spot...)\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright! You... You have soiled my perfect prosecution record. I'll never forget that. This time... Victory is mine!\nPhoenix:\n... Victory is yours? Is that all this means to you...?\nvon Karma:\nWh-What...!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nvon Karma:\n... H-Hmph! Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin. (Changed from [Come, Scruff-face!

To be honest, I've never seen writing that looks like this.\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's a special way of writing called \"cursive\". Look here. See how it says, \"To my dearest Wendy\" in more normal letters here?\nPearl:\nTh-This sloppy, unreadable writing!

It's the sequel to \"The Steel Samurai\".\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nPowers:\nThis time, there are three Samurai Brothers: Aluminum Samurai, Tin Samurai... And of course, the Nickel Samurai. It's a love \"Y\" in Neo Olde Tokyo!\nPhoenix:\nI see... ... W-Wait... A love what...?\nPowers:\nA love \"Y\". This girl, Sayo, works at a tea shop and all three guys fall for her at the same time.\nPhoenix:\nOh... I guess the \"Y\" shape is like the 3 brothers colliding over this one girl?\nPowers:\nAnyway, Sayo is actually the daughter of the evil Strawberry Clan's leader!\nPhoenix:\nSounds like an unusual situation.

The Jammin' Ninja is, like the Samurai shows, aimed towards kids. It's the story of a ninja who can't climb a wall, but became a big pop star.\nPhoenix:\n...Uh, what?\nPowers:\nHe was a really lousy ninja. Absolutely couldn't do any ninja things right at all. But boy could he sing! With his trusty bright red guitar in hand, he took the ancient world by storm.\nPhoenix:\nA... A ninja...

Our brave hero catches a not so Jammin' cold the night before Battle 3!\nPhoenix:\nAww, that's too bad for him...\nPowers:\nY-Yeah... But this kind of pop music-based love story is something high school girls really like.\nPearl:\nUm...\nPowers:\nYes, Pearl?\nPearl:\nWh-What happens next!? I want to know!\nPearl:\nJammin'... The Jammin' Ninja! Will he be able to sing!? What about Princess Misola!?\nPowers:\nEvery Sunday at 8 AM.\nPearl:\nUmm... Which show should I watch...?

That was Juan's...\nPhoenix:\nI'm guessing you've seen this case before?\nPowers:\nIt's pretty famous by now. It stands out because it holds THE bright red guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(The bright red guitar...

I was on my way to the toilet, minding my own business.\nPhoenix:\nAnd...? Did you tell that to the police?\nOldbag:\nWell, of course! I thought I could get a gift certificate or two out of it, maybe more.\nPearl:\nGift certificate...?\nOldbag:\nI've been recruited again for that part at the trial. You know, the trial tomorrow?

Who is this \"woman\" you're talking about...?\nOldbag:\n...Adrian Andrews, of course! Who else!? That guy, he shoved the girl onto Juan on purpose!\nPhoenix:\nHis own manager? But why...?\nOldbag:\nI thought lawyers were smart! It was to create a scandal to make Juan lose face! That girl drove Juan into a scandal that dragged his reputation through the mud!\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like a pretty standard definition of a scandal to me...) Why do you know about that anyway, Ms. Oldbag?\nOldbag:\nI'm one of Juan's biggest fans! I'm always out there gathering information!

Ms. Andrews has a motive.\nPearl:\nYou mean Ms. Inpax's suicide note...?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. She was also the one to discover the victim's body. Clever...\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPearl:\nAh! Mr. Nick! The transceiver!\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nHello!? Wright & Co. Law Offices! (Changed from [Hello!?

I should talk with Mia...\nTalk\nMaya's situation\nPhoenix:\nHow's Maya!?\nMia:\nShe's safe... for now. That kidnapper is one to keep his word, it seems.\nPhoenix:\nI'm glad to hear she's safe... But Mia, how did you know...?\nMia:\nAs soon as she was locked up, Maya called for me. I read the note she left... Then I gathered as much information about her surroundings as I could.\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't know you could use spirit channeling like that... Pretty smart of her...) (Changed from [I didn't know you could use spirit channeling like this... Pretty smart of her...] in the original release)\nThe kidnapper\nPhoenix:\nThe kidnapper! What's he like!?\nMia:\nI don't know... Apparently, Maya went to answer a phone call at the hotel and was drugged there...\nPhoenix:\nAnd!?\nMia:\nShe didn't see the face of her attacker.\nPhoenix:\nArgh...\nPresent\nAnything\nMia:\nSorry, but I don't have time to answer your questions.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah...

Too bad I'm really hungry, and not really thirsty.\nBoxes\nMaya:\nThere's all sorts of things piled up here... But it's too dark to see.\nDoor\nMaya:\nDrat, it's locked. (Hmm, but this door's lock seems easy enough to open...) On TV, the hero always uses a plastic card or a stiff piece of cardboard... ...Then \"click\", they magically open the door. (I wonder if there's a card like that around here I could use...)\nCard\nMaya:\nHuh? Someone dropped a card here... It kinda looks like... a business card... But there's no name on it. Hmm... It's a picture of a seashell, I think... What a strange card.\nMove\nMaya:\nIf I don't do something to the door first, I don't think I'll be \"moving\" anywhere...\nAfter examining door and card:\nMaya:\nAh! That's it! This shell card! If I use this, maybe I can get the door open! This might be my key out of here! I had a feeling this card might be useful... I'm such a genius! Alright. Now if you'll excuse me, Mr. Kidnapper...\n...*click*...\nMaya:\n(I did it!) OK... Now I'm getting the heck out of here! (I shouldn't keep Nick waiting...

I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...)\nOldbag:\nBesides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?Oldbag:\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSomething you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that?\nOldbag:\nIt's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course.\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Gossip\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nIf this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony.\nMia:\nIt looks like we shouldn't force it right now.\nJudge:\nHmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?Oldbag:\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room?\nOldbag:\nI have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am!\nJudge:\n...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?Oldbag:\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho in the world was that!?\nOldbag:\nI'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was...\nJudge:\nYes...? He was...?\nOldbag:\n... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...)\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.Oldbag:\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release))\n\n\n\nThe person's face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's face in more detail!\nOldbag:\nYou don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth!\nPhoenix:\nHis teeth were... shining?\nOldbag:\nWell, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie.\nPhoenix:\n... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!?\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the person was carrying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was the man you saw carrying?\nOldbag:\nIn which hand? His right or his left?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nAh, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand?\nOldbag:\nAh, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand.\nPhoenix:\nThen how about his left?\nOldbag:\nEmpty.\nPhoenix:\n... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable?

Really, as if something like that matters.\nPhoenix:\nBut it does.\nOldbag:\nUm... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat thing?\nOldbag:\nThat gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...)\nOldbag:\nThat thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!!\nPhoenix:\nUm, right...\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright.

I request what the witness said about the jacket be appended to her testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't quite see where you're going with this, but alright. Witness, please...\nOldbag:\nAh well, I don't like to badmouth anyone without reason, but if I must...\nAdds statement \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket.

Really bad.Mia:\nBut, that's how the human mind is. It also has the tendency to jump off-topic. She's strayed onto a few interesting side-topics this time too, hasn't she? But that's what makes her a sweet old lady, right?Phoenix:\n(That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag...Oldbag:\nWhat!? Don't say my name for no reason!Phoenix:\nDo you know what this is?Oldbag:\nAaaah! It's button number 2 on the Jammin' Ninja's costume!Phoenix:\n(Now I KNOW she's an obsessed fan...

She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.Oldbag:\nSee! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!Phoenix:\nIt was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.Oldbag:\nSee! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!Phoenix:\n...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his \"usual racing jacket\"!?Oldbag:\n... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nNow hold your tongue still there for one second! So what you saw in actuality, was not Mr. Engarde, the man... but Mr. Engarde, the Nickel Samurai!?Oldbag:\nBut when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!Oldbag:\nEdgey-poo! Do you think so too?Edgeworth:\nWell, it might be something worth considering. (Changed from [Well, it might be something worth thinking about.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nJust say, \"It's important\" and agree with me for a change!Judge:\nWitness!

Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.Phoenix:\nBut... But the possibility does exist!Oldbag:\nAh, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.Judge:\nH-How do you know that?Oldbag:\nBecause... I said so.

What sort of tone is that to take with an elder! My youthfulness isn't what it used to be, so you should forgive me for everything! If you keep on barking at me like that, I'll start singing at the top of my lungs!\nPhoenix:\nUh, what?\nOldbag:\n\"A striking figure by the sea, standing all alone is he. He's the Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n(...She's actually singing... Someone help my poor ears.)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Can you please do something about this racket!?\nEdgeworth:\nWitness. I'll give you a piece of gum later if you'll be good and stick to just the facts.\nOldbag:\nOKAAAAAAAY! ... You promise, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I'll be sending the bill for the chewing gum to your office at a later date.\nPhoenix:\n(Remind me to send you a thank you note later too, Edgeworth, old chum...)Oldbag:\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBe a little more careful with your testimony, please! Not too long ago, you said he was wearing his \"racing jacket\", and now he's not!?\nOldbag:\n\"Not too long ago\"...? Then let me ask you this! When you were itty-bitty, what was your grand dream?\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nOldbag:\nWhat did you want to be when you grew up, whippersnapper!?\nPhoenix:\nMy dream, huh...? Well, I... uh, wanted to be Judge Wackner, hero of the Public's Court. So what!?\nOldbag:\nSee! And look at where you are now! You're not Judge Wackner, are you!? Are you!?\nPhoenix:\nWell...\nOldbag:\n\"What I said earlier\"... Who puts any weight into things like that!? The \"now\" is everything! I can't be held responsible for the \"past\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did court become theatrics over testimonies?)\nOldbag:\nAll that matters is that man was inside that costume. Isn't that enough!?Oldbag:\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why would that be?\nOldbag:\nThat way, no one could see his face, of course!\nPhoenix:\nBut there's still no advantage for him that I can see. In fact, you would think the costume would make him stand out all the more!\nOldbag:\n... You are such a annoying child, you know that? You disagree with everything I say...\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that what YOU'RE always doing to me!?)\nOldbag:\nI got it! Maybe it was more troublesome for him to change in and out of his costume!Oldbag:\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas there anyone else scheduled to appear at the post-ceremony show?\nOldbag:\nWell, all the contestants were supposed to go onstage in a friendly gesture thing.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that included the Jammin' Ninja...?\nOldbag:\nOf course it included him! That's why when Engarde came out of dear Juan's room, I didn't give it a second thought.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nOldbag:\nWell, anyway.Oldbag:\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo let me ask you one last time.

The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Alright, let's tackle this. The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other in the given scenario. \n\nLooking at the testimonies from Oldbag, she claims that Matt Engarde, as the Nickel Samurai, wore his costume during the murder because he had to go to the post-ceremony stage show right after. The key here is the timing. The testimony mentions he needed to be in costume for the show right after the crime.\n\nNow, checking the evidence, the \"Press Conference Ticket\" (evidence 3) indicates that the Nickel Samurai was supposed to hold a press conference after the stage show. If the stage show was scheduled right after the award ceremony, but the murder occurred around 8:15 PM (as per the autopsy report), there might be a timing conflict. However, the more direct contradiction comes from the fact that the post-ceremony stage show was canceled due to unforeseen circumstances (as mentioned in the PA announcement). If the show was canceled, Engarde wouldn't need to wear the costume for it, undermining Oldbag's claim that wearing the costume was convenient for attending the show. \n\nHowever, another angle is the \"Crime Photo\" (evidence 9) which shows the victim's body with the knife. But the \"Jammin' Ninja's Button\" (evidence 16) found on Engarde's costume suggests he was in the costume. But Oldbag's testimony about the costume's necessity might be contradicted by the actual schedule changes. Wait, the \"Press Conference Ticket\" (evidence 3) actually states that the press conference was scheduled, but the stage show was canceled. However, the testimony in question (testimony 3) says he had to go to the post-ceremony show right after the crime. Since the show was canceled, there's no need for the costume for that purpose. Thus, the existence of the Press Conference Ticket (evidence 3) contradicts Oldbag's testimony that the costume was necessary for the show. Therefore, the contradiction is between testimony 3 (about needing to go to the stage show) and evidence 3 (the ticket for a press conference, which was scheduled after a show that didn't happen). \n\nWait, but the testimony is about the stage show, not the press conference. The stage show was canceled, so he didn't need to go. But the ticket is for the press conference. Hmm, maybe the better contradiction is between the testimony that he needed the costume for the stage show (testimony 3) and the fact that the stage show was canceled (as per the PA announcement in the Hotel Lobby section). But the PA announcement isn't listed as evidence here. The available evidence includes the \"Press Conference Ticket\" (evidence 3) which might imply the show wasn't held. However, the user might have to rely on the evidence provided. Alternatively, the \"Guitar Case\" (evidence 7) being empty and wet could relate to the missing guitar, but I'm not sure how that contradicts the testimony.\n\nWait, another angle: The testimony states that the Nickel Samurai had to go to the stage show right after the crime, hence the costume. But the \"Crime Photo\" (evidence 9) shows the victim in a samurai outfit. Wait, no, the victim is Juan Corrida, the Jammin' Ninja. The Nickel Samurai costume would be on Engarde. The contradiction here is that the testimony claims the costume was necessary for the show, but the show was canceled. However, since the PA announcement isn't listed as evidence, maybe the relevant evidence is the Press Conference Ticket (evidence 3) which was for after the stage show. If the stage show was canceled, the ticket's existence might indicate that the press conference was supposed to happen regardless, but the testimony's claim about the necessity of the costume for the show is contradicted by the show's cancellation. However, since the user's evidence list includes the Press Conference Ticket (evidence 3), which was given by Powers and mentions the press conference after the show, but the show was canceled. Therefore, the testimony's claim that the costume was needed for the stage show (testimony 3) is contradicted by the fact that the stage show didn't occur, hence no need for the costume. But how is that evidenced? The PA announcement about the show cancellation isn't an evidence item listed. The available evidence that could contradict is the Press Conference Ticket, which implies the schedule was changed. \n\nAlternatively, the \"Jammin' Ninja's Button\" (evidence 16) found on Engarde's costume suggests he was in the costume, but Oldbag's testimony about seeing the Nickel Samurai (Engarde) in the costume leaving the room, but the button is from the Jammin' Ninja's costume, implying the attacker was wearing the Jammin' Ninja's costume. Wait, but the button was found on Engarde's costume. Hmm, this might be a better contradiction. If the button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume was found on Engarde's Nickel Samurai costume, that suggests contact between the two. But Oldbag's testimony claims she saw the Nickel Samurai (Engarde) leaving the room. However, the presence of the Jammin's button on Engarde's costume could indicate that the attacker was wearing the Jammin's costume, not the Nickel's. But Oldbag says she saw the Nickel Samurai. Therefore, the contradiction is between the button (evidence 16) and her testimony that it was the Nickel Samurai. But that would be testimony 1 or 2. Wait, testimony 1 is about seeing the Nickel Samurai. The button is from the Jammin's costume, so if the attacker was wearing the Jammin's costume, Oldbag's identification is wrong. But she claims it was the Nickel Samurai. So, evidence 16 (Jammin's button) contradicts testimony 1 (seeing Nickel Samurai). But the user's options are to pick from the given testimonies. The provided testimonies are the ones in the cross-examination. \n\nWait, in the cross-examination, the testimony in question is testimony 3: \"He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\" The contradiction here is that the post-ceremony stage show was canceled, as per the PA announcement in the Hotel Lobby. But the PA announcement isn't listed as evidence. The available evidence is the \"Press Conference Ticket\" (evidence 3), which was for after the show, but the show was canceled. However, the ticket itself might not directly state the show was canceled. Alternatively, the \"Crime Photo\" (evidence 9) shows the victim's time of death as 8:15 PM, which is after the ceremony (which ended around when, based on the timeline? The ceremony ended, then the post-show was scheduled but canceled. If the murder happened at 8:15, and the stage show was supposed to start soon after, but was canceled, then the necessity of the costume for the show is moot. But how to link this to the evidence. \n\nAlternatively, the \"Press Conference Ticket\" (evidence 3) might indicate that the press conference was scheduled, which was after the stage show. But since the stage show was canceled, the press conference might have been as well. However, the ticket's existence shows that the press conference was planned, but the testimony claims the costume was needed for the stage show. If the stage show was canceled, the defendant wouldn't need the costume for that purpose. Thus, the testimony's reasoning (he needed the costume for the show) is contradicted by the fact that the show didn't happen, which is evidenced by the PA announcement, but that's not in the evidence list. \n\nWait, but the user's evidence list includes the \"Press Conference Ticket\" (evidence 3), which was given by Powers. The ticket's description says: \"Seems like the Nickel Samurai is to confess something after the post-ceremony stage show.\" But the PA announcement mentioned the post-ceremony stage show was canceled. However, since the PA announcement isn't an evidence item, perhaps the relevant contradiction is between the testimony that Engarde had to go to the stage show (testimony 3) and the fact that the ticket is for a press conference after the show, implying the show was part of the schedule. But that doesn't directly contradict. \n\nAlternatively, the \"Crime Photo\" (evidence 9) shows the victim was killed at 8:15 PM. The post-ceremony stage show was scheduled to start soon after, but was canceled. The testimony claims Engarde needed the costume for the show, but if the show was canceled, there's no reason to wear it. However, without the PA announcement as evidence, maybe the \"Press Conference Ticket\" is the key. If the press conference was scheduled after the stage show, but the stage show didn't happen, the defendant might not have needed the costume. But how does that directly contradict the testimony? \n\nAlternatively, looking back, the testimony in question is testimony 3: \"He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\" The evidence that contradicts this is the \"Press Conference Ticket\" (evidence 3) which is for a press conference after the stage show. However, the existence of the ticket doesn't directly contradict the testimony; it just shows there was a press conference planned. The contradiction is more about the necessity of the costume for the stage show. If the stage show was canceled, the defendant wouldn't need the costume, but the testimony claims he did. However, without evidence showing the show was canceled, maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nWait, another angle: The \"Guitar Case\" (evidence 7) is empty, and the Jammin' Ninja's guitar is missing. The testimony says Engarde was in the Nickel Samurai costume, but if the guitar was missing, perhaps the attacker used it as a weapon? Not sure. Alternatively, the \"Wine Glass\" (evidence 8) has tomato juice, which the victim loved. But how does that relate?\n\nWait, let's think about the key contradiction here. Oldbag testifies that the defendant was in the Nickel Samurai costume because he had to go to the stage show. But if the stage show was canceled, that reason is invalid. The evidence that the stage show was canceled is the PA announcement, which isn't listed as evidence. However, the \"Press Conference Ticket\" (evidence 3) might indicate that the press conference was supposed to happen after the show, which implies the show was part of the schedule. But the testimony is about the show, not the press conference. \n\nAlternatively, the \"Crime Photo\" (evidence 9) shows the victim's time of death as 8:15 PM, which is after the award ceremony. The post-ceremony stage show was supposed to start at 8:00 PM but was canceled. Therefore, the murder occurred after the show was supposed to start but was canceled. Hence, Engarde wouldn't need the costume for the show. But again, the PA announcement isn't an evidence item here. \n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is between the testimony that the defendant was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume (testimony 1) and the \"Jammin' Ninja's Button\" (evidence 16) found on his costume. If he was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume, how did a button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume get there? That suggests that the attacker was in the Jammin' Ninja's costume, not the Nickel's. Therefore, Oldbag's testimony that she saw the Nickel Samurai is contradicted by the presence of the Jammin's button. \n\nSo, testimony 1 (\"The Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\") is contradicted by evidence 16 (Jammin' Ninja's Button). The button from the Jammin's costume being on Engarde's costume implies that the attacker was in the Jammin's costume, not the Nickel's, so Oldbag's identification is wrong. \n\nBut the user's answer needs to be in the format {\"evidence\": X, \"testimony\": Y}. The testimony in question here is testimony 1. So, the correct pair would be evidence 16 (Jammin' Ninja's Button) and testimony 1 (seeing the Nickel Samurai). But the user's options are the five testimonies provided in the cross-examination. Wait, the cross-examination testimonies are:\n\nTestimony 0: Engarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nTestimony 1: The Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nTestimony 2: Yes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nTestimony 3: He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nTestimony 4: So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.\n\nThe key contradiction is that Oldbag claims she saw the Nickel Samurai (Engarde in costume), but the button from the Jammin's costume (evidence 16) was found on Engarde's costume. This suggests that Engarde's costume came into contact with the Jammin's costume, implying that the attacker was wearing the Jammin's costume, not the Nickel's. Therefore, Oldbag's testimony 1 (seeing the Nickel Samurai) is contradicted by evidence 16 (Jammin's button). \n\nHowever, the user's task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict. So the answer should be {\"evidence\": 16, \"testimony\": 1}.\n\n{\"evidence\": 16, \"testimony\": 1}",

And Global Hero Onyankopon doesn't want to go home without the prize! We hope Lady Luck is with all our heroes tonight! And now! The winner of the third annual Hero of Heroes Grand Prix... IS ME!!\nWhoooooooooa! The true hero of the night has appeared in our midst! It looks like this year's Grand Prix goes to this fantastic warrior! The Nickel Samurai! Too bad, Jammin' Ninja.

He did it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.\nPowers:\nAh, I'm proud of the guy for doing the series justice.\nPearl:\nU-Um... So the person everyone was cheering for... I guess he got the prize?\nMaya:\nYup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? \"The Nickel Samurai\"!\nPearl:\nNo. Every Sunday, I only watch the Educational Channel's \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nOK, that's it! From now on, it's \"The Nickel Samurai\"! All the kids watch it!\nPearl:\nDo you like \"The Nickel Samurai\" too, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nNah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. But I do like \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nHey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed to watch it anymore! You're supposed to act your age and have interests that match. ...It's very important.\nMaya:\nAw, give it a rest, Pearly!\nPowers:\nLooks like I made the right choice in inviting everyone here. I'm glad you're all having a good time.\nMaya:\nAaaaah... It's like a dream!\nPowers:\nToo bad for the Jammin' Ninja, though. Last year, he lost to The Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo. I thought this might be his year...\nMaya:\nYeah... Oh, hey, did anyone else think that the Jammin' Ninja was a bit different today?\nPearl:\nDifferent? What do you mean?\nMaya:\nUm, well, he wasn't carrying his bright red guitar.\nPowers:\nHey, you're right! Strange he'd walk around without his signature guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh* I will never understand these people and their shows...) Anyway, Mr. Powers, thank you very much for tonight.\nPowers:\nA-Aw, it was nothing... I owe you one, so it's just my way of saying thanks.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! It's time to get going to the lobby! There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.\nPowers:\nAnd then, I heard there's going to be a press conference after that.\nPhoenix:\nA press conference? Is he going to make a speech about winning this year's prize?\nPowers:\nUh, well, not exactly... Something about the Nickel Samurai confessing something.\nPhoenix:\nConfessing...? Sounds pretty serious.\nMaya:\nArgh! Nick! COME ON! You don't want us to be the last ones there, do you!?\nPearl:\nYeah, Mr. Nick! Do you!?\nPhoenix:\n(Why me...? The show doesn't even start for another 20 minutes...)\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there.\nPowers:\nAnd behind those doors is an equally grand lobby.\nPearl:\nShall we go and take a look, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nHey, wait up! This grand dessert is calling to me... It's saying, \"Eat me now!\"\nWalls or ceiling\nPhoenix:\nThis sure is one luxurious hotel. Almost to the point of gaudy, with how it blends together everything \"fancy\" imaginable.

How about we get one of these for the office?\nPhoenix:\nOne of those hanging from our poor, weak ceiling? I don't think so.\nTables at back\nMaya:\nIf this is all a dream, I don't ever want to wake up! And all the directors and stars that were here to see the heroes, wow.\nPhoenix:\nI had no idea who most of them were.\nPearl:\nNeither did I.\nMaya:\nNick, you've got to cut that \"news only\" habit out. Your new show is going to be \"The Nickel Samurai!\" Every Sunday morning at 8! Oh, I know! We can watch it together starting next week! I'll come wake you up extra early to make sure, OK?\nPhoenix:\nAh, I'm fine... You know, you really don't have to on my account...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage.

You sure can eat.\nMaya:\nWell, a growing girl needs her nutrients!\nPhoenix:\n(A growing girl? Exactly how big do you plan on getting...?)\nTalk\nWill Powers\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much for inviting us today.\nPowers:\nAww, it was nothing really. Guys like us don't get to come to a place like this often, so I thought I'd invite you all.\nMaya:\nHey, Mr. Powers! What have you been up to lately?\nPowers:\nWell, since \"The Pink Princess\" successfully wrapped up last month, I've been on a kid's exercise show... ...while wearing a rabbit mask over my face...\nMaya:\nOh, I see.\nPowers:\nI'm still really sorry about all the headaches I caused you that time, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nAh, well. What's done is done, so let's forget about it. (This is Will Powers. He's an action star. His popularity exploded when he was the Steel Samurai. And he was the first case Maya worked on with me.)\nMaya:\nIt's too bad you look scary, or people'd know you're a real softy who's good with kids. (Changed from [You can't tell by looking at you, but you're a really nice guy with a love of kids.] in the original release)\nPowers:\nUm, thanks. (Changed from [Ah, thanks.] in the original release)\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe they're going to make a movie based on the Nickel Samurai.\nMaya:\nI can't believe it either, but for a different reason!\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai. An epic story of one hero in a desperate fight against his arch-enemy, the Evil Magistrate in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo. And last year, they started a new series, \"The Nickel Samurai\". The new series seems to be a hit with the kids, too.\nPowers:\nI'm really attached to the Steel Samurai as a show, (Changed from [The Steel Samurai is a show I have a lot of strong feelings for,] in the original release) so I was hoping that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one... (Changed from [so I hoped that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nYeah, it's too bad... It'd been [sic] awesome to see you with the new actor, Matt Engarde. (Changed from [Yeah... It's too bad... It'd be great to see you on the show...] in the original release) He's super popular right now. (Changed from [With the new actor, Matt Engarde. He's super popular right now.] in the original release)\nPearl:\nMr. Un-gard...?\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Pearls doesn't know who he is.)\nMaya:\nThis year it's going to be the Nickel Samurai vs. the Jammin' Ninja at the box office!\nPhoenix:\n...Jammin' Ninja...? Who's that again?\nJammin' Ninja (appears after \"The Nickel Samurai\")\nPhoenix:\nSo who is this \"Jammin' Ninja\" again?\nMaya:\nHe's a hero, duh. His symbol is a bright red guitar he's always carrying.\nPhoenix:\n(A ninja who's always carrying around a bright red guitar...? How does that even work!?)\nMaya:\nWith a scarf around his neck and a guitar in hand, he rises to stardom in an ancient time.\nPhoenix:\nA ninja... Who becomes a star??\nMaya:\nYeah! A ninja who becomes a star!\nPowers:\nThere's a strong rivalry between the two of them. Global Studios' Nickel Samurai and Worldwide Studios' Jammin' Ninja. They even air at the same time.\nMaya:\nYou know what I heard? I heard those two don't get along at all. The Nickel Samurai's Engarde and the guy who plays the Jammin' Ninja, I mean.\nPhoenix:\n(The Nickel Samurai speaks French!? Oh, you mean Matt Engarde, the actor...) I guess even the world of heroes isn't a sparkling, happy place.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPowers:\nAh, I really owe you one. If it wasn't for you guys, I don't know what would've happened. What you did... It was a real tight spot I was in, and you fought so hard to get me out. I don't care what happens. I'll never forget everything you've done for me.\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo, you're going to study to become a lawyer too. Am I right or am I right?\nMaya:\nUmm...\nPowers:\nIt must be real tough. There's all those thick books with hard words you have to read...\nMaya:\nUh, um... Well...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, yeah. Mr. Powers doesn't know that Maya's a spirit medium...)\nMaya:\nI thought he'd be able to tell by my clothes.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he thinks that you've got some strange hobby on the side or something.\nMaya:\n...Hey, wait a sec. What's that's supposed to mean!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo are you Maya's little sister?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but no.\nPowers:\nOh, then you must be Mr. Wright's little sister!\nPearl:\nAgain, I'm sorry, but...\nPowers:\nThen... Whose little sister are you?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but I'm an only child.\nPowers:\nOh, I see... S-Sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(Pearl looks so sad... She looks really sorry too...)\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, they're all shocked because then they figure out who I am.\nMaya:\nHmm... Well, I don't think you look scary.\nPearl:\nMe either. I think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Those two are making Mr. Powers tear up...)\nAnything else\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Thanks for taking the time to take it out and show it to me, but I'm really sorry, I don't know a thing about it.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nPhoenix:\nWow, what is with this place? Looks like I've stumbled into Oz or something. Way in the back, there's a sign for the bathroom. Maybe I should visit it while I can before the show starts... (Changed from [I bet we have a little time to look around before the show starts...] in the original release)\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...? Could it be that there's an action star who has a soft spot for teddy bears...? ...Nah, can't be.\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". \"Juan Corrida\"... His name just sounds like a star's name. I've heard it before, but I don't know anything about him at all.\nEnd of hallway\nPhoenix:\nThere are toilets in each room in this hotel, but since all sorts of events are held here, there are bathrooms for people who aren't staying here to use as well. Perfect for people like me, who can't afford a stay here in the first place...\nFlowers on right\nPhoenix:\n\"To Mr. Engarde From the Global Studio Staff\" Ah, it'd be nice if lawyers got flowers too. Something like, \"To Mr. Wright From All Your Grateful Clients\".\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\". \"Matt Engarde\"... I've heard that name before. Oh, yeah. Maya's always yammering about him like the obsessed fan she is...\nViola Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Viola Hall and visiting Hallway)\nPowers:\nSounds like the post-ceremony show is about to start.\nMaya:\nAlright! I'm so pumped! I wonder if he's going to show off his special move today? \"Nickel Samurai Smelting!\"\nPowers:\nActually, what I'm interested in most is the press conference.\nMaya:\nYou mean the \"big confession\" the Nickel Samurai's going to make after the show? So what is it? Don't you know what it's about, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nUh, well, I'm not the Steel Samurai anymore, so I don't have any idea.\nMaya:\nBah.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Ah, so I guess you are all going to the press conference then?\nMaya:\nYeah, of course!\nPowers:\nIf that's the case, then here, take these tickets so you can get in.\nPress Conference Ticket added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much. Well, let's get going to the lobby.\nPearl:\nIt looks like it's over this way, Mr. Nick!\nMaya:\nOK! For great justice!\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPowers:\nThey called this so suddenly that something about it just seems off, you know?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the press conference?\nPowers:\nYeah. He said, \"There's something I'd like to confess if I win.\" I heard he faxed his request for a conference in to the office only yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nYesterday... (Yeah, that is kind of sudden.)\nPowers:\nBut I guess his manager set everything up somehow, so he was lucky.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Nice manager.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Only a really gaudy hotel would have such a large, gaudy lobby to match.\nPearl:\nAh, I think they're going to have the post-ceremony show over there.\nPhoenix:\nThey're using a compact stage, I see.\nMaya:\nOoh... I'm all ready to use my special \"Samurai Power\".\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks like she's ready to start a fight...)\nPA Notice:\nYour attention please, your attention please. The Nickel Samurai's Post-Ceremony Stage Show will not be held tonight due to unforeseen circumstances.\nMaya:\nWHAAAT!? WHYYYYY!?\nPhoenix:\nOww! You didn't have to pinch me! Pinch yourself if you don't believe it!\nPA Notice:\nWe are asking for everyone's cooperation at this time. So please stay where you are. ...This is a special request from the police.\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nP-Police? Did they just say the police?\nPowers:\nD-Do you want me to go check out what's going on?\nPhoenix:\nUm, wait, I'll come with you...\n???:\nFreeze! You two! Didn't you hear the announcement just now!? It just finished telling you not to move!\nMaya:\nTh-That voice... I've heard that voice somewhere before...\n???:\nHonestly, youth these days can't be bothered to listen to other people when they talk! Just the other day it was the same thing! There was a small footbridge with a sign next to it that said, \"Beware, Bridge Out!\" And along comes a snot-nosed little punk kid right up to the bridge. I tried to tell the boy the bridge was out and it was dangerous, but would he listen!? No, of course not! He said he'd be careful and only walk on the \"in\" part of the bridge since the \"out\" part is what was dangerous! I am not kidding you here! The kid said that and really meant it! WELL! I really let him have it then, and knocked him clear off of that bridge! Honestly, kids these days don't know right from wrong, I tell you!\nPowers:\nThis non-stop chatter...\nPhoenix:\nI-It can't be... ...Ms. Oldbag?\n???:\n...\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, you young whipper-snappers!? Do I know you!? ...Wait. YOU! You're Powers, aren't you!?\nPowers:\nY-Yeah. Um, about what happened back then...\nOldbag:\nYou didn't even get nominated this year, did you? (Changed from [You didn't get nominated last year either, did you?] in the original release) Oh, that's right. You're doing that children's exercise program, trying to play nice.\nPowers:\nAh, yeah, that's me. Thankfully I still have a job...\nOldbag:\nI love that show, and you're a hoot! You're the \"big brother\" character, right? Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You're that giant rabbit! (Changed from [Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You ended up with a rabbit face.] in the original release) What a work of art, but that's how it is, you know? I mean, if you didn't wear the mask, who knows how many TVs you'd break? Really, and shame on those kids exercising around you. They're getting what they deserve. This is why I thought you shouldn't be anywhere...\nPhoenix:\nUm... What are you doing here?\nOldbag:\nLook at my uniform and tell me you can't tell I'm a member of security!\nMaya:\nBut that outfit...\nOldbag:\nAnnoying, noisy brats get the blaster!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nSecond floor\nMaya:\nWow, it looks like there's a fancy restaurant on the second floor!\nPhoenix:\nYou STILL feel like eating?\nMaya:\nI mean, since we're here, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't pull the \"since we're here\" trick on me...)\nPearl:\nWhat a beautiful mansion. Do you live in this wonderful world every day, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, this is my first time in a place like this.\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to say these cameras were set up to cover the post-ceremony stage show.\nMaya:\nBut I wonder where everyone's gone, abandoning their cameras like this...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess something big must have happened...)\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage for the post-ceremony stage show.\nPowers:\nThere was supposed to be a press meeting after the show, but now...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like no one will hear what the Nickel Samurai had to confess after all.\nSeats\nMaya:\nWe're here, so we might as well take some pictures. OK, everyone, sit in a chair!\nPhoenix:\nBut we're all out of film...\nMaya:\nDon't worry about it. There's a zillion cameras over there we can borrow.\nPhoenix:\nHey, hey! You can't just go and \"borrow\" an expensive professional camera like that!\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nMaya:\nWhat incident? What did you do?\nOldbag:\nI didn't do anything, you young'un! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I plead the fifth.\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me!?\nOldbag:\nI thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.\nMaya:\nYou? A bodyguard?\nOldbag:\nFor your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles.\nMaya:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth?\nOldbag:\nBut...\nEdgeworth:\nThat sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me.\nOldbag:\nThat's what he said to me. What did I ever do to deserve that!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nWhat happened?\nMaya:\nUm... So, did something happen?\nOldbag:\nI don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those \"incidents\" happened again.\nPowers:\nA-An \"incident\"? Like a \"murder\" kind of \"incident\"?\nOldbag:\nMaybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, showers of blood are sure to follow. Bet you didn't know that! (Changed from [So wherever I go, a rain of blood will come pouring down. Bet you didn't know that!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUm, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake?\nOldbag:\nSilence, whippersnapper!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nThese eyes of mine are real pros now!\nPhoenix:\n\"Pros\"? Pros at doing what?\nOldbag:\nAt doing police work, of course! My eyes are like a hawk! And my professional eyes spot a messy incident! A messy, bloody incident! That's why I don't have time for you meddling kids and your petty little things!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\n...Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it? I don't like that devilish smile playing on your lips...\nMaya:\nLet's make like we're going to the bathroom, and check things out!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way. The police told us not go [sic] anywhere, remember?\nMaya:\nHuh!? How B-O-R-I-N-G! You're such a boring guy! You've got no motivation! No spirit!\nPearl:\nHuh? What? What's going on? Are you giving Mystic Maya trouble again, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Not you too, Pearls... Please don't stick your little nose into this one...)\nMaya:\nSo listen to this, Pearly. This one time at lawyer camp, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nO-OK! I get it! Let's go take a look.\nMaya:\nYay! I know you couldn't say no to me, Nick!\nPearl:\nThat's right. You'd walk over miles of hot coals for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That would be EVERY time we work a case together...)\nMaya:\nWell, what are we waiting for? Let's go already! You can come along too, Pearly.\nPearl:\nGoody! I get to come! I get to come!\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nThere's nothing really out of the ordinary here...\nPearl:\nAre you looking for the \"in-si-dent\" that the old lady was talking about? (Changed from [Are you looking for the 'something' that the old lady was talking about?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't look like it happened here. Well, we'd better go look somewhere else.\nMaya:\nAlright! Then, let's try...\nBellboy:\nExcuse me.\nMaya:\nAck!\nBellboy:\nAre you by chance, Ms. Maya Fey?\nMaya:\nUm, yeah... That's me.\nBellboy:\nYou have a phone call waiting for you at the front desk.\nMaya:\nA call? I wonder if it's someone from Kurain Village...\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mystic Maya?\nMaya:\nOh, nothing. You guys go on ahead and I'll be right there, OK? (Changed from [Oh, nothing. I'll just go on ahead to check it out, OK?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nOK.\nBellboy:\nRight this way, Ms. Fey.\nPearl:\nLet's go look somewhere else now, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, OK.\nPearl:\nThis is a little exciting... And a little scary...\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of.\nChandelier\nPearl:\nSo, that's called a \"shan-deh leer\", right?\nPhoenix:\nYup.\nPearl:\nWhat is that for? What does it do?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's for lighting up a room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? Can I look down now? My neck hurts...\nTables at the back\nPhoenix:\nThey haven't cleaned up all the food yet. There's a sad feeling hanging in the air now that the party is over...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nIt's a feast fit for a king!\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPearl:\nIt was the first time I ate that food. What was it called again? I think it started with \"key\". Key... Wee?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, a \"kiwi\".\nPearl:\nI don't know what to say. It's a sweet but sour fruit all in one.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nHotel Lobby\nExamine\nSecond floor\nPhoenix:\nA lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. But right now, the only thing filling this enormous room is anxiety about the murder. ...I really hope nothing else bad happens here...\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nThese cameras must belong to the press that came to cover the conference. They're all basically doing the same thing: staring at the empty stage.\nSeats\nPhoenix:\nSeats for the spectators of the post-ceremony show and the press conference. But it's too bad neither event is going to be held now.\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nPearl:\nUm, I guess you must have done something... um... \"deh-plor-ible\"...\nOldbag:\n\"Deplorable!?\" I would never do such a thing! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you!

TOLD. YOU. I get people the info they want! Which means that I've got a right to know!\nNope! Don't care who you are, pal, we're still investigating, so you can't go in!\nWhat's yer problem!? Just ya wait! It'll be all over the morning paper! \"Scruffy Detective's Secret Scandal Revealed!\" You'll see! I'll git ya back!\nPearl:\nThose two sound pretty serious...\nPhoenix:\n(That southern accent can only mean...)\nHey, Wright!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey... Lotta...\nLotta:\nCome on, do a gal a favor and tell this cop I'm just doin' my job and I've got rights...\nGumshoe:\nAh, YOU!\nPhoenix:\nAh... Detective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, help a guy out! Tell her that only the police are allowed here! This is the scene of a murder, so she should leave this to us pros...\nPearl:\nA... A murder!?\nGumshoe:\nAw, shoot! Me and my big mouth!\nLotta:\nSee! I knew it! My gut instinct told me so! I always trust my gut! A murder, it said! And that's what it is! A genuine murder!\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, wait...\nYeehaw, a murder! Of a big star, no less!\nGumshoe:\nOh, man... I'm in trouble now...\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nSo... Detective Gumshoe... A murder...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, no, that's not it. I got my facts mixed up for a second there, pal.\nPearl:\nU-Um... Mr. Nick? Is the dead person the Nickel Samurai...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Why do you ask?\nPearl:\nWell, Mystic Maya was rooting for him, so...\nGumshoe:\nIt wasn't the Nickel Samurai that got bumped. Actually, the Nickel Samurai is the one under suspicion of doing the bumping off...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nThe guy that died was this hero named the Jammin' Ninja, pal.\nPhoenix:\nThe Jammin' Ninja...\nLotta Hart\nPearl:\nUm, that woman with the big puffy hair that looks like cotton candy...\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Lotta?\nPearl:\nThat woman... She was there that time too, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat time?\nPearl:\n...When Mystic Maya did that channeling...\nPhoenix:\nOh, that time... Well, Lotta's a journalist, so that's why she was there.\nPearl:\nJer-nal-ist...\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like she was hanging around here before the murder happened.\nPhoenix:\n\"Hanging around\"...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, hiding in wait in front of the Jammin' Ninja's door, pal.\nPhoenix:\nB-But why would she...?\nGumshoe:\nShe wouldn't tell me, pal. Just said something about \"Gettin' my big scoop\"...\nPhoenix:\n(Scoop? What sort of news could she be after...?)\nThe victim (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nSo the victim was the Jammin' Ninja?\nPearl:\nMr. Jammin' Ninja...?\nGumshoe:\nHe was on a really popular rival TV show to \"The Nickel Samurai\".\nPearl:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nThe victim was the action star, Juan Corrida. He got a huge push and rode the express train to stardom. I mean, even I know who he is!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, even I recognize his face...)\nGumshoe:\nBut I heard lately that Matt Engarde's been taking the wind out of his sail. I'm telling you, pal, as far as who's popular, those two are hogging all the limelight.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess there's no space for Mr. Powers at all, huh... Poor guy...)\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde... Um... That's the Nickel Samurai, right...?\nGumshoe:\nYup. I mean, no! You've got to say it with more umph! \"The Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n...Anyway, so now that Juan Corrida's gone, that means Mr. Engarde has the whole stage to himself, wouldn't you say?\nGumshoe:\nI wouldn't bet on it, pal. We can't have that happen, you know?\nPhoenix:\n\"Can't have that happen\"? (What's that supposed to mean, I wonder...)\nArrested? (appears after presenting Matt Engarde profile)\nPhoenix:\nWh-Why was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's not something I can tell you. We just started the investigation, so we don't want any leaks.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like yet another \"Steel Samurai\" hero is in hot water...)\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick... If Mystic Maya knew about this...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know. She'd make me take this case... I know...\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI was really shocked by what happened to her in that one case. I didn't know she had such an awesome power!\nPearl:\nAwesome power...?\nGumshoe:\nI thought maybe I should do some self-improvement and take up a hobby. So I went out and bought some Morning Glory seeds and planted them, pal.\nPhoenix:\n...That's a good way to improve yourself.\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. Well, it's nothing really...\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nThat girl is number three on my \"People I've Seen A Lot Of Lately\" list.\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then who's number one...?\nGumshoe:\nAs if you need to ask. It's YOU, pal!\nPhoenix:\nA-Ah... So who's number two?\nGumshoe:\nMaya Fey. ...But it looks like she's not around this time.\nPearl:\nIt must be nice to be such good friends with each other, isn't it Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think that's the real meaning of Detective Gumshoe's list...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nI look good! I think I've lost some weight, pal!\nPhoenix:\nIt's only wishful thinking.\nGumshoe:\nWishful thinking, huh? ... In that case, I wishfully think I've lost some weight!\nPhoenix:\n(I wishfully think he might face the facts one day...)\nGumshoe:\nLately, I've been on the instant noodles only diet, pal!\nJuan Corrida profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm not a real fan of action shows or anything... But I know who Juan Corrida and Matt Engarde are.\nPhoenix:\nYou can't talk about one without talking about the other, I guess.\nGumshoe:\nThey even debuted around the same time. So they have this real fiery rivalry with each other. Kinda like you and me, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(I never knew he thought of me as a rival...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nThe Nickel Samurai! He really took the Grand Prix tonight!\nPhoenix:\nMaya's a big fan of his.\nGumshoe:\nReally? ...Oh, I'm sorry then.\nPearl:\nWhy are you sorry?\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde was just arrested, pal. ...On suspicion of murdering Juan Corrida.\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nAny evidence\nPhoenix:\nWould you take a look at this for me?\nGumshoe:\nListen, pal... I'm not leaking any info about the evidence to you this time. If I do, my salary's really gonna get it... And then I won't even be able to get those instant noodles down at the discount market!\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nDo you know this person?\nGumshoe:\nYou meet a lot of people as a detective, pal. So we make extra sure to not forget people because that's our job. ...Now, having said that, I don't remember ever seeing this person before.\nPearl:\nWhich means that you're kind of forgetful, aren't you Mr. Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThat's not what it means... Not exactly anyway...\nAfter clearing \"The victim\" and \"Arrested?\" Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Hallway:\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPowers:\nHey! So what's going on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Juan Corrida has been killed.\nPowers:\nWh-Wh-What!? Juan is... He's...!?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde.\nPowers:\nY-You're joking, right!?\nPhoenix:\nNope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja.\nPowers:\nOoogh... Not again... I feel sick.\nPearl:\n\"Again\"...?\nPhoenix:\n...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls.\nPowers:\nI still can't believe... No way... No way Matt would...\nPhoenix:\n(...? What's Mr. Powers got in his hand...?)\nPowers:\n...Oh, before I forget... This... This is for you, Mr. Wright. I got this from the bellboy that came by earlier.\nRadio Transceiver received from Mr. Powers.\nPhoenix:\n...For me...? But why?\nPowers:\nI don't know. All he said was it was for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney.\nTalk\nMatt and Juan\nPowers:\nMatt is the most energetic and active actor out there right now. The Nickel Samurai really sealed his place as a pop idol, but... he kept adding fuel to the fire of his rivalry with Juan anyway.\nPearl:\nMr. Juan... He's the Jammin' Ninja, right?\nPowers:\nThose two would butt heads over everything they could think of. But I'd say that Matt was the one who almost always came out on top.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess some people only know how to relate to others by butting heads like a ram...)\nPowers:\nJuan said that he'd take Matt on this time too, so he joined a rival TV show.\nPearl:\nAnd that was \"The Jammin' Ninja\"...?\nPowers:\nThe stylish Nickel Samurai and the burning Jammin' Ninja... Well, things turned messy real fast with those two using their shows for their \"war\". And the final tally... Look around... It's pretty obvious how things ended up.\nPhoenix:\n(Matt even won the Grand Prix this year... The final win over his rival, I guess...)\nPress conference\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde was going to hold a press conference, wasn't he?\nPowers:\nThat's what I heard. Though if you wanted to get technical about it, it was the Nickel Samurai's conference.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai's...?\nPowers:\nYeah. He was supposed to wear his costume and give the press conference that way.\nPhoenix:\nHe was going to be in costume...? But why? (Changed from [So he was supposed to be in-costume...? But why?] in the original release)\nPowers:\nI'm not sure... They don't keep me in the loop anymore.\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nPowers:\nIt was almost right after you guys left. An old man who's a bellboy at this hotel showed up.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when he told you to give this to me...?\nPowers:\nYeah...\nPhoenix:\n(Why... Why give me this transceiver...?)\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nHey, where did Maya go off to?\nPhoenix:\nShe got a phone call.\nPowers:\nOh yeah, that's right. She was heading for the front desk just now. She sure stands out in a crowd, doesn't she?\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, then they're all shocked because they figure out who I am...\nPearl:\nI think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Mr. Powers is getting teary eyed.)\nJuan Corrida profile\nPowers:\nHe debuted around the same time as Matt in everything, you know.\nPearl:\nReally?\nPowers:\nYeah, it started out small... First it was singing contests, then swimming competitions... Then it was bowling tournaments, and then it was who could throw the best New Year's parties... Juan was always trying to one-up Matt. But lately, those two were escalating to more and more dangerous things... I thought that no good would come of it all, so I began to worry.\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad Juan's story ended so soon...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nPowers:\nMatt's younger than me, but you can practically see his star potential.\nPearl:\nHis star po-ten-shial...?\nPowers:\nI got his autograph the other day.\nPhoenix:\n...Feels kind of wrong now, doesn't it?\nPowers:\nI don't care what people say! Matt didn't kill Juan! I know he didn't!\nAny other profile\nPowers:\nUmm... I'm honored you're asking me, But I have no idea who this person is. Umm... Sorry...\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPearl:\nUm... I was just wondering... Where's Mystic Maya? She's been gone a long time.\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, she was only going to answer a phone call...)\nPearl:\nMaybe she got lost. I'll take a quick look around for her.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nPearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I... I'm not sure... (It's coming from this transceiver...) (Changed from [Did this transceiver just...?] in the original release)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, hello? Wright here...\n???:\nIs this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney?\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are...!?\n???:\nYou don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMaya:\nHeeelp! Niiiiick!\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\nMaya...?\n???:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Wouldn't you agree that the more important issue is the fate of the girl?\nPhoenix:\n(Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?) Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?\n???:\nCome now. Don't fall apart on me yet.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This... No! This can't be!)\n???:\nNow that I have your attention, Mr. Attorney, I have a modest proposal for you. If you do what I require, then I will return to you your valuable \"item\" unharmed. ...What is this called again in your fancy lawyer terms?\nPhoenix:\n...\"Kidnapping for ransom\"...\n???:\nYes, that's it. This is a kidnapping.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nPhoenix:\n(M-My sight... Everything's fading away... Maya... Maya... Maya's been kidnapped!)\n???:\n...--re you there? Mr. Attorney, are you there? (Changed from [You there? Mr. Wright, are you there?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nH-How much!? How much do you want!?\n???:\nVery good, Mr. Attorney. I'm glad you have such a good grasp of the situation.\nPhoenix:\nHurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya--\n???:\nMoney is not what I seek.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\n???:\nWhat I want is a certain verdict. I would like a complete acquittal.\nPhoenix:\nComplete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!?\n???:\nI am not the person you will be representing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\n???:\nYou are currently at the Gatewater Hotel, are you not? And I know that a murder has just taken place there.\nPhoenix:\nJuan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde...\n???:\nYou are, as expected, quite on top of things, Mr. Attorney. Now then. What I want is very simple. I want you to obtain a complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nM-Matt Engarde? But why?\n???:\nHe did not kill anyone. I can attest to that. However...\nPhoenix:\nH-However!? However what!?\n???:\nHowever, someone is framing him for the murder. A very smart someone who is setting him up to take the fall...\nPhoenix:\n... (If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?)\n???:\nYou are, of course, at liberty to take me at my word or not. (Changed from [You are, of course, at liberty to believe me or not.] in the original release) However, there is one thing you can take as fact. Right now, your very precious \"item\" is with me, in my possession.\nMaya:\nMmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\n???:\nYou have two days. Of course, tonight, he will be in questioning with the police. But the trial is in two days. At that trial, you will win a not guilty verdict. Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nO-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!?\n???:\nYes, exactly. I don't believe I was wrong in choosing you, so don't let me down.\nPhoenix:\nAagh!\n???:\nOh, yes, that's right. Now that I am playing the role of the kidnapper, I can't pass up this chance to say, \"And don't even think about callin' the cops!\" ...Hmm, not great, but you get the idea.\nPhoenix:\nD-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!?\n???:\nAlright, I'll tell you that much. My name is... ...De Killer.\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Wh-Where is Mystic Maya!?\nPhoenix:\n...She's been kidnapped.\nPearl:\nN-No... ... It's all my fault! If only I had gone with Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault, Pearls.\nPearl:\nBut it is! It is! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nPowers:\nMr. Wright... I think we... I think we should tell the police what it's [sic] going on...!\nPhoenix:\n(No! We can't do that! If we do, who knows what will happen to Maya...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What about the detective we saw earlier...?\nPhoenix:\n(...Detective Gumshoe!) Yes, that's it! Wait here, and I'll be right back!\nPowers:\nAlright! I'll take care of Pearl while you're away!\nHallway\nGumshoe:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANSOM!?\nPhoenix:\nShhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nGumshoe:\nWait, the deal is \"complete acquittal\" in exchange for Maya, you mean...? Then this means Matt Engarde is obviously the killer, pal! No doubt about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent...\nGumshoe:\nYou really believe what a KIDNAPPER tells you, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd on top of everything else, there's all this evidence we keep finding.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nThe forensics team's having a field day back there. (Changed from [The guys with the eagle eyes are really lapping it up like they just caught a huge fish.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nGumshoe:\nBut it's strange. There's so much evidence that it feels like something's wrong.\nPhoenix:\nThere's too much evidence? Is that possible? (Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being \"set-up\"...?)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, looks like you won't be leaving here tonight, pal. Just sit tight and cooperate with the investigation. Tomorrow you can start yours.\nPhoenix:\n...A-Alright... (Isn't there another way...?)\nGumshoe:\nWe've also got to be careful about pushing the kidnapper the wrong way.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right...\nDate:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0???\nMaya:\nNnngh... Oww, my head... (Wh-Where... Where am I!? I wonder if I'm still in that hotel... Wh-What happened to me...?) Nick... Pearly! ... (Come on, you guys. This isn't funny anymore...)\n...*ka-click*...\n???:\nI see you have awoken.\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you!?\n???:\nMe? ...I am known as \"De Killer\".\nMaya:\n\"D-De Killer\"!? You mean like an \"ASSASSIN\"!? (I... I'm too young to die!)\n???:\nDon't worry. You are not my target. ...For now anyway.\nMaya:\nA-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nick! Nick! Where are you!? ...Help me...\n???:\nYes, that's right. Only one person can save you now, and that is Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\n...Huh? Wh-What? Nick... Nick's going to save me...?\n???:\nCalm down and be a good girl. Think of this as a business transaction.\nMaya:\nA... A business transaction?\n???:\nI am going to contact him now. I hope you'll cooperate and play your assigned role well.\nMaya:\n...Nick... What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearly... (Changed from [What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearls...] in the original release) ...Sis...\n???:\n... Is this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney? ... You don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMarch 21, 8:11 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPearl:\nGood morning!\nPhoenix:\nAh, morning, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mr. Nick! Come on! Let's hurry and go see Mr. Engarde!\nPhoenix:\nWe have to wait a bit, Pearls. Visiting hours don't start until 9 AM, so...\nPearl:\nOh, I see. Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I had gone with you... (Changed from [Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I went with you that time...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls... She's been like this since last night... We managed to get home somehow, yesterday evening... Thanks to Detective Gumshoe gently holding her by the hand and leading her here... But by the looks of it, I don't think Pearls got any sleep at all last night.)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mystic Maya... She's alright, right!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she's alright. Either way, I'm going to save her. You can trust me on that.\nPearl:\nPlease... Please... Help her...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm only able to stay this calm and collected... Because Pearls is doing the crying for the both of us...)\nExamine\nAnywhere\nPhoenix:\n...No matter where I look in this familiar space I call my office... No, I can't let my mind wander now! I don't have the time! I've got to get going on this case!\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPearl:\nUm... I have a thought...\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nPearl:\nYou're going to represent Mr. Engarde... aren't you?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I don't really seem to have a choice.\nPearl:\nUm, but what if... What if he... ...is the real murderer? What would you do then, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWould you fight to get a not guilty for a murderer to save Mystic Maya...?\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Let's talk to Mr. Engarde first, OK? ...We can think all the bad things we want, but it doesn't change a thing.\nPearl:\nY-Yeah, you're right... I'm sorry. I... I can't stop thinking about it...\nMaya's situation\nPhoenix:\nPearls... You're really worried about Maya, aren't you?\nPearl:\nI... I don't have anyone else left in this world.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean...?\nPearl:\nMy family's all gone...\nPhoenix:\n(...Her family...)\nPearl:\nMy father... He left my mother and the village behind and went away.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry...\nPearl:\nAnd... my mother... She did that thing... all for me...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nMystic Maya... She's like a sister to me... ... She is all I have left in this world...\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nPearls...?\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(She looks out of it... Maybe I should leave her alone...)\nMarch 21, 8:57 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(We couldn't wait for visiting hours to start, so Pearls and I came down here early... To visit one Nickel Samurai, charged with the murder of the Jammin' Ninja...)\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nG-Good morning. How are you today?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI know this situation might be a little tough for you...\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... We're...\nEngarde:\nOh, sorry dude...\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nI already signed up...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me...?\nEngarde:\nI already have life insurance. I signed up a long time ago cause my job is, you know...\nPhoenix:\n... Oh! No no no... We're not insurance salespeople!\nEngarde:\nReally...? Dude, I really don't need that right now either.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nFire extinguishers. I mean, this building isn't my house, so...\nPhoenix:\n... No no no... We're not here to sell you fire extinguishers either! I'm a lawyer. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nEngarde:\nA lawyer...? ... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my manager, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nThe Nickel Samurai sure is a strange person, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(I think \"strange\" is an understatement.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. You're just in time.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\nEngarde:\nYou're a lawyer dude, right? My manager's looking for a good one right now, so how about it?\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! This is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to make him let me take his case! I have to!)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera. Mr. Engarde keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nSorry to intrude, but I would like to ask you a few personal questions.\nEngarde:\nUm, that's OK, but dude, my autobiography's coming out soon, so... If I say stuff without the publisher's approval, then I'm gonna be in real hot water... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my publisher, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde is so lucky! He has so many people he can talk to.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... I don't know if he actually has anyone he can really talk to...)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. Like I thought, the publisher said it'd be \"real bad\" if I said anything, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(Does he have a mind of his own!?)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, I would like to ask you about the murder...\nEngarde:\nOh, are you covering this for a tabloid as a side job, dude? Um, um... Well, if you want my statement on this, you should ask through my staff...\nPhoenix:\nNo no no... I'm not asking on behalf of a tabloid...\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the president of the studio, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nIs he alright, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(If we're talking about Mr. Engarde's brain here, I wouldn't put my money on it.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. The studio president said, \"Even Neo Mt. Fuji itself knows that I'm not the murderer!\"\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? What's \"Neo Mt. Fuji\"...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a mountain in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo; the city the Nickel Samurai protects.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, this is an attorney's badge.\nEngarde:\nDude, I'm sorry, but I don't have the free time to be looking at things like that.\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nEngarde:\nI'm much too busy with Nickel Samurai stuff right now.\nEngarde:\nI don't have the time to take a lawyer's correspondence course...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does he believe I'm a salesman!? Insurance, then extinguishers... Now this!!)\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\n...? What's that?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a ticket for the press conference. You were going to give one after winning the Grand Prix, right?\nEngarde:\nHuh? Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. While you were in costume, no less. ([in costume] hyphenated in the original release)\nEngarde:\nUm, I never heard anything like that, dude. I only heard about the stage show. I always leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't know...? That's odd...)\nRadio Transceiver\nPearl:\n...Mr. Nick? What are you going to do with that?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know yet, but I figured I could at least show it to him...\nEngarde:\nIs that a transceiver? Hey, it looks like a real nice one, too.\nPhoenix:\nI got it as a \"present\" from someone.\nEngarde:\nHmm? Interesting.\nPhoenix:\nI've also been instructed to take your case.\nEngarde:\nIs that what you heard from the transceiver?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nEngarde:\nDude, that's terrible! Don't let some disembodied voice boss you around!\nPhoenix:\n(This coming from a man with a cell phone on his wrist...)\nWill Powers profile\nEngarde:\nI've seen him somewhere before... Is he a member of my fan club?\nPhoenix:\nThat's Mr. Powers. Isn't he supposed to be kind of like a mentor to you?\nEngarde:\nPowers...? Oh yeah! He's the guy on that kid's exercise program. I gave him an autograph just the other day.\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't see Mr. Powers as a mentor at all...)\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nMan, it's too bad he's dead...\nPhoenix:\nYou killed him... That's the most logical conclusion, don't you agree?\nEngarde:\nDude, what are you talking about!? You're making a huge mistake.\nPhoenix:\nIf that's such a mistake, then why did they issue an arrest warrant for you!?\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the guy in charge of this place, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nStars sure know a lot of people, don't they?\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that phone even really gets reception in here...)\nEngarde:\n...Um, I guess you're right about the warrant after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we might be making some progress here!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nEngarde:\nYeah... I'm such a handsome devil.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um, yeah...\nEngarde:\nAnd I'm way good at sports! Karate, tennis, judo, soccer, football, hockey, fencing... Dude, it's no wonder I'm so popular.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um, yeah... (You're also good at sitting in a jail cell, Mr. Popular.)\nAny other evidence\nEngarde:\nDude, I know I like to throw money around, but it's not like I buy anything and everything.\nPhoenix:\n(That's nice, because it's not up for sale anyway!)\nAny other profile\nEngarde:\nUm, dude, this person looks like a member of my fan club. Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the fan club president, OK? ... ...\nPhoenix:\nUm, \"dude\", you know what...? Forget I asked...\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Press Conference Ticket and Radio Transceiver:\nEngarde:\n... ...Well, dude, I think it's about time for me to get going.\nPhoenix:\nPlease, wait! ...I really need to take your case!\nEngarde:\nThere's always other people in need of a lawyer, right? Want me to introduce you to a few?\nPearl:\nPlease! Please let Mr. Nick represent you!\nEngarde:\nMan, oh man. Lawyers these days. Now you dudes use kids to pull in clients, too?\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't take me as your lawyer, then De Killer is going to...!\nEngarde:\n... Wait... What did you just say?\nPhoenix:\n\"De Killer\"...\nEngarde:\nD-De Killer!?\nPhoenix:\n(...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...)\nEngarde:\n... Alright, dude. I accept your terms.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEngarde:\nI'll let you represent me in court.\nPearl:\nW-We did it! We did it, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...)\nEngarde:\nGo ahead, ask me anything. I'll help out as much as I can...\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nEngarde:\nMan, I thank my lucky stars that people know my name.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're quite the hero, and you're in the national spotlight.\nPearl:\nI didn't know who he is... Does that mean I'm not a good citizen...?\nEngarde:\nAh, it's really great to be the Nickel Samurai. Dude, lately, I just keep on getting more and more popular.\nPhoenix:\n(True enough... \"The Nickel Samurai\" is very popular among high schoolers and secretaries right now. I guess Mr. Engarde has a way of catching the eyes of women...)\nEngarde:\nDo you know my motto? \"Refreshing like a spring breeze.\" That's what I am.\nPearl:\nA spring breeze...\nEngarde:\nThat's why this kind of scandal is disastrous, dude. I mean, even if I get out of here tomorrow, it's still gonna look bad.\nPhoenix:\n(But everyone loves a good scandal...) (Changed from [Everyone loves a good scandal...] in the original release)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me about your activities last night?\nEngarde:\nAfter I got the award, I took a break and went back to my room. I had that post-ceremony stage show to do. So I was in my Nickel Samurai costume.\nPhoenix:\nAnd you were alone the entire time?\nEngarde:\nMy manager was running around being busy, so yeah.\nPhoenix:\nBecause of the press conference you were supposed to have after the show?\nEngarde:\nI told you, dude. I have no idea about any press conference, alright?\nPhoenix:\n(That's strange... I thought the Nickel Samurai was going to confess something...)\nEngarde:\nAnyway, when I was leaving my room, that's when I noticed it was kinda noisy...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida was already dead at that time...?\nEngarde:\nYeah, that's what I gathered anyway from my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm beginning to gather that this guy can't do a thing on his own...) (Changed from [With the way he's always talking about his manager, it's as if she runs his life.] in the original release)\nEngarde:\nAnd that's when the detective in the green coat showed up. He searched me... And then, out of the blue, the dude arrested me.\nThe victim (appears after \"Matt Engarde\")\nPhoenix:\nAbout you and the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida, what sort of...\nEngarde:\nThat's got nothing to do with anything, dude. Man, with that face of his, you can't even tell he's the same age as me. And he wanted to try making a \"Jammin' Ninja\" movie, even though we all know it'd fail.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai still won in the end, right?\nEngarde:\nYeah. I took the Grand Prix by storm. So why would I, the winner, have any reason to kill the guy anyway? Dude, you'd think it'd be the other way around, you know?\nThe charge of murder (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know why you were arrested?\nEngarde:\nI guess maybe my full body search went badly.\nPhoenix:\nDid they find something on you?\nEngarde:\nThey found a button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nPhoenix:\nA button...?\nEngarde:\nI don't get it either. It was caught in the pleats of my samurai pants, or \"hakama\".\nPearl:\nAaah!\nEngarde:\nDude, I really think someone planted it there though. I'm serious.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that's what really happened...?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nPearl:\nLet's ask one last thing. Let's test Mr. Engarde to see if he really is innocent or not...\nPhoenix:\nW-We can do that...?\nPearl:\nYes. If you use this...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's Magatama!)\nPearl:\nHe won't be able to hide any secrets from you, Mr. Nick. I'm sure of it.\nPhoenix:\n(I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly.\nEngarde:\nWhat is it, dude?\nPhoenix:\nDid you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nPlease put the phone away and answer this question yourself.\nEngarde:\nAlright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWell, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nNothing. Not a chain or lock in sight.\nPearl:\nWhich means... I think it is alright to trust him.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.)\nEngarde:\nUm... The trial's tomorrow, right? I'm counting on you, dude.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 21, 11:34 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWell, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important...\nPearl:\nSo! So now what should we do!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer.\nPearl:\nOK! Then let's start looking!\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Actually, the crime happened at the recently completed hotel in the center of town, the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. ...Just how far are they going to expand their empire...?\nCharley the plant\nPearl:\nOh! I'll water it!\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK... I already did that...\nPearl:\n...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...)\nPoster\nPearl:\nThis is the Nickel Samurai... right?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's right.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!?\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.\nPearl:\nOh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either...\nPhoenix:\nI-It's OK, Pearls. Really.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh! I cleaned it up some more for you last night! ...Because I couldn't sleep...\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSince there were no Psyche-Locks, then that means we can trust Mr. Engarde to be innocent.\nPearl:\nI really feel much better knowing that. Ever since last night, I was so worried that I kept wondering... \"What if he is the real killer...? What then...?\"\nAny ideas\nPhoenix:\nHey, I have something I want to ask you, Pearls.\nPearl:\nOK, what is it?\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you so interested in how Maya and I get along? I mean, she and I don't have anything special go--\nPearl:\nHuh!? Wh-What do you mean!? B-But I thought... I thought you and Mystic Maya were... I-I've been mistaken all this time!? No way...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aaaah! She really wasn't kidding! Pearls actually believes Maya and I are... ...Maybe I should've just left it alone...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Stop it! Don't hide your true feelings from me!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! She slapped me!!)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPearl:\nThat's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nI guess?\nPearl:\nI feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...)\nMaya Fey profile\nPearl:\nOh, Mystic Maya... I wonder if you're alright...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure she's OK. We have to be patient for just one more day. I'm sure we can save her. Trust me.\nPearl:\nIf there's anything I can do, please tell me, OK!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPearl:\nTo tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me.\nPhoenix:\nI think your hair now suits you perfectly.\nPearl:\nR-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget*\nPhoenix:\n*fidget, fidget*\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPearl:\nI'm sure that Mr. Detective would be our ally if we asked!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I think so too. (Looking back, we've known each other for a while now... He's always been trustworthy... A bit \"off\", but still trustworthy. What a paradox.)\nWill Powers profile\nPearl:\nHe's a really kind and nice old man, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is really perceptive when it comes to people... But what does she mean by \"old man\"...?) Hey, Pearls? What about me...?\nPearl:\nWhat about you, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, I don't think I want to hear this...)\nAnything else\nPearl:\nUm, there are still so many things in this world that I don't understand yet. ...Honestly, I still don't have enough training.\nPhoenix:\nAh, no, it's OK. I don't have any ideas myself...\nPearl:\nI'm sorry. I'm really sorry!\nMarch 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEngarde:\nAh, the lawyer dude. So what did you find out?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... I'm still in the middle of investigating...\nEngarde:\nI see. ...But I've already told you everything I know, dude.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\nDude, like I told you, I don't know anything about that press conference. I leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(...This is harder than pulling bass from a river...)\nRadio Transceiver\nEngarde:\nSo, why are you carrying around that transceiver...?\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about it.\nEngarde:\nAnd why do you do everything it tells you to do? You know, the messages it sends you, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, he probably doesn't have anything to do with Maya's kidnapping.) ...That's a secret.\nEngarde:\nOK, whatever, dude.\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nLook, dude, I didn't kill him. I mean, the Nickel Samurai kicked the Jammin' Ninja's butt, right? So it's not like I felt threatened by the likes of him.\nPearl:\nBeing rivals sounds like a sad way to relate to another person...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nOldbag:\nHey! What do you think you're doing!? You can't come in without...\nPearl:\nGood morning.\nOldbag:\nHold on, it's YOU! What is going on around here!?\nPhoenix:\nU-Uh... Um...\nOldbag:\nI heard poor Juan was killed. Is that true!? It's a bad rerun is what this is. Another \"Steel Samurai\" doing the most evil of deeds.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you know... That's not entirely...\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know that I was a huge fan of Juan's! Why, oh why, do all the stars I'm interested in drop one by one like flies!? It's always been that way! Ever since I was a little girl in elementary school! The class hamster was fine until it was my turn to clean its cage, and then it died! The other kids started calling me the \"Queen Reaper\". I swear that's what they dubbed me! \"Whoever you name in your evil spell dies within three minutes,\" they would taunt.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened...\nOldbag:\nHmph! Don't push me, boy!\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? I... Um... I couldn't hear everything she said... because she was talking too fast...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...?\nOldbag:\nDon't boss me around, you spiky-haired, smarty-pants!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but...\nPearl:\n...Even Mr. Engarde himself didn't seem to know, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(How does the person who's supposed to give a conference not know about it...?)\nTalk\nThe victim\nOldbag:\nMy dear Hammer died a year ago in that dreadful murder. And only recently did I finally find a star that makes this heart go *badump* again.\nPhoenix:\n...I don't know what to say...\nOldbag:\nI ask you, why does every star I cheer for always ends [sic] up kicking the bucket?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nI'd watch your words! No one's going to get away with saying anything bad about my Juan!\nPhoenix:\nBut I haven't said anything...\nOldbag:\nWell, I don't believe a word that woman says anyway!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What woman?\nOldbag:\nThat irritating, backwater girl with the afro and the horrible country accent. I mean, what is that manner of speaking supposed to be? And why does she never stop? Honestly, women these days. They don't know the meaning of the word \"modesty\". When I was a young maiden, I was so beautiful even the flowers of the field blushed. But despite this, I pressed flowers, or read the stars, or wrote beautiful love poems or\nPhoenix:\n...Pearls? Are you thirsty?\nPearl:\nUm, a little.\nPhoenix:\nOK. I'll go get you some juice or something.\nPearl:\nTh-Thank you very much.\nOldbag:\nHey! Are you paying attention!? Young'uns today!\nPhoenix:\n(So I'm guessing Ms. Oldbag heard everything from Lotta...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nI want to ask you about what happened around the time of the murder...\nOldbag:\nAh, I don't know anything about that. I was here getting ready.\nPhoenix:\nGetting ready? For what...?\nOldbag:\nThe show, of course! ...Well, and the press conference afterwards.\nPhoenix:\n(Cue mysterious music for the magical press conference.)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I don't know anything about the murder.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see...\nOldbag:\n... But.\nPhoenix:\n?\nOldbag:\nBut if you're talking about what I saw, that's different. I saw it very clearly!\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nOldbag:\nI saw the most important moment of the night!\nWhat you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nTh-The most important moment!? You don't mean...!?\nOldbag:\nOh, so now you treat me with respect, you disrespectful child. When you speak to your elders, you should always be polite. Really, kids today.\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see!?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nOldbag:\nThe murder last night was gruesome, wasn't it? But then, what murder isn't?\nPhoenix:\n(Please don't stray onto another tangent... Please...)\nOldbag:\nIf you want to hear more, then show your respect and bring this lady a present!\nWhat you witnessed (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see on the night of the murder!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPearl:\nP-Please! Mystic Maya's life is...\nOldbag:\nAh, but you haven't given me my present yet. ...Hmm... Let's see... I'll only tell it to you if you can bring me Juan's autograph!\nPhoenix:\n(What an unreasonable request... You might as well have asked for the moon!)\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nI don't have anything to say to delinquents like you!\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr... She's clamming up like the old clam she is...)\nPearl:\nPlease! Anything would be helpful!\nOldbag:\nWell then, how about I tell you my measurements?\nPhoenix:\n...Um... No, that's okay... Really.\nPearl:\nShe really doesn't like you, does she Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI know, I know...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like the investigation is still in full swing. The hotel staff and the police are running around like a bunch of headless chickens.\nPearl:\nI wonder if we can do any investigating of our own in this kind of atmosphere...\nPhoenix:\n...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess.\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of, only to disappear... ...If only we had all gone together...\nChandelier\nPearl:\nThat is such a beautiful sight.\nPhoenix:\nThe chandelier?\nPearl:\nYes. But I can't believe it... I can't believe that such a terrible murder happened under such beautiful lights... It's shocking.\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was held on that stage just last night. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nWe ate at this table last night, didn't we?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nPearl:\nI was really happy then.\nPhoenix:\n(I wish I could make you smile again... Even for a second...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHallway\nLotta:\nHey! Yer here! Been waitin' for ya, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nLotta...\nLotta:\nHey! Mr. Cop fella! The thief's showed his face!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!?\nLotta:\nArrest him! Put him on trial! Find him guilty! Give him the death penalty!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong, Lotta!? Are you feeling alright?\nLotta:\nLooked here and there and up and down the mountain, but it ain't here! So why don'tcha just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep! (Changed from [So why don't ya just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep!] in the original release)\nPearl:\nUm, what are you looking for...?\nLotta:\nMy CAMERA! C-A-M-E-R-A! It's my life blood! I'm gonna die without my $700 camera!!\nPhoenix:\nY-Your camera...?\nLotta:\nLook, don't lots of people say the criminal always goes back to the scene of the crime!? And lookie lookie, here ya are!\nPhoenix:\nYep. Here I am... Faced with a Lotta trouble.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...?\nLotta:\nI didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nLotta:\nYeah, that's what I thought too, so I was a nice enough gal to lend a helpin' hand! ...Secretly, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(I have a feeling one of these days, I'm going to end up defending her in court...)\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\".\nLotta:\nSo that's the scene of the murder, I reckon. I thought somethin' had gone on that night, but I didn't never think it was murder.\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\".\nPearl:\nSo Mr. Engarde was here during his break, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what he claims. (Hmm... The crime scene... If he had wanted to get to Mr. Corrida's room... He would have had to pass through this hallway.)\nTalk\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!\nPearl:\nHuh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?\nLotta:\nI had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon. I made this itty-bitty scratch on it and the manager got all huffed up in the face... He gave me his talkin' to and was real mean about it too. He done made me cry at that!\nPearl:\nWhen did you lose your camera?\nLotta:\nLast night, after the murder happened. Musta been when I was busy runnin' around lookin' into things! That's when I lost sight of my dear, darlin' expensive sweetie!\nPhoenix:\nLotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours?\nLotta:\nI don't rightly know. I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?)\nLotta's Camera added to the Court Record.\nCamera (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!\nPearl:\nHuh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?\nLotta:\nI had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon.

I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nLotta, please tell me what you know about what happened at the time of the murder.\nLotta:\nWell, from before the ceremony last night, I was hangin' around here in this area. Yeah, actually I was here until around the time Mr. Engarde was arrested.\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you doing here...?\nLotta:\nYou sure you went to school, City Boy? Wherever Lotta Hart goes, there's a story to be found! A big scoop to be had!\nPhoenix:\nA big scoop...?\nLotta:\nI told ya before. I'm gonna be the best tabloid photographer the world's ever seen! Reckon course that means I'm always lookin' for the perfect shot!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what \"scoop\" she was after this time...?)\nLotta:\nAlthough, I was also on the look out for the other stars that were here, so... maybe I wasn't here the entire time...\nBig scoop (appears after \"Camera\" and \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nLotta... Are you sure you weren't here the entire time? So you could take a picture for your big scoop?\nLotta:\nWell... Maybe I was. But that's what real journalists do! I got some juicy inside info, so I thought to myself, why not get a picture for proof?\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of story was it that you would hang around here...?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nOops, sorry, Mr. Lawyer. Can't be tellin' you that. Trade secret, ya know?\nPhoenix:\n(Not again... Why does everyone have something to hide...?)\nPearl:\nWe've been stopped, haven't we?\nLotta:\nHa ha, yeah! Take that, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here is happy... Ms. Lotta and your \"I rule!\" smile...)\nBig scoop (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou were on the hunt for your big scoop last night?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nIt's just a bunch of tabloid photos. They ain't got nothing to do with the murder.\nPearl:\nIt looks like we have no choice but to remove the Psyche-Locks.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I guess so.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nLotta:\nHey, what's that? ...A press conference ticket? How come I ain't got myself one of them!?\nPhoenix:\nP-Please don't direct your anger at me...\nLotta:\nWhy in tarnations wasn't I invited to that!? How come someone on the bottom of the popularity chart like you got the info, but not me!? Info like that is worth nothin' to ya, am I right or what!?\nPhoenix:\n(...Is that the kind of person she thinks I am...?)\nPearl:\nAre you going to stand there and take that, Mr. Nick!?\nLotta's Camera\nLotta:\nNngh... And I just bought that camera... Who did it!? The thievin' rascal!\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't look straight at me while you're saying that...\nLotta:\nWhen I find the bugger who went and done this, they're gonna pay with a bullet!\nPhoenix:\n(And if you do that, don't expect me to defend you...)\nMaya Fey profile\nLotta:\nNow that I think about it, she isn't with y'all today, is she...?\nPearl:\nUm...\nLotta:\nShe's a spunky one! You shouldn't have been lettin' her outta yer sight. Who knows what she's up to now...\nPhoenix:\n(Like you're one to talk...)\nPearl:\n...\nPearl Fey profile\nLotta:\nAh, just wanna say sorry to ya.\nPearl:\nFor...?\nLotta:\nWell, I really, absolutely thought you were the murderer.\nPearl:\n...Huh?\nLotta:\nYou know... Last time, that thing with Maya Fey...\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!? But why!?\nLotta:\nI mean, you were all worked up, ya know?\nPearl:\n*sniffle* ...Meanie...\nPhoenix:\nLotta, that was very insensitive of you!\nLotta Hart profile\nLotta:\nThis kind of hairstyle is pretty hard to get, ya know. Hard to care for too. Just the other day, I ran my hand through my hair to fix it up, and suddenly, out pops this dollar coin! That's gotta be like hittin' the jackpot!\nPearl:\nWow, that's really lucky!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* What a deep conversation that was...)\nJuan Corrida or Matt Engarde profile\nLotta:\nI don't really care for 'em \"heroes\" or whatnot.\nPearl:\nOh, I see...\nLotta:\nAnd shows they got for kids, those adventures are just plain ol' borin'! Now, adults. We get more caught up in messy, sticky, real situations! ...Even me...\nPearl:\nO-Oh...\nLotta:\nSounds like the tyke's gettin' what I'm goin' with this!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a sec here! Don't go around getting her mixed up in things like that!\nSecurity Lady profile\nLotta:\nThis old granny? Ah, she kept on glarin' at me with those eyes of hers. As if it's my fault. Kept babblin' how she won't forgive people who write \"trash\" about her Juan... ...Ah, yeah, we sorta got into a little fight, ya know...\nPhoenix:\n(A \"little\" fight? Knowing those two, it was probably more of a blabbering contest.)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know anything...\nLotta:\n...*sigh*... I've told ya how many times now? I'm a journalist. I've got so much info runnin' laps in my head I forget things here and there!\nPearl:\nPlease don't get so worked up over this...\nLotta:\nHah! I don't care if ya beg me! \"Be extra tough on kids!\" That's this gal's motto on learnin' youngsters.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nUm... Where are we?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room.\n???:\nMay I help you with something?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... We're...\n???:\nYou're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail.\nPhoenix:\nUm... How did you know I'm his lawyer...?\n???:\nYou were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer.\nPearl:\nWow...\n???:\nIt's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either.\nPearl:\nIt's really not the time to be showing off, Mr. Nick.\nAndrews:\nI am Adrian Andrews. I hate to waste time, so let's get down to business.\nPhoenix:\nA-Alright... (She may be of small stature, but appearances can be deceiving...)\nExamine\nRed suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's probably Mr. Engarde's suitcase. For someone who was only going to be here for the award show, this is a lot of stuff. Looks like he has about three days' worth of clothes in here.\nPearl:\nStars really are different from us, aren't they...?\nBedroom\nPhoenix:\nThat's the bedroom over there.\nPearl:\nThat's a bed...? Wow, they have really big beds here!\nSofa\nPhoenix:\nThere's some samurai-looking clothes on the sofa here.\nPearl:\nUm, I think that jacket looking thing is called a \"happi\".\nPhoenix:\n(Whatever it is, I'm sure something like that would make a great souvenir. Maya would be absolutely thrilled...)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nLooks like dishes left over from dinner... A dinner for two, at that.\nPearl:\nI'm sure they're Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews' plates.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they had T-bone steaks... What's with Global Studios and T-bone steaks...?\nPlate on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a giant bone sitting on the plate.\nPearl:\nI... I don't really like meat...\nPhoenix:\n(...? There's something... weird about this plate... I just wish I could put my finger on what it is...)\nTalk\nNight of the murder\nAndrews:\nI assume the first thing you need to know is what everyone was doing that night, correct?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, that is correct.\nAndrews:\nThen I will tell you. Before the award ceremony, I had dinner with Mr. Engarde. In this very room, I might add.\nPhoenix:\n\"Dinner\"? What did you eat?\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate to waste time with trifling details. If you took a look at the table yourself, you wouldn't need to ask me.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet she's a lot of fun at parties...)\nAndrews:\nWhen the award show was starting, I headed for Viola Hall.\nPhoenix:\nAnd after the show ended, you came back to this room...?\nAndrews:\nNo, I had some small errands to run. I helped with the preparations in the lobby.\nPhoenix:\nOh... (Preparations for the post-ceremony show, I guess...)\nAndrews:\nWhen it was time for the post-ceremony show, I came back to call for Mr. Engarde. After that, I went to visit Mr. Corrida...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you found his body, isn't it?\nAndrews:\n...\nPearl:\nYou really held strong through everything...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... She does seem to be mentally tough as nails...)\nRelation to Engarde\nPhoenix:\nUm, so... About you and...\nAndrews:\nStop right there. You aren't seriously about to ask how Mr. Engarde and I are related, are you? (Changed from [Don't expect me to believe you have been talking to me without knowing how we relate.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nAndrews:\nI have no idea how he could chose [sic] you as his lawyer. (Changed from [I have no idea why Mr. Engarde chose you as his lawyer.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Why did she have to go and say something like that...?)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Calm down and hang in there. I'll give you a shoulder rub to relieve your stress later, alright?\nAndrews:\nI already gave you my name earlier, but I'll add that I'm Mr. Engarde's manager.\nPhoenix:\nHis manager... Speaking of managers, did the victim, Mr. Corrida have one?\nAndrews:\nNo, he did not.\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't?\nAndrews:\nGlobal Studios has a very different policy from Worldwide Studios in that Worldwide Studios does not assign individual managers to their stars.\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nAndrews:\nThis industry is very ruthless and unforgiving. Actually, you look quite ruthless and unforgiving yourself to your poor partner. Dragging a little girl like her to places like this. Honestly.\nPearl:\nYou're wrong! I... I'm doing this to help Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Calm down and hang in there. I'll buy you a juice later, alright?\nPearl:\nNngh...\nMotive for murder (appears after presenting Juan Corrida profile)\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any ideas?\nAndrews:\nAs to...?\nPhoenix:\nAs to why Mr. Corrida was murdered?\nAndrews:\nWhy would you ask me about such a thing...?\nPhoenix:\nI'm just doing my job. So, do you have any ideas?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nSorry, but there's nothing more I have to add to this conversation.\nPearl:\nIs it a Psyche-Lock, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYes... There's getting to be more and more of these lately.\nMotive for murder (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou know something, don't you? About why Mr. Corrida was murdered...\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nAndrews:\nWhy are you asking me? Don't tell me you can see inside my heart.\nPhoenix:\n(No, but I can see the locks you have on your psyche.)\nPearl:\nIf you don't remove her locks...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it's worthless to even ask...)\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one taking care of the arrangements for this press conference, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, that's right.\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Engarde said he \"didn't know\" about it.\nAndrews:\n... Is that what he said...?\nPearl:\nHuh...?\nAndrews:\nActually, I didn't know all the details either. It was a request from the publicity department. All I did was help out and do what I was asked.\nPearl:\nOh... I see.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder about that... I wouldn't take her to be the type of person to do something without knowing the details.)\nWill Powers profile\nAndrews:\nThat's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be.\nPhoenix:\n(Urk... What a horrible thing to say...)\nAndrews:\n...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? For a second, her face twisted in pain...)\nPearl:\nI wonder if something happened to Ms. Andrews...\nJuan Corrida profile\nPhoenix:\nDid you know the victim, Mr. Corrida?\nAndrews:\nYes, I knew him. The world is such a small place, after all.\nPearl:\nDid you know about his rivalry with the Nickel Samurai?\nAndrews:\nHonestly, they were like children when it came to that. Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most trivial things. (Changed from [Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most uninteresting things.] in the original release) ... If either one of them wasn't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die. (Changed from [If either one of them weren't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n! (...I've got a hunch that this woman knows more than she's letting on... She must know why Juan Corrida was killed!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nAndrews:\nI asked to become Mr. Engarde's manager. He's a pleasure to manage with his nice disposition.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Mr. Engarde does seem like a rather weak-willed man; always doing as he's told...)\nPearl:\nHe's always saying, \"my manager,\" right Mr. Nick?\nAndrews:\n...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAndrews:\nI hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... (Take away that layer of sarcasm and she really does seem to hate herself...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, I'd like to ask you about this...\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Where are we...?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Juan Corrida's room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Corrida...?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim... Which makes this the crime scene, too.\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's you! So!? What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!?\nPhoenix:\nNot yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there?\nPhoenix:\n(I just want Maya to be alright...)\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nWe don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal.\nPhoenix:\nCan you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...?\nGumshoe:\nJust this once... \"Special circumstances\" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here.\nPhoenix:\nThank you.\nGumshoe:\nOh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy.\nPearl:\nWow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you!\nGumshoe:\nHa ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I got a map!\nPhoenix:\nThat's great, Pearls!\nPearl:\n... Um... But Mr. Nick, I can't read what it says...\nHotel Guidemap added to the Court Record.\nExamine\nRefrigerator\nPhoenix:\nThere are all sorts of things in this refrigerator...\nPearl:\nThe carrot juice bottle and the tomato juice bottle are both empty...\nPhoenix:\nEmpty...? (It's too much of a hassle to throw them away, I guess.) They're all vegetable juices. I guess he must've been a real health nut.\nPearl:\n...Oh! There's a beet, some ketchup, and a bottle of strawberry jam too!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe red was his favorite color...?\nStuffed bears\nPearl:\nWow, there are a lot of bears!\nPhoenix:\n(Alarm clock ones, collector's editions, stuffed teddies, plastic models... It's pretty overwhelming... Is there a kind of bear he doesn't have...?)\nPearl:\nThere's even a few in the trash can...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I get the feeling maybe the guy didn't really like bears.\nPearl:\nPoor teddies...\nIt's hard to \"bear\" with all these problems... Growl! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n... (I don't think I want to \"bear\" with the trauma the last case caused me...)\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mr. Nick?\nDesk\nPearl:\nHmph! It's so messy here!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls really likes things neat and tidy, I take it...)\nPearl:\nThere are a lot of electronic things in here that I've never seen before. Hey, Mr. Nick! Tell me what they are, pretty please?\nPhoenix:\nOK. That over there is a \"watch\". You wear it on your wrist.\nPearl:\n... I know what a watch is...\nPhoenix:\n(Oops. For a second there, I forgot I was talking with Pearls, not Maya...)\nBlue suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's a suitcase. There are so many things in it that I bet it barely closes. There's his clothes, a dryer, an electric shaver, a calculator...\nPearl:\nDo all stars pack too much stuff like Mr. Corrida?\nTable on right\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Mr. Corrida had dinner last night.\nPearl:\nThis bottle... It's tomato juice.\nPhoenix:\n(We had a lot of food at the award show last night... But I wonder if the stars had gone onstage after only eating a meager meal like this...)\nBedroom\nPearl:\nSo that's a bed, right?\nPhoenix:\nYup. It's big, but it's a bed.\nPearl:\nAaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft!\nPhoenix:\n(Big beds must be a rarity for her...)\nScattered items near guitar case\nPhoenix:\nBottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.\nPearl:\nWhat's this glass fragment from...?\nPhoenix:\nA flower vase maybe? There are flowers on the floor, but I don't know what they are.\nPearl:\nYou don't know much about flowers, do you Mr. Nick?\nGuitar case\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.\nPearl:\nThat's strange. The guitar is not here...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he forgot to bring it to the show?\nPearl:\nBut Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item...\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid...\nPearl:\nYeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nGuitar Case added to the Court Record.\nGuitar case (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.\nPearl:\nThat's strange. The guitar is not here...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he forgot to bring it to the show?\nPearl:\nBut Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item...\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid...\nPearl:\nYeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nWine glass\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nPearl:\nBut doesn't it seem weird?\nPhoenix:\n...What seems weird?\nPearl:\nI mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor.\nPhoenix:\n... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)\nPearl:\nWhy is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?\nWine Glass added to the Court Record.\nWine glass (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nPearl:\nBut doesn't it seem weird?\nPhoenix:\n...What seems weird?\nPearl:\nI mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor.\nPhoenix:\n... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)\nPearl:\nWhy is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?\nTalk\nCause of death\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what was the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nWell, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal. (Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIt should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Here's a picture.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a knife in his chest.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal, that's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was stabbed to death...)\nGumshoe:\nThey're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now.\nPhoenix:\nThere were fingerprints on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nYup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nCause of death (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what was the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nWell, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal. (Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIt should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Here's a picture.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a knife in his chest.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal, that's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was stabbed to death...)\nGumshoe:\nThey're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now.\nPhoenix:\nThere were fingerprints on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nYup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nReason for arrest\nPhoenix:\nWhy was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nBecause we had evidence on him.\nPearl:\nEvidence...?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the victim, Juan Corrida, really put up a big fight.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, one look at the crime scene and you can tell. There's signs of a struggle everywhere.\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah. During the fight, his button came off...\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde said something about a button... Something like, one of the Jammin' Ninja's buttons got caught in his \"hakama\"...)\nGumshoe:\nBut that's not all...\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nThere was a witness, pal.\nPhoenix:\nA witness!? Wh-Who is it!?\nGumshoe:\nThat lady... Ms. Oldbag.\nPhoenix:\n(Please... Anyone but her!)\nGumshoe:\nThe prosecution has plenty of evidence to make a solid case... Not to mention there's something around where the vic was that's a little off. (Changed from [Not to mention there's something at the crime scene that was a little off.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nSomething that's a little off...? As in...? (Changed from [Something that was a little off...? As in...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nAs in, that's for you to figure out, pal!\nPearl:\nAlright, let's try to figure it out, Mr. Nick!\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nGumshoe:\nThat's your \"present\" from the kidnapper, huh? While you're talking, it sends and receives radio waves... If we could trace that...\nPearl:\nYeah! We could use it to find out where the bad guy is!\nPhoenix:\n(It uses radio waves, huh?)\nGumshoe:\nI got it! I'll go find a radio scanner, and let you borrow it, pal!\nGuitar Case\nPhoenix:\nWhat can you tell me about this guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nOh, that. This is just what I heard, pal, but that's the Jammin' Ninja's signature item.\nPhoenix:\nThe guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nNo, not that! What do you take me as? I mean the guitar inside, of course!\nPearl:\nBut... The guitar is missing.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, we looked for it too. It's not normal for a person to forget to bring their most famous item to an award show.\nPhoenix:\n(It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...)\nWine Glass\nPhoenix:\nSo about this wine glass...\nGumshoe:\nAh, so you noticed it, pal. The whole crime scene was a mess, but this glass was the only thing that was untouched.\nPhoenix:\nYou noticed that too, Detective Gumshoe...?\nGumshoe:\nNo, actually Ms. von Karma noticed it first.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Pearls noticed it before me too... Hey, wait a minute. So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's here at the hotel...? (Changed from [So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's coming here...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah, she's around. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal. (Changed from [Yeah, she's coming. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal.] in the original release) Especially if she catches you in here. (Changed from [I think it'd be best if you didn't bump into her here.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou can bet the instant I see her, I'll be running the 1,000 meter dash.\nCrime Photo\nGumshoe:\nYou look at this photo and you can't help it. It makes you want to say, \"I can't believe this is the scene of a murder.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Stabbed with a knife after a struggle... A clue is sleeping in this photo somewhere... I know it.)\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm sorry.\nPhoenix:\n...For what?\nGumshoe:\nI really want to help you look for her, pal.\nPearl:\nMr. Detective...\nGumshoe:\nIf anything happens, let me know, OK? I want to help in any way I can!\nPearl Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, little missy. Listen good, OK?\nPearl:\nOK. What is it?\nGumshoe:\nDon't ever pick up a whip, OK? Don't even think about it.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nGumshoe:\nIf you ever find yourself thinking you want one, try to make due with a good slap to the face. Got that? Slap the person in the face. Promise me, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(Personal experience tells me Gumshoe should be careful what he wishes for...)\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nIf I had a choice, she would be number three on my list of people I don't want to see.\nPhoenix:\n...Because I'm in the number one spot?\nGumshoe:\nDon't get all high and mighty on me here. You've taken a tumble into second place, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really? Then who's in first...?\nGumshoe:\nMs. von Karma's miles and miles ahead of you in this race.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh...\nGumshoe:\nShe's really scary... Right now... M-Ms. von Karma... You really don't...\nPhoenix:\n(He's so scared of her that he's whispering now...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, why don't we let bygones be bygones, pal? Look, this guy is guilty. A buck says so.\nPhoenix:\nOne dollar...? Sure you're not talking about Pearls' allowance money?\nGumshoe:\nI... I can't bet any more than that... My salary... It's...\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't matter what we think... I still have to defend Mr. Engarde in court or else!)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick...\nSecurity Lady profile\nGumshoe:\nI thought she was an alien from outer space.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, probably because she's wearing that strange helmet.\nGumshoe:\nNah, even with her helmet off, I thought she was an alien, pal.\nPhoenix:\n... I think that's probably best kept to yourself, if you know what I mean...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nGumshoe:\nShe's Mr. Engarde's manager, right? No matter what I do, I really stink at talking with people like her. As soon as I open my mouth, I get all flustered. See, she's one of those women with a brain. She's someone who \"gets things done\".\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she does give that sort of impression, like she's got it all together.\nGumshoe:\nCompared to her, you can easily tell I'm a \"can't do anything right\" kind of guy. That's why I get all nervous and start messing up.\nPhoenix:\n(I feel sort of bad for him...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you know about this?\nGumshoe:\nUm... There's nothing special I can tell you about this, pal. Look pal, we don't have a lot of time. Why don't you show me something more important? If Ms. von Karma saw me here like this... I'd have to switch sides real fast...\nAfter clearing all Talk options, examining guitar case, and presenting Wine Glass:\n...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*...\nPearl:\nWh-What's that beeping noise, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I've heard this sound somewhere before...)\nGumshoe:\nIt's Ms. von Karma...\nPearl:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nFor some reason, whenever I hear that sound, she pops out of nowhere and whips me! (Changed from [Whenever I hear that sound, for some reason, she pops out of nowhere and whips me!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, that's exactly what happen [sic] the last time...) (Changed from [Come to think of it, that did happen the last time...] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nS-Sorry! I've gotta make myself scarce! Later, pal! Eowww!\nvon Karma:\nAt last, you reveal your true nature... Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(*gulp* Would it be too much to ask for you to be nice to me for a change...?)\nvon Karma:\nSo you're the type to steal information from pitifully hopeless detectives! That's very dishonorable of you!\nPhoenix:\n(Owww!)\nvon Karma:\nHey! Don't you dare run away, Scruffy McTrenchcoat!\nGumshoe:\nAh!\nvon Karma:\nI didn't think the detectives of this country could be this pitiful...\nGumshoe:\nUwaah!\nvon Karma:\nDetective! Come over here for a second!\nGumshoe:\nYeooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!\nvon Karma:\n...Hmph. I feel better knowing at least you were man enough to face your punishment.\nPhoenix:\n(He was so scared, he just froze up on the spot...)\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright! You... You have soiled my perfect prosecution record. I'll never forget that. This time... Victory is mine!\nPhoenix:\n... Victory is yours? Is that all this means to you...?\nvon Karma:\nWh-What...!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nvon Karma:\n... H-Hmph! Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin. (Changed from [Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!\nvon Karma:\nThis isn't over yet... I swear on my family's honor!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! What did she throw at me NOW...!? (Changed from [Ow! Now what did she throw at me...!?] in the original release) What is this...?)\nGumshoe:\n...Well, I guess this means I've gotta get back to the precinct now, pal. If you ever need me, come down to the Criminal Affairs Department, alright? And if you can, try not to let Ms. von Karma see you...\nExamine\nPaper on desk\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, what's this piece of paper...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's called an \"autograph\".\nPearl:\nAuto-graff?\nPhoenix:\nIt's got Mr. Corrida's name written on it, so it's his autograph.\nPearl:\nI can't read it at all. To be honest, I've never seen writing that looks like this.\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's a special way of writing called \"cursive\". Look here. See how it says, \"To my dearest Wendy\" in more normal letters here?\nPearl:\nTh-This sloppy, unreadable writing! It's crazy and cruel to give this to someone!\nPhoenix:\n(Hold on...)\nPearl:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nWendy... I've heard that name somewhere before...\nMr. Corrida's Autograph added to the Court Record.\nAfter visiting Enguarde's Hotel Room:\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPowers:\nOh, Mr. Wright! How are you?\nPhoenix:\nAh, Mr. Powers. Have you been here the entire time?\nPowers:\nYeah. People connected to the murder aren't allowed to go home, let alone leave...\nTalk\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me a little more about the Nickel Samurai TV show?\nPowers:\nOK. \"The Nickel Samurai\" is an action hero program aimed towards kids. It's the sequel to \"The Steel Samurai\".\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nPowers:\nThis time, there are three Samurai Brothers: Aluminum Samurai, Tin Samurai... And of course, the Nickel Samurai. It's a love \"Y\" in Neo Olde Tokyo!\nPhoenix:\nI see... ... W-Wait... A love what...?\nPowers:\nA love \"Y\". This girl, Sayo, works at a tea shop and all three guys fall for her at the same time.\nPhoenix:\nOh... I guess the \"Y\" shape is like the 3 brothers colliding over this one girl?\nPowers:\nAnyway, Sayo is actually the daughter of the evil Strawberry Clan's leader!\nPhoenix:\nSounds like an unusual situation. Like Romeo and Juliet... times three.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah... Strange thing is, this sort of forbidden love story is really big with the office ladies.\nPearl:\nUm...\nPowers:\nYes, Pearl?\nPearl:\nWh-What happens next!? I want to know! Ms. Sayo... Does Ms. Sayo fall in love? She does, doesn't she?\nPowers:\nEvery Sunday at 8 AM.\nPearl:\nI'm going to stop watching \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\" starting this week!\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe she's really considering it!)\nJammin' Ninja\nPhoenix:\nSo what's the \"Jammin' Ninja\" TV show like?\nPowers:\nIt started from a remake of an old movie, to tell you the truth. The Jammin' Ninja is, like the Samurai shows, aimed towards kids. It's the story of a ninja who can't climb a wall, but became a big pop star.\nPhoenix:\n...Uh, what?\nPowers:\nHe was a really lousy ninja. Absolutely couldn't do any ninja things right at all. But boy could he sing! With his trusty bright red guitar in hand, he took the ancient world by storm.\nPhoenix:\nA... A ninja... With a bright red guitar...!?\nPowers:\nAnd then, the final fight in front of his beloved Princess Misola! \"Jammin' versus the Muromachi Five!\" Suddenly! Our brave hero catches a not so Jammin' cold the night before Battle 3!\nPhoenix:\nAww, that's too bad for him...\nPowers:\nY-Yeah... But this kind of pop music-based love story is something high school girls really like.\nPearl:\nUm...\nPowers:\nYes, Pearl?\nPearl:\nWh-What happens next!? I want to know!\nPearl:\nJammin'... The Jammin' Ninja! Will he be able to sing!? What about Princess Misola!?\nPowers:\nEvery Sunday at 8 AM.\nPearl:\nUmm... Which show should I watch...? Hmm...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe she's really  considering it!)\nThe gossip on Adrian (appears after presenting Adrian Andrews profile)\nPhoenix:\nWould you mind telling me about this \"gossip\"?\nPowers:\nAh, so you ARE interested in it! I figured you would be! (Changed from [Ah, so you're interested in it too!

Which means if we're talking about a certain manager with the initials A. A....\nPhoenix:\n... Adrian Andrews...?\nPowers:\nY-Yes, exactly! This is big news!!\nPhoenix:\n(But... It seems kind of odd.

And I didn't suspect a thing because he looked like such a normal old man...\nPhoenix:\n(Old man, huh...)\nGuitar Case\nPowers:\nThat guitar case... That was Juan's...\nPhoenix:\nI'm guessing you've seen this case before?\nPowers:\nIt's pretty famous by now. It stands out because it holds THE bright red guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(The bright red guitar... The Jammin' Ninja's signature item.)\nPearl:\nBut if the guitar is so important, how could he forget it for the award ceremony?\nPhoenix:\n(That does seem a little strange...)\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nI...

I saw him coming out of Juan's room.\nPhoenix:\nYou're kidding!\nPearl:\nOh no!\nOldbag:\nIt was about ten minutes before Juan's body was discovered. It was just a coincidence. I was on my way to the toilet, minding my own business.\nPhoenix:\nAnd...? Did you tell that to the police?\nOldbag:\nWell, of course! I thought I could get a gift certificate or two out of it, maybe more.\nPearl:\nGift certificate...?\nOldbag:\nI've been recruited again for that part at the trial. You know, the trial tomorrow? This time, you're gonna get it! I'm gonna work hard to get your client pronounced guilty!\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Engarde hasn't done anything bad...\nOldbag:\nI don't care about details like that!

But why...?\nOldbag:\nI thought lawyers were smart! It was to create a scandal to make Juan lose face! That girl drove Juan into a scandal that dragged his reputation through the mud!\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like a pretty standard definition of a scandal to me...) Why do you know about that anyway, Ms. Oldbag?\nOldbag:\nI'm one of Juan's biggest fans! I'm always out there gathering information!

Without her, I became scared. Everything... Everyone seemed like they were out to get me.\nPhoenix:\nSo you got close to Mr. Corrida to recover her suicide note, correct?\nAndrews:\n... Looks like that tabloid reported the truth after all. Ironic, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nWell, like they say, where there's smoke, there's fire.\nAndrews:\nAnd if they purposely add fuel to the fire, they keep the celebrity world burning.\nPearl:\n...\nAndrews:\nBut as for the suicide note? I didn't and wouldn't kill anyone for it. It just doesn't suit me, that's all.\nAndrews:\n... Well, that's enough for now.

At the time of the murder, he was still in his Nickel Samurai costume!Judge:\nIf that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...Edgeworth:\nThe defendant.Judge:\nHow did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?Phoenix:\n(If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...nothing strange with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is nothing strange with this photo.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I have done nothing to alter this picture either, in case you're wondering, Wright.\nJudge:\nI see... And it seems the defense will rest on this matter. In that case, there is no reason to further prolong this trial.\nMia:\nIs this really alright with you, Phoenix!?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well... There's nothing wrong with this photo that I can poi--\nMia:\nTry again! Take another good look at it! And if you still don't see anything... Do something... anything to prolong the trial!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Chief! W-Wait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright? I'm about to enter my verdict. Please address me with your comment afterwards.\nPhoenix:\nUm, no, I'm sorry, but this can't wait...\nEdgeworth:\nOh? Let me guess. You are going to point out some peculiarity with this photo?\nJudge:\nWh-What? Why didn't you say so earlier!?\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"something strange with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"Phoenix:\nThere's... There's something strange with this photo!Edgeworth:\nI knew this was coming, Wright.Judge:\nYour thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.Judge:\n\"Debunk with a bunker buster\"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!Judge:\nIf you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need one chance, correct...?Phoenix:\nUm... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this photo from anyway...? (Changed from [Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...?] in the original release) It's all out of focus!

What does that mean...?Phoenix:\nThe costumed person in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde! (Changed from [The 'Nickel Samurai' in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!] in the original release)Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of this!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI wonder if you would care to elaborate... With actual facts, that is.Phoenix:\nLet's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.Judge:\nHis... His socks... You can see his socks...Phoenix:\nExactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nThere is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)Mia:\nThat's curious...Phoenix:\nHuh? What is?Mia:\nEdgeworth is unusually calm today...Phoenix:\nThat's true...Mia:\nHe's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.Phoenix:\n\"Along for the ride\"...? What do you mean by that?Mia:\nI can only think that perhaps he doesn't feel under attack at all...Phoenix:\n(He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, I haven't damaged his case at all!?)

Where does this leave us!?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nIf the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!Edgeworth:\n... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Edgeworth:\nWright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?Phoenix:\n(Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)Mia:\nDon't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)Judge:\nMr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts.

Do you just pick the first piece of evidence you see?\nMia:\nI can't believe it. I didn't think you would mess up here of all places...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...

What in the world points you to her? (Changed from [And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nFor starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.Judge:\nAnd how does that all add up?Phoenix:\nIt means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!Judge:\nThe knife that was used as a murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nWhy don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?Phoenix:\n(I have to do this now!

I can't believe that Adrian... No way! Not cool and collected Adrian Andrews!Phoenix:\nShe is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... her.Engarde:\nSo after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...Phoenix:\nSee, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.Engarde:\nHmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?Phoenix:\nYes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.Engarde:\nBut... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!Phoenix:\nShe has her own agenda.Engarde:\nH-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?Phoenix:\nI'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.Engarde:\nGet me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?Mia:\nPhoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's missing suicide note, right?Phoenix:\n...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live. (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release) But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...Mia:\n...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.Phoenix:\nAnd that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!Mia:\nThat sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.Phoenix:\nUm, what...?Mia:\nWho was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' dependency issues with regards to Ms. Inpax...?

Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you please.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls the witness subpoenaed by this court. Ms. Adrian Andrews, the person who discovered the crime in Mr. Juan Corrida's room!Edgeworth:\nWhat is your occupation?Andrews:\nI am the manager of the defendant in this case, Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge:\nI see. Now then...Andrews:\nBefore we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.Judge:\nUh, yes, sure. What is it?Andrews:\nI'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly \"magazine\" recently...Judge:\nAh, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of \"Gossip Land\"...Phoenix:\n(If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)Edgeworth:\nAnyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.Andrews:\nYes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.Judge:\nHmm, so it was a \"fry 'n bait\" matter... or was that \"bait 'n fry\"? Reminds me of fishing...Andrews:\nBut I... But I didn't kill him.Edgeworth:\nNo one has accused you of that.Andrews:\nI think there's someone who would beg to differ. (Changed from [I've got a feeling someone will soon...] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nI think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.Edgeworth:\nVery well then.

Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...Edgeworth:\nAnd that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:\nPhoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.Phoenix:\nYes... I know.Mia:\nIn order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pacing. (Changed from [You should disrupt her pace.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nDisrupt her pacing...? (Changed from [Disrupt her pace...?] in the original release)Mia:\nShe's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it.

Then I guess you could say it could not have been taken out of his room, yes?\nAndrews:\nExcuse me? \"It\"...? What are you...?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I thought years of school would have taught you how to construct a sentence. If you can't make a sensible sentence with a subject, then I'll make one for you. Watch.

    "response": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user provided a detailed transcript from the game \"Farewell, My Turnabout\" and is asking which evidence contradicts a specific testimony. The testimony in question is Adrian Andrews' statement about knocking over the flower vase onto the guitar case.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the evidence presented. The key evidence here is the Guitar Case (Evidence 7). The description mentions that there's water only on top of the lid. Adrian's testimony says she knocked the vase over, which would have spilled water onto the guitar case. However, if the vase fell and broke, the water would have soaked into the case and possibly spread around, not just remained on the top. The contradiction here is that if the vase fell onto the guitar case, the water should have gotten inside, but the case's interior isn't wet. This suggests that the vase was placed there after the water had already dried, indicating someone else moved it, which contradicts her testimony of accidentally knocking it over during the incident.\n\nSo, the evidence (Guitar Case, 7) contradicts testimony 5 where she claims she knocked the vase onto the case. The water's presence only on the lid implies the vase wasn't knocked over at the time she described.\n\n{\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 5}",

The moment you've all been waiting for! Who will be this year's Grand Prix Champion? Who will be our \"Hero of Heroes\"!? Will it be last year's runner-up, Jammin' Ninja!? Or maybe Captain Saipan all the way from the lovely tropical island of Saipan!? I see the students of a certain Starry School are raring to win! And Global Hero Onyankopon doesn't want to go home without the prize! We hope Lady Luck is with all our heroes tonight! And now! The winner of the third annual Hero of Heroes Grand Prix... IS ME!!\nWhoooooooooa! The true hero of the night has appeared in our midst! It looks like this year's Grand Prix goes to this fantastic warrior! The Nickel Samurai! Too bad, Jammin' Ninja. Looks like the title eluded you again this year!\nMarch 20, 7:42 PMGatewater HotelViola Hall\nMaya:\nAlright! Yes! Did you hear that, Nick!? Did you!? The Nickel Samurai! He did it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.\nPowers:\nAh, I'm proud of the guy for doing the series justice.\nPearl:\nU-Um... So the person everyone was cheering for... I guess he got the prize?\nMaya:\nYup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? \"The Nickel Samurai\"!\nPearl:\nNo. Every Sunday, I only watch the Educational Channel's \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nOK, that's it! From now on, it's \"The Nickel Samurai\"! All the kids watch it!\nPearl:\nDo you like \"The Nickel Samurai\" too, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nNah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. But I do like \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nHey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed to watch it anymore! You're supposed to act your age and have interests that match. ...It's very important.\nMaya:\nAw, give it a rest, Pearly!\nPowers:\nLooks like I made the right choice in inviting everyone here. I'm glad you're all having a good time.\nMaya:\nAaaaah... It's like a dream!\nPowers:\nToo bad for the Jammin' Ninja, though. Last year, he lost to The Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo. I thought this might be his year...\nMaya:\nYeah... Oh, hey, did anyone else think that the Jammin' Ninja was a bit different today?\nPearl:\nDifferent? What do you mean?\nMaya:\nUm, well, he wasn't carrying his bright red guitar.\nPowers:\nHey, you're right! Strange he'd walk around without his signature guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh* I will never understand these people and their shows...) Anyway, Mr. Powers, thank you very much for tonight.\nPowers:\nA-Aw, it was nothing... I owe you one, so it's just my way of saying thanks.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! It's time to get going to the lobby! There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.\nPowers:\nAnd then, I heard there's going to be a press conference after that.\nPhoenix:\nA press conference? Is he going to make a speech about winning this year's prize?\nPowers:\nUh, well, not exactly... Something about the Nickel Samurai confessing something.\nPhoenix:\nConfessing...? Sounds pretty serious.\nMaya:\nArgh! Nick! COME ON! You don't want us to be the last ones there, do you!?\nPearl:\nYeah, Mr. Nick! Do you!?\nPhoenix:\n(Why me...? The show doesn't even start for another 20 minutes...)\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there.\nPowers:\nAnd behind those doors is an equally grand lobby.\nPearl:\nShall we go and take a look, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nHey, wait up! This grand dessert is calling to me... It's saying, \"Eat me now!\"\nWalls or ceiling\nPhoenix:\nThis sure is one luxurious hotel. Almost to the point of gaudy, with how it blends together everything \"fancy\" imaginable. (Speaking of fancy, didn't that bellboy give me something like that last year?)\nChandelier\nMaya:\nThat chandelier is really something, isn't it?\nPearl:\nI thought it was a kind of space ship...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. How about we get one of these for the office?\nPhoenix:\nOne of those hanging from our poor, weak ceiling? I don't think so.\nTables at back\nMaya:\nIf this is all a dream, I don't ever want to wake up! And all the directors and stars that were here to see the heroes, wow.\nPhoenix:\nI had no idea who most of them were.\nPearl:\nNeither did I.\nMaya:\nNick, you've got to cut that \"news only\" habit out. Your new show is going to be \"The Nickel Samurai!\" Every Sunday morning at 8! Oh, I know! We can watch it together starting next week! I'll come wake you up extra early to make sure, OK?\nPhoenix:\nAh, I'm fine... You know, you really don't have to on my account...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second.\nMaya:\nWell, shows like that are guaranteed to be good, you know?\nFront table\nMaya:\nWhat can I say? This is a really high-class hotel!\nPearl:\nI've never eaten this kind of salad before.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nMaya:\nDon't worry! Any leftovers belong in my happily awaiting stomach anyway!\nPhoenix:\nYou're such a glutton, Maya.\nPowers:\nAh, I lose this one to Maya. You sure can eat.\nMaya:\nWell, a growing girl needs her nutrients!\nPhoenix:\n(A growing girl? Exactly how big do you plan on getting...?)\nTalk\nWill Powers\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much for inviting us today.\nPowers:\nAww, it was nothing really. Guys like us don't get to come to a place like this often, so I thought I'd invite you all.\nMaya:\nHey, Mr. Powers! What have you been up to lately?\nPowers:\nWell, since \"The Pink Princess\" successfully wrapped up last month, I've been on a kid's exercise show... ...while wearing a rabbit mask over my face...\nMaya:\nOh, I see.\nPowers:\nI'm still really sorry about all the headaches I caused you that time, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nAh, well. What's done is done, so let's forget about it. (This is Will Powers. He's an action star. His popularity exploded when he was the Steel Samurai. And he was the first case Maya worked on with me.)\nMaya:\nIt's too bad you look scary, or people'd know you're a real softy who's good with kids. (Changed from [You can't tell by looking at you, but you're a really nice guy with a love of kids.] in the original release)\nPowers:\nUm, thanks. (Changed from [Ah, thanks.] in the original release)\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe they're going to make a movie based on the Nickel Samurai.\nMaya:\nI can't believe it either, but for a different reason!\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai. An epic story of one hero in a desperate fight against his arch-enemy, the Evil Magistrate in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo. And last year, they started a new series, \"The Nickel Samurai\". The new series seems to be a hit with the kids, too.\nPowers:\nI'm really attached to the Steel Samurai as a show, (Changed from [The Steel Samurai is a show I have a lot of strong feelings for,] in the original release) so I was hoping that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one... (Changed from [so I hoped that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nYeah, it's too bad... It'd been [sic] awesome to see you with the new actor, Matt Engarde. (Changed from [Yeah... It's too bad... It'd be great to see you on the show...] in the original release) He's super popular right now. (Changed from [With the new actor, Matt Engarde. He's super popular right now.] in the original release)\nPearl:\nMr. Un-gard...?\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Pearls doesn't know who he is.)\nMaya:\nThis year it's going to be the Nickel Samurai vs. the Jammin' Ninja at the box office!\nPhoenix:\n...Jammin' Ninja...? Who's that again?\nJammin' Ninja (appears after \"The Nickel Samurai\")\nPhoenix:\nSo who is this \"Jammin' Ninja\" again?\nMaya:\nHe's a hero, duh. His symbol is a bright red guitar he's always carrying.\nPhoenix:\n(A ninja who's always carrying around a bright red guitar...? How does that even work!?)\nMaya:\nWith a scarf around his neck and a guitar in hand, he rises to stardom in an ancient time.\nPhoenix:\nA ninja... Who becomes a star??\nMaya:\nYeah! A ninja who becomes a star!\nPowers:\nThere's a strong rivalry between the two of them. Global Studios' Nickel Samurai and Worldwide Studios' Jammin' Ninja. They even air at the same time.\nMaya:\nYou know what I heard? I heard those two don't get along at all. The Nickel Samurai's Engarde and the guy who plays the Jammin' Ninja, I mean.\nPhoenix:\n(The Nickel Samurai speaks French!? Oh, you mean Matt Engarde, the actor...) I guess even the world of heroes isn't a sparkling, happy place.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPowers:\nAh, I really owe you one. If it wasn't for you guys, I don't know what would've happened. What you did... It was a real tight spot I was in, and you fought so hard to get me out. I don't care what happens. I'll never forget everything you've done for me.\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo, you're going to study to become a lawyer too. Am I right or am I right?\nMaya:\nUmm...\nPowers:\nIt must be real tough. There's all those thick books with hard words you have to read...\nMaya:\nUh, um... Well...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, yeah. Mr. Powers doesn't know that Maya's a spirit medium...)\nMaya:\nI thought he'd be able to tell by my clothes.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he thinks that you've got some strange hobby on the side or something.\nMaya:\n...Hey, wait a sec. What's that's supposed to mean!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo are you Maya's little sister?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but no.\nPowers:\nOh, then you must be Mr. Wright's little sister!\nPearl:\nAgain, I'm sorry, but...\nPowers:\nThen... Whose little sister are you?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but I'm an only child.\nPowers:\nOh, I see... S-Sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(Pearl looks so sad... She looks really sorry too...)\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, they're all shocked because then they figure out who I am.\nMaya:\nHmm... Well, I don't think you look scary.\nPearl:\nMe either. I think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Those two are making Mr. Powers tear up...)\nAnything else\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Thanks for taking the time to take it out and show it to me, but I'm really sorry, I don't know a thing about it.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nPhoenix:\nWow, what is with this place? Looks like I've stumbled into Oz or something. Way in the back, there's a sign for the bathroom. Maybe I should visit it while I can before the show starts... (Changed from [I bet we have a little time to look around before the show starts...] in the original release)\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...? Could it be that there's an action star who has a soft spot for teddy bears...? ...Nah, can't be.\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". \"Juan Corrida\"... His name just sounds like a star's name. I've heard it before, but I don't know anything about him at all.\nEnd of hallway\nPhoenix:\nThere are toilets in each room in this hotel, but since all sorts of events are held here, there are bathrooms for people who aren't staying here to use as well. Perfect for people like me, who can't afford a stay here in the first place...\nFlowers on right\nPhoenix:\n\"To Mr. Engarde From the Global Studio Staff\" Ah, it'd be nice if lawyers got flowers too. Something like, \"To Mr. Wright From All Your Grateful Clients\".\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\". \"Matt Engarde\"... I've heard that name before. Oh, yeah. Maya's always yammering about him like the obsessed fan she is...\nViola Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Viola Hall and visiting Hallway)\nPowers:\nSounds like the post-ceremony show is about to start.\nMaya:\nAlright! I'm so pumped! I wonder if he's going to show off his special move today? \"Nickel Samurai Smelting!\"\nPowers:\nActually, what I'm interested in most is the press conference.\nMaya:\nYou mean the \"big confession\" the Nickel Samurai's going to make after the show? So what is it? Don't you know what it's about, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nUh, well, I'm not the Steel Samurai anymore, so I don't have any idea.\nMaya:\nBah.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Ah, so I guess you are all going to the press conference then?\nMaya:\nYeah, of course!\nPowers:\nIf that's the case, then here, take these tickets so you can get in.\nPress Conference Ticket added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much. Well, let's get going to the lobby.\nPearl:\nIt looks like it's over this way, Mr. Nick!\nMaya:\nOK! For great justice!\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPowers:\nThey called this so suddenly that something about it just seems off, you know?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the press conference?\nPowers:\nYeah. He said, \"There's something I'd like to confess if I win.\" I heard he faxed his request for a conference in to the office only yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nYesterday... (Yeah, that is kind of sudden.)\nPowers:\nBut I guess his manager set everything up somehow, so he was lucky.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Nice manager.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Only a really gaudy hotel would have such a large, gaudy lobby to match.\nPearl:\nAh, I think they're going to have the post-ceremony show over there.\nPhoenix:\nThey're using a compact stage, I see.\nMaya:\nOoh... I'm all ready to use my special \"Samurai Power\".\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks like she's ready to start a fight...)\nPA Notice:\nYour attention please, your attention please. The Nickel Samurai's Post-Ceremony Stage Show will not be held tonight due to unforeseen circumstances.\nMaya:\nWHAAAT!? WHYYYYY!?\nPhoenix:\nOww! You didn't have to pinch me! Pinch yourself if you don't believe it!\nPA Notice:\nWe are asking for everyone's cooperation at this time. So please stay where you are. ...This is a special request from the police.\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nP-Police? Did they just say the police?\nPowers:\nD-Do you want me to go check out what's going on?\nPhoenix:\nUm, wait, I'll come with you...\n???:\nFreeze! You two! Didn't you hear the announcement just now!? It just finished telling you not to move!\nMaya:\nTh-That voice... I've heard that voice somewhere before...\n???:\nHonestly, youth these days can't be bothered to listen to other people when they talk! Just the other day it was the same thing! There was a small footbridge with a sign next to it that said, \"Beware, Bridge Out!\" And along comes a snot-nosed little punk kid right up to the bridge. I tried to tell the boy the bridge was out and it was dangerous, but would he listen!? No, of course not! He said he'd be careful and only walk on the \"in\" part of the bridge since the \"out\" part is what was dangerous! I am not kidding you here! The kid said that and really meant it! WELL! I really let him have it then, and knocked him clear off of that bridge! Honestly, kids these days don't know right from wrong, I tell you!\nPowers:\nThis non-stop chatter...\nPhoenix:\nI-It can't be... ...Ms. Oldbag?\n???:\n...\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, you young whipper-snappers!? Do I know you!? ...Wait. YOU! You're Powers, aren't you!?\nPowers:\nY-Yeah. Um, about what happened back then...\nOldbag:\nYou didn't even get nominated this year, did you? (Changed from [You didn't get nominated last year either, did you?] in the original release) Oh, that's right. You're doing that children's exercise program, trying to play nice.\nPowers:\nAh, yeah, that's me. Thankfully I still have a job...\nOldbag:\nI love that show, and you're a hoot! You're the \"big brother\" character, right? Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You're that giant rabbit! (Changed from [Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You ended up with a rabbit face.] in the original release) What a work of art, but that's how it is, you know? I mean, if you didn't wear the mask, who knows how many TVs you'd break? Really, and shame on those kids exercising around you. They're getting what they deserve. This is why I thought you shouldn't be anywhere...\nPhoenix:\nUm... What are you doing here?\nOldbag:\nLook at my uniform and tell me you can't tell I'm a member of security!\nMaya:\nBut that outfit...\nOldbag:\nAnnoying, noisy brats get the blaster!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nSecond floor\nMaya:\nWow, it looks like there's a fancy restaurant on the second floor!\nPhoenix:\nYou STILL feel like eating?\nMaya:\nI mean, since we're here, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't pull the \"since we're here\" trick on me...)\nPearl:\nWhat a beautiful mansion. Do you live in this wonderful world every day, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, this is my first time in a place like this.\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to say these cameras were set up to cover the post-ceremony stage show.\nMaya:\nBut I wonder where everyone's gone, abandoning their cameras like this...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess something big must have happened...)\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage for the post-ceremony stage show.\nPowers:\nThere was supposed to be a press meeting after the show, but now...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like no one will hear what the Nickel Samurai had to confess after all.\nSeats\nMaya:\nWe're here, so we might as well take some pictures. OK, everyone, sit in a chair!\nPhoenix:\nBut we're all out of film...\nMaya:\nDon't worry about it. There's a zillion cameras over there we can borrow.\nPhoenix:\nHey, hey! You can't just go and \"borrow\" an expensive professional camera like that!\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nMaya:\nWhat incident? What did you do?\nOldbag:\nI didn't do anything, you young'un! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I plead the fifth.\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me!?\nOldbag:\nI thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.\nMaya:\nYou? A bodyguard?\nOldbag:\nFor your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles.\nMaya:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth?\nOldbag:\nBut...\nEdgeworth:\nThat sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me.\nOldbag:\nThat's what he said to me. What did I ever do to deserve that!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nWhat happened?\nMaya:\nUm... So, did something happen?\nOldbag:\nI don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those \"incidents\" happened again.\nPowers:\nA-An \"incident\"? Like a \"murder\" kind of \"incident\"?\nOldbag:\nMaybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, showers of blood are sure to follow. Bet you didn't know that! (Changed from [So wherever I go, a rain of blood will come pouring down. Bet you didn't know that!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUm, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake?\nOldbag:\nSilence, whippersnapper!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nThese eyes of mine are real pros now!\nPhoenix:\n\"Pros\"? Pros at doing what?\nOldbag:\nAt doing police work, of course! My eyes are like a hawk! And my professional eyes spot a messy incident! A messy, bloody incident! That's why I don't have time for you meddling kids and your petty little things!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\n...Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it? I don't like that devilish smile playing on your lips...\nMaya:\nLet's make like we're going to the bathroom, and check things out!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way. The police told us not go [sic] anywhere, remember?\nMaya:\nHuh!? How B-O-R-I-N-G! You're such a boring guy! You've got no motivation! No spirit!\nPearl:\nHuh? What? What's going on? Are you giving Mystic Maya trouble again, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Not you too, Pearls... Please don't stick your little nose into this one...)\nMaya:\nSo listen to this, Pearly. This one time at lawyer camp, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nO-OK! I get it! Let's go take a look.\nMaya:\nYay! I know you couldn't say no to me, Nick!\nPearl:\nThat's right. You'd walk over miles of hot coals for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That would be EVERY time we work a case together...)\nMaya:\nWell, what are we waiting for? Let's go already! You can come along too, Pearly.\nPearl:\nGoody! I get to come! I get to come!\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nThere's nothing really out of the ordinary here...\nPearl:\nAre you looking for the \"in-si-dent\" that the old lady was talking about? (Changed from [Are you looking for the 'something' that the old lady was talking about?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't look like it happened here. Well, we'd better go look somewhere else.\nMaya:\nAlright! Then, let's try...\nBellboy:\nExcuse me.\nMaya:\nAck!\nBellboy:\nAre you by chance, Ms. Maya Fey?\nMaya:\nUm, yeah... That's me.\nBellboy:\nYou have a phone call waiting for you at the front desk.\nMaya:\nA call? I wonder if it's someone from Kurain Village...\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mystic Maya?\nMaya:\nOh, nothing. You guys go on ahead and I'll be right there, OK? (Changed from [Oh, nothing. I'll just go on ahead to check it out, OK?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nOK.\nBellboy:\nRight this way, Ms. Fey.\nPearl:\nLet's go look somewhere else now, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, OK.\nPearl:\nThis is a little exciting... And a little scary...\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of.\nChandelier\nPearl:\nSo, that's called a \"shan-deh leer\", right?\nPhoenix:\nYup.\nPearl:\nWhat is that for? What does it do?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's for lighting up a room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? Can I look down now? My neck hurts...\nTables at the back\nPhoenix:\nThey haven't cleaned up all the food yet. There's a sad feeling hanging in the air now that the party is over...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nIt's a feast fit for a king!\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPearl:\nIt was the first time I ate that food. What was it called again? I think it started with \"key\". Key... Wee?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, a \"kiwi\".\nPearl:\nI don't know what to say. It's a sweet but sour fruit all in one.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nHotel Lobby\nExamine\nSecond floor\nPhoenix:\nA lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. But right now, the only thing filling this enormous room is anxiety about the murder. ...I really hope nothing else bad happens here...\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nThese cameras must belong to the press that came to cover the conference. They're all basically doing the same thing: staring at the empty stage.\nSeats\nPhoenix:\nSeats for the spectators of the post-ceremony show and the press conference. But it's too bad neither event is going to be held now.\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nPearl:\nUm, I guess you must have done something... um... \"deh-plor-ible\"...\nOldbag:\n\"Deplorable!?\" I would never do such a thing! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I plead the fifth.\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me!?\nOldbag:\nI thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.\nPearl:\n\"Body...guard?\"\nOldbag:\nFor your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles.\nPhoenix:\n(She's not talking about Edgeworth, is she...?)\nOldbag:\nBut...\nEdgeworth:\nThat sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me.\nOldbag:\nThat's what he said to me. What did I ever do to deserve that!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nWhat happened?\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, but what in the world just happened?\nOldbag:\nI don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those \"incidents\" happened again.\nPowers:\nA-An \"incident\"? Like a \"murder\" kind of \"incident\"?\nOldbag:\nMaybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, showers of blood are sure to follow. Bet you didn't know that! (Changed from [So wherever I go, a rain of blood will come pouring down. Bet you didn't know that!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUm, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake?\nOldbag:\nSilence, whippersnapper!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nI.

Just ya wait! It'll be all over the morning paper! \"Scruffy Detective's Secret Scandal Revealed!\" You'll see!

Detective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, help a guy out! Tell her that only the police are allowed here! This is the scene of a murder, so she should leave this to us pros...\nPearl:\nA... A murder!?\nGumshoe:\nAw, shoot! Me and my big mouth!\nLotta:\nSee! I knew it! My gut instinct told me so! I always trust my gut! A murder, it said! And that's what it is! A genuine murder!\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, wait...\nYeehaw, a murder! Of a big star, no less!\nGumshoe:\nOh, man... I'm in trouble now...\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nSo... Detective Gumshoe... A murder...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, no, that's not it. I got my facts mixed up for a second there, pal.\nPearl:\nU-Um... Mr. Nick? Is the dead person the Nickel Samurai...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Why do you ask?\nPearl:\nWell, Mystic Maya was rooting for him, so...\nGumshoe:\nIt wasn't the Nickel Samurai that got bumped. Actually, the Nickel Samurai is the one under suspicion of doing the bumping off...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nThe guy that died was this hero named the Jammin' Ninja, pal.\nPhoenix:\nThe Jammin' Ninja...\nLotta Hart\nPearl:\nUm, that woman with the big puffy hair that looks like cotton candy...\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Lotta?\nPearl:\nThat woman... She was there that time too, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat time?\nPearl:\n...When Mystic Maya did that channeling...\nPhoenix:\nOh, that time... Well, Lotta's a journalist, so that's why she was there.\nPearl:\nJer-nal-ist...\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like she was hanging around here before the murder happened.\nPhoenix:\n\"Hanging around\"...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, hiding in wait in front of the Jammin' Ninja's door, pal.\nPhoenix:\nB-But why would she...?\nGumshoe:\nShe wouldn't tell me, pal. Just said something about \"Gettin' my big scoop\"...\nPhoenix:\n(Scoop? What sort of news could she be after...?)\nThe victim (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nSo the victim was the Jammin' Ninja?\nPearl:\nMr. Jammin' Ninja...?\nGumshoe:\nHe was on a really popular rival TV show to \"The Nickel Samurai\".\nPearl:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nThe victim was the action star, Juan Corrida. He got a huge push and rode the express train to stardom. I mean, even I know who he is!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, even I recognize his face...)\nGumshoe:\nBut I heard lately that Matt Engarde's been taking the wind out of his sail. I'm telling you, pal, as far as who's popular, those two are hogging all the limelight.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess there's no space for Mr. Powers at all, huh... Poor guy...)\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde... Um... That's the Nickel Samurai, right...?\nGumshoe:\nYup. I mean, no! You've got to say it with more umph! \"The Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n...Anyway, so now that Juan Corrida's gone, that means Mr. Engarde has the whole stage to himself, wouldn't you say?\nGumshoe:\nI wouldn't bet on it, pal. We can't have that happen, you know?\nPhoenix:\n\"Can't have that happen\"? (What's that supposed to mean, I wonder...)\nArrested? (appears after presenting Matt Engarde profile)\nPhoenix:\nWh-Why was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's not something I can tell you. We just started the investigation, so we don't want any leaks.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like yet another \"Steel Samurai\" hero is in hot water...)\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick... If Mystic Maya knew about this...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know. She'd make me take this case... I know...\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI was really shocked by what happened to her in that one case. I didn't know she had such an awesome power!\nPearl:\nAwesome power...?\nGumshoe:\nI thought maybe I should do some self-improvement and take up a hobby. So I went out and bought some Morning Glory seeds and planted them, pal.\nPhoenix:\n...That's a good way to improve yourself.\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. Well, it's nothing really...\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nThat girl is number three on my \"People I've Seen A Lot Of Lately\" list.\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then who's number one...?\nGumshoe:\nAs if you need to ask. It's YOU, pal!\nPhoenix:\nA-Ah... So who's number two?\nGumshoe:\nMaya Fey. ...But it looks like she's not around this time.\nPearl:\nIt must be nice to be such good friends with each other, isn't it Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think that's the real meaning of Detective Gumshoe's list...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nI look good! I think I've lost some weight, pal!\nPhoenix:\nIt's only wishful thinking.\nGumshoe:\nWishful thinking, huh? ... In that case, I wishfully think I've lost some weight!\nPhoenix:\n(I wishfully think he might face the facts one day...)\nGumshoe:\nLately, I've been on the instant noodles only diet, pal!\nJuan Corrida profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm not a real fan of action shows or anything... But I know who Juan Corrida and Matt Engarde are.\nPhoenix:\nYou can't talk about one without talking about the other, I guess.\nGumshoe:\nThey even debuted around the same time. So they have this real fiery rivalry with each other. Kinda like you and me, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(I never knew he thought of me as a rival...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nThe Nickel Samurai! He really took the Grand Prix tonight!\nPhoenix:\nMaya's a big fan of his.\nGumshoe:\nReally? ...Oh, I'm sorry then.\nPearl:\nWhy are you sorry?\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde was just arrested, pal. ...On suspicion of murdering Juan Corrida.\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nAny evidence\nPhoenix:\nWould you take a look at this for me?\nGumshoe:\nListen, pal... I'm not leaking any info about the evidence to you this time. If I do, my salary's really gonna get it... And then I won't even be able to get those instant noodles down at the discount market!\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nDo you know this person?\nGumshoe:\nYou meet a lot of people as a detective, pal. So we make extra sure to not forget people because that's our job. ...Now, having said that, I don't remember ever seeing this person before.\nPearl:\nWhich means that you're kind of forgetful, aren't you Mr. Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThat's not what it means... Not exactly anyway...\nAfter clearing \"The victim\" and \"Arrested?\" Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Hallway:\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPowers:\nHey! So what's going on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Juan Corrida has been killed.\nPowers:\nWh-Wh-What!? Juan is... He's...!?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde.\nPowers:\nY-You're joking, right!?\nPhoenix:\nNope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja.\nPowers:\nOoogh... Not again... I feel sick.\nPearl:\n\"Again\"...?\nPhoenix:\n...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls.\nPowers:\nI still can't believe... No way... No way Matt would...\nPhoenix:\n(...? What's Mr. Powers got in his hand...?)\nPowers:\n...Oh, before I forget... This... This is for you, Mr. Wright. I got this from the bellboy that came by earlier.\nRadio Transceiver received from Mr. Powers.\nPhoenix:\n...For me...? But why?\nPowers:\nI don't know. All he said was it was for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney.\nTalk\nMatt and Juan\nPowers:\nMatt is the most energetic and active actor out there right now. The Nickel Samurai really sealed his place as a pop idol, but... he kept adding fuel to the fire of his rivalry with Juan anyway.\nPearl:\nMr. Juan... He's the Jammin' Ninja, right?\nPowers:\nThose two would butt heads over everything they could think of. But I'd say that Matt was the one who almost always came out on top.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess some people only know how to relate to others by butting heads like a ram...)\nPowers:\nJuan said that he'd take Matt on this time too, so he joined a rival TV show.\nPearl:\nAnd that was \"The Jammin' Ninja\"...?\nPowers:\nThe stylish Nickel Samurai and the burning Jammin' Ninja... Well, things turned messy real fast with those two using their shows for their \"war\". And the final tally... Look around... It's pretty obvious how things ended up.\nPhoenix:\n(Matt even won the Grand Prix this year... The final win over his rival, I guess...)\nPress conference\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde was going to hold a press conference, wasn't he?\nPowers:\nThat's what I heard. Though if you wanted to get technical about it, it was the Nickel Samurai's conference.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai's...?\nPowers:\nYeah. He was supposed to wear his costume and give the press conference that way.\nPhoenix:\nHe was going to be in costume...? But why? (Changed from [So he was supposed to be in-costume...? But why?] in the original release)\nPowers:\nI'm not sure... They don't keep me in the loop anymore.\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nPowers:\nIt was almost right after you guys left. An old man who's a bellboy at this hotel showed up.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when he told you to give this to me...?\nPowers:\nYeah...\nPhoenix:\n(Why... Why give me this transceiver...?)\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nHey, where did Maya go off to?\nPhoenix:\nShe got a phone call.\nPowers:\nOh yeah, that's right. She was heading for the front desk just now. She sure stands out in a crowd, doesn't she?\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, then they're all shocked because they figure out who I am...\nPearl:\nI think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Mr. Powers is getting teary eyed.)\nJuan Corrida profile\nPowers:\nHe debuted around the same time as Matt in everything, you know.\nPearl:\nReally?\nPowers:\nYeah, it started out small... First it was singing contests, then swimming competitions... Then it was bowling tournaments, and then it was who could throw the best New Year's parties... Juan was always trying to one-up Matt. But lately, those two were escalating to more and more dangerous things... I thought that no good would come of it all, so I began to worry.\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad Juan's story ended so soon...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nPowers:\nMatt's younger than me, but you can practically see his star potential.\nPearl:\nHis star po-ten-shial...?\nPowers:\nI got his autograph the other day.\nPhoenix:\n...Feels kind of wrong now, doesn't it?\nPowers:\nI don't care what people say! Matt didn't kill Juan! I know he didn't!\nAny other profile\nPowers:\nUmm... I'm honored you're asking me, But I have no idea who this person is. Umm... Sorry...\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPearl:\nUm... I was just wondering... Where's Mystic Maya? She's been gone a long time.\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, she was only going to answer a phone call...)\nPearl:\nMaybe she got lost. I'll take a quick look around for her.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nPearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I... I'm not sure... (It's coming from this transceiver...) (Changed from [Did this transceiver just...?] in the original release)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, hello? Wright here...\n???:\nIs this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney?\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are...!?\n???:\nYou don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMaya:\nHeeelp! Niiiiick!\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\nMaya...?\n???:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Wouldn't you agree that the more important issue is the fate of the girl?\nPhoenix:\n(Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?) Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?\n???:\nCome now. Don't fall apart on me yet.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This... No! This can't be!)\n???:\nNow that I have your attention, Mr. Attorney, I have a modest proposal for you. If you do what I require, then I will return to you your valuable \"item\" unharmed. ...What is this called again in your fancy lawyer terms?\nPhoenix:\n...\"Kidnapping for ransom\"...\n???:\nYes, that's it. This is a kidnapping.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nPhoenix:\n(M-My sight... Everything's fading away... Maya... Maya... Maya's been kidnapped!)\n???:\n...--re you there? Mr. Attorney, are you there? (Changed from [You there? Mr. Wright, are you there?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nH-How much!? How much do you want!?\n???:\nVery good, Mr. Attorney. I'm glad you have such a good grasp of the situation.\nPhoenix:\nHurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya--\n???:\nMoney is not what I seek.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\n???:\nWhat I want is a certain verdict. I would like a complete acquittal.\nPhoenix:\nComplete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!?\n???:\nI am not the person you will be representing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\n???:\nYou are currently at the Gatewater Hotel, are you not? And I know that a murder has just taken place there.\nPhoenix:\nJuan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde...\n???:\nYou are, as expected, quite on top of things, Mr. Attorney. Now then. What I want is very simple. I want you to obtain a complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nM-Matt Engarde? But why?\n???:\nHe did not kill anyone. I can attest to that. However...\nPhoenix:\nH-However!? However what!?\n???:\nHowever, someone is framing him for the murder. A very smart someone who is setting him up to take the fall...\nPhoenix:\n... (If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?)\n???:\nYou are, of course, at liberty to take me at my word or not. (Changed from [You are, of course, at liberty to believe me or not.] in the original release) However, there is one thing you can take as fact. Right now, your very precious \"item\" is with me, in my possession.\nMaya:\nMmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\n???:\nYou have two days. Of course, tonight, he will be in questioning with the police. But the trial is in two days. At that trial, you will win a not guilty verdict. Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nO-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!?\n???:\nYes, exactly. I don't believe I was wrong in choosing you, so don't let me down.\nPhoenix:\nAagh!\n???:\nOh, yes, that's right. Now that I am playing the role of the kidnapper, I can't pass up this chance to say, \"And don't even think about callin' the cops!\" ...Hmm, not great, but you get the idea.\nPhoenix:\nD-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!?\n???:\nAlright, I'll tell you that much. My name is... ...De Killer.\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Wh-Where is Mystic Maya!?\nPhoenix:\n...She's been kidnapped.\nPearl:\nN-No... ... It's all my fault! If only I had gone with Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault, Pearls.\nPearl:\nBut it is! It is! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nPowers:\nMr. Wright... I think we... I think we should tell the police what it's [sic] going on...!\nPhoenix:\n(No! We can't do that! If we do, who knows what will happen to Maya...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What about the detective we saw earlier...?\nPhoenix:\n(...Detective Gumshoe!) Yes, that's it! Wait here, and I'll be right back!\nPowers:\nAlright! I'll take care of Pearl while you're away!\nHallway\nGumshoe:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANSOM!?\nPhoenix:\nShhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nGumshoe:\nWait, the deal is \"complete acquittal\" in exchange for Maya, you mean...? Then this means Matt Engarde is obviously the killer, pal! No doubt about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent...\nGumshoe:\nYou really believe what a KIDNAPPER tells you, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd on top of everything else, there's all this evidence we keep finding.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nThe forensics team's having a field day back there. (Changed from [The guys with the eagle eyes are really lapping it up like they just caught a huge fish.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nGumshoe:\nBut it's strange. There's so much evidence that it feels like something's wrong.\nPhoenix:\nThere's too much evidence? Is that possible? (Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being \"set-up\"...?)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, looks like you won't be leaving here tonight, pal. Just sit tight and cooperate with the investigation. Tomorrow you can start yours.\nPhoenix:\n...A-Alright... (Isn't there another way...?)\nGumshoe:\nWe've also got to be careful about pushing the kidnapper the wrong way.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right...\nDate:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0???\nMaya:\nNnngh... Oww, my head... (Wh-Where... Where am I!? I wonder if I'm still in that hotel... Wh-What happened to me...?) Nick... Pearly! ... (Come on, you guys. This isn't funny anymore...)\n...*ka-click*...\n???:\nI see you have awoken.\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you!?\n???:\nMe? ...I am known as \"De Killer\".\nMaya:\n\"D-De Killer\"!? You mean like an \"ASSASSIN\"!? (I... I'm too young to die!)\n???:\nDon't worry. You are not my target. ...For now anyway.\nMaya:\nA-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nick! Nick! Where are you!? ...Help me...\n???:\nYes, that's right. Only one person can save you now, and that is Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\n...Huh? Wh-What? Nick... Nick's going to save me...?\n???:\nCalm down and be a good girl. Think of this as a business transaction.\nMaya:\nA... A business transaction?\n???:\nI am going to contact him now. I hope you'll cooperate and play your assigned role well.\nMaya:\n...Nick... What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearly... (Changed from [What's going to happen to me? Nick...

What if he... ...is the real murderer? What would you do then, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWould you fight to get a not guilty for a murderer to save Mystic Maya...?\nPhoenix:\nPearls...

We're...\nEngarde:\nOh, sorry dude...\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nI already signed up...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me...?\nEngarde:\nI already have life insurance. I signed up a long time ago cause my job is, you know...\nPhoenix:\n... Oh! No no no... We're not insurance salespeople!\nEngarde:\nReally...? Dude, I really don't need that right now either.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nFire extinguishers. I mean, this building isn't my house, so...\nPhoenix:\n... No no no... We're not here to sell you fire extinguishers either! I'm a lawyer. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nEngarde:\nA lawyer...? ... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my manager, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nThe Nickel Samurai sure is a strange person, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(I think \"strange\" is an understatement.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. You're just in time.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\nEngarde:\nYou're a lawyer dude, right? My manager's looking for a good one right now, so how about it?\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! This is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to make him let me take his case! I have to!)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera. Mr. Engarde keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nSorry to intrude, but I would like to ask you a few personal questions.\nEngarde:\nUm, that's OK, but dude, my autobiography's coming out soon, so... If I say stuff without the publisher's approval, then I'm gonna be in real hot water... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my publisher, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde is so lucky! He has so many people he can talk to.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... I don't know if he actually has anyone he can really talk to...)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. Like I thought, the publisher said it'd be \"real bad\" if I said anything, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(Does he have a mind of his own!?)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, I would like to ask you about the murder...\nEngarde:\nOh, are you covering this for a tabloid as a side job, dude? Um, um... Well, if you want my statement on this, you should ask through my staff...\nPhoenix:\nNo no no... I'm not asking on behalf of a tabloid...\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the president of the studio, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nIs he alright, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(If we're talking about Mr. Engarde's brain here, I wouldn't put my money on it.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. The studio president said, \"Even Neo Mt. Fuji itself knows that I'm not the murderer!\"\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? What's \"Neo Mt. Fuji\"...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a mountain in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo; the city the Nickel Samurai protects.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, this is an attorney's badge.\nEngarde:\nDude, I'm sorry, but I don't have the free time to be looking at things like that.\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nEngarde:\nI'm much too busy with Nickel Samurai stuff right now.\nEngarde:\nI don't have the time to take a lawyer's correspondence course...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does he believe I'm a salesman!? Insurance, then extinguishers... Now this!!)\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\n...? What's that?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a ticket for the press conference. You were going to give one after winning the Grand Prix, right?\nEngarde:\nHuh? Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. While you were in costume, no less. ([in costume] hyphenated in the original release)\nEngarde:\nUm, I never heard anything like that, dude. I only heard about the stage show. I always leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't know...? That's odd...)\nRadio Transceiver\nPearl:\n...Mr. Nick? What are you going to do with that?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know yet, but I figured I could at least show it to him...\nEngarde:\nIs that a transceiver? Hey, it looks like a real nice one, too.\nPhoenix:\nI got it as a \"present\" from someone.\nEngarde:\nHmm? Interesting.\nPhoenix:\nI've also been instructed to take your case.\nEngarde:\nIs that what you heard from the transceiver?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nEngarde:\nDude, that's terrible! Don't let some disembodied voice boss you around!\nPhoenix:\n(This coming from a man with a cell phone on his wrist...)\nWill Powers profile\nEngarde:\nI've seen him somewhere before... Is he a member of my fan club?\nPhoenix:\nThat's Mr. Powers. Isn't he supposed to be kind of like a mentor to you?\nEngarde:\nPowers...? Oh yeah! He's the guy on that kid's exercise program. I gave him an autograph just the other day.\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't see Mr. Powers as a mentor at all...)\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nMan, it's too bad he's dead...\nPhoenix:\nYou killed him... That's the most logical conclusion, don't you agree?\nEngarde:\nDude, what are you talking about!? You're making a huge mistake.\nPhoenix:\nIf that's such a mistake, then why did they issue an arrest warrant for you!?\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the guy in charge of this place, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nStars sure know a lot of people, don't they?\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that phone even really gets reception in here...)\nEngarde:\n...Um, I guess you're right about the warrant after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we might be making some progress here!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nEngarde:\nYeah... I'm such a handsome devil.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um, yeah...\nEngarde:\nAnd I'm way good at sports! Karate, tennis, judo, soccer, football, hockey, fencing... Dude, it's no wonder I'm so popular.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um, yeah... (You're also good at sitting in a jail cell, Mr. Popular.)\nAny other evidence\nEngarde:\nDude, I know I like to throw money around, but it's not like I buy anything and everything.\nPhoenix:\n(That's nice, because it's not up for sale anyway!)\nAny other profile\nEngarde:\nUm, dude, this person looks like a member of my fan club. Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the fan club president, OK? ... ...\nPhoenix:\nUm, \"dude\", you know what...? Forget I asked...\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Press Conference Ticket and Radio Transceiver:\nEngarde:\n... ...Well, dude, I think it's about time for me to get going.\nPhoenix:\nPlease, wait! ...I really need to take your case!\nEngarde:\nThere's always other people in need of a lawyer, right? Want me to introduce you to a few?\nPearl:\nPlease! Please let Mr. Nick represent you!\nEngarde:\nMan, oh man. Lawyers these days. Now you dudes use kids to pull in clients, too?\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't take me as your lawyer, then De Killer is going to...!\nEngarde:\n... Wait... What did you just say?\nPhoenix:\n\"De Killer\"...\nEngarde:\nD-De Killer!?\nPhoenix:\n(...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...)\nEngarde:\n... Alright, dude. I accept your terms.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEngarde:\nI'll let you represent me in court.\nPearl:\nW-We did it! We did it, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...)\nEngarde:\nGo ahead, ask me anything. I'll help out as much as I can...\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nEngarde:\nMan, I thank my lucky stars that people know my name.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're quite the hero, and you're in the national spotlight.\nPearl:\nI didn't know who he is... Does that mean I'm not a good citizen...?\nEngarde:\nAh, it's really great to be the Nickel Samurai. Dude, lately, I just keep on getting more and more popular.\nPhoenix:\n(True enough... \"The Nickel Samurai\" is very popular among high schoolers and secretaries right now. I guess Mr. Engarde has a way of catching the eyes of women...)\nEngarde:\nDo you know my motto? \"Refreshing like a spring breeze.\" That's what I am.\nPearl:\nA spring breeze...\nEngarde:\nThat's why this kind of scandal is disastrous, dude. I mean, even if I get out of here tomorrow, it's still gonna look bad.\nPhoenix:\n(But everyone loves a good scandal...) (Changed from [Everyone loves a good scandal...] in the original release)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me about your activities last night?\nEngarde:\nAfter I got the award, I took a break and went back to my room. I had that post-ceremony stage show to do. So I was in my Nickel Samurai costume.\nPhoenix:\nAnd you were alone the entire time?\nEngarde:\nMy manager was running around being busy, so yeah.\nPhoenix:\nBecause of the press conference you were supposed to have after the show?\nEngarde:\nI told you, dude. I have no idea about any press conference, alright?\nPhoenix:\n(That's strange... I thought the Nickel Samurai was going to confess something...)\nEngarde:\nAnyway, when I was leaving my room, that's when I noticed it was kinda noisy...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida was already dead at that time...?\nEngarde:\nYeah, that's what I gathered anyway from my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm beginning to gather that this guy can't do a thing on his own...) (Changed from [With the way he's always talking about his manager, it's as if she runs his life.] in the original release)\nEngarde:\nAnd that's when the detective in the green coat showed up. He searched me... And then, out of the blue, the dude arrested me.\nThe victim (appears after \"Matt Engarde\")\nPhoenix:\nAbout you and the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida, what sort of...\nEngarde:\nThat's got nothing to do with anything, dude. Man, with that face of his, you can't even tell he's the same age as me. And he wanted to try making a \"Jammin' Ninja\" movie, even though we all know it'd fail.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai still won in the end, right?\nEngarde:\nYeah. I took the Grand Prix by storm. So why would I, the winner, have any reason to kill the guy anyway? Dude, you'd think it'd be the other way around, you know?\nThe charge of murder (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know why you were arrested?\nEngarde:\nI guess maybe my full body search went badly.\nPhoenix:\nDid they find something on you?\nEngarde:\nThey found a button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nPhoenix:\nA button...?\nEngarde:\nI don't get it either. It was caught in the pleats of my samurai pants, or \"hakama\".\nPearl:\nAaah!\nEngarde:\nDude, I really think someone planted it there though. I'm serious.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that's what really happened...?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nPearl:\nLet's ask one last thing. Let's test Mr. Engarde to see if he really is innocent or not...\nPhoenix:\nW-We can do that...?\nPearl:\nYes. If you use this...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's Magatama!)\nPearl:\nHe won't be able to hide any secrets from you, Mr. Nick. I'm sure of it.\nPhoenix:\n(I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly.\nEngarde:\nWhat is it, dude?\nPhoenix:\nDid you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nPlease put the phone away and answer this question yourself.\nEngarde:\nAlright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWell, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nNothing. Not a chain or lock in sight.\nPearl:\nWhich means... I think it is alright to trust him.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.)\nEngarde:\nUm... The trial's tomorrow, right? I'm counting on you, dude.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 21, 11:34 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWell, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important...\nPearl:\nSo! So now what should we do!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer.\nPearl:\nOK! Then let's start looking!\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Actually, the crime happened at the recently completed hotel in the center of town, the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. ...Just how far are they going to expand their empire...?\nCharley the plant\nPearl:\nOh! I'll water it!\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK... I already did that...\nPearl:\n...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...)\nPoster\nPearl:\nThis is the Nickel Samurai... right?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's right.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!?\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.\nPearl:\nOh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either...\nPhoenix:\nI-It's OK, Pearls. Really.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh! I cleaned it up some more for you last night! ...Because I couldn't sleep...\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSince there were no Psyche-Locks, then that means we can trust Mr. Engarde to be innocent.\nPearl:\nI really feel much better knowing that. Ever since last night, I was so worried that I kept wondering... \"What if he is the real killer...? What then...?\"\nAny ideas\nPhoenix:\nHey, I have something I want to ask you, Pearls.\nPearl:\nOK, what is it?\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you so interested in how Maya and I get along? I mean, she and I don't have anything special go--\nPearl:\nHuh!? Wh-What do you mean!? B-But I thought... I thought you and Mystic Maya were... I-I've been mistaken all this time!? No way...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aaaah! She really wasn't kidding! Pearls actually believes Maya and I are... ...Maybe I should've just left it alone...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Stop it! Don't hide your true feelings from me!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! She slapped me!!)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPearl:\nThat's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nI guess?\nPearl:\nI feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...)\nMaya Fey profile\nPearl:\nOh, Mystic Maya... I wonder if you're alright...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure she's OK. We have to be patient for just one more day. I'm sure we can save her. Trust me.\nPearl:\nIf there's anything I can do, please tell me, OK!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPearl:\nTo tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me.\nPhoenix:\nI think your hair now suits you perfectly.\nPearl:\nR-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget*\nPhoenix:\n*fidget, fidget*\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPearl:\nI'm sure that Mr. Detective would be our ally if we asked!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I think so too. (Looking back, we've known each other for a while now... He's always been trustworthy... A bit \"off\", but still trustworthy. What a paradox.)\nWill Powers profile\nPearl:\nHe's a really kind and nice old man, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is really perceptive when it comes to people... But what does she mean by \"old man\"...?) Hey, Pearls? What about me...?\nPearl:\nWhat about you, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, I don't think I want to hear this...)\nAnything else\nPearl:\nUm, there are still so many things in this world that I don't understand yet. ...Honestly, I still don't have enough training.\nPhoenix:\nAh, no, it's OK. I don't have any ideas myself...\nPearl:\nI'm sorry. I'm really sorry!\nMarch 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEngarde:\nAh, the lawyer dude. So what did you find out?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... I'm still in the middle of investigating...\nEngarde:\nI see. ...But I've already told you everything I know, dude.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\nDude, like I told you, I don't know anything about that press conference. I leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(...This is harder than pulling bass from a river...)\nRadio Transceiver\nEngarde:\nSo, why are you carrying around that transceiver...?\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about it.\nEngarde:\nAnd why do you do everything it tells you to do? You know, the messages it sends you, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, he probably doesn't have anything to do with Maya's kidnapping.) ...That's a secret.\nEngarde:\nOK, whatever, dude.\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nLook, dude, I didn't kill him. I mean, the Nickel Samurai kicked the Jammin' Ninja's butt, right? So it's not like I felt threatened by the likes of him.\nPearl:\nBeing rivals sounds like a sad way to relate to another person...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nOldbag:\nHey! What do you think you're doing!? You can't come in without...\nPearl:\nGood morning.\nOldbag:\nHold on, it's YOU! What is going on around here!?\nPhoenix:\nU-Uh... Um...\nOldbag:\nI heard poor Juan was killed. Is that true!? It's a bad rerun is what this is. Another \"Steel Samurai\" doing the most evil of deeds.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you know... That's not entirely...\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know that I was a huge fan of Juan's! Why, oh why, do all the stars I'm interested in drop one by one like flies!? It's always been that way! Ever since I was a little girl in elementary school! The class hamster was fine until it was my turn to clean its cage, and then it died! The other kids started calling me the \"Queen Reaper\". I swear that's what they dubbed me! \"Whoever you name in your evil spell dies within three minutes,\" they would taunt.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened...\nOldbag:\nHmph! Don't push me, boy!\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? I... Um... I couldn't hear everything she said... because she was talking too fast...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...?\nOldbag:\nDon't boss me around, you spiky-haired, smarty-pants!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but...\nPearl:\n...Even Mr. Engarde himself didn't seem to know, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(How does the person who's supposed to give a conference not know about it...?)\nTalk\nThe victim\nOldbag:\nMy dear Hammer died a year ago in that dreadful murder. And only recently did I finally find a star that makes this heart go *badump* again.\nPhoenix:\n...I don't know what to say...\nOldbag:\nI ask you, why does every star I cheer for always ends [sic] up kicking the bucket?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nI'd watch your words! No one's going to get away with saying anything bad about my Juan!\nPhoenix:\nBut I haven't said anything...\nOldbag:\nWell, I don't believe a word that woman says anyway!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What woman?\nOldbag:\nThat irritating, backwater girl with the afro and the horrible country accent. I mean, what is that manner of speaking supposed to be? And why does she never stop? Honestly, women these days. They don't know the meaning of the word \"modesty\". When I was a young maiden, I was so beautiful even the flowers of the field blushed. But despite this, I pressed flowers, or read the stars, or wrote beautiful love poems or\nPhoenix:\n...Pearls? Are you thirsty?\nPearl:\nUm, a little.\nPhoenix:\nOK. I'll go get you some juice or something.\nPearl:\nTh-Thank you very much.\nOldbag:\nHey! Are you paying attention!? Young'uns today!\nPhoenix:\n(So I'm guessing Ms. Oldbag heard everything from Lotta...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nI want to ask you about what happened around the time of the murder...\nOldbag:\nAh, I don't know anything about that. I was here getting ready.\nPhoenix:\nGetting ready? For what...?\nOldbag:\nThe show, of course! ...Well, and the press conference afterwards.\nPhoenix:\n(Cue mysterious music for the magical press conference.)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I don't know anything about the murder.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see...\nOldbag:\n... But.\nPhoenix:\n?\nOldbag:\nBut if you're talking about what I saw, that's different. I saw it very clearly!\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nOldbag:\nI saw the most important moment of the night!\nWhat you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nTh-The most important moment!? You don't mean...!?\nOldbag:\nOh, so now you treat me with respect, you disrespectful child. When you speak to your elders, you should always be polite. Really, kids today.\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see!?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nOldbag:\nThe murder last night was gruesome, wasn't it? But then, what murder isn't?\nPhoenix:\n(Please don't stray onto another tangent... Please...)\nOldbag:\nIf you want to hear more, then show your respect and bring this lady a present!\nWhat you witnessed (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see on the night of the murder!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPearl:\nP-Please! Mystic Maya's life is...\nOldbag:\nAh, but you haven't given me my present yet. ...Hmm... Let's see... I'll only tell it to you if you can bring me Juan's autograph!\nPhoenix:\n(What an unreasonable request... You might as well have asked for the moon!)\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nI don't have anything to say to delinquents like you!\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr... She's clamming up like the old clam she is...)\nPearl:\nPlease! Anything would be helpful!\nOldbag:\nWell then, how about I tell you my measurements?\nPhoenix:\n...Um... No, that's okay... Really.\nPearl:\nShe really doesn't like you, does she Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI know, I know...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like the investigation is still in full swing. The hotel staff and the police are running around like a bunch of headless chickens.\nPearl:\nI wonder if we can do any investigating of our own in this kind of atmosphere...\nPhoenix:\n...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess.\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of, only to disappear... ...If only we had all gone together...\nChandelier\nPearl:\nThat is such a beautiful sight.\nPhoenix:\nThe chandelier?\nPearl:\nYes. But I can't believe it... I can't believe that such a terrible murder happened under such beautiful lights... It's shocking.\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was held on that stage just last night. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nWe ate at this table last night, didn't we?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nPearl:\nI was really happy then.\nPhoenix:\n(I wish I could make you smile again... Even for a second...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHallway\nLotta:\nHey! Yer here! Been waitin' for ya, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nLotta...\nLotta:\nHey! Mr. Cop fella! The thief's showed his face!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!?\nLotta:\nArrest him! Put him on trial! Find him guilty! Give him the death penalty!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong, Lotta!? Are you feeling alright?\nLotta:\nLooked here and there and up and down the mountain, but it ain't here! So why don'tcha just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep! (Changed from [So why don't ya just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep!] in the original release)\nPearl:\nUm, what are you looking for...?\nLotta:\nMy CAMERA! C-A-M-E-R-A! It's my life blood! I'm gonna die without my $700 camera!!\nPhoenix:\nY-Your camera...?\nLotta:\nLook, don't lots of people say the criminal always goes back to the scene of the crime!? And lookie lookie, here ya are!\nPhoenix:\nYep. Here I am... Faced with a Lotta trouble.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...?\nLotta:\nI didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nLotta:\nYeah, that's what I thought too, so I was a nice enough gal to lend a helpin' hand! ...Secretly, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(I have a feeling one of these days, I'm going to end up defending her in court...)\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\".\nLotta:\nSo that's the scene of the murder, I reckon. I thought somethin' had gone on that night, but I didn't never think it was murder.\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\".\nPearl:\nSo Mr. Engarde was here during his break, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what he claims. (Hmm... The crime scene... If he had wanted to get to Mr. Corrida's room... He would have had to pass through this hallway.)\nTalk\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!\nPearl:\nHuh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?\nLotta:\nI had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon. I made this itty-bitty scratch on it and the manager got all huffed up in the face... He gave me his talkin' to and was real mean about it too. He done made me cry at that!\nPearl:\nWhen did you lose your camera?\nLotta:\nLast night, after the murder happened. Musta been when I was busy runnin' around lookin' into things! That's when I lost sight of my dear, darlin' expensive sweetie!\nPhoenix:\nLotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours?\nLotta:\nI don't rightly know. I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?)\nLotta's Camera added to the Court Record.\nCamera (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!\nPearl:\nHuh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?\nLotta:\nI had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon.

So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nLotta, please tell me what you know about what happened at the time of the murder.\nLotta:\nWell, from before the ceremony last night, I was hangin' around here in this area. Yeah, actually I was here until around the time Mr. Engarde was arrested.\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you doing here...?\nLotta:\nYou sure you went to school, City Boy? Wherever Lotta Hart goes, there's a story to be found! A big scoop to be had!\nPhoenix:\nA big scoop...?\nLotta:\nI told ya before. I'm gonna be the best tabloid photographer the world's ever seen! Reckon course that means I'm always lookin' for the perfect shot!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what \"scoop\" she was after this time...?)\nLotta:\nAlthough, I was also on the look out for the other stars that were here, so... maybe I wasn't here the entire time...\nBig scoop (appears after \"Camera\" and \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nLotta... Are you sure you weren't here the entire time? So you could take a picture for your big scoop?\nLotta:\nWell... Maybe I was. But that's what real journalists do! I got some juicy inside info, so I thought to myself, why not get a picture for proof?\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of story was it that you would hang around here...?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nOops, sorry, Mr. Lawyer. Can't be tellin' you that. Trade secret, ya know?\nPhoenix:\n(Not again... Why does everyone have something to hide...?)\nPearl:\nWe've been stopped, haven't we?\nLotta:\nHa ha, yeah! Take that, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here is happy... Ms. Lotta and your \"I rule!\" smile...)\nBig scoop (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou were on the hunt for your big scoop last night?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nIt's just a bunch of tabloid photos. They ain't got nothing to do with the murder.\nPearl:\nIt looks like we have no choice but to remove the Psyche-Locks.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I guess so.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nLotta:\nHey, what's that? ...A press conference ticket? How come I ain't got myself one of them!?\nPhoenix:\nP-Please don't direct your anger at me...\nLotta:\nWhy in tarnations wasn't I invited to that!? How come someone on the bottom of the popularity chart like you got the info, but not me!? Info like that is worth nothin' to ya, am I right or what!?\nPhoenix:\n(...Is that the kind of person she thinks I am...?)\nPearl:\nAre you going to stand there and take that, Mr. Nick!?\nLotta's Camera\nLotta:\nNngh... And I just bought that camera... Who did it!? The thievin' rascal!\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't look straight at me while you're saying that...\nLotta:\nWhen I find the bugger who went and done this, they're gonna pay with a bullet!\nPhoenix:\n(And if you do that, don't expect me to defend you...)\nMaya Fey profile\nLotta:\nNow that I think about it, she isn't with y'all today, is she...?\nPearl:\nUm...\nLotta:\nShe's a spunky one! You shouldn't have been lettin' her outta yer sight. Who knows what she's up to now...\nPhoenix:\n(Like you're one to talk...)\nPearl:\n...\nPearl Fey profile\nLotta:\nAh, just wanna say sorry to ya.\nPearl:\nFor...?\nLotta:\nWell, I really, absolutely thought you were the murderer.\nPearl:\n...Huh?\nLotta:\nYou know... Last time, that thing with Maya Fey...\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!? But why!?\nLotta:\nI mean, you were all worked up, ya know?\nPearl:\n*sniffle* ...Meanie...\nPhoenix:\nLotta, that was very insensitive of you!\nLotta Hart profile\nLotta:\nThis kind of hairstyle is pretty hard to get, ya know. Hard to care for too. Just the other day, I ran my hand through my hair to fix it up, and suddenly, out pops this dollar coin! That's gotta be like hittin' the jackpot!\nPearl:\nWow, that's really lucky!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* What a deep conversation that was...)\nJuan Corrida or Matt Engarde profile\nLotta:\nI don't really care for 'em \"heroes\" or whatnot.\nPearl:\nOh, I see...\nLotta:\nAnd shows they got for kids, those adventures are just plain ol' borin'! Now, adults. We get more caught up in messy, sticky, real situations! ...Even me...\nPearl:\nO-Oh...\nLotta:\nSounds like the tyke's gettin' what I'm goin' with this!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a sec here! Don't go around getting her mixed up in things like that!\nSecurity Lady profile\nLotta:\nThis old granny? Ah, she kept on glarin' at me with those eyes of hers. As if it's my fault. Kept babblin' how she won't forgive people who write \"trash\" about her Juan... ...Ah, yeah, we sorta got into a little fight, ya know...\nPhoenix:\n(A \"little\" fight? Knowing those two, it was probably more of a blabbering contest.)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know anything...\nLotta:\n...*sigh*... I've told ya how many times now? I'm a journalist. I've got so much info runnin' laps in my head I forget things here and there!\nPearl:\nPlease don't get so worked up over this...\nLotta:\nHah! I don't care if ya beg me! \"Be extra tough on kids!\" That's this gal's motto on learnin' youngsters.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nUm... Where are we?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room.\n???:\nMay I help you with something?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... We're...\n???:\nYou're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail.\nPhoenix:\nUm... How did you know I'm his lawyer...?\n???:\nYou were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer.\nPearl:\nWow...\n???:\nIt's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either.\nPearl:\nIt's really not the time to be showing off, Mr. Nick.\nAndrews:\nI am Adrian Andrews. I hate to waste time, so let's get down to business.\nPhoenix:\nA-Alright... (She may be of small stature, but appearances can be deceiving...)\nExamine\nRed suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's probably Mr. Engarde's suitcase. For someone who was only going to be here for the award show, this is a lot of stuff. Looks like he has about three days' worth of clothes in here.\nPearl:\nStars really are different from us, aren't they...?\nBedroom\nPhoenix:\nThat's the bedroom over there.\nPearl:\nThat's a bed...? Wow, they have really big beds here!\nSofa\nPhoenix:\nThere's some samurai-looking clothes on the sofa here.\nPearl:\nUm, I think that jacket looking thing is called a \"happi\".\nPhoenix:\n(Whatever it is, I'm sure something like that would make a great souvenir. Maya would be absolutely thrilled...)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nLooks like dishes left over from dinner... A dinner for two, at that.\nPearl:\nI'm sure they're Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews' plates.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they had T-bone steaks... What's with Global Studios and T-bone steaks...?\nPlate on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a giant bone sitting on the plate.\nPearl:\nI... I don't really like meat...\nPhoenix:\n(...? There's something... weird about this plate... I just wish I could put my finger on what it is...)\nTalk\nNight of the murder\nAndrews:\nI assume the first thing you need to know is what everyone was doing that night, correct?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, that is correct.\nAndrews:\nThen I will tell you. Before the award ceremony, I had dinner with Mr. Engarde. In this very room, I might add.\nPhoenix:\n\"Dinner\"? What did you eat?\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate to waste time with trifling details. If you took a look at the table yourself, you wouldn't need to ask me.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet she's a lot of fun at parties...)\nAndrews:\nWhen the award show was starting, I headed for Viola Hall.\nPhoenix:\nAnd after the show ended, you came back to this room...?\nAndrews:\nNo, I had some small errands to run. I helped with the preparations in the lobby.\nPhoenix:\nOh... (Preparations for the post-ceremony show, I guess...)\nAndrews:\nWhen it was time for the post-ceremony show, I came back to call for Mr. Engarde. After that, I went to visit Mr. Corrida...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you found his body, isn't it?\nAndrews:\n...\nPearl:\nYou really held strong through everything...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... She does seem to be mentally tough as nails...)\nRelation to Engarde\nPhoenix:\nUm, so... About you and...\nAndrews:\nStop right there. You aren't seriously about to ask how Mr. Engarde and I are related, are you? (Changed from [Don't expect me to believe you have been talking to me without knowing how we relate.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nAndrews:\nI have no idea how he could chose [sic] you as his lawyer. (Changed from [I have no idea why Mr. Engarde chose you as his lawyer.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Why did she have to go and say something like that...?)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Calm down and hang in there. I'll give you a shoulder rub to relieve your stress later, alright?\nAndrews:\nI already gave you my name earlier, but I'll add that I'm Mr. Engarde's manager.\nPhoenix:\nHis manager... Speaking of managers, did the victim, Mr. Corrida have one?\nAndrews:\nNo, he did not.\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't?\nAndrews:\nGlobal Studios has a very different policy from Worldwide Studios in that Worldwide Studios does not assign individual managers to their stars.\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nAndrews:\nThis industry is very ruthless and unforgiving. Actually, you look quite ruthless and unforgiving yourself to your poor partner. Dragging a little girl like her to places like this. Honestly.\nPearl:\nYou're wrong! I... I'm doing this to help Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Calm down and hang in there. I'll buy you a juice later, alright?\nPearl:\nNngh...\nMotive for murder (appears after presenting Juan Corrida profile)\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any ideas?\nAndrews:\nAs to...?\nPhoenix:\nAs to why Mr. Corrida was murdered?\nAndrews:\nWhy would you ask me about such a thing...?\nPhoenix:\nI'm just doing my job. So, do you have any ideas?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nSorry, but there's nothing more I have to add to this conversation.\nPearl:\nIs it a Psyche-Lock, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYes... There's getting to be more and more of these lately.\nMotive for murder (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou know something, don't you? About why Mr. Corrida was murdered...\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nAndrews:\nWhy are you asking me? Don't tell me you can see inside my heart.\nPhoenix:\n(No, but I can see the locks you have on your psyche.)\nPearl:\nIf you don't remove her locks...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it's worthless to even ask...)\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one taking care of the arrangements for this press conference, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, that's right.\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Engarde said he \"didn't know\" about it.\nAndrews:\n... Is that what he said...?\nPearl:\nHuh...?\nAndrews:\nActually, I didn't know all the details either. It was a request from the publicity department. All I did was help out and do what I was asked.\nPearl:\nOh... I see.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder about that... I wouldn't take her to be the type of person to do something without knowing the details.)\nWill Powers profile\nAndrews:\nThat's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be.\nPhoenix:\n(Urk... What a horrible thing to say...)\nAndrews:\n...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? For a second, her face twisted in pain...)\nPearl:\nI wonder if something happened to Ms. Andrews...\nJuan Corrida profile\nPhoenix:\nDid you know the victim, Mr. Corrida?\nAndrews:\nYes, I knew him. The world is such a small place, after all.\nPearl:\nDid you know about his rivalry with the Nickel Samurai?\nAndrews:\nHonestly, they were like children when it came to that. Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most trivial things. (Changed from [Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most uninteresting things.] in the original release) ... If either one of them wasn't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die. (Changed from [If either one of them weren't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n! (...I've got a hunch that this woman knows more than she's letting on... She must know why Juan Corrida was killed!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nAndrews:\nI asked to become Mr. Engarde's manager. He's a pleasure to manage with his nice disposition.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Mr. Engarde does seem like a rather weak-willed man; always doing as he's told...)\nPearl:\nHe's always saying, \"my manager,\" right Mr. Nick?\nAndrews:\n...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAndrews:\nI hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... (Take away that layer of sarcasm and she really does seem to hate herself...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, I'd like to ask you about this...\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Where are we...?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Juan Corrida's room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Corrida...?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim... Which makes this the crime scene, too.\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's you! So!? What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!?\nPhoenix:\nNot yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there?\nPhoenix:\n(I just want Maya to be alright...)\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nWe don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal.\nPhoenix:\nCan you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...?\nGumshoe:\nJust this once... \"Special circumstances\" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here.\nPhoenix:\nThank you.\nGumshoe:\nOh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy.\nPearl:\nWow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you!\nGumshoe:\nHa ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I got a map!\nPhoenix:\nThat's great, Pearls!\nPearl:\n... Um... But Mr. Nick, I can't read what it says...\nHotel Guidemap added to the Court Record.\nExamine\nRefrigerator\nPhoenix:\nThere are all sorts of things in this refrigerator...\nPearl:\nThe carrot juice bottle and the tomato juice bottle are both empty...\nPhoenix:\nEmpty...? (It's too much of a hassle to throw them away, I guess.) They're all vegetable juices. I guess he must've been a real health nut.\nPearl:\n...Oh! There's a beet, some ketchup, and a bottle of strawberry jam too!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe red was his favorite color...?\nStuffed bears\nPearl:\nWow, there are a lot of bears!\nPhoenix:\n(Alarm clock ones, collector's editions, stuffed teddies, plastic models... It's pretty overwhelming... Is there a kind of bear he doesn't have...?)\nPearl:\nThere's even a few in the trash can...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I get the feeling maybe the guy didn't really like bears.\nPearl:\nPoor teddies...\nIt's hard to \"bear\" with all these problems... Growl! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n... (I don't think I want to \"bear\" with the trauma the last case caused me...)\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mr. Nick?\nDesk\nPearl:\nHmph! It's so messy here!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls really likes things neat and tidy, I take it...)\nPearl:\nThere are a lot of electronic things in here that I've never seen before. Hey, Mr. Nick! Tell me what they are, pretty please?\nPhoenix:\nOK. That over there is a \"watch\". You wear it on your wrist.\nPearl:\n... I know what a watch is...\nPhoenix:\n(Oops. For a second there, I forgot I was talking with Pearls, not Maya...)\nBlue suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's a suitcase. There are so many things in it that I bet it barely closes. There's his clothes, a dryer, an electric shaver, a calculator...\nPearl:\nDo all stars pack too much stuff like Mr. Corrida?\nTable on right\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Mr. Corrida had dinner last night.\nPearl:\nThis bottle... It's tomato juice.\nPhoenix:\n(We had a lot of food at the award show last night... But I wonder if the stars had gone onstage after only eating a meager meal like this...)\nBedroom\nPearl:\nSo that's a bed, right?\nPhoenix:\nYup. It's big, but it's a bed.\nPearl:\nAaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft!\nPhoenix:\n(Big beds must be a rarity for her...)\nScattered items near guitar case\nPhoenix:\nBottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.\nPearl:\nWhat's this glass fragment from...?\nPhoenix:\nA flower vase maybe? There are flowers on the floor, but I don't know what they are.\nPearl:\nYou don't know much about flowers, do you Mr. Nick?\nGuitar case\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.\nPearl:\nThat's strange. The guitar is not here...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he forgot to bring it to the show?\nPearl:\nBut Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item...\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid...\nPearl:\nYeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nGuitar Case added to the Court Record.\nGuitar case (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.\nPearl:\nThat's strange. The guitar is not here...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he forgot to bring it to the show?\nPearl:\nBut Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item...\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid...\nPearl:\nYeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nWine glass\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nPearl:\nBut doesn't it seem weird?\nPhoenix:\n...What seems weird?\nPearl:\nI mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor.\nPhoenix:\n... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)\nPearl:\nWhy is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?\nWine Glass added to the Court Record.\nWine glass (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nPearl:\nBut doesn't it seem weird?\nPhoenix:\n...What seems weird?\nPearl:\nI mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor.\nPhoenix:\n... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)\nPearl:\nWhy is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?\nTalk\nCause of death\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what was the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nWell, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal. (Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIt should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Here's a picture.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a knife in his chest.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal, that's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was stabbed to death...)\nGumshoe:\nThey're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now.\nPhoenix:\nThere were fingerprints on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nYup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nCause of death (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what was the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nWell, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal. (Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIt should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Here's a picture.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a knife in his chest.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal, that's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was stabbed to death...)\nGumshoe:\nThey're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now.\nPhoenix:\nThere were fingerprints on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nYup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nReason for arrest\nPhoenix:\nWhy was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nBecause we had evidence on him.\nPearl:\nEvidence...?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the victim, Juan Corrida, really put up a big fight.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, one look at the crime scene and you can tell. There's signs of a struggle everywhere.\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah. During the fight, his button came off...\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde said something about a button... Something like, one of the Jammin' Ninja's buttons got caught in his \"hakama\"...)\nGumshoe:\nBut that's not all...\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nThere was a witness, pal.\nPhoenix:\nA witness!? Wh-Who is it!?\nGumshoe:\nThat lady... Ms. Oldbag.\nPhoenix:\n(Please... Anyone but her!)\nGumshoe:\nThe prosecution has plenty of evidence to make a solid case... Not to mention there's something around where the vic was that's a little off. (Changed from [Not to mention there's something at the crime scene that was a little off.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nSomething that's a little off...? As in...? (Changed from [Something that was a little off...? As in...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nAs in, that's for you to figure out, pal!\nPearl:\nAlright, let's try to figure it out, Mr. Nick!\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nGumshoe:\nThat's your \"present\" from the kidnapper, huh? While you're talking, it sends and receives radio waves... If we could trace that...\nPearl:\nYeah! We could use it to find out where the bad guy is!\nPhoenix:\n(It uses radio waves, huh?)\nGumshoe:\nI got it! I'll go find a radio scanner, and let you borrow it, pal!\nGuitar Case\nPhoenix:\nWhat can you tell me about this guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nOh, that. This is just what I heard, pal, but that's the Jammin' Ninja's signature item.\nPhoenix:\nThe guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nNo, not that! What do you take me as? I mean the guitar inside, of course!\nPearl:\nBut... The guitar is missing.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, we looked for it too. It's not normal for a person to forget to bring their most famous item to an award show.\nPhoenix:\n(It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...)\nWine Glass\nPhoenix:\nSo about this wine glass...\nGumshoe:\nAh, so you noticed it, pal. The whole crime scene was a mess, but this glass was the only thing that was untouched.\nPhoenix:\nYou noticed that too, Detective Gumshoe...?\nGumshoe:\nNo, actually Ms. von Karma noticed it first.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Pearls noticed it before me too... Hey, wait a minute. So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's here at the hotel...? (Changed from [So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's coming here...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah, she's around. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal. (Changed from [Yeah, she's coming. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal.] in the original release) Especially if she catches you in here. (Changed from [I think it'd be best if you didn't bump into her here.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou can bet the instant I see her, I'll be running the 1,000 meter dash.\nCrime Photo\nGumshoe:\nYou look at this photo and you can't help it. It makes you want to say, \"I can't believe this is the scene of a murder.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Stabbed with a knife after a struggle... A clue is sleeping in this photo somewhere... I know it.)\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm sorry.\nPhoenix:\n...For what?\nGumshoe:\nI really want to help you look for her, pal.\nPearl:\nMr. Detective...\nGumshoe:\nIf anything happens, let me know, OK? I want to help in any way I can!\nPearl Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, little missy. Listen good, OK?\nPearl:\nOK. What is it?\nGumshoe:\nDon't ever pick up a whip, OK? Don't even think about it.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nGumshoe:\nIf you ever find yourself thinking you want one, try to make due with a good slap to the face. Got that? Slap the person in the face. Promise me, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(Personal experience tells me Gumshoe should be careful what he wishes for...)\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nIf I had a choice, she would be number three on my list of people I don't want to see.\nPhoenix:\n...Because I'm in the number one spot?\nGumshoe:\nDon't get all high and mighty on me here. You've taken a tumble into second place, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really? Then who's in first...?\nGumshoe:\nMs. von Karma's miles and miles ahead of you in this race.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh...\nGumshoe:\nShe's really scary... Right now... M-Ms. von Karma... You really don't...\nPhoenix:\n(He's so scared of her that he's whispering now...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, why don't we let bygones be bygones, pal? Look, this guy is guilty. A buck says so.\nPhoenix:\nOne dollar...? Sure you're not talking about Pearls' allowance money?\nGumshoe:\nI... I can't bet any more than that... My salary... It's...\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't matter what we think... I still have to defend Mr. Engarde in court or else!)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick...\nSecurity Lady profile\nGumshoe:\nI thought she was an alien from outer space.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, probably because she's wearing that strange helmet.\nGumshoe:\nNah, even with her helmet off, I thought she was an alien, pal.\nPhoenix:\n... I think that's probably best kept to yourself, if you know what I mean...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nGumshoe:\nShe's Mr. Engarde's manager, right? No matter what I do, I really stink at talking with people like her. As soon as I open my mouth, I get all flustered. See, she's one of those women with a brain. She's someone who \"gets things done\".\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she does give that sort of impression, like she's got it all together.\nGumshoe:\nCompared to her, you can easily tell I'm a \"can't do anything right\" kind of guy.

That was Juan's...\nPhoenix:\nI'm guessing you've seen this case before?\nPowers:\nIt's pretty famous by now. It stands out because it holds THE bright red guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(The bright red guitar...

I was on my way to the toilet, minding my own business.\nPhoenix:\nAnd...? Did you tell that to the police?\nOldbag:\nWell, of course! I thought I could get a gift certificate or two out of it, maybe more.\nPearl:\nGift certificate...?\nOldbag:\nI've been recruited again for that part at the trial. You know, the trial tomorrow?

I still have work to do, so...\nPhoenix:\nI understand.\nAndrews:\nOh, I have one small favor to ask. My... attempted suicide... I'd like for you to keep it a secret.\nPearl:\nMs. Andrews...\nAndrews:\nIf... If people found out about my weakness... I... I would sooner choose to die than live.\nPhoenix:\nA-A-Alright! I understand! We'll keep it a secret! (Ms. Andrews... I guess she's the overthinking type... (Changed from [Ms. Andrews...

A seashell?\nAndrews:\nThat's what it looks like, doesn't it? I honestly don't remember owning this card... I wonder where I picked it up from...?\nPhoenix:\n(Her not remembering something clearly? Sounds like it would be a rare occurence.)\nAndrews:\nWell, I must be off.

He was worn out from his mini performance as the Nickel Samurai during the ceremony...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, Mr. Engarde did say he was taking a nap...) Then I guess you could say it could not have been taken out of his room, yes?\nAndrews:\nExcuse me? \"It\"...? What are you...?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I thought years of school would have taught you how to construct a sentence. If you can't make a sensible sentence with a subject, then I'll make one for you. Watch.

Even I don't know.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas that because you were \"shocked and dazed\" at discovering the victim's body?\nAndrews:\nYes... That's probably it.\nPhoenix:\n...\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not going to get anywhere if I continue pressing her like this... The only way to make her talk is with evidence... I guess I should give it a try...)Present Guitar Case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way you were the one who opened the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nWhy would you say that!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's elementary, my dear. Because the only fingerprints on this guitar case are those of the victim!\nAndrews:\nAh!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\n... You shouldn't assume that I must have left prints just because I touched the case.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nAndrews:\nWhat if I were to tell you that I was wearing gloves at the time?\nJudge:\nGloves...? But why would you be wearing gloves at the time?\nAndrews:\nIt was the night of the award ceremony. So of course I dressed up for the occasion. Yes, now I remember... I'm almost sure I was wearing a pair of thin gloves.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see... Well, Mr. Wright. It seems the witness was wearing gloves at the scene of the crime.\n\n\n\nNothing strange about that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHmm, I guess so... And I guess that makes sense.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. You're the epitome of a half-baked idea.\nAndrews:\nA brain is to be used, not to look pretty for med students carving cadavers.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like I need to bake my thoughts just a little longer...)\nEdgeworth:\nNow, if the defense has no further objections, let's return to the testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nThat's strange...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were wearing gloves...? Isn't that a little strange?\nAndrews:\nWhy is that strange!? Do you have something that would prove I was not wearing gloves at the time...?\n\n\n\nPresent Wine Glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I have your proof right here.

We can't afford to let up on her now.Phoenix:\nI wasn't planning on letting up, but...Mia:\nShe's at her weakest now, so this is our chance!Phoenix:\n(Yeah, if we had a weapon to hit her with...)Mia:\nI'm sure a weapon is hiding somewhere in the Court Record, waiting to be found.\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Pearl Fey\nDescription: Maya's cousin.

The case was empty after all.\nPerson: Andrews\nTestimony 3\nTestimony: As for why I opened the case... Even I don't know.\nPerson: Andrews\n\nWhich evidence and testimony contradict each other? You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other based on the provided story, characters, evidences, and testimonies. \n\nLooking at the testimonies by Adrian Andrews, the key testimony here is: \"It's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all.\" (Testimony 2). She claims the guitar case was empty.\n\nThe relevant evidence is the Guitar Case (Evidence 7), which states that the case was found empty but with water on top of the lid. However, another piece of evidence comes into play here: the Crime Photo (Evidence 9). The Crime Photo's description mentions that the guitar case is open and empty in the crime scene photo. \n\nWait, but there's more. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) states the cause of death as strangulation with a scarf and then stabbing. However, the contradiction here isn't about the cause of death but the guitar case. \n\nWait, maybe the Picture Card (Evidence 18) is involved. The Picture Card was placed next to the victim and was carried by Andrews. But how does that relate to the guitar case being empty? \n\nWait, the key contradiction might be in the testimony that the case was empty when Andrews opened it. But the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record the victim's room. If the camera was running, perhaps it shows that the guitar case wasn't empty when Andrews opened it. However, the evidence provided doesn't mention the spy camera footage directly contradicting that.\n\nWait, looking back, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the guitar case as empty. But the contradiction arises from the fact that if Andrews opened the case after the vase fell, but the case was already open when she arrived. The Guitar Case's description mentions that it was found open and empty, but only the victim's fingerprints are on it. Andrews claims she opened it, but if she was wearing gloves, her fingerprints wouldn't be there. But she said she might have been wearing gloves, which explains no prints. However, the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has her fingerprints. If she was wearing gloves, the Wine Glass wouldn't have her fingerprints. Therefore, the presence of her fingerprints on the Wine Glass contradicts her claim of wearing gloves when she opened the guitar case. \n\nBut the specific testimony in question is about the case being empty. The evidence that contradicts her statement about opening the case would be the Guitar Case's fingerprints. However, the user is asking for the pair where the evidence and testimony directly contradict. \n\nWait, in the testimony, Andrews says she opened the case, but the Guitar Case's evidence states only the victim's fingerprints are present. Therefore, if she opened it, her fingerprints should be there unless she was wearing gloves. But the Wine Glass has her fingerprints, indicating she wasn't wearing gloves when handling the glass. Thus, if she wasn't wearing gloves when touching the glass, she also wasn't wearing gloves when opening the case, so her fingerprints should be on the case. Since the case only has the victim's prints, her testimony about opening it is contradicted. \n\nSo the contradiction is between her testimony that she opened the case (Testimony 1) and the Guitar Case evidence (Evidence 7) showing only the victim's fingerprints. However, in the given options, the user is looking for the specific pair. \n\nBut the user's answer format requires the evidence and testimony indices. Testimony 2 is about the case being empty, which is actually true according to the Crime Photo. The real contradiction is in Testimony 1 (opening the case) and the Guitar Case's fingerprints (Evidence 7). But according to the provided list, Testimony 1 is \"I suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over.\" The evidence would be the Guitar Case (7) showing only the victim's fingerprints. Therefore, the correct pair would be Evidence 7 and Testimony 1. \n\nBut looking at the options, the user might expect this. However, in the cross-examination, the focus was on the Wine Glass (8) having her fingerprints, proving she wasn't wearing gloves, thus contradicting her claim of wearing gloves when opening the case. However, the testimony in question here is about the case being empty. The key contradiction in the given testimonies and evidence is that she claims to have opened the case (Testimony 1), but the case only has the victim's prints (Evidence 7). Therefore, the correct answer is {\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 1}.\n\n{\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 1}",

The moment you've all been waiting for! Who will be this year's Grand Prix Champion? Who will be our \"Hero of Heroes\"!? Will it be last year's runner-up, Jammin' Ninja!? Or maybe Captain Saipan all the way from the lovely tropical island of Saipan!? I see the students of a certain Starry School are raring to win! And Global Hero Onyankopon doesn't want to go home without the prize! We hope Lady Luck is with all our heroes tonight! And now! The winner of the third annual Hero of Heroes Grand Prix... IS ME!!\nWhoooooooooa! The true hero of the night has appeared in our midst! It looks like this year's Grand Prix goes to this fantastic warrior! The Nickel Samurai! Too bad, Jammin' Ninja. Looks like the title eluded you again this year!\nMarch 20, 7:42 PMGatewater HotelViola Hall\nMaya:\nAlright! Yes! Did you hear that, Nick!? Did you!? The Nickel Samurai! He did it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.\nPowers:\nAh, I'm proud of the guy for doing the series justice.\nPearl:\nU-Um... So the person everyone was cheering for... I guess he got the prize?\nMaya:\nYup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? \"The Nickel Samurai\"!\nPearl:\nNo. Every Sunday, I only watch the Educational Channel's \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nOK, that's it! From now on, it's \"The Nickel Samurai\"! All the kids watch it!\nPearl:\nDo you like \"The Nickel Samurai\" too, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nNah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. But I do like \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nHey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed to watch it anymore! You're supposed to act your age and have interests that match. ...It's very important.\nMaya:\nAw, give it a rest, Pearly!\nPowers:\nLooks like I made the right choice in inviting everyone here. I'm glad you're all having a good time.\nMaya:\nAaaaah... It's like a dream!\nPowers:\nToo bad for the Jammin' Ninja, though. Last year, he lost to The Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo. I thought this might be his year...\nMaya:\nYeah... Oh, hey, did anyone else think that the Jammin' Ninja was a bit different today?\nPearl:\nDifferent? What do you mean?\nMaya:\nUm, well, he wasn't carrying his bright red guitar.\nPowers:\nHey, you're right! Strange he'd walk around without his signature guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh* I will never understand these people and their shows...) Anyway, Mr. Powers, thank you very much for tonight.\nPowers:\nA-Aw, it was nothing... I owe you one, so it's just my way of saying thanks.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! It's time to get going to the lobby! There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.\nPowers:\nAnd then, I heard there's going to be a press conference after that.\nPhoenix:\nA press conference? Is he going to make a speech about winning this year's prize?\nPowers:\nUh, well, not exactly... Something about the Nickel Samurai confessing something.\nPhoenix:\nConfessing...? Sounds pretty serious.\nMaya:\nArgh! Nick! COME ON! You don't want us to be the last ones there, do you!?\nPearl:\nYeah, Mr. Nick! Do you!?\nPhoenix:\n(Why me...? The show doesn't even start for another 20 minutes...)\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there.\nPowers:\nAnd behind those doors is an equally grand lobby.\nPearl:\nShall we go and take a look, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nHey, wait up! This grand dessert is calling to me... It's saying, \"Eat me now!\"\nWalls or ceiling\nPhoenix:\nThis sure is one luxurious hotel. Almost to the point of gaudy, with how it blends together everything \"fancy\" imaginable. (Speaking of fancy, didn't that bellboy give me something like that last year?)\nChandelier\nMaya:\nThat chandelier is really something, isn't it?\nPearl:\nI thought it was a kind of space ship...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. How about we get one of these for the office?\nPhoenix:\nOne of those hanging from our poor, weak ceiling? I don't think so.\nTables at back\nMaya:\nIf this is all a dream, I don't ever want to wake up! And all the directors and stars that were here to see the heroes, wow.\nPhoenix:\nI had no idea who most of them were.\nPearl:\nNeither did I.\nMaya:\nNick, you've got to cut that \"news only\" habit out. Your new show is going to be \"The Nickel Samurai!\" Every Sunday morning at 8! Oh, I know! We can watch it together starting next week! I'll come wake you up extra early to make sure, OK?\nPhoenix:\nAh, I'm fine... You know, you really don't have to on my account...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second.\nMaya:\nWell, shows like that are guaranteed to be good, you know?\nFront table\nMaya:\nWhat can I say? This is a really high-class hotel!\nPearl:\nI've never eaten this kind of salad before.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nMaya:\nDon't worry! Any leftovers belong in my happily awaiting stomach anyway!\nPhoenix:\nYou're such a glutton, Maya.\nPowers:\nAh, I lose this one to Maya. You sure can eat.\nMaya:\nWell, a growing girl needs her nutrients!\nPhoenix:\n(A growing girl? Exactly how big do you plan on getting...?)\nTalk\nWill Powers\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much for inviting us today.\nPowers:\nAww, it was nothing really. Guys like us don't get to come to a place like this often, so I thought I'd invite you all.\nMaya:\nHey, Mr. Powers! What have you been up to lately?\nPowers:\nWell, since \"The Pink Princess\" successfully wrapped up last month, I've been on a kid's exercise show... ...while wearing a rabbit mask over my face...\nMaya:\nOh, I see.\nPowers:\nI'm still really sorry about all the headaches I caused you that time, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nAh, well. What's done is done, so let's forget about it. (This is Will Powers. He's an action star. His popularity exploded when he was the Steel Samurai. And he was the first case Maya worked on with me.)\nMaya:\nIt's too bad you look scary, or people'd know you're a real softy who's good with kids. (Changed from [You can't tell by looking at you, but you're a really nice guy with a love of kids.] in the original release)\nPowers:\nUm, thanks. (Changed from [Ah, thanks.] in the original release)\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe they're going to make a movie based on the Nickel Samurai.\nMaya:\nI can't believe it either, but for a different reason!\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai. An epic story of one hero in a desperate fight against his arch-enemy, the Evil Magistrate in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo. And last year, they started a new series, \"The Nickel Samurai\". The new series seems to be a hit with the kids, too.\nPowers:\nI'm really attached to the Steel Samurai as a show, (Changed from [The Steel Samurai is a show I have a lot of strong feelings for,] in the original release) so I was hoping that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one... (Changed from [so I hoped that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nYeah, it's too bad... It'd been [sic] awesome to see you with the new actor, Matt Engarde. (Changed from [Yeah... It's too bad... It'd be great to see you on the show...] in the original release) He's super popular right now. (Changed from [With the new actor, Matt Engarde. He's super popular right now.] in the original release)\nPearl:\nMr. Un-gard...?\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Pearls doesn't know who he is.)\nMaya:\nThis year it's going to be the Nickel Samurai vs. the Jammin' Ninja at the box office!\nPhoenix:\n...Jammin' Ninja...? Who's that again?\nJammin' Ninja (appears after \"The Nickel Samurai\")\nPhoenix:\nSo who is this \"Jammin' Ninja\" again?\nMaya:\nHe's a hero, duh. His symbol is a bright red guitar he's always carrying.\nPhoenix:\n(A ninja who's always carrying around a bright red guitar...? How does that even work!?)\nMaya:\nWith a scarf around his neck and a guitar in hand, he rises to stardom in an ancient time.\nPhoenix:\nA ninja... Who becomes a star??\nMaya:\nYeah! A ninja who becomes a star!\nPowers:\nThere's a strong rivalry between the two of them. Global Studios' Nickel Samurai and Worldwide Studios' Jammin' Ninja. They even air at the same time.\nMaya:\nYou know what I heard? I heard those two don't get along at all. The Nickel Samurai's Engarde and the guy who plays the Jammin' Ninja, I mean.\nPhoenix:\n(The Nickel Samurai speaks French!? Oh, you mean Matt Engarde, the actor...) I guess even the world of heroes isn't a sparkling, happy place.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPowers:\nAh, I really owe you one. If it wasn't for you guys, I don't know what would've happened. What you did... It was a real tight spot I was in, and you fought so hard to get me out. I don't care what happens. I'll never forget everything you've done for me.\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo, you're going to study to become a lawyer too. Am I right or am I right?\nMaya:\nUmm...\nPowers:\nIt must be real tough. There's all those thick books with hard words you have to read...\nMaya:\nUh, um... Well...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, yeah. Mr. Powers doesn't know that Maya's a spirit medium...)\nMaya:\nI thought he'd be able to tell by my clothes.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he thinks that you've got some strange hobby on the side or something.\nMaya:\n...Hey, wait a sec. What's that's supposed to mean!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo are you Maya's little sister?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but no.\nPowers:\nOh, then you must be Mr. Wright's little sister!\nPearl:\nAgain, I'm sorry, but...\nPowers:\nThen... Whose little sister are you?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but I'm an only child.\nPowers:\nOh, I see... S-Sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(Pearl looks so sad... She looks really sorry too...)\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, they're all shocked because then they figure out who I am.\nMaya:\nHmm... Well, I don't think you look scary.\nPearl:\nMe either. I think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Those two are making Mr. Powers tear up...)\nAnything else\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Thanks for taking the time to take it out and show it to me, but I'm really sorry, I don't know a thing about it.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nPhoenix:\nWow, what is with this place? Looks like I've stumbled into Oz or something. Way in the back, there's a sign for the bathroom. Maybe I should visit it while I can before the show starts... (Changed from [I bet we have a little time to look around before the show starts...] in the original release)\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...? Could it be that there's an action star who has a soft spot for teddy bears...? ...Nah, can't be.\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". \"Juan Corrida\"... His name just sounds like a star's name. I've heard it before, but I don't know anything about him at all.\nEnd of hallway\nPhoenix:\nThere are toilets in each room in this hotel, but since all sorts of events are held here, there are bathrooms for people who aren't staying here to use as well. Perfect for people like me, who can't afford a stay here in the first place...\nFlowers on right\nPhoenix:\n\"To Mr. Engarde From the Global Studio Staff\" Ah, it'd be nice if lawyers got flowers too. Something like, \"To Mr. Wright From All Your Grateful Clients\".\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\". \"Matt Engarde\"... I've heard that name before. Oh, yeah. Maya's always yammering about him like the obsessed fan she is...\nViola Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Viola Hall and visiting Hallway)\nPowers:\nSounds like the post-ceremony show is about to start.\nMaya:\nAlright! I'm so pumped! I wonder if he's going to show off his special move today? \"Nickel Samurai Smelting!\"\nPowers:\nActually, what I'm interested in most is the press conference.\nMaya:\nYou mean the \"big confession\" the Nickel Samurai's going to make after the show? So what is it? Don't you know what it's about, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nUh, well, I'm not the Steel Samurai anymore, so I don't have any idea.\nMaya:\nBah.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Ah, so I guess you are all going to the press conference then?\nMaya:\nYeah, of course!\nPowers:\nIf that's the case, then here, take these tickets so you can get in.\nPress Conference Ticket added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much. Well, let's get going to the lobby.\nPearl:\nIt looks like it's over this way, Mr. Nick!\nMaya:\nOK! For great justice!\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPowers:\nThey called this so suddenly that something about it just seems off, you know?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the press conference?\nPowers:\nYeah. He said, \"There's something I'd like to confess if I win.\" I heard he faxed his request for a conference in to the office only yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nYesterday... (Yeah, that is kind of sudden.)\nPowers:\nBut I guess his manager set everything up somehow, so he was lucky.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Nice manager.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Only a really gaudy hotel would have such a large, gaudy lobby to match.\nPearl:\nAh, I think they're going to have the post-ceremony show over there.\nPhoenix:\nThey're using a compact stage, I see.\nMaya:\nOoh... I'm all ready to use my special \"Samurai Power\".\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks like she's ready to start a fight...)\nPA Notice:\nYour attention please, your attention please. The Nickel Samurai's Post-Ceremony Stage Show will not be held tonight due to unforeseen circumstances.\nMaya:\nWHAAAT!? WHYYYYY!?\nPhoenix:\nOww! You didn't have to pinch me! Pinch yourself if you don't believe it!\nPA Notice:\nWe are asking for everyone's cooperation at this time. So please stay where you are. ...This is a special request from the police.\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nP-Police? Did they just say the police?\nPowers:\nD-Do you want me to go check out what's going on?\nPhoenix:\nUm, wait, I'll come with you...\n???:\nFreeze! You two! Didn't you hear the announcement just now!? It just finished telling you not to move!\nMaya:\nTh-That voice... I've heard that voice somewhere before...\n???:\nHonestly, youth these days can't be bothered to listen to other people when they talk! Just the other day it was the same thing! There was a small footbridge with a sign next to it that said, \"Beware, Bridge Out!\" And along comes a snot-nosed little punk kid right up to the bridge. I tried to tell the boy the bridge was out and it was dangerous, but would he listen!? No, of course not! He said he'd be careful and only walk on the \"in\" part of the bridge since the \"out\" part is what was dangerous! I am not kidding you here! The kid said that and really meant it! WELL! I really let him have it then, and knocked him clear off of that bridge! Honestly, kids these days don't know right from wrong, I tell you!\nPowers:\nThis non-stop chatter...\nPhoenix:\nI-It can't be... ...Ms. Oldbag?\n???:\n...\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, you young whipper-snappers!? Do I know you!? ...Wait. YOU! You're Powers, aren't you!?\nPowers:\nY-Yeah. Um, about what happened back then...\nOldbag:\nYou didn't even get nominated this year, did you? (Changed from [You didn't get nominated last year either, did you?] in the original release) Oh, that's right. You're doing that children's exercise program, trying to play nice.\nPowers:\nAh, yeah, that's me. Thankfully I still have a job...\nOldbag:\nI love that show, and you're a hoot! You're the \"big brother\" character, right? Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You're that giant rabbit! (Changed from [Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You ended up with a rabbit face.] in the original release) What a work of art, but that's how it is, you know? I mean, if you didn't wear the mask, who knows how many TVs you'd break? Really, and shame on those kids exercising around you. They're getting what they deserve. This is why I thought you shouldn't be anywhere...\nPhoenix:\nUm... What are you doing here?\nOldbag:\nLook at my uniform and tell me you can't tell I'm a member of security!\nMaya:\nBut that outfit...\nOldbag:\nAnnoying, noisy brats get the blaster!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nSecond floor\nMaya:\nWow, it looks like there's a fancy restaurant on the second floor!\nPhoenix:\nYou STILL feel like eating?\nMaya:\nI mean, since we're here, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't pull the \"since we're here\" trick on me...)\nPearl:\nWhat a beautiful mansion. Do you live in this wonderful world every day, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, this is my first time in a place like this.\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to say these cameras were set up to cover the post-ceremony stage show.\nMaya:\nBut I wonder where everyone's gone, abandoning their cameras like this...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess something big must have happened...)\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage for the post-ceremony stage show.\nPowers:\nThere was supposed to be a press meeting after the show, but now...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like no one will hear what the Nickel Samurai had to confess after all.\nSeats\nMaya:\nWe're here, so we might as well take some pictures. OK, everyone, sit in a chair!\nPhoenix:\nBut we're all out of film...\nMaya:\nDon't worry about it. There's a zillion cameras over there we can borrow.\nPhoenix:\nHey, hey! You can't just go and \"borrow\" an expensive professional camera like that!\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nMaya:\nWhat incident? What did you do?\nOldbag:\nI didn't do anything, you young'un! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I plead the fifth.\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me!?\nOldbag:\nI thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.\nMaya:\nYou? A bodyguard?\nOldbag:\nFor your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles.\nMaya:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth?\nOldbag:\nBut...\nEdgeworth:\nThat sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me.\nOldbag:\nThat's what he said to me. What did I ever do to deserve that!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nWhat happened?\nMaya:\nUm... So, did something happen?\nOldbag:\nI don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those \"incidents\" happened again.\nPowers:\nA-An \"incident\"? Like a \"murder\" kind of \"incident\"?\nOldbag:\nMaybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, showers of blood are sure to follow. Bet you didn't know that! (Changed from [So wherever I go, a rain of blood will come pouring down. Bet you didn't know that!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUm, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake?\nOldbag:\nSilence, whippersnapper!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nThese eyes of mine are real pros now!\nPhoenix:\n\"Pros\"? Pros at doing what?\nOldbag:\nAt doing police work, of course! My eyes are like a hawk! And my professional eyes spot a messy incident! A messy, bloody incident! That's why I don't have time for you meddling kids and your petty little things!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\n...Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it? I don't like that devilish smile playing on your lips...\nMaya:\nLet's make like we're going to the bathroom, and check things out!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way. The police told us not go [sic] anywhere, remember?\nMaya:\nHuh!? How B-O-R-I-N-G! You're such a boring guy! You've got no motivation! No spirit!\nPearl:\nHuh? What? What's going on? Are you giving Mystic Maya trouble again, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Not you too, Pearls... Please don't stick your little nose into this one...)\nMaya:\nSo listen to this, Pearly. This one time at lawyer camp, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nO-OK! I get it! Let's go take a look.\nMaya:\nYay! I know you couldn't say no to me, Nick!\nPearl:\nThat's right. You'd walk over miles of hot coals for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That would be EVERY time we work a case together...)\nMaya:\nWell, what are we waiting for? Let's go already! You can come along too, Pearly.\nPearl:\nGoody! I get to come! I get to come!\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nThere's nothing really out of the ordinary here...\nPearl:\nAre you looking for the \"in-si-dent\" that the old lady was talking about? (Changed from [Are you looking for the 'something' that the old lady was talking about?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't look like it happened here. Well, we'd better go look somewhere else.\nMaya:\nAlright! Then, let's try...\nBellboy:\nExcuse me.\nMaya:\nAck!\nBellboy:\nAre you by chance, Ms. Maya Fey?\nMaya:\nUm, yeah... That's me.\nBellboy:\nYou have a phone call waiting for you at the front desk.\nMaya:\nA call? I wonder if it's someone from Kurain Village...\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mystic Maya?\nMaya:\nOh, nothing. You guys go on ahead and I'll be right there, OK? (Changed from [Oh, nothing. I'll just go on ahead to check it out, OK?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nOK.\nBellboy:\nRight this way, Ms. Fey.\nPearl:\nLet's go look somewhere else now, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, OK.\nPearl:\nThis is a little exciting... And a little scary...\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of.\nChandelier\nPearl:\nSo, that's called a \"shan-deh leer\", right?\nPhoenix:\nYup.\nPearl:\nWhat is that for? What does it do?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's for lighting up a room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? Can I look down now? My neck hurts...\nTables at the back\nPhoenix:\nThey haven't cleaned up all the food yet. There's a sad feeling hanging in the air now that the party is over...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nIt's a feast fit for a king!\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPearl:\nIt was the first time I ate that food. What was it called again? I think it started with \"key\". Key... Wee?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, a \"kiwi\".\nPearl:\nI don't know what to say. It's a sweet but sour fruit all in one.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nHotel Lobby\nExamine\nSecond floor\nPhoenix:\nA lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. But right now, the only thing filling this enormous room is anxiety about the murder. ...I really hope nothing else bad happens here...\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nThese cameras must belong to the press that came to cover the conference. They're all basically doing the same thing: staring at the empty stage.\nSeats\nPhoenix:\nSeats for the spectators of the post-ceremony show and the press conference. But it's too bad neither event is going to be held now.\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nPearl:\nUm, I guess you must have done something... um... \"deh-plor-ible\"...\nOldbag:\n\"Deplorable!?\" I would never do such a thing! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm...

TOLD. YOU. I get people the info they want! Which means that I've got a right to know!\nNope! Don't care who you are, pal, we're still investigating, so you can't go in!\nWhat's yer problem!? Just ya wait! It'll be all over the morning paper! \"Scruffy Detective's Secret Scandal Revealed!\" You'll see! I'll git ya back!\nPearl:\nThose two sound pretty serious...\nPhoenix:\n(That southern accent can only mean...)\nHey, Wright!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey... Lotta...\nLotta:\nCome on, do a gal a favor and tell this cop I'm just doin' my job and I've got rights...\nGumshoe:\nAh, YOU!\nPhoenix:\nAh... Detective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, help a guy out! Tell her that only the police are allowed here! This is the scene of a murder, so she should leave this to us pros...\nPearl:\nA... A murder!?\nGumshoe:\nAw, shoot! Me and my big mouth!\nLotta:\nSee! I knew it! My gut instinct told me so! I always trust my gut! A murder, it said! And that's what it is! A genuine murder!\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, wait...\nYeehaw, a murder! Of a big star, no less!\nGumshoe:\nOh, man... I'm in trouble now...\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nSo... Detective Gumshoe... A murder...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, no, that's not it. I got my facts mixed up for a second there, pal.\nPearl:\nU-Um... Mr. Nick? Is the dead person the Nickel Samurai...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Why do you ask?\nPearl:\nWell, Mystic Maya was rooting for him, so...\nGumshoe:\nIt wasn't the Nickel Samurai that got bumped. Actually, the Nickel Samurai is the one under suspicion of doing the bumping off...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nThe guy that died was this hero named the Jammin' Ninja, pal.\nPhoenix:\nThe Jammin' Ninja...\nLotta Hart\nPearl:\nUm, that woman with the big puffy hair that looks like cotton candy...\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Lotta?\nPearl:\nThat woman... She was there that time too, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat time?\nPearl:\n...When Mystic Maya did that channeling...\nPhoenix:\nOh, that time... Well, Lotta's a journalist, so that's why she was there.\nPearl:\nJer-nal-ist...\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like she was hanging around here before the murder happened.\nPhoenix:\n\"Hanging around\"...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, hiding in wait in front of the Jammin' Ninja's door, pal.\nPhoenix:\nB-But why would she...?\nGumshoe:\nShe wouldn't tell me, pal. Just said something about \"Gettin' my big scoop\"...\nPhoenix:\n(Scoop? What sort of news could she be after...?)\nThe victim (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nSo the victim was the Jammin' Ninja?\nPearl:\nMr. Jammin' Ninja...?\nGumshoe:\nHe was on a really popular rival TV show to \"The Nickel Samurai\".\nPearl:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nThe victim was the action star, Juan Corrida. He got a huge push and rode the express train to stardom. I mean, even I know who he is!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, even I recognize his face...)\nGumshoe:\nBut I heard lately that Matt Engarde's been taking the wind out of his sail. I'm telling you, pal, as far as who's popular, those two are hogging all the limelight.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess there's no space for Mr. Powers at all, huh... Poor guy...)\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde... Um... That's the Nickel Samurai, right...?\nGumshoe:\nYup. I mean, no! You've got to say it with more umph! \"The Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n...Anyway, so now that Juan Corrida's gone, that means Mr. Engarde has the whole stage to himself, wouldn't you say?\nGumshoe:\nI wouldn't bet on it, pal. We can't have that happen, you know?\nPhoenix:\n\"Can't have that happen\"? (What's that supposed to mean, I wonder...)\nArrested? (appears after presenting Matt Engarde profile)\nPhoenix:\nWh-Why was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's not something I can tell you. We just started the investigation, so we don't want any leaks.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like yet another \"Steel Samurai\" hero is in hot water...)\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick... If Mystic Maya knew about this...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know. She'd make me take this case... I know...\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI was really shocked by what happened to her in that one case. I didn't know she had such an awesome power!\nPearl:\nAwesome power...?\nGumshoe:\nI thought maybe I should do some self-improvement and take up a hobby. So I went out and bought some Morning Glory seeds and planted them, pal.\nPhoenix:\n...That's a good way to improve yourself.\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. Well, it's nothing really...\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nThat girl is number three on my \"People I've Seen A Lot Of Lately\" list.\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then who's number one...?\nGumshoe:\nAs if you need to ask. It's YOU, pal!\nPhoenix:\nA-Ah... So who's number two?\nGumshoe:\nMaya Fey. ...But it looks like she's not around this time.\nPearl:\nIt must be nice to be such good friends with each other, isn't it Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think that's the real meaning of Detective Gumshoe's list...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nI look good! I think I've lost some weight, pal!\nPhoenix:\nIt's only wishful thinking.\nGumshoe:\nWishful thinking, huh? ... In that case, I wishfully think I've lost some weight!\nPhoenix:\n(I wishfully think he might face the facts one day...)\nGumshoe:\nLately, I've been on the instant noodles only diet, pal!\nJuan Corrida profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm not a real fan of action shows or anything... But I know who Juan Corrida and Matt Engarde are.\nPhoenix:\nYou can't talk about one without talking about the other, I guess.\nGumshoe:\nThey even debuted around the same time. So they have this real fiery rivalry with each other. Kinda like you and me, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(I never knew he thought of me as a rival...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nThe Nickel Samurai! He really took the Grand Prix tonight!\nPhoenix:\nMaya's a big fan of his.\nGumshoe:\nReally? ...Oh, I'm sorry then.\nPearl:\nWhy are you sorry?\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde was just arrested, pal. ...On suspicion of murdering Juan Corrida.\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nAny evidence\nPhoenix:\nWould you take a look at this for me?\nGumshoe:\nListen, pal... I'm not leaking any info about the evidence to you this time. If I do, my salary's really gonna get it... And then I won't even be able to get those instant noodles down at the discount market!\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nDo you know this person?\nGumshoe:\nYou meet a lot of people as a detective, pal. So we make extra sure to not forget people because that's our job. ...Now, having said that, I don't remember ever seeing this person before.\nPearl:\nWhich means that you're kind of forgetful, aren't you Mr. Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThat's not what it means... Not exactly anyway...\nAfter clearing \"The victim\" and \"Arrested?\" Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Hallway:\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPowers:\nHey! So what's going on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Juan Corrida has been killed.\nPowers:\nWh-Wh-What!? Juan is... He's...!?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde.\nPowers:\nY-You're joking, right!?\nPhoenix:\nNope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja.\nPowers:\nOoogh... Not again... I feel sick.\nPearl:\n\"Again\"...?\nPhoenix:\n...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls.\nPowers:\nI still can't believe... No way... No way Matt would...\nPhoenix:\n(...? What's Mr. Powers got in his hand...?)\nPowers:\n...Oh, before I forget... This... This is for you, Mr. Wright. I got this from the bellboy that came by earlier.\nRadio Transceiver received from Mr. Powers.\nPhoenix:\n...For me...? But why?\nPowers:\nI don't know. All he said was it was for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney.\nTalk\nMatt and Juan\nPowers:\nMatt is the most energetic and active actor out there right now. The Nickel Samurai really sealed his place as a pop idol, but... he kept adding fuel to the fire of his rivalry with Juan anyway.\nPearl:\nMr. Juan... He's the Jammin' Ninja, right?\nPowers:\nThose two would butt heads over everything they could think of. But I'd say that Matt was the one who almost always came out on top.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess some people only know how to relate to others by butting heads like a ram...)\nPowers:\nJuan said that he'd take Matt on this time too, so he joined a rival TV show.\nPearl:\nAnd that was \"The Jammin' Ninja\"...?\nPowers:\nThe stylish Nickel Samurai and the burning Jammin' Ninja... Well, things turned messy real fast with those two using their shows for their \"war\". And the final tally... Look around... It's pretty obvious how things ended up.\nPhoenix:\n(Matt even won the Grand Prix this year... The final win over his rival, I guess...)\nPress conference\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde was going to hold a press conference, wasn't he?\nPowers:\nThat's what I heard. Though if you wanted to get technical about it, it was the Nickel Samurai's conference.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai's...?\nPowers:\nYeah. He was supposed to wear his costume and give the press conference that way.\nPhoenix:\nHe was going to be in costume...? But why? (Changed from [So he was supposed to be in-costume...? But why?] in the original release)\nPowers:\nI'm not sure... They don't keep me in the loop anymore.\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nPowers:\nIt was almost right after you guys left. An old man who's a bellboy at this hotel showed up.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when he told you to give this to me...?\nPowers:\nYeah...\nPhoenix:\n(Why... Why give me this transceiver...?)\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nHey, where did Maya go off to?\nPhoenix:\nShe got a phone call.\nPowers:\nOh yeah, that's right. She was heading for the front desk just now. She sure stands out in a crowd, doesn't she?\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, then they're all shocked because they figure out who I am...\nPearl:\nI think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Mr. Powers is getting teary eyed.)\nJuan Corrida profile\nPowers:\nHe debuted around the same time as Matt in everything, you know.\nPearl:\nReally?\nPowers:\nYeah, it started out small... First it was singing contests, then swimming competitions... Then it was bowling tournaments, and then it was who could throw the best New Year's parties... Juan was always trying to one-up Matt. But lately, those two were escalating to more and more dangerous things... I thought that no good would come of it all, so I began to worry.\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad Juan's story ended so soon...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nPowers:\nMatt's younger than me, but you can practically see his star potential.\nPearl:\nHis star po-ten-shial...?\nPowers:\nI got his autograph the other day.\nPhoenix:\n...Feels kind of wrong now, doesn't it?\nPowers:\nI don't care what people say! Matt didn't kill Juan! I know he didn't!\nAny other profile\nPowers:\nUmm... I'm honored you're asking me, But I have no idea who this person is. Umm... Sorry...\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPearl:\nUm... I was just wondering... Where's Mystic Maya? She's been gone a long time.\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, she was only going to answer a phone call...)\nPearl:\nMaybe she got lost. I'll take a quick look around for her.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nPearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I... I'm not sure... (It's coming from this transceiver...) (Changed from [Did this transceiver just...?] in the original release)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, hello? Wright here...\n???:\nIs this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney?\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are...!?\n???:\nYou don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMaya:\nHeeelp! Niiiiick!\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\nMaya...?\n???:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Wouldn't you agree that the more important issue is the fate of the girl?\nPhoenix:\n(Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?) Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?\n???:\nCome now. Don't fall apart on me yet.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This... No! This can't be!)\n???:\nNow that I have your attention, Mr. Attorney, I have a modest proposal for you. If you do what I require, then I will return to you your valuable \"item\" unharmed. ...What is this called again in your fancy lawyer terms?\nPhoenix:\n...\"Kidnapping for ransom\"...\n???:\nYes, that's it. This is a kidnapping.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nPhoenix:\n(M-My sight... Everything's fading away... Maya... Maya... Maya's been kidnapped!)\n???:\n...--re you there? Mr. Attorney, are you there? (Changed from [You there? Mr. Wright, are you there?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nH-How much!? How much do you want!?\n???:\nVery good, Mr. Attorney. I'm glad you have such a good grasp of the situation.\nPhoenix:\nHurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya--\n???:\nMoney is not what I seek.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\n???:\nWhat I want is a certain verdict. I would like a complete acquittal.\nPhoenix:\nComplete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!?\n???:\nI am not the person you will be representing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\n???:\nYou are currently at the Gatewater Hotel, are you not? And I know that a murder has just taken place there.\nPhoenix:\nJuan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde...\n???:\nYou are, as expected, quite on top of things, Mr. Attorney. Now then. What I want is very simple. I want you to obtain a complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nM-Matt Engarde? But why?\n???:\nHe did not kill anyone. I can attest to that. However...\nPhoenix:\nH-However!? However what!?\n???:\nHowever, someone is framing him for the murder. A very smart someone who is setting him up to take the fall...\nPhoenix:\n... (If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?)\n???:\nYou are, of course, at liberty to take me at my word or not. (Changed from [You are, of course, at liberty to believe me or not.] in the original release) However, there is one thing you can take as fact. Right now, your very precious \"item\" is with me, in my possession.\nMaya:\nMmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\n???:\nYou have two days. Of course, tonight, he will be in questioning with the police. But the trial is in two days. At that trial, you will win a not guilty verdict. Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nO-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!?\n???:\nYes, exactly. I don't believe I was wrong in choosing you, so don't let me down.\nPhoenix:\nAagh!\n???:\nOh, yes, that's right. Now that I am playing the role of the kidnapper, I can't pass up this chance to say, \"And don't even think about callin' the cops!\" ...Hmm, not great, but you get the idea.\nPhoenix:\nD-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!?\n???:\nAlright, I'll tell you that much. My name is... ...De Killer.\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Wh-Where is Mystic Maya!?\nPhoenix:\n...She's been kidnapped.\nPearl:\nN-No... ... It's all my fault! If only I had gone with Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault, Pearls.\nPearl:\nBut it is! It is! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nPowers:\nMr. Wright... I think we... I think we should tell the police what it's [sic] going on...!\nPhoenix:\n(No! We can't do that! If we do, who knows what will happen to Maya...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What about the detective we saw earlier...?\nPhoenix:\n(...Detective Gumshoe!) Yes, that's it! Wait here, and I'll be right back!\nPowers:\nAlright! I'll take care of Pearl while you're away!\nHallway\nGumshoe:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANSOM!?\nPhoenix:\nShhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nGumshoe:\nWait, the deal is \"complete acquittal\" in exchange for Maya, you mean...? Then this means Matt Engarde is obviously the killer, pal! No doubt about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent...\nGumshoe:\nYou really believe what a KIDNAPPER tells you, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd on top of everything else, there's all this evidence we keep finding.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nThe forensics team's having a field day back there. (Changed from [The guys with the eagle eyes are really lapping it up like they just caught a huge fish.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nGumshoe:\nBut it's strange. There's so much evidence that it feels like something's wrong.\nPhoenix:\nThere's too much evidence? Is that possible? (Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being \"set-up\"...?)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, looks like you won't be leaving here tonight, pal. Just sit tight and cooperate with the investigation. Tomorrow you can start yours.\nPhoenix:\n...A-Alright... (Isn't there another way...?)\nGumshoe:\nWe've also got to be careful about pushing the kidnapper the wrong way.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right...\nDate:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0???\nMaya:\nNnngh... Oww, my head... (Wh-Where... Where am I!? I wonder if I'm still in that hotel... Wh-What happened to me...?) Nick... Pearly! ... (Come on, you guys. This isn't funny anymore...)\n...*ka-click*...\n???:\nI see you have awoken.\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you!?\n???:\nMe? ...I am known as \"De Killer\".\nMaya:\n\"D-De Killer\"!? You mean like an \"ASSASSIN\"!? (I... I'm too young to die!)\n???:\nDon't worry. You are not my target. ...For now anyway.\nMaya:\nA-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nick! Nick! Where are you!? ...Help me...\n???:\nYes, that's right. Only one person can save you now, and that is Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\n...Huh? Wh-What? Nick... Nick's going to save me...?\n???:\nCalm down and be a good girl. Think of this as a business transaction.\nMaya:\nA... A business transaction?\n???:\nI am going to contact him now. I hope you'll cooperate and play your assigned role well.\nMaya:\n...Nick... What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearly... (Changed from [What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearls...] in the original release) ...Sis...\n???:\n... Is this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney? ... You don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMarch 21, 8:11 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPearl:\nGood morning!\nPhoenix:\nAh, morning, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mr. Nick! Come on! Let's hurry and go see Mr. Engarde!\nPhoenix:\nWe have to wait a bit, Pearls. Visiting hours don't start until 9 AM, so...\nPearl:\nOh, I see. Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I had gone with you... (Changed from [Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I went with you that time...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls... She's been like this since last night... We managed to get home somehow, yesterday evening... Thanks to Detective Gumshoe gently holding her by the hand and leading her here... But by the looks of it, I don't think Pearls got any sleep at all last night.)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mystic Maya... She's alright, right!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she's alright. Either way, I'm going to save her. You can trust me on that.\nPearl:\nPlease... Please... Help her...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm only able to stay this calm and collected... Because Pearls is doing the crying for the both of us...)\nExamine\nAnywhere\nPhoenix:\n...No matter where I look in this familiar space I call my office... No, I can't let my mind wander now! I don't have the time! I've got to get going on this case!\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPearl:\nUm... I have a thought...\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nPearl:\nYou're going to represent Mr. Engarde... aren't you?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I don't really seem to have a choice.\nPearl:\nUm, but what if... What if he... ...is the real murderer? What would you do then, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWould you fight to get a not guilty for a murderer to save Mystic Maya...?\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Let's talk to Mr. Engarde first, OK? ...We can think all the bad things we want, but it doesn't change a thing.\nPearl:\nY-Yeah, you're right... I'm sorry. I... I can't stop thinking about it...\nMaya's situation\nPhoenix:\nPearls... You're really worried about Maya, aren't you?\nPearl:\nI... I don't have anyone else left in this world.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean...?\nPearl:\nMy family's all gone...\nPhoenix:\n(...Her family...)\nPearl:\nMy father... He left my mother and the village behind and went away.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry...\nPearl:\nAnd... my mother... She did that thing... all for me...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nMystic Maya... She's like a sister to me... ... She is all I have left in this world...\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nPearls...?\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(She looks out of it... Maybe I should leave her alone...)\nMarch 21, 8:57 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(We couldn't wait for visiting hours to start, so Pearls and I came down here early... To visit one Nickel Samurai, charged with the murder of the Jammin' Ninja...)\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nG-Good morning. How are you today?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI know this situation might be a little tough for you...\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... We're...\nEngarde:\nOh, sorry dude...\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nI already signed up...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me...?\nEngarde:\nI already have life insurance. I signed up a long time ago cause my job is, you know...\nPhoenix:\n... Oh! No no no... We're not insurance salespeople!\nEngarde:\nReally...? Dude, I really don't need that right now either.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nFire extinguishers. I mean, this building isn't my house, so...\nPhoenix:\n... No no no... We're not here to sell you fire extinguishers either! I'm a lawyer. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nEngarde:\nA lawyer...? ... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my manager, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nThe Nickel Samurai sure is a strange person, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(I think \"strange\" is an understatement.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. You're just in time.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\nEngarde:\nYou're a lawyer dude, right? My manager's looking for a good one right now, so how about it?\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! This is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to make him let me take his case! I have to!)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera. Mr. Engarde keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nSorry to intrude, but I would like to ask you a few personal questions.\nEngarde:\nUm, that's OK, but dude, my autobiography's coming out soon, so... If I say stuff without the publisher's approval, then I'm gonna be in real hot water... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my publisher, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde is so lucky! He has so many people he can talk to.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... I don't know if he actually has anyone he can really talk to...)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. Like I thought, the publisher said it'd be \"real bad\" if I said anything, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(Does he have a mind of his own!?)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, I would like to ask you about the murder...\nEngarde:\nOh, are you covering this for a tabloid as a side job, dude? Um, um... Well, if you want my statement on this, you should ask through my staff...\nPhoenix:\nNo no no... I'm not asking on behalf of a tabloid...\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the president of the studio, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nIs he alright, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(If we're talking about Mr. Engarde's brain here, I wouldn't put my money on it.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. The studio president said, \"Even Neo Mt. Fuji itself knows that I'm not the murderer!\"\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? What's \"Neo Mt. Fuji\"...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a mountain in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo; the city the Nickel Samurai protects.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, this is an attorney's badge.\nEngarde:\nDude, I'm sorry, but I don't have the free time to be looking at things like that.\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nEngarde:\nI'm much too busy with Nickel Samurai stuff right now.\nEngarde:\nI don't have the time to take a lawyer's correspondence course...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does he believe I'm a salesman!? Insurance, then extinguishers... Now this!!)\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\n...? What's that?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a ticket for the press conference. You were going to give one after winning the Grand Prix, right?\nEngarde:\nHuh? Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. While you were in costume, no less. ([in costume] hyphenated in the original release)\nEngarde:\nUm, I never heard anything like that, dude. I only heard about the stage show. I always leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't know...? That's odd...)\nRadio Transceiver\nPearl:\n...Mr. Nick? What are you going to do with that?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know yet, but I figured I could at least show it to him...\nEngarde:\nIs that a transceiver? Hey, it looks like a real nice one, too.\nPhoenix:\nI got it as a \"present\" from someone.\nEngarde:\nHmm? Interesting.\nPhoenix:\nI've also been instructed to take your case.\nEngarde:\nIs that what you heard from the transceiver?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nEngarde:\nDude, that's terrible! Don't let some disembodied voice boss you around!\nPhoenix:\n(This coming from a man with a cell phone on his wrist...)\nWill Powers profile\nEngarde:\nI've seen him somewhere before... Is he a member of my fan club?\nPhoenix:\nThat's Mr. Powers. Isn't he supposed to be kind of like a mentor to you?\nEngarde:\nPowers...? Oh yeah! He's the guy on that kid's exercise program. I gave him an autograph just the other day.\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't see Mr. Powers as a mentor at all...)\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nMan, it's too bad he's dead...\nPhoenix:\nYou killed him... That's the most logical conclusion, don't you agree?\nEngarde:\nDude, what are you talking about!? You're making a huge mistake.\nPhoenix:\nIf that's such a mistake, then why did they issue an arrest warrant for you!?\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the guy in charge of this place, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nStars sure know a lot of people, don't they?\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that phone even really gets reception in here...)\nEngarde:\n...Um, I guess you're right about the warrant after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we might be making some progress here!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nEngarde:\nYeah... I'm such a handsome devil.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um, yeah...\nEngarde:\nAnd I'm way good at sports! Karate, tennis, judo, soccer, football, hockey, fencing... Dude, it's no wonder I'm so popular.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um, yeah... (You're also good at sitting in a jail cell, Mr. Popular.)\nAny other evidence\nEngarde:\nDude, I know I like to throw money around, but it's not like I buy anything and everything.\nPhoenix:\n(That's nice, because it's not up for sale anyway!)\nAny other profile\nEngarde:\nUm, dude, this person looks like a member of my fan club. Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the fan club president, OK? ... ...\nPhoenix:\nUm, \"dude\", you know what...? Forget I asked...\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Press Conference Ticket and Radio Transceiver:\nEngarde:\n... ...Well, dude, I think it's about time for me to get going.\nPhoenix:\nPlease, wait! ...I really need to take your case!\nEngarde:\nThere's always other people in need of a lawyer, right? Want me to introduce you to a few?\nPearl:\nPlease! Please let Mr. Nick represent you!\nEngarde:\nMan, oh man. Lawyers these days. Now you dudes use kids to pull in clients, too?\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't take me as your lawyer, then De Killer is going to...!\nEngarde:\n... Wait... What did you just say?\nPhoenix:\n\"De Killer\"...\nEngarde:\nD-De Killer!?\nPhoenix:\n(...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...)\nEngarde:\n... Alright, dude. I accept your terms.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEngarde:\nI'll let you represent me in court.\nPearl:\nW-We did it! We did it, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...)\nEngarde:\nGo ahead, ask me anything. I'll help out as much as I can...\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nEngarde:\nMan, I thank my lucky stars that people know my name.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're quite the hero, and you're in the national spotlight.\nPearl:\nI didn't know who he is... Does that mean I'm not a good citizen...?\nEngarde:\nAh, it's really great to be the Nickel Samurai. Dude, lately, I just keep on getting more and more popular.\nPhoenix:\n(True enough... \"The Nickel Samurai\" is very popular among high schoolers and secretaries right now. I guess Mr. Engarde has a way of catching the eyes of women...)\nEngarde:\nDo you know my motto? \"Refreshing like a spring breeze.\" That's what I am.\nPearl:\nA spring breeze...\nEngarde:\nThat's why this kind of scandal is disastrous, dude. I mean, even if I get out of here tomorrow, it's still gonna look bad.\nPhoenix:\n(But everyone loves a good scandal...) (Changed from [Everyone loves a good scandal...] in the original release)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me about your activities last night?\nEngarde:\nAfter I got the award, I took a break and went back to my room. I had that post-ceremony stage show to do. So I was in my Nickel Samurai costume.\nPhoenix:\nAnd you were alone the entire time?\nEngarde:\nMy manager was running around being busy, so yeah.\nPhoenix:\nBecause of the press conference you were supposed to have after the show?\nEngarde:\nI told you, dude. I have no idea about any press conference, alright?\nPhoenix:\n(That's strange... I thought the Nickel Samurai was going to confess something...)\nEngarde:\nAnyway, when I was leaving my room, that's when I noticed it was kinda noisy...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida was already dead at that time...?\nEngarde:\nYeah, that's what I gathered anyway from my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm beginning to gather that this guy can't do a thing on his own...) (Changed from [With the way he's always talking about his manager, it's as if she runs his life.] in the original release)\nEngarde:\nAnd that's when the detective in the green coat showed up. He searched me... And then, out of the blue, the dude arrested me.\nThe victim (appears after \"Matt Engarde\")\nPhoenix:\nAbout you and the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida, what sort of...\nEngarde:\nThat's got nothing to do with anything, dude. Man, with that face of his, you can't even tell he's the same age as me. And he wanted to try making a \"Jammin' Ninja\" movie, even though we all know it'd fail.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai still won in the end, right?\nEngarde:\nYeah. I took the Grand Prix by storm. So why would I, the winner, have any reason to kill the guy anyway? Dude, you'd think it'd be the other way around, you know?\nThe charge of murder (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know why you were arrested?\nEngarde:\nI guess maybe my full body search went badly.\nPhoenix:\nDid they find something on you?\nEngarde:\nThey found a button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nPhoenix:\nA button...?\nEngarde:\nI don't get it either. It was caught in the pleats of my samurai pants, or \"hakama\".\nPearl:\nAaah!\nEngarde:\nDude, I really think someone planted it there though. I'm serious.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that's what really happened...?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nPearl:\nLet's ask one last thing. Let's test Mr. Engarde to see if he really is innocent or not...\nPhoenix:\nW-We can do that...?\nPearl:\nYes. If you use this...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's Magatama!)\nPearl:\nHe won't be able to hide any secrets from you, Mr. Nick. I'm sure of it.\nPhoenix:\n(I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly.\nEngarde:\nWhat is it, dude?\nPhoenix:\nDid you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nPlease put the phone away and answer this question yourself.\nEngarde:\nAlright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWell, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nNothing. Not a chain or lock in sight.\nPearl:\nWhich means... I think it is alright to trust him.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.)\nEngarde:\nUm... The trial's tomorrow, right? I'm counting on you, dude.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 21, 11:34 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWell, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important...\nPearl:\nSo! So now what should we do!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer.\nPearl:\nOK! Then let's start looking!\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Actually, the crime happened at the recently completed hotel in the center of town, the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. ...Just how far are they going to expand their empire...?\nCharley the plant\nPearl:\nOh! I'll water it!\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK... I already did that...\nPearl:\n...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...)\nPoster\nPearl:\nThis is the Nickel Samurai... right?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's right.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!?\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.\nPearl:\nOh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either...\nPhoenix:\nI-It's OK, Pearls. Really.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh! I cleaned it up some more for you last night! ...Because I couldn't sleep...\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSince there were no Psyche-Locks, then that means we can trust Mr. Engarde to be innocent.\nPearl:\nI really feel much better knowing that. Ever since last night, I was so worried that I kept wondering... \"What if he is the real killer...? What then...?\"\nAny ideas\nPhoenix:\nHey, I have something I want to ask you, Pearls.\nPearl:\nOK, what is it?\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you so interested in how Maya and I get along? I mean, she and I don't have anything special go--\nPearl:\nHuh!? Wh-What do you mean!? B-But I thought... I thought you and Mystic Maya were... I-I've been mistaken all this time!? No way...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aaaah! She really wasn't kidding! Pearls actually believes Maya and I are... ...Maybe I should've just left it alone...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Stop it! Don't hide your true feelings from me!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! She slapped me!!)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPearl:\nThat's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nI guess?\nPearl:\nI feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...)\nMaya Fey profile\nPearl:\nOh, Mystic Maya... I wonder if you're alright...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure she's OK. We have to be patient for just one more day. I'm sure we can save her. Trust me.\nPearl:\nIf there's anything I can do, please tell me, OK!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPearl:\nTo tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me.\nPhoenix:\nI think your hair now suits you perfectly.\nPearl:\nR-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget*\nPhoenix:\n*fidget, fidget*\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPearl:\nI'm sure that Mr. Detective would be our ally if we asked!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I think so too. (Looking back, we've known each other for a while now... He's always been trustworthy... A bit \"off\", but still trustworthy. What a paradox.)\nWill Powers profile\nPearl:\nHe's a really kind and nice old man, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is really perceptive when it comes to people... But what does she mean by \"old man\"...?) Hey, Pearls? What about me...?\nPearl:\nWhat about you, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, I don't think I want to hear this...)\nAnything else\nPearl:\nUm, there are still so many things in this world that I don't understand yet. ...Honestly, I still don't have enough training.\nPhoenix:\nAh, no, it's OK. I don't have any ideas myself...\nPearl:\nI'm sorry. I'm really sorry!\nMarch 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEngarde:\nAh, the lawyer dude. So what did you find out?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... I'm still in the middle of investigating...\nEngarde:\nI see. ...But I've already told you everything I know, dude.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\nDude, like I told you, I don't know anything about that press conference. I leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(...This is harder than pulling bass from a river...)\nRadio Transceiver\nEngarde:\nSo, why are you carrying around that transceiver...?\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about it.\nEngarde:\nAnd why do you do everything it tells you to do? You know, the messages it sends you, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, he probably doesn't have anything to do with Maya's kidnapping.) ...That's a secret.\nEngarde:\nOK, whatever, dude.\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nLook, dude, I didn't kill him. I mean, the Nickel Samurai kicked the Jammin' Ninja's butt, right? So it's not like I felt threatened by the likes of him.\nPearl:\nBeing rivals sounds like a sad way to relate to another person...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nOldbag:\nHey! What do you think you're doing!? You can't come in without...\nPearl:\nGood morning.\nOldbag:\nHold on, it's YOU! What is going on around here!?\nPhoenix:\nU-Uh... Um...\nOldbag:\nI heard poor Juan was killed. Is that true!? It's a bad rerun is what this is. Another \"Steel Samurai\" doing the most evil of deeds.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you know... That's not entirely...\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know that I was a huge fan of Juan's! Why, oh why, do all the stars I'm interested in drop one by one like flies!? It's always been that way! Ever since I was a little girl in elementary school! The class hamster was fine until it was my turn to clean its cage, and then it died! The other kids started calling me the \"Queen Reaper\". I swear that's what they dubbed me! \"Whoever you name in your evil spell dies within three minutes,\" they would taunt.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened...\nOldbag:\nHmph! Don't push me, boy!\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? I... Um... I couldn't hear everything she said... because she was talking too fast...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...?\nOldbag:\nDon't boss me around, you spiky-haired, smarty-pants!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but...\nPearl:\n...Even Mr. Engarde himself didn't seem to know, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(How does the person who's supposed to give a conference not know about it...?)\nTalk\nThe victim\nOldbag:\nMy dear Hammer died a year ago in that dreadful murder. And only recently did I finally find a star that makes this heart go *badump* again.\nPhoenix:\n...I don't know what to say...\nOldbag:\nI ask you, why does every star I cheer for always ends [sic] up kicking the bucket?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nI'd watch your words! No one's going to get away with saying anything bad about my Juan!\nPhoenix:\nBut I haven't said anything...\nOldbag:\nWell, I don't believe a word that woman says anyway!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What woman?\nOldbag:\nThat irritating, backwater girl with the afro and the horrible country accent. I mean, what is that manner of speaking supposed to be? And why does she never stop? Honestly, women these days. They don't know the meaning of the word \"modesty\". When I was a young maiden, I was so beautiful even the flowers of the field blushed. But despite this, I pressed flowers, or read the stars, or wrote beautiful love poems or\nPhoenix:\n...Pearls? Are you thirsty?\nPearl:\nUm, a little.\nPhoenix:\nOK. I'll go get you some juice or something.\nPearl:\nTh-Thank you very much.\nOldbag:\nHey! Are you paying attention!? Young'uns today!\nPhoenix:\n(So I'm guessing Ms. Oldbag heard everything from Lotta...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nI want to ask you about what happened around the time of the murder...\nOldbag:\nAh, I don't know anything about that. I was here getting ready.\nPhoenix:\nGetting ready? For what...?\nOldbag:\nThe show, of course! ...Well, and the press conference afterwards.\nPhoenix:\n(Cue mysterious music for the magical press conference.)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I don't know anything about the murder.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see...\nOldbag:\n... But.\nPhoenix:\n?\nOldbag:\nBut if you're talking about what I saw, that's different. I saw it very clearly!\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nOldbag:\nI saw the most important moment of the night!\nWhat you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nTh-The most important moment!? You don't mean...!?\nOldbag:\nOh, so now you treat me with respect, you disrespectful child. When you speak to your elders, you should always be polite. Really, kids today.\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see!?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nOldbag:\nThe murder last night was gruesome, wasn't it? But then, what murder isn't?\nPhoenix:\n(Please don't stray onto another tangent... Please...)\nOldbag:\nIf you want to hear more, then show your respect and bring this lady a present!\nWhat you witnessed (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see on the night of the murder!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPearl:\nP-Please! Mystic Maya's life is...\nOldbag:\nAh, but you haven't given me my present yet. ...Hmm... Let's see... I'll only tell it to you if you can bring me Juan's autograph!\nPhoenix:\n(What an unreasonable request... You might as well have asked for the moon!)\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nI don't have anything to say to delinquents like you!\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr... She's clamming up like the old clam she is...)\nPearl:\nPlease! Anything would be helpful!\nOldbag:\nWell then, how about I tell you my measurements?\nPhoenix:\n...Um... No, that's okay... Really.\nPearl:\nShe really doesn't like you, does she Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI know, I know...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like the investigation is still in full swing. The hotel staff and the police are running around like a bunch of headless chickens.\nPearl:\nI wonder if we can do any investigating of our own in this kind of atmosphere...\nPhoenix:\n...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess.\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of, only to disappear... ...If only we had all gone together...\nChandelier\nPearl:\nThat is such a beautiful sight.\nPhoenix:\nThe chandelier?\nPearl:\nYes. But I can't believe it... I can't believe that such a terrible murder happened under such beautiful lights... It's shocking.\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was held on that stage just last night. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nWe ate at this table last night, didn't we?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nPearl:\nI was really happy then.\nPhoenix:\n(I wish I could make you smile again... Even for a second...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHallway\nLotta:\nHey! Yer here! Been waitin' for ya, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nLotta...\nLotta:\nHey! Mr. Cop fella! The thief's showed his face!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!?\nLotta:\nArrest him! Put him on trial! Find him guilty! Give him the death penalty!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong, Lotta!? Are you feeling alright?\nLotta:\nLooked here and there and up and down the mountain, but it ain't here! So why don'tcha just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep! (Changed from [So why don't ya just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep!] in the original release)\nPearl:\nUm, what are you looking for...?\nLotta:\nMy CAMERA! C-A-M-E-R-A! It's my life blood! I'm gonna die without my $700 camera!!\nPhoenix:\nY-Your camera...?\nLotta:\nLook, don't lots of people say the criminal always goes back to the scene of the crime!? And lookie lookie, here ya are!\nPhoenix:\nYep. Here I am... Faced with a Lotta trouble.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...?\nLotta:\nI didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nLotta:\nYeah, that's what I thought too, so I was a nice enough gal to lend a helpin' hand! ...Secretly, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(I have a feeling one of these days, I'm going to end up defending her in court...)\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\".\nLotta:\nSo that's the scene of the murder, I reckon. I thought somethin' had gone on that night, but I didn't never think it was murder.\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\".\nPearl:\nSo Mr. Engarde was here during his break, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what he claims. (Hmm... The crime scene... If he had wanted to get to Mr. Corrida's room... He would have had to pass through this hallway.)\nTalk\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!\nPearl:\nHuh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?\nLotta:\nI had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon. I made this itty-bitty scratch on it and the manager got all huffed up in the face... He gave me his talkin' to and was real mean about it too. He done made me cry at that!\nPearl:\nWhen did you lose your camera?\nLotta:\nLast night, after the murder happened. Musta been when I was busy runnin' around lookin' into things! That's when I lost sight of my dear, darlin' expensive sweetie!\nPhoenix:\nLotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours?\nLotta:\nI don't rightly know. I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?)\nLotta's Camera added to the Court Record.\nCamera (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!\nPearl:\nHuh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?\nLotta:\nI had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon.

So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nLotta, please tell me what you know about what happened at the time of the murder.\nLotta:\nWell, from before the ceremony last night, I was hangin' around here in this area. Yeah, actually I was here until around the time Mr. Engarde was arrested.\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you doing here...?\nLotta:\nYou sure you went to school, City Boy? Wherever Lotta Hart goes, there's a story to be found! A big scoop to be had!\nPhoenix:\nA big scoop...?\nLotta:\nI told ya before. I'm gonna be the best tabloid photographer the world's ever seen! Reckon course that means I'm always lookin' for the perfect shot!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what \"scoop\" she was after this time...?)\nLotta:\nAlthough, I was also on the look out for the other stars that were here, so... maybe I wasn't here the entire time...\nBig scoop (appears after \"Camera\" and \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nLotta... Are you sure you weren't here the entire time? So you could take a picture for your big scoop?\nLotta:\nWell... Maybe I was. But that's what real journalists do! I got some juicy inside info, so I thought to myself, why not get a picture for proof?\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of story was it that you would hang around here...?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nOops, sorry, Mr. Lawyer. Can't be tellin' you that. Trade secret, ya know?\nPhoenix:\n(Not again... Why does everyone have something to hide...?)\nPearl:\nWe've been stopped, haven't we?\nLotta:\nHa ha, yeah! Take that, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here is happy... Ms. Lotta and your \"I rule!\" smile...)\nBig scoop (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou were on the hunt for your big scoop last night?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nIt's just a bunch of tabloid photos. They ain't got nothing to do with the murder.\nPearl:\nIt looks like we have no choice but to remove the Psyche-Locks.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I guess so.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nLotta:\nHey, what's that? ...A press conference ticket? How come I ain't got myself one of them!?\nPhoenix:\nP-Please don't direct your anger at me...\nLotta:\nWhy in tarnations wasn't I invited to that!? How come someone on the bottom of the popularity chart like you got the info, but not me!? Info like that is worth nothin' to ya, am I right or what!?\nPhoenix:\n(...Is that the kind of person she thinks I am...?)\nPearl:\nAre you going to stand there and take that, Mr. Nick!?\nLotta's Camera\nLotta:\nNngh... And I just bought that camera... Who did it!? The thievin' rascal!\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't look straight at me while you're saying that...\nLotta:\nWhen I find the bugger who went and done this, they're gonna pay with a bullet!\nPhoenix:\n(And if you do that, don't expect me to defend you...)\nMaya Fey profile\nLotta:\nNow that I think about it, she isn't with y'all today, is she...?\nPearl:\nUm...\nLotta:\nShe's a spunky one! You shouldn't have been lettin' her outta yer sight. Who knows what she's up to now...\nPhoenix:\n(Like you're one to talk...)\nPearl:\n...\nPearl Fey profile\nLotta:\nAh, just wanna say sorry to ya.\nPearl:\nFor...?\nLotta:\nWell, I really, absolutely thought you were the murderer.\nPearl:\n...Huh?\nLotta:\nYou know... Last time, that thing with Maya Fey...\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!? But why!?\nLotta:\nI mean, you were all worked up, ya know?\nPearl:\n*sniffle* ...Meanie...\nPhoenix:\nLotta, that was very insensitive of you!\nLotta Hart profile\nLotta:\nThis kind of hairstyle is pretty hard to get, ya know. Hard to care for too. Just the other day, I ran my hand through my hair to fix it up, and suddenly, out pops this dollar coin! That's gotta be like hittin' the jackpot!\nPearl:\nWow, that's really lucky!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* What a deep conversation that was...)\nJuan Corrida or Matt Engarde profile\nLotta:\nI don't really care for 'em \"heroes\" or whatnot.\nPearl:\nOh, I see...\nLotta:\nAnd shows they got for kids, those adventures are just plain ol' borin'! Now, adults. We get more caught up in messy, sticky, real situations! ...Even me...\nPearl:\nO-Oh...\nLotta:\nSounds like the tyke's gettin' what I'm goin' with this!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a sec here! Don't go around getting her mixed up in things like that!\nSecurity Lady profile\nLotta:\nThis old granny? Ah, she kept on glarin' at me with those eyes of hers. As if it's my fault. Kept babblin' how she won't forgive people who write \"trash\" about her Juan... ...Ah, yeah, we sorta got into a little fight, ya know...\nPhoenix:\n(A \"little\" fight? Knowing those two, it was probably more of a blabbering contest.)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know anything...\nLotta:\n...*sigh*... I've told ya how many times now? I'm a journalist. I've got so much info runnin' laps in my head I forget things here and there!\nPearl:\nPlease don't get so worked up over this...\nLotta:\nHah! I don't care if ya beg me! \"Be extra tough on kids!\" That's this gal's motto on learnin' youngsters.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nUm... Where are we?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room.\n???:\nMay I help you with something?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... We're...\n???:\nYou're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail.\nPhoenix:\nUm... How did you know I'm his lawyer...?\n???:\nYou were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer.\nPearl:\nWow...\n???:\nIt's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either.\nPearl:\nIt's really not the time to be showing off, Mr. Nick.\nAndrews:\nI am Adrian Andrews. I hate to waste time, so let's get down to business.\nPhoenix:\nA-Alright... (She may be of small stature, but appearances can be deceiving...)\nExamine\nRed suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's probably Mr. Engarde's suitcase. For someone who was only going to be here for the award show, this is a lot of stuff. Looks like he has about three days' worth of clothes in here.\nPearl:\nStars really are different from us, aren't they...?\nBedroom\nPhoenix:\nThat's the bedroom over there.\nPearl:\nThat's a bed...? Wow, they have really big beds here!\nSofa\nPhoenix:\nThere's some samurai-looking clothes on the sofa here.\nPearl:\nUm, I think that jacket looking thing is called a \"happi\".\nPhoenix:\n(Whatever it is, I'm sure something like that would make a great souvenir. Maya would be absolutely thrilled...)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nLooks like dishes left over from dinner... A dinner for two, at that.\nPearl:\nI'm sure they're Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews' plates.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they had T-bone steaks... What's with Global Studios and T-bone steaks...?\nPlate on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a giant bone sitting on the plate.\nPearl:\nI... I don't really like meat...\nPhoenix:\n(...? There's something... weird about this plate... I just wish I could put my finger on what it is...)\nTalk\nNight of the murder\nAndrews:\nI assume the first thing you need to know is what everyone was doing that night, correct?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, that is correct.\nAndrews:\nThen I will tell you. Before the award ceremony, I had dinner with Mr. Engarde. In this very room, I might add.\nPhoenix:\n\"Dinner\"? What did you eat?\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate to waste time with trifling details. If you took a look at the table yourself, you wouldn't need to ask me.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet she's a lot of fun at parties...)\nAndrews:\nWhen the award show was starting, I headed for Viola Hall.\nPhoenix:\nAnd after the show ended, you came back to this room...?\nAndrews:\nNo, I had some small errands to run. I helped with the preparations in the lobby.\nPhoenix:\nOh... (Preparations for the post-ceremony show, I guess...)\nAndrews:\nWhen it was time for the post-ceremony show, I came back to call for Mr. Engarde. After that, I went to visit Mr. Corrida...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you found his body, isn't it?\nAndrews:\n...\nPearl:\nYou really held strong through everything...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... She does seem to be mentally tough as nails...)\nRelation to Engarde\nPhoenix:\nUm, so... About you and...\nAndrews:\nStop right there. You aren't seriously about to ask how Mr. Engarde and I are related, are you? (Changed from [Don't expect me to believe you have been talking to me without knowing how we relate.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nAndrews:\nI have no idea how he could chose [sic] you as his lawyer. (Changed from [I have no idea why Mr. Engarde chose you as his lawyer.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Why did she have to go and say something like that...?)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Calm down and hang in there. I'll give you a shoulder rub to relieve your stress later, alright?\nAndrews:\nI already gave you my name earlier, but I'll add that I'm Mr. Engarde's manager.\nPhoenix:\nHis manager... Speaking of managers, did the victim, Mr. Corrida have one?\nAndrews:\nNo, he did not.\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't?\nAndrews:\nGlobal Studios has a very different policy from Worldwide Studios in that Worldwide Studios does not assign individual managers to their stars.\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nAndrews:\nThis industry is very ruthless and unforgiving. Actually, you look quite ruthless and unforgiving yourself to your poor partner. Dragging a little girl like her to places like this. Honestly.\nPearl:\nYou're wrong! I... I'm doing this to help Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Calm down and hang in there. I'll buy you a juice later, alright?\nPearl:\nNngh...\nMotive for murder (appears after presenting Juan Corrida profile)\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any ideas?\nAndrews:\nAs to...?\nPhoenix:\nAs to why Mr. Corrida was murdered?\nAndrews:\nWhy would you ask me about such a thing...?\nPhoenix:\nI'm just doing my job. So, do you have any ideas?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nSorry, but there's nothing more I have to add to this conversation.\nPearl:\nIs it a Psyche-Lock, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYes... There's getting to be more and more of these lately.\nMotive for murder (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou know something, don't you? About why Mr. Corrida was murdered...\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nAndrews:\nWhy are you asking me? Don't tell me you can see inside my heart.\nPhoenix:\n(No, but I can see the locks you have on your psyche.)\nPearl:\nIf you don't remove her locks...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it's worthless to even ask...)\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one taking care of the arrangements for this press conference, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, that's right.\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Engarde said he \"didn't know\" about it.\nAndrews:\n... Is that what he said...?\nPearl:\nHuh...?\nAndrews:\nActually, I didn't know all the details either. It was a request from the publicity department. All I did was help out and do what I was asked.\nPearl:\nOh... I see.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder about that... I wouldn't take her to be the type of person to do something without knowing the details.)\nWill Powers profile\nAndrews:\nThat's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be.\nPhoenix:\n(Urk... What a horrible thing to say...)\nAndrews:\n...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? For a second, her face twisted in pain...)\nPearl:\nI wonder if something happened to Ms. Andrews...\nJuan Corrida profile\nPhoenix:\nDid you know the victim, Mr. Corrida?\nAndrews:\nYes, I knew him. The world is such a small place, after all.\nPearl:\nDid you know about his rivalry with the Nickel Samurai?\nAndrews:\nHonestly, they were like children when it came to that. Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most trivial things. (Changed from [Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most uninteresting things.] in the original release) ... If either one of them wasn't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die. (Changed from [If either one of them weren't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n! (...I've got a hunch that this woman knows more than she's letting on... She must know why Juan Corrida was killed!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nAndrews:\nI asked to become Mr. Engarde's manager. He's a pleasure to manage with his nice disposition.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Mr. Engarde does seem like a rather weak-willed man; always doing as he's told...)\nPearl:\nHe's always saying, \"my manager,\" right Mr. Nick?\nAndrews:\n...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAndrews:\nI hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... (Take away that layer of sarcasm and she really does seem to hate herself...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, I'd like to ask you about this...\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Where are we...?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Juan Corrida's room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Corrida...?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim... Which makes this the crime scene, too.\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's you! So!? What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!?\nPhoenix:\nNot yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there?\nPhoenix:\n(I just want Maya to be alright...)\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nWe don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal.\nPhoenix:\nCan you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...?\nGumshoe:\nJust this once... \"Special circumstances\" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here.\nPhoenix:\nThank you.\nGumshoe:\nOh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy.\nPearl:\nWow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you!\nGumshoe:\nHa ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I got a map!\nPhoenix:\nThat's great, Pearls!\nPearl:\n... Um... But Mr. Nick, I can't read what it says...\nHotel Guidemap added to the Court Record.\nExamine\nRefrigerator\nPhoenix:\nThere are all sorts of things in this refrigerator...\nPearl:\nThe carrot juice bottle and the tomato juice bottle are both empty...\nPhoenix:\nEmpty...? (It's too much of a hassle to throw them away, I guess.) They're all vegetable juices. I guess he must've been a real health nut.\nPearl:\n...Oh! There's a beet, some ketchup, and a bottle of strawberry jam too!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe red was his favorite color...?\nStuffed bears\nPearl:\nWow, there are a lot of bears!\nPhoenix:\n(Alarm clock ones, collector's editions, stuffed teddies, plastic models... It's pretty overwhelming... Is there a kind of bear he doesn't have...?)\nPearl:\nThere's even a few in the trash can...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I get the feeling maybe the guy didn't really like bears.\nPearl:\nPoor teddies...\nIt's hard to \"bear\" with all these problems... Growl! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n... (I don't think I want to \"bear\" with the trauma the last case caused me...)\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mr. Nick?\nDesk\nPearl:\nHmph! It's so messy here!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls really likes things neat and tidy, I take it...)\nPearl:\nThere are a lot of electronic things in here that I've never seen before. Hey, Mr. Nick! Tell me what they are, pretty please?\nPhoenix:\nOK. That over there is a \"watch\". You wear it on your wrist.\nPearl:\n... I know what a watch is...\nPhoenix:\n(Oops. For a second there, I forgot I was talking with Pearls, not Maya...)\nBlue suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's a suitcase. There are so many things in it that I bet it barely closes. There's his clothes, a dryer, an electric shaver, a calculator...\nPearl:\nDo all stars pack too much stuff like Mr. Corrida?\nTable on right\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Mr. Corrida had dinner last night.\nPearl:\nThis bottle... It's tomato juice.\nPhoenix:\n(We had a lot of food at the award show last night... But I wonder if the stars had gone onstage after only eating a meager meal like this...)\nBedroom\nPearl:\nSo that's a bed, right?\nPhoenix:\nYup. It's big, but it's a bed.\nPearl:\nAaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft!\nPhoenix:\n(Big beds must be a rarity for her...)\nScattered items near guitar case\nPhoenix:\nBottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.\nPearl:\nWhat's this glass fragment from...?\nPhoenix:\nA flower vase maybe? There are flowers on the floor, but I don't know what they are.\nPearl:\nYou don't know much about flowers, do you Mr. Nick?\nGuitar case\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.\nPearl:\nThat's strange. The guitar is not here...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he forgot to bring it to the show?\nPearl:\nBut Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item...\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid...\nPearl:\nYeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nGuitar Case added to the Court Record.\nGuitar case (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.\nPearl:\nThat's strange. The guitar is not here...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he forgot to bring it to the show?\nPearl:\nBut Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item...\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid...\nPearl:\nYeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nWine glass\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nPearl:\nBut doesn't it seem weird?\nPhoenix:\n...What seems weird?\nPearl:\nI mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor.\nPhoenix:\n... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)\nPearl:\nWhy is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?\nWine Glass added to the Court Record.\nWine glass (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nPearl:\nBut doesn't it seem weird?\nPhoenix:\n...What seems weird?\nPearl:\nI mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor.\nPhoenix:\n... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)\nPearl:\nWhy is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?\nTalk\nCause of death\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what was the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nWell, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal. (Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIt should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Here's a picture.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a knife in his chest.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal, that's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was stabbed to death...)\nGumshoe:\nThey're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now.\nPhoenix:\nThere were fingerprints on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nYup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nCause of death (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what was the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nWell, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal.

And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nReason for arrest\nPhoenix:\nWhy was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nBecause we had evidence on him.\nPearl:\nEvidence...?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the victim, Juan Corrida, really put up a big fight.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, one look at the crime scene and you can tell. There's signs of a struggle everywhere.\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah. During the fight, his button came off...\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde said something about a button... Something like, one of the Jammin' Ninja's buttons got caught in his \"hakama\"...)\nGumshoe:\nBut that's not all...\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nThere was a witness, pal.\nPhoenix:\nA witness!? Wh-Who is it!?\nGumshoe:\nThat lady... Ms. Oldbag.\nPhoenix:\n(Please... Anyone but her!)\nGumshoe:\nThe prosecution has plenty of evidence to make a solid case... Not to mention there's something around where the vic was that's a little off. (Changed from [Not to mention there's something at the crime scene that was a little off.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nSomething that's a little off...? As in...? (Changed from [Something that was a little off...? As in...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nAs in, that's for you to figure out, pal!\nPearl:\nAlright, let's try to figure it out, Mr. Nick!\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nGumshoe:\nThat's your \"present\" from the kidnapper, huh? While you're talking, it sends and receives radio waves... If we could trace that...\nPearl:\nYeah! We could use it to find out where the bad guy is!\nPhoenix:\n(It uses radio waves, huh?)\nGumshoe:\nI got it! I'll go find a radio scanner, and let you borrow it, pal!\nGuitar Case\nPhoenix:\nWhat can you tell me about this guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nOh, that. This is just what I heard, pal, but that's the Jammin' Ninja's signature item.\nPhoenix:\nThe guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nNo, not that! What do you take me as? I mean the guitar inside, of course!\nPearl:\nBut... The guitar is missing.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, we looked for it too. It's not normal for a person to forget to bring their most famous item to an award show.\nPhoenix:\n(It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...)\nWine Glass\nPhoenix:\nSo about this wine glass...\nGumshoe:\nAh, so you noticed it, pal. The whole crime scene was a mess, but this glass was the only thing that was untouched.\nPhoenix:\nYou noticed that too, Detective Gumshoe...?\nGumshoe:\nNo, actually Ms. von Karma noticed it first.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Pearls noticed it before me too... Hey, wait a minute. So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's here at the hotel...? (Changed from [So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's coming here...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah, she's around. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal. (Changed from [Yeah, she's coming. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal.] in the original release) Especially if she catches you in here. (Changed from [I think it'd be best if you didn't bump into her here.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou can bet the instant I see her, I'll be running the 1,000 meter dash.\nCrime Photo\nGumshoe:\nYou look at this photo and you can't help it. It makes you want to say, \"I can't believe this is the scene of a murder.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Stabbed with a knife after a struggle... A clue is sleeping in this photo somewhere... I know it.)\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm sorry.\nPhoenix:\n...For what?\nGumshoe:\nI really want to help you look for her, pal.\nPearl:\nMr. Detective...\nGumshoe:\nIf anything happens, let me know, OK? I want to help in any way I can!\nPearl Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, little missy. Listen good, OK?\nPearl:\nOK. What is it?\nGumshoe:\nDon't ever pick up a whip, OK? Don't even think about it.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nGumshoe:\nIf you ever find yourself thinking you want one, try to make due with a good slap to the face. Got that? Slap the person in the face. Promise me, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(Personal experience tells me Gumshoe should be careful what he wishes for...)\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nIf I had a choice, she would be number three on my list of people I don't want to see.\nPhoenix:\n...Because I'm in the number one spot?\nGumshoe:\nDon't get all high and mighty on me here. You've taken a tumble into second place, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really? Then who's in first...?\nGumshoe:\nMs. von Karma's miles and miles ahead of you in this race.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh...\nGumshoe:\nShe's really scary... Right now... M-Ms. von Karma... You really don't...\nPhoenix:\n(He's so scared of her that he's whispering now...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, why don't we let bygones be bygones, pal? Look, this guy is guilty. A buck says so.\nPhoenix:\nOne dollar...? Sure you're not talking about Pearls' allowance money?\nGumshoe:\nI... I can't bet any more than that... My salary... It's...\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't matter what we think... I still have to defend Mr. Engarde in court or else!)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick...\nSecurity Lady profile\nGumshoe:\nI thought she was an alien from outer space.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, probably because she's wearing that strange helmet.\nGumshoe:\nNah, even with her helmet off, I thought she was an alien, pal.\nPhoenix:\n... I think that's probably best kept to yourself, if you know what I mean...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nGumshoe:\nShe's Mr. Engarde's manager, right? No matter what I do, I really stink at talking with people like her. As soon as I open my mouth, I get all flustered. See, she's one of those women with a brain. She's someone who \"gets things done\".\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she does give that sort of impression, like she's got it all together.\nGumshoe:\nCompared to her, you can easily tell I'm a \"can't do anything right\" kind of guy. That's why I get all nervous and start messing up.\nPhoenix:\n(I feel sort of bad for him...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you know about this?\nGumshoe:\nUm... There's nothing special I can tell you about this, pal. Look pal, we don't have a lot of time. Why don't you show me something more important? If Ms. von Karma saw me here like this... I'd have to switch sides real fast...\nAfter clearing all Talk options, examining guitar case, and presenting Wine Glass:\n...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*...\nPearl:\nWh-What's that beeping noise, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I've heard this sound somewhere before...)\nGumshoe:\nIt's Ms. von Karma...\nPearl:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nFor some reason, whenever I hear that sound, she pops out of nowhere and whips me! (Changed from [Whenever I hear that sound, for some reason, she pops out of nowhere and whips me!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, that's exactly what happen [sic] the last time...) (Changed from [Come to think of it, that did happen the last time...] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nS-Sorry! I've gotta make myself scarce! Later, pal! Eowww!\nvon Karma:\nAt last, you reveal your true nature... Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(*gulp* Would it be too much to ask for you to be nice to me for a change...?)\nvon Karma:\nSo you're the type to steal information from pitifully hopeless detectives! That's very dishonorable of you!\nPhoenix:\n(Owww!)\nvon Karma:\nHey! Don't you dare run away, Scruffy McTrenchcoat!\nGumshoe:\nAh!\nvon Karma:\nI didn't think the detectives of this country could be this pitiful...\nGumshoe:\nUwaah!\nvon Karma:\nDetective! Come over here for a second!\nGumshoe:\nYeooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!\nvon Karma:\n...Hmph. I feel better knowing at least you were man enough to face your punishment.\nPhoenix:\n(He was so scared, he just froze up on the spot...)\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright! You... You have soiled my perfect prosecution record. I'll never forget that. This time... Victory is mine!\nPhoenix:\n... Victory is yours? Is that all this means to you...?\nvon Karma:\nWh-What...!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nvon Karma:\n... H-Hmph! Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin. (Changed from [Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!\nvon Karma:\nThis isn't over yet... I swear on my family's honor!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! What did she throw at me NOW...!? (Changed from [Ow! Now what did she throw at me...!?] in the original release) What is this...?)\nGumshoe:\n...Well, I guess this means I've gotta get back to the precinct now, pal. If you ever need me, come down to the Criminal Affairs Department, alright? And if you can, try not to let Ms. von Karma see you...\nExamine\nPaper on desk\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, what's this piece of paper...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's called an \"autograph\".\nPearl:\nAuto-graff?\nPhoenix:\nIt's got Mr. Corrida's name written on it, so it's his autograph.\nPearl:\nI can't read it at all. To be honest, I've never seen writing that looks like this.\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's a special way of writing called \"cursive\". Look here. See how it says, \"To my dearest Wendy\" in more normal letters here?\nPearl:\nTh-This sloppy, unreadable writing! It's crazy and cruel to give this to someone!\nPhoenix:\n(Hold on...)\nPearl:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nWendy... I've heard that name somewhere before...\nMr. Corrida's Autograph added to the Court Record.\nAfter visiting Enguarde's Hotel Room:\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPowers:\nOh, Mr. Wright! How are you?\nPhoenix:\nAh, Mr. Powers. Have you been here the entire time?\nPowers:\nYeah. People connected to the murder aren't allowed to go home, let alone leave...\nTalk\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me a little more about the Nickel Samurai TV show?\nPowers:\nOK. \"The Nickel Samurai\" is an action hero program aimed towards kids. It's the sequel to \"The Steel Samurai\".\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nPowers:\nThis time, there are three Samurai Brothers: Aluminum Samurai, Tin Samurai... And of course, the Nickel Samurai. It's a love \"Y\" in Neo Olde Tokyo!\nPhoenix:\nI see... ... W-Wait... A love what...?\nPowers:\nA love \"Y\". This girl, Sayo, works at a tea shop and all three guys fall for her at the same time.\nPhoenix:\nOh... I guess the \"Y\" shape is like the 3 brothers colliding over this one girl?\nPowers:\nAnyway, Sayo is actually the daughter of the evil Strawberry Clan's leader!\nPhoenix:\nSounds like an unusual situation. Like Romeo and Juliet... times three.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah... Strange thing is, this sort of forbidden love story is really big with the office ladies.\nPearl:\nUm...\nPowers:\nYes, Pearl?\nPearl:\nWh-What happens next!? I want to know! Ms. Sayo... Does Ms. Sayo fall in love? She does, doesn't she?\nPowers:\nEvery Sunday at 8 AM.\nPearl:\nI'm going to stop watching \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\" starting this week!\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe she's really considering it!)\nJammin' Ninja\nPhoenix:\nSo what's the \"Jammin' Ninja\" TV show like?\nPowers:\nIt started from a remake of an old movie, to tell you the truth. The Jammin' Ninja is, like the Samurai shows, aimed towards kids. It's the story of a ninja who can't climb a wall, but became a big pop star.\nPhoenix:\n...Uh, what?\nPowers:\nHe was a really lousy ninja. Absolutely couldn't do any ninja things right at all. But boy could he sing! With his trusty bright red guitar in hand, he took the ancient world by storm.\nPhoenix:\nA... A ninja... With a bright red guitar...!?\nPowers:\nAnd then, the final fight in front of his beloved Princess Misola! \"Jammin' versus the Muromachi Five!\" Suddenly! Our brave hero catches a not so Jammin' cold the night before Battle 3!\nPhoenix:\nAww, that's too bad for him...\nPowers:\nY-Yeah... But this kind of pop music-based love story is something high school girls really like.\nPearl:\nUm...\nPowers:\nYes, Pearl?\nPearl:\nWh-What happens next!? I want to know!\nPearl:\nJammin'... The Jammin' Ninja! Will he be able to sing!? What about Princess Misola!?\nPowers:\nEvery Sunday at 8 AM.\nPearl:\nUmm... Which show should I watch...? Hmm...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe she's really  considering it!)\nThe gossip on Adrian (appears after presenting Adrian Andrews profile)\nPhoenix:\nWould you mind telling me about this \"gossip\"?\nPowers:\nAh, so you ARE interested in it! I figured you would be! (Changed from [Ah, so you're interested in it too!

That was Juan's...\nPhoenix:\nI'm guessing you've seen this case before?\nPowers:\nIt's pretty famous by now. It stands out because it holds THE bright red guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(The bright red guitar...

I saw him coming out of Juan's room.\nPhoenix:\nYou're kidding!\nPearl:\nOh no!\nOldbag:\nIt was about ten minutes before Juan's body was discovered. It was just a coincidence. I was on my way to the toilet, minding my own business.\nPhoenix:\nAnd...? Did you tell that to the police?\nOldbag:\nWell, of course! I thought I could get a gift certificate or two out of it, maybe more.\nPearl:\nGift certificate...?\nOldbag:\nI've been recruited again for that part at the trial. You know, the trial tomorrow? This time, you're gonna get it! I'm gonna work hard to get your client pronounced guilty!\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Engarde hasn't done anything bad...\nOldbag:\nI don't care about details like that!

Why do you know about that anyway, Ms. Oldbag?\nOldbag:\nI'm one of Juan's biggest fans! I'm always out there gathering information!

Without her, I became scared. Everything... Everyone seemed like they were out to get me.\nPhoenix:\nSo you got close to Mr. Corrida to recover her suicide note, correct?\nAndrews:\n...

I just thought it might have been possible...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have a suggestion. Why don't you put that in the void where your brain is supposed to be!\nJudge:\nYes, and never bring it out again!\nPhoenix:\n(Can't a foolishly foolish fool get some love...?)\nEdgeworth:\nDo you still think you can prove your theory? Can you prove that the guitar case was not empty at the time of the murder?\nLeads back to:\n\"I wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!\"Judge:\nTh-This is... This is a photograph...!Phoenix:\nYes, but what is important is what is in that picture, Your Honor.Judge:\nI-In this picture...?Phoenix:\nIt doesn't take a genius to see what I mean! What I am proposing is... Inside the guitar case was the Nickel Samurai! The hero's very own costume!Edgeworth:\nWh-What!?Judge:\nM-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!Edgeworth:\nWright! Are you saying that the witness opened the guitar case to take out a costume!? What insane point would there be to doing something like that!?Phoenix:\nThat insane point would be to wear the costume, of course. Ms. Andrews put it on to hide her identity so she could make her escape. After all, you couldn't let anyone see you leave, could you, Ms. Andrews?Andrews:\n...!Edgeworth:\nI-I refuse to accept your theory! Do you have anything to support such a preposterous idea!?Phoenix:\nJust outside the door was an investigative photographer who was starving for a big scoop. And in the end, she managed to get this shot, correct?Judge:\nYou... You mean this photo!? Order! Ordeeeer! It looks like we've wandered into quite another mess again, haven't we...?Mia:\nNice job, Phoenix.Phoenix:\nWell, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later!Judge:\nHmm... So the real murderer was hiding inside a costume...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nW-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!?Judge:\nHmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...?It was stolen from Engarde.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI think it may have been stolen from Mr. Engarde...\nJudge:\nS-Stolen!? But why would someone do such a thing!?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe the thief wanted to interfere with the post-ceremony stage show.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nAnd so, if he didn't have his costume, then Mr. Engarde would be forced to go naked!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe YOU should be stripped naked and run out for making a mockery of this court!\nPhoenix:\nE-EXCUSE ME!?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Matt Engarde did not take his costume off after the award ceremony! He even testified that he took a nap while still wearing his costume! Is this not correct!?\nPhoenix:\n... Ah, yeah, he did say something like that, didn't he?\nJudge:\n*sigh* That's what I thought. Let's try that one more time, shall we, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts.\"It was a spare costume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period...\"Phoenix:\nMr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a spare one.Edgeworth:\nWhat...?Judge:\nThen... are you saying that on the night of the murder... there were TWO Nickel Samurai costumes at the Gatewater Hotel!?Phoenix:\nYes, that is what I am saying.Judge:\nAnd how do you explain the costume that was inside the guitar case...?Edgeworth:\nIt would mean that the victim himself had brought this spare to the ceremony on purpose! (Changed from [It would mean that the victim himself had planned to bring this spare to the ceremony!] in the original release)Judge:\nBut... But why!? The victim, Mr. Corrida, was the Jammin' Ninja. Why would he secretly bring the Nickel Samurai's spare costume with him...? What could be the reason behind such a peculiar act?Phoenix:\n... And therein lies the sticking point... (Changed from [... Ah, so that's what he intended...] in the original release)Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWh-What are you mumbling to yourself about now!? Have you just been rambling all this time without any sense of inner monologue!?Phoenix:\nHuh!? N-No, I just...Judge:\nMr. Wright, please explain yourself! Why do you think the victim had the Nickel Samurai's spare costume!?Mia:\nPhoenix... Are you sure you can explain this one? Think carefully before you answer... And then answer with gusto! I believe in you!Phoenix:\nAlright. This is what I think.

What are you doing!? Are you crazy!?\nPhoenix:\nI... I, uh... I presented the evidence with gusto, just like you said!\nMia:\nI told you to present it with gusto, yes... But I seem to recall the sentence before that was, \"Think carefully\"!\nPhoenix:\n*gulp*\nJudge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nAh, sorry...\nMia:\nThis one is pretty tough. I really think you should look carefully at the Court Record. And then search through your memories! The answer is there, I know you'll find it!\nJudge:\nNow then. Are you ready to try again, Mr. Wright? Minus the wrong evidence this time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Alright. This is what I think.\"Judge:\nWhat is this...?Phoenix:\nOn the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special press conference.Judge:\nA press conference...?Phoenix:\nYes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something at this conference.Edgeworth:\nI heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright.Phoenix:\nBut what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had no idea he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night.Andrews:\n...Judge:\nBut how can that be!?Phoenix:\nThe way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida himself!Judge:\nTh-The victim?Phoenix:\nYes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the \"Nickel Samurai\"!Judge:\nHe was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!?Phoenix:\nThat's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is what he intended to reveal at that conference.Edgeworth:\nThe Nickel Samurai was going to \"confess\" something. And by \"confess\", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about \"himself\".Phoenix:\nWhich means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about Matt Engarde!Judge:\nYes, I guess that is what it would mean...Edgeworth:\nBut, if that's the case... that's not a \"confession\"! That's \"public disclosure\"!Andrews:\nHmph.Judge:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?Andrews:\nI can see why you are pros at what you do.Judge:\nPardon me?Andrews:\nYes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan.Judge:\nMs. Andrews! Please offer us an explanation for this!Andrews:\nI was the one he asked to help set it up. And the person who prepared the second costume for him... That was also me.Judge:\nYou...!?Andrews:\nJuan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway.Judge:\nHe was going to ruin him, huh...?Andrews:\nIt looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Judge:\nAnd do you know what this \"secret\" of Mr. Engarde's is, Ms. Andrews...?Andrews:\n... That's something only Juan knew. I... I don't know what it is.Judge:\nAh... I see.Edgeworth:\n...Andrews:\nI... I've probably been coming off quite suspicious to everyone, but that's to be expected. I've been trying to protect Matt, after all...Phoenix:\nP-Protect Mr. Engarde!?Judge:\nAnd yet again another strange bit of truth comes to light it seems... Ms. Andrews, if you could, please tell us the truth about your behavior!Andrews:\nYes, Your Honor. I understand.Witness Testimony-- Protecting Matt --Andrews:\nFrom the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.\nMatt had to kill Juan no matter what.\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...Judge:\nHmm... This does account for everything...Andrews:\nWell... I am the logical type.Mia:\nWe're finally seeing her true self. She is more nervous than a scared rabbit.Judge:\nIf the defense can find no fault with this testimony, I am ready to make a ruling. (Changed from [If there are no objections, I feel that I can pass a verdict based on this testimony.] in the original release) Please keep that in mind as you cross-examine, Mr. Wright. (Changed from [Now then, Mr. Wright, if you please.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Looks like somehow everything has swung to the opposite end of the scale again... That just means I have to put my weight into this and turn her logic upside-down!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Protecting Matt --Andrews:\nFrom the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you say that was your \"intuition\" speaking to you?\nAndrews:\nDon't confuse my methods of reasoning with your own.\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\nAndrews:\nIf you want to prove that someone did something, you need three things.\nPhoenix:\nThree... things?\nAndrews:\nA motive, an opportunity to commit the crime, and finally... decisive evidence. And if you think these three things through, the answer becomes quite clear.\nMia:\nYou should have already known that, Phoenix...\nPhoenix:\nThey didn't teach that to us in school... At least, not from what I remember...\nAndrews:\nMay I continue now?Andrews:\nMatt had to kill Juan no matter what.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo would you say this \"need\" came from the press conference?\nAndrews:\nYes. Do you know why Juan chose that event and that hotel for the conference? Because that was when he could cause the most damage to the public's beloved Matt Engarde.\nJudge:\nAnd you knew of this plan, didn't you, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\nYes... because I was the one who set up the conference and prepared the costume.\nPhoenix:\nBut... I'm sure Mr. Engarde himself didn't know anything about a press conference.\nAndrews:\nOh really? Can you show me any proof that he didn't know about the press conference?\nPhoenix:\nA-Anyway! The important thing here is that this information was not in your testimony!\nJudge:\nYes, I agree. Ms. Andrews, please correct your testimony, if you please.\nAndrews:\n\"Grasping at straws\" now, are we, Mr. Wright?\nChanges statement from \"Matt had to kill Juan no matter what.\" to \"I know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.\"Andrews:\nI know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHas Mr. Engarde done something to hurt or betray you personally?\nAndrews:\n... Why do you ask?\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one who helped Mr. Corrida with his press conference... And that event was supposed to bring down Mr. Engarde, yet you still helped out!\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe person on trial right now is Mr. Engarde, Wright. What the witness was thinking, helping the victim with his plan, is none of our concern. In any case, this means that the defendant had a motive to kill.\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I keep doing this to myself...?)Andrews:\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nB-But didn't you already testify earlier that Mr. Engarde was... \"Taking a nap in his room\"!? Are you telling me now that, that too, was a lie so you could cover for Mr. Engarde!?\nAndrews:\nI'm not telling you anything of the sort. When I went to get him for the show, he honestly was sleeping. However, as to whether he was sleeping the entire time, that I cannot say. I was too busy setting up the stage at the time.\nJudge:\nHmm... I keep trying, but I can find no flaws with what Ms. Andrews has said. I can't say the same for some people here in this courtroom, however.\nPhoenix:\n(The judge is glaring straight at Mia...)\nMia:\nHe's glaring at you, smart guy!Andrews:\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou can hardly call the knife \"decisive evidence\"! The fingerprints on the knife could very well be a clever camouflage!\nAndrews:\nThen... What about the button?\nPhoenix:\nThe button...?\nAndrews:\nIt's clear from the crime scene that the victim and the murderer fought. And during the fight, the killer ripped the button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nJudge:\nYou're talking about this button, correct?\nAndrews:\nThat button was found in the pleats of Matt's hakama, isn't that correct? I would think that makes it very decisive evidence.\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nJudge:\nLooks like you were out-foxed again, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nA-Anyway! The knife doesn't prove a thing! Please fix your testimony!\nAndrews:\nI can't stand the sight of a man who can't gracefully accept his defeat.\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(... Thank goodness Mia can still look at me...)\nMia:\nWith an icy stare, yes.\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews, for Mr. Wright's sake, please add this information to your testimony.\nChanges statement from \"My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\" to \"That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\"Andrews:\nThat button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd how do you know that?\nAndrews:\nWhen the ends of the threads on the button and the costume were matched up, they were found to fit together perfectly... Or so I heard.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I've heard that before too. But why would Ms. Andrews know about this case down to such a fine detail?)\nAndrews:\nDon't look at me like that! Just because I'm prepared and you are not!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... And I thought I had her this time for sure. If there's anything to trip her up on, it has to be here. ...But where and what?)Present Juan's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is the victim's autopsy report.\"Andrews:\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut what you really did was stab the guy in the back, didn't you? And at the worst possible time.\nAndrews:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nWho's to say she really \"stabbed the guy in the back\" as you put it?\nPhoenix:\nThis witness could have disclosed things about Mr. Engarde at any time. Why, then, would she wait until there was a large audience before doing so? It's the same reason why Mr. Corrida planned such an elaborate conference. Ms. Andrews wanted to cause Mr. Engarde as much damage as she possibly could! This witness bears ill-will towards the defendant!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis isn't the \"Phoenix Wright Wax Philosophical Power Hour\". And please, stop slandering the witness.\nAndrews:\n...Phoenix:\nAs I expected, Ms. Andrews' testimony seems pretty solid.Mia:\nReally? Because to me, it sounded a little wishy-washy.Phoenix:\nWishy-washy? (Well, I guess we'll see if I press a little more...)Mia:\nYou should know this by now, but you'll need strong, decisive evidence to make her talk.Phoenix:\nGot it, Chief!

    "response": "Okay, let's dive into this. So, the user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other in the provided case. They need the answer in JSON format, specifying the evidence number and testimony number. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the testimonies and evidences listed. The testimonies are from Adrian Andrews, and the key here is to find a contradiction between her statement and one of the evidence items.\n\nLooking at Testimony 5: \"That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\" Andrews claims that the button from Juan's costume was torn off during a fight with Matt Engarde, which is used as evidence against Matt. \n\nNow, checking the evidences, Evidence 16 is the \"Jammin' Ninja's Button\" described as being ripped from his costume and found in Engarde's hakama. However, the critical point here is the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14), which states the cause of death as strangulation with a scarf followed by a stabbing. If Juan was strangled, there wouldn't have been a physical struggle where a button could be torn off. The button being torn off implies a struggle during the attack, but the autopsy shows he was strangled first, which would incapacitate him, making a struggle unlikely. Therefore, the button couldn't have been torn off during the fight if the actual cause of death was strangulation. This contradiction between the testimony about the button being torn in a fight and the autopsy report showing death by strangulation (which wouldn't involve such a struggle) is the key here.\n\nSo the testimony about the button (Testimony 5) is contradicted by the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14).\n\n{\"evidence\": 14, \"testimony\": 5}",

Or maybe Captain Saipan all the way from the lovely tropical island of Saipan!? I see the students of a certain Starry School are raring to win! And Global Hero Onyankopon doesn't want to go home without the prize! We hope Lady Luck is with all our heroes tonight! And now! The winner of the third annual Hero of Heroes Grand Prix... IS ME!!\nWhoooooooooa! The true hero of the night has appeared in our midst! It looks like this year's Grand Prix goes to this fantastic warrior! The Nickel Samurai! Too bad, Jammin' Ninja. Looks like the title eluded you again this year!\nMarch 20, 7:42 PMGatewater HotelViola Hall\nMaya:\nAlright! Yes! Did you hear that, Nick!? Did you!? The Nickel Samurai! He did it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.\nPowers:\nAh, I'm proud of the guy for doing the series justice.\nPearl:\nU-Um... So the person everyone was cheering for... I guess he got the prize?\nMaya:\nYup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? \"The Nickel Samurai\"!\nPearl:\nNo. Every Sunday, I only watch the Educational Channel's \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nOK, that's it! From now on, it's \"The Nickel Samurai\"! All the kids watch it!\nPearl:\nDo you like \"The Nickel Samurai\" too, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nNah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. But I do like \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\".\nMaya:\nHey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed to watch it anymore!

There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.\nPowers:\nAnd then, I heard there's going to be a press conference after that.\nPhoenix:\nA press conference? Is he going to make a speech about winning this year's prize?\nPowers:\nUh, well, not exactly... Something about the Nickel Samurai confessing something.\nPhoenix:\nConfessing...? Sounds pretty serious.\nMaya:\nArgh! Nick! COME ON! You don't want us to be the last ones there, do you!?\nPearl:\nYeah, Mr. Nick! Do you!?\nPhoenix:\n(Why me...? The show doesn't even start for another 20 minutes...)\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there.\nPowers:\nAnd behind those doors is an equally grand lobby.\nPearl:\nShall we go and take a look, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nHey, wait up! This grand dessert is calling to me... It's saying, \"Eat me now!\"\nWalls or ceiling\nPhoenix:\nThis sure is one luxurious hotel. Almost to the point of gaudy, with how it blends together everything \"fancy\" imaginable. (Speaking of fancy, didn't that bellboy give me something like that last year?)\nChandelier\nMaya:\nThat chandelier is really something, isn't it?\nPearl:\nI thought it was a kind of space ship...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. How about we get one of these for the office?\nPhoenix:\nOne of those hanging from our poor, weak ceiling? I don't think so.\nTables at back\nMaya:\nIf this is all a dream, I don't ever want to wake up! And all the directors and stars that were here to see the heroes, wow.\nPhoenix:\nI had no idea who most of them were.\nPearl:\nNeither did I.\nMaya:\nNick, you've got to cut that \"news only\" habit out. Your new show is going to be \"The Nickel Samurai!\" Every Sunday morning at 8! Oh, I know! We can watch it together starting next week! I'll come wake you up extra early to make sure, OK?\nPhoenix:\nAh, I'm fine... You know, you really don't have to on my account...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second.\nMaya:\nWell, shows like that are guaranteed to be good, you know?\nFront table\nMaya:\nWhat can I say? This is a really high-class hotel!\nPearl:\nI've never eaten this kind of salad before.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nMaya:\nDon't worry! Any leftovers belong in my happily awaiting stomach anyway!\nPhoenix:\nYou're such a glutton, Maya.\nPowers:\nAh, I lose this one to Maya. You sure can eat.\nMaya:\nWell, a growing girl needs her nutrients!\nPhoenix:\n(A growing girl? Exactly how big do you plan on getting...?)\nTalk\nWill Powers\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much for inviting us today.\nPowers:\nAww, it was nothing really. Guys like us don't get to come to a place like this often, so I thought I'd invite you all.\nMaya:\nHey, Mr. Powers! What have you been up to lately?\nPowers:\nWell, since \"The Pink Princess\" successfully wrapped up last month, I've been on a kid's exercise show... ...while wearing a rabbit mask over my face...\nMaya:\nOh, I see.\nPowers:\nI'm still really sorry about all the headaches I caused you that time, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nAh, well. What's done is done, so let's forget about it. (This is Will Powers. He's an action star. His popularity exploded when he was the Steel Samurai. And he was the first case Maya worked on with me.)\nMaya:\nIt's too bad you look scary, or people'd know you're a real softy who's good with kids. (Changed from [You can't tell by looking at you, but you're a really nice guy with a love of kids.] in the original release)\nPowers:\nUm, thanks. (Changed from [Ah, thanks.] in the original release)\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe they're going to make a movie based on the Nickel Samurai.\nMaya:\nI can't believe it either, but for a different reason!\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai. An epic story of one hero in a desperate fight against his arch-enemy, the Evil Magistrate in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo. And last year, they started a new series, \"The Nickel Samurai\". The new series seems to be a hit with the kids, too.\nPowers:\nI'm really attached to the Steel Samurai as a show, (Changed from [The Steel Samurai is a show I have a lot of strong feelings for,] in the original release) so I was hoping that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one... (Changed from [so I hoped that maybe I'd get a chance to do something in this new one...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nYeah, it's too bad... It'd been [sic] awesome to see you with the new actor, Matt Engarde. (Changed from [Yeah... It's too bad... It'd be great to see you on the show...] in the original release) He's super popular right now. (Changed from [With the new actor, Matt Engarde. He's super popular right now.] in the original release)\nPearl:\nMr. Un-gard...?\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Pearls doesn't know who he is.)\nMaya:\nThis year it's going to be the Nickel Samurai vs. the Jammin' Ninja at the box office!\nPhoenix:\n...Jammin' Ninja...? Who's that again?\nJammin' Ninja (appears after \"The Nickel Samurai\")\nPhoenix:\nSo who is this \"Jammin' Ninja\" again?\nMaya:\nHe's a hero, duh. His symbol is a bright red guitar he's always carrying.\nPhoenix:\n(A ninja who's always carrying around a bright red guitar...? How does that even work!?)\nMaya:\nWith a scarf around his neck and a guitar in hand, he rises to stardom in an ancient time.\nPhoenix:\nA ninja... Who becomes a star??\nMaya:\nYeah! A ninja who becomes a star!\nPowers:\nThere's a strong rivalry between the two of them. Global Studios' Nickel Samurai and Worldwide Studios' Jammin' Ninja. They even air at the same time.\nMaya:\nYou know what I heard? I heard those two don't get along at all. The Nickel Samurai's Engarde and the guy who plays the Jammin' Ninja, I mean.\nPhoenix:\n(The Nickel Samurai speaks French!? Oh, you mean Matt Engarde, the actor...) I guess even the world of heroes isn't a sparkling, happy place.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPowers:\nAh, I really owe you one. If it wasn't for you guys, I don't know what would've happened. What you did... It was a real tight spot I was in, and you fought so hard to get me out. I don't care what happens. I'll never forget everything you've done for me.\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo, you're going to study to become a lawyer too. Am I right or am I right?\nMaya:\nUmm...\nPowers:\nIt must be real tough. There's all those thick books with hard words you have to read...\nMaya:\nUh, um... Well...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, yeah. Mr. Powers doesn't know that Maya's a spirit medium...)\nMaya:\nI thought he'd be able to tell by my clothes.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he thinks that you've got some strange hobby on the side or something.\nMaya:\n...Hey, wait a sec. What's that's supposed to mean!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPowers:\nSo are you Maya's little sister?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but no.\nPowers:\nOh, then you must be Mr. Wright's little sister!\nPearl:\nAgain, I'm sorry, but...\nPowers:\nThen... Whose little sister are you?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but I'm an only child.\nPowers:\nOh, I see... S-Sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(Pearl looks so sad... She looks really sorry too...)\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, they're all shocked because then they figure out who I am.\nMaya:\nHmm... Well, I don't think you look scary.\nPearl:\nMe either. I think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Those two are making Mr. Powers tear up...)\nAnything else\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Thanks for taking the time to take it out and show it to me, but I'm really sorry, I don't know a thing about it.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHallway\nPhoenix:\nWow, what is with this place? Looks like I've stumbled into Oz or something. Way in the back, there's a sign for the bathroom. Maybe I should visit it while I can before the show starts... (Changed from [I bet we have a little time to look around before the show starts...] in the original release)\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...? Could it be that there's an action star who has a soft spot for teddy bears...? ...Nah, can't be.\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\". \"Juan Corrida\"... His name just sounds like a star's name. I've heard it before, but I don't know anything about him at all.\nEnd of hallway\nPhoenix:\nThere are toilets in each room in this hotel, but since all sorts of events are held here, there are bathrooms for people who aren't staying here to use as well. Perfect for people like me, who can't afford a stay here in the first place...\nFlowers on right\nPhoenix:\n\"To Mr. Engarde From the Global Studio Staff\" Ah, it'd be nice if lawyers got flowers too. Something like, \"To Mr. Wright From All Your Grateful Clients\".\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\". \"Matt Engarde\"... I've heard that name before. Oh, yeah. Maya's always yammering about him like the obsessed fan she is...\nViola Hall (after clearing all Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Viola Hall and visiting Hallway)\nPowers:\nSounds like the post-ceremony show is about to start.\nMaya:\nAlright! I'm so pumped! I wonder if he's going to show off his special move today? \"Nickel Samurai Smelting!\"\nPowers:\nActually, what I'm interested in most is the press conference.\nMaya:\nYou mean the \"big confession\" the Nickel Samurai's going to make after the show? So what is it? Don't you know what it's about, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nUh, well, I'm not the Steel Samurai anymore, so I don't have any idea.\nMaya:\nBah.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry. Ah, so I guess you are all going to the press conference then?\nMaya:\nYeah, of course!\nPowers:\nIf that's the case, then here, take these tickets so you can get in.\nPress Conference Ticket added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThank you very much. Well, let's get going to the lobby.\nPearl:\nIt looks like it's over this way, Mr. Nick!\nMaya:\nOK! For great justice!\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPowers:\nThey called this so suddenly that something about it just seems off, you know?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the press conference?\nPowers:\nYeah. He said, \"There's something I'd like to confess if I win.\" I heard he faxed his request for a conference in to the office only yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nYesterday... (Yeah, that is kind of sudden.)\nPowers:\nBut I guess his manager set everything up somehow, so he was lucky.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Nice manager.\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Only a really gaudy hotel would have such a large, gaudy lobby to match.\nPearl:\nAh, I think they're going to have the post-ceremony show over there.\nPhoenix:\nThey're using a compact stage, I see.\nMaya:\nOoh... I'm all ready to use my special \"Samurai Power\".\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks like she's ready to start a fight...)\nPA Notice:\nYour attention please, your attention please. The Nickel Samurai's Post-Ceremony Stage Show will not be held tonight due to unforeseen circumstances.\nMaya:\nWHAAAT!? WHYYYYY!?\nPhoenix:\nOww! You didn't have to pinch me! Pinch yourself if you don't believe it!\nPA Notice:\nWe are asking for everyone's cooperation at this time. So please stay where you are. ...This is a special request from the police.\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nP-Police? Did they just say the police?\nPowers:\nD-Do you want me to go check out what's going on?\nPhoenix:\nUm, wait, I'll come with you...\n???:\nFreeze! You two! Didn't you hear the announcement just now!? It just finished telling you not to move!\nMaya:\nTh-That voice... I've heard that voice somewhere before...\n???:\nHonestly, youth these days can't be bothered to listen to other people when they talk! Just the other day it was the same thing! There was a small footbridge with a sign next to it that said, \"Beware, Bridge Out!\" And along comes a snot-nosed little punk kid right up to the bridge. I tried to tell the boy the bridge was out and it was dangerous, but would he listen!? No, of course not! He said he'd be careful and only walk on the \"in\" part of the bridge since the \"out\" part is what was dangerous! I am not kidding you here! The kid said that and really meant it! WELL! I really let him have it then, and knocked him clear off of that bridge! Honestly, kids these days don't know right from wrong, I tell you!\nPowers:\nThis non-stop chatter...\nPhoenix:\nI-It can't be... ...Ms. Oldbag?\n???:\n...\nOldbag:\nWhat is it, you young whipper-snappers!? Do I know you!? ...Wait. YOU! You're Powers, aren't you!?\nPowers:\nY-Yeah. Um, about what happened back then...\nOldbag:\nYou didn't even get nominated this year, did you? (Changed from [You didn't get nominated last year either, did you?] in the original release) Oh, that's right. You're doing that children's exercise program, trying to play nice.\nPowers:\nAh, yeah, that's me. Thankfully I still have a job...\nOldbag:\nI love that show, and you're a hoot! You're the \"big brother\" character, right? Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You're that giant rabbit! (Changed from [Yes, even with your face covered by a mask, I know. You ended up with a rabbit face.] in the original release) What a work of art, but that's how it is, you know? I mean, if you didn't wear the mask, who knows how many TVs you'd break? Really, and shame on those kids exercising around you. They're getting what they deserve. This is why I thought you shouldn't be anywhere...\nPhoenix:\nUm... What are you doing here?\nOldbag:\nLook at my uniform and tell me you can't tell I'm a member of security!\nMaya:\nBut that outfit...\nOldbag:\nAnnoying, noisy brats get the blaster!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nSecond floor\nMaya:\nWow, it looks like there's a fancy restaurant on the second floor!\nPhoenix:\nYou STILL feel like eating?\nMaya:\nI mean, since we're here, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't pull the \"since we're here\" trick on me...)\nPearl:\nWhat a beautiful mansion. Do you live in this wonderful world every day, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, this is my first time in a place like this.\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to say these cameras were set up to cover the post-ceremony stage show.\nMaya:\nBut I wonder where everyone's gone, abandoning their cameras like this...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess something big must have happened...)\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage for the post-ceremony stage show.\nPowers:\nThere was supposed to be a press meeting after the show, but now...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like no one will hear what the Nickel Samurai had to confess after all.\nSeats\nMaya:\nWe're here, so we might as well take some pictures. OK, everyone, sit in a chair!\nPhoenix:\nBut we're all out of film...\nMaya:\nDon't worry about it. There's a zillion cameras over there we can borrow.\nPhoenix:\nHey, hey! You can't just go and \"borrow\" an expensive professional camera like that!\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nMaya:\nWhat incident? What did you do?\nOldbag:\nI didn't do anything, you young'un! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I plead the fifth.\nOldbag:\nBut you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me!?\nOldbag:\nI thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.\nMaya:\nYou? A bodyguard?\nOldbag:\nFor your friend! That fiery, good-looking guy with the red jacket and the ruffles.\nMaya:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth?\nOldbag:\nBut...\nEdgeworth:\nThat sort of arrangement would be entirely too troublesome for me.\nOldbag:\nThat's what he said to me. What did I ever do to deserve that!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nWhat happened?\nMaya:\nUm... So, did something happen?\nOldbag:\nI don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those \"incidents\" happened again.\nPowers:\nA-An \"incident\"? Like a \"murder\" kind of \"incident\"?\nOldbag:\nMaybe. You see, I'm a bit of a devilish woman. So wherever I go, showers of blood are sure to follow. Bet you didn't know that! (Changed from [So wherever I go, a rain of blood will come pouring down. Bet you didn't know that!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUm, then shouldn't you quit being a security guard, at least for other people's sake?\nOldbag:\nSilence, whippersnapper!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nThese eyes of mine are real pros now!\nPhoenix:\n\"Pros\"? Pros at doing what?\nOldbag:\nAt doing police work, of course! My eyes are like a hawk! And my professional eyes spot a messy incident! A messy, bloody incident! That's why I don't have time for you meddling kids and your petty little things!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\n...Hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it? I don't like that devilish smile playing on your lips...\nMaya:\nLet's make like we're going to the bathroom, and check things out!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way. The police told us not go [sic] anywhere, remember?\nMaya:\nHuh!? How B-O-R-I-N-G! You're such a boring guy! You've got no motivation! No spirit!\nPearl:\nHuh? What? What's going on? Are you giving Mystic Maya trouble again, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Not you too, Pearls... Please don't stick your little nose into this one...)\nMaya:\nSo listen to this, Pearly. This one time at lawyer camp, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nO-OK! I get it! Let's go take a look.\nMaya:\nYay! I know you couldn't say no to me, Nick!\nPearl:\nThat's right. You'd walk over miles of hot coals for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That would be EVERY time we work a case together...)\nMaya:\nWell, what are we waiting for? Let's go already! You can come along too, Pearly.\nPearl:\nGoody! I get to come! I get to come!\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nThere's nothing really out of the ordinary here...\nPearl:\nAre you looking for the \"in-si-dent\" that the old lady was talking about? (Changed from [Are you looking for the 'something' that the old lady was talking about?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't look like it happened here. Well, we'd better go look somewhere else.\nMaya:\nAlright! Then, let's try...\nBellboy:\nExcuse me.\nMaya:\nAck!\nBellboy:\nAre you by chance, Ms. Maya Fey?\nMaya:\nUm, yeah... That's me.\nBellboy:\nYou have a phone call waiting for you at the front desk.\nMaya:\nA call? I wonder if it's someone from Kurain Village...\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mystic Maya?\nMaya:\nOh, nothing. You guys go on ahead and I'll be right there, OK? (Changed from [Oh, nothing. I'll just go on ahead to check it out, OK?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nOK.\nBellboy:\nRight this way, Ms. Fey.\nPearl:\nLet's go look somewhere else now, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, OK.\nPearl:\nThis is a little exciting... And a little scary...\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of.\nChandelier\nPearl:\nSo, that's called a \"shan-deh leer\", right?\nPhoenix:\nYup.\nPearl:\nWhat is that for? What does it do?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's for lighting up a room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? Can I look down now? My neck hurts...\nTables at the back\nPhoenix:\nThey haven't cleaned up all the food yet. There's a sad feeling hanging in the air now that the party is over...\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was just held on that stage. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nIt's a feast fit for a king!\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nPearl:\nIt was the first time I ate that food. What was it called again? I think it started with \"key\". Key... Wee?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, a \"kiwi\".\nPearl:\nI don't know what to say. It's a sweet but sour fruit all in one.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls, having eaten only vegetables all her life. She's been missing out...)\nHotel Lobby\nExamine\nSecond floor\nPhoenix:\nA lobby with a grand staircase always feels enormous. But right now, the only thing filling this enormous room is anxiety about the murder. ...I really hope nothing else bad happens here...\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nThese cameras must belong to the press that came to cover the conference. They're all basically doing the same thing: staring at the empty stage.\nSeats\nPhoenix:\nSeats for the spectators of the post-ceremony show and the press conference. But it's too bad neither event is going to be held now.\nTalk\nWendy Oldbag\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?\nOldbag:\nOh, that old place? Well, since \"that\" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.\nPearl:\nUm, I guess you must have done something... um... \"deh-plor-ible\"...\nOldbag:\n\"Deplorable!?\" I would never do such a thing! Don't you remember? That incident a year ago... When this lady got on the witness stand and testified.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nOldbag:\nAnd you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?\nPhoenix:\nUm...

What did I ever do to deserve that!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nWhat happened?\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, but what in the world just happened?\nOldbag:\nI don't have all the details, but, it looks like another one of those \"incidents\" happened again.\nPowers:\nA-An \"incident\"?

TOLD. YOU. I get people the info they want! Which means that I've got a right to know!\nNope! Don't care who you are, pal, we're still investigating, so you can't go in!\nWhat's yer problem!? Just ya wait! It'll be all over the morning paper! \"Scruffy Detective's Secret Scandal Revealed!\" You'll see! I'll git ya back!\nPearl:\nThose two sound pretty serious...\nPhoenix:\n(That southern accent can only mean...)\nHey, Wright!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey... Lotta...\nLotta:\nCome on, do a gal a favor and tell this cop I'm just doin' my job and I've got rights...\nGumshoe:\nAh, YOU!\nPhoenix:\nAh... Detective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, help a guy out! Tell her that only the police are allowed here! This is the scene of a murder, so she should leave this to us pros...\nPearl:\nA... A murder!?\nGumshoe:\nAw, shoot! Me and my big mouth!\nLotta:\nSee! I knew it! My gut instinct told me so! I always trust my gut! A murder, it said! And that's what it is! A genuine murder!\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, wait...\nYeehaw, a murder! Of a big star, no less!\nGumshoe:\nOh, man... I'm in trouble now...\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nSo... Detective Gumshoe... A murder...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, no, that's not it. I got my facts mixed up for a second there, pal.\nPearl:\nU-Um... Mr. Nick? Is the dead person the Nickel Samurai...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Why do you ask?\nPearl:\nWell, Mystic Maya was rooting for him, so...\nGumshoe:\nIt wasn't the Nickel Samurai that got bumped. Actually, the Nickel Samurai is the one under suspicion of doing the bumping off...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nThe guy that died was this hero named the Jammin' Ninja, pal.\nPhoenix:\nThe Jammin' Ninja...\nLotta Hart\nPearl:\nUm, that woman with the big puffy hair that looks like cotton candy...\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Lotta?\nPearl:\nThat woman... She was there that time too, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat time?\nPearl:\n...When Mystic Maya did that channeling...\nPhoenix:\nOh, that time... Well, Lotta's a journalist, so that's why she was there.\nPearl:\nJer-nal-ist...\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like she was hanging around here before the murder happened.\nPhoenix:\n\"Hanging around\"...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, hiding in wait in front of the Jammin' Ninja's door, pal.\nPhoenix:\nB-But why would she...?\nGumshoe:\nShe wouldn't tell me, pal. Just said something about \"Gettin' my big scoop\"...\nPhoenix:\n(Scoop? What sort of news could she be after...?)\nThe victim (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nSo the victim was the Jammin' Ninja?\nPearl:\nMr. Jammin' Ninja...?\nGumshoe:\nHe was on a really popular rival TV show to \"The Nickel Samurai\".\nPearl:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nThe victim was the action star, Juan Corrida. He got a huge push and rode the express train to stardom. I mean, even I know who he is!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, even I recognize his face...)\nGumshoe:\nBut I heard lately that Matt Engarde's been taking the wind out of his sail. I'm telling you, pal, as far as who's popular, those two are hogging all the limelight.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess there's no space for Mr. Powers at all, huh... Poor guy...)\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde... Um... That's the Nickel Samurai, right...?\nGumshoe:\nYup. I mean, no! You've got to say it with more umph! \"The Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n...Anyway, so now that Juan Corrida's gone, that means Mr. Engarde has the whole stage to himself, wouldn't you say?\nGumshoe:\nI wouldn't bet on it, pal. We can't have that happen, you know?\nPhoenix:\n\"Can't have that happen\"? (What's that supposed to mean, I wonder...)\nArrested? (appears after presenting Matt Engarde profile)\nPhoenix:\nWh-Why was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's not something I can tell you. We just started the investigation, so we don't want any leaks.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like yet another \"Steel Samurai\" hero is in hot water...)\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick... If Mystic Maya knew about this...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know. She'd make me take this case... I know...\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI was really shocked by what happened to her in that one case. I didn't know she had such an awesome power!\nPearl:\nAwesome power...?\nGumshoe:\nI thought maybe I should do some self-improvement and take up a hobby. So I went out and bought some Morning Glory seeds and planted them, pal.\nPhoenix:\n...That's a good way to improve yourself.\nGumshoe:\nHo ho ho. Well, it's nothing really...\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nThat girl is number three on my \"People I've Seen A Lot Of Lately\" list.\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then who's number one...?\nGumshoe:\nAs if you need to ask. It's YOU, pal!\nPhoenix:\nA-Ah... So who's number two?\nGumshoe:\nMaya Fey. ...But it looks like she's not around this time.\nPearl:\nIt must be nice to be such good friends with each other, isn't it Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think that's the real meaning of Detective Gumshoe's list...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nI look good! I think I've lost some weight, pal!\nPhoenix:\nIt's only wishful thinking.\nGumshoe:\nWishful thinking, huh? ... In that case, I wishfully think I've lost some weight!\nPhoenix:\n(I wishfully think he might face the facts one day...)\nGumshoe:\nLately, I've been on the instant noodles only diet, pal!\nJuan Corrida profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm not a real fan of action shows or anything... But I know who Juan Corrida and Matt Engarde are.\nPhoenix:\nYou can't talk about one without talking about the other, I guess.\nGumshoe:\nThey even debuted around the same time. So they have this real fiery rivalry with each other. Kinda like you and me, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(I never knew he thought of me as a rival...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nThe Nickel Samurai! He really took the Grand Prix tonight!\nPhoenix:\nMaya's a big fan of his.\nGumshoe:\nReally? ...Oh, I'm sorry then.\nPearl:\nWhy are you sorry?\nGumshoe:\nMatt Engarde was just arrested, pal. ...On suspicion of murdering Juan Corrida.\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nAny evidence\nPhoenix:\nWould you take a look at this for me?\nGumshoe:\nListen, pal... I'm not leaking any info about the evidence to you this time. If I do, my salary's really gonna get it... And then I won't even be able to get those instant noodles down at the discount market!\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nDo you know this person?\nGumshoe:\nYou meet a lot of people as a detective, pal. So we make extra sure to not forget people because that's our job. ...Now, having said that, I don't remember ever seeing this person before.\nPearl:\nWhich means that you're kind of forgetful, aren't you Mr. Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThat's not what it means... Not exactly anyway...\nAfter clearing \"The victim\" and \"Arrested?\" Talk options in Gatewater Hotel - Hallway:\nMarch 20Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nPowers:\nHey! So what's going on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Juan Corrida has been killed.\nPowers:\nWh-Wh-What!? Juan is... He's...!?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like he was murdered... And a suspect was arrested. That suspect is Mr. Matt Engarde.\nPowers:\nY-You're joking, right!?\nPhoenix:\nNope. They arrested the Nickel Samurai on suspicion of murdering the Jammin' Ninja.\nPowers:\nOoogh... Not again... I feel sick.\nPearl:\n\"Again\"...?\nPhoenix:\n...About a year ago, something just like this happened, Pearls.\nPowers:\nI still can't believe... No way... No way Matt would...\nPhoenix:\n(...? What's Mr. Powers got in his hand...?)\nPowers:\n...Oh, before I forget... This... This is for you, Mr. Wright. I got this from the bellboy that came by earlier.\nRadio Transceiver received from Mr. Powers.\nPhoenix:\n...For me...? But why?\nPowers:\nI don't know. All he said was it was for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney.\nTalk\nMatt and Juan\nPowers:\nMatt is the most energetic and active actor out there right now. The Nickel Samurai really sealed his place as a pop idol, but... he kept adding fuel to the fire of his rivalry with Juan anyway.\nPearl:\nMr. Juan... He's the Jammin' Ninja, right?\nPowers:\nThose two would butt heads over everything they could think of. But I'd say that Matt was the one who almost always came out on top.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess some people only know how to relate to others by butting heads like a ram...)\nPowers:\nJuan said that he'd take Matt on this time too, so he joined a rival TV show.\nPearl:\nAnd that was \"The Jammin' Ninja\"...?\nPowers:\nThe stylish Nickel Samurai and the burning Jammin' Ninja... Well, things turned messy real fast with those two using their shows for their \"war\". And the final tally... Look around... It's pretty obvious how things ended up.\nPhoenix:\n(Matt even won the Grand Prix this year... The final win over his rival, I guess...)\nPress conference\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde was going to hold a press conference, wasn't he?\nPowers:\nThat's what I heard. Though if you wanted to get technical about it, it was the Nickel Samurai's conference.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai's...?\nPowers:\nYeah. He was supposed to wear his costume and give the press conference that way.\nPhoenix:\nHe was going to be in costume...? But why? (Changed from [So he was supposed to be in-costume...? But why?] in the original release)\nPowers:\nI'm not sure... They don't keep me in the loop anymore.\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nPowers:\nIt was almost right after you guys left. An old man who's a bellboy at this hotel showed up.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when he told you to give this to me...?\nPowers:\nYeah...\nPhoenix:\n(Why... Why give me this transceiver...?)\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nHey, where did Maya go off to?\nPhoenix:\nShe got a phone call.\nPowers:\nOh yeah, that's right. She was heading for the front desk just now. She sure stands out in a crowd, doesn't she?\nWill Powers profile\nPowers:\nHey, is my face really all that scary? Kids won't come anywhere near me... But when I cover my face, then they're all shocked because they figure out who I am...\nPearl:\nI think your face makes you look like a very kind person!\nPowers:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aww... Mr. Powers is getting teary eyed.)\nJuan Corrida profile\nPowers:\nHe debuted around the same time as Matt in everything, you know.\nPearl:\nReally?\nPowers:\nYeah, it started out small... First it was singing contests, then swimming competitions... Then it was bowling tournaments, and then it was who could throw the best New Year's parties... Juan was always trying to one-up Matt. But lately, those two were escalating to more and more dangerous things... I thought that no good would come of it all, so I began to worry.\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad Juan's story ended so soon...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nPowers:\nMatt's younger than me, but you can practically see his star potential.\nPearl:\nHis star po-ten-shial...?\nPowers:\nI got his autograph the other day.\nPhoenix:\n...Feels kind of wrong now, doesn't it?\nPowers:\nI don't care what people say! Matt didn't kill Juan! I know he didn't!\nAny other profile\nPowers:\nUmm... I'm honored you're asking me, But I have no idea who this person is. Umm... Sorry...\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK. You don't have to apologize so much.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPearl:\nUm... I was just wondering... Where's Mystic Maya? She's been gone a long time.\nPhoenix:\n(Now that she mentions it, she was only going to answer a phone call...)\nPearl:\nMaybe she got lost. I'll take a quick look around for her.\n...*beep beep beep*...\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nPearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I... I'm not sure... (It's coming from this transceiver...) (Changed from [Did this transceiver just...?] in the original release)\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, hello? Wright here...\n???:\nIs this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney?\nPhoenix:\nAnd you are...!?\n???:\nYou don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with... Such as...\nMaya:\nHeeelp! Niiiiick!\nPearl:\nM-Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\nMaya...?\n???:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Wouldn't you agree that the more important issue is the fate of the girl?\nPhoenix:\n(Her fate? Does he mean what I think he means...?) Maya! Where are you!? Are you hurt!?\n???:\nCome now. Don't fall apart on me yet.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This... No! This can't be!)\n???:\nNow that I have your attention, Mr. Attorney, I have a modest proposal for you. If you do what I require, then I will return to you your valuable \"item\" unharmed. ...What is this called again in your fancy lawyer terms?\nPhoenix:\n...\"Kidnapping for ransom\"...\n???:\nYes, that's it. This is a kidnapping.\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\nPhoenix:\n(M-My sight... Everything's fading away... Maya... Maya... Maya's been kidnapped!)\n???:\n...--re you there? Mr. Attorney, are you there? (Changed from [You there? Mr. Wright, are you there?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nH-How much!? How much do you want!?\n???:\nVery good, Mr. Attorney. I'm glad you have such a good grasp of the situation.\nPhoenix:\nHurry up and state your condition! And then return Maya--\n???:\nMoney is not what I seek.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\n???:\nWhat I want is a certain verdict. I would like a complete acquittal.\nPhoenix:\nComplete acquittal!? Wh-What in the world have you done to need...!?\n???:\nI am not the person you will be representing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\n???:\nYou are currently at the Gatewater Hotel, are you not? And I know that a murder has just taken place there.\nPhoenix:\nJuan Corrida was killed, and the suspect is Matt Engarde...\n???:\nYou are, as expected, quite on top of things, Mr. Attorney. Now then. What I want is very simple. I want you to obtain a complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nPhoenix:\nM-Matt Engarde? But why?\n???:\nHe did not kill anyone. I can attest to that. However...\nPhoenix:\nH-However!? However what!?\n???:\nHowever, someone is framing him for the murder. A very smart someone who is setting him up to take the fall...\nPhoenix:\n... (If I agree and do what he wants, can I believe he'll keep his end of the bargain!?)\n???:\nYou are, of course, at liberty to take me at my word or not. (Changed from [You are, of course, at liberty to believe me or not.] in the original release) However, there is one thing you can take as fact. Right now, your very precious \"item\" is with me, in my possession.\nMaya:\nMmngnhhh... Heeelp!... Nngmph... NIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\n???:\nYou have two days. Of course, tonight, he will be in questioning with the police. But the trial is in two days. At that trial, you will win a not guilty verdict. Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Attorney. (Changed from [Remember, you only have one chance. One chance, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nO-One...!? Y-You expect me to get a not guilty in one trial day!?\n???:\nYes, exactly. I don't believe I was wrong in choosing you, so don't let me down.\nPhoenix:\nAagh!\n???:\nOh, yes, that's right. Now that I am playing the role of the kidnapper, I can't pass up this chance to say, \"And don't even think about callin' the cops!\" ...Hmm, not great, but you get the idea.\nPhoenix:\nD-Dammit! Who... Who the hell are you!?\n???:\nAlright, I'll tell you that much. My name is... ...De Killer.\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Wh-Where is Mystic Maya!?\nPhoenix:\n...She's been kidnapped.\nPearl:\nN-No... ... It's all my fault! If only I had gone with Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault, Pearls.\nPearl:\nBut it is! It is! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nPowers:\nMr. Wright... I think we... I think we should tell the police what it's [sic] going on...!\nPhoenix:\n(No! We can't do that! If we do, who knows what will happen to Maya...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What about the detective we saw earlier...?\nPhoenix:\n(...Detective Gumshoe!) Yes, that's it! Wait here, and I'll be right back!\nPowers:\nAlright! I'll take care of Pearl while you're away!\nHallway\nGumshoe:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANSOM!?\nPhoenix:\nShhh! Not so loud! ...The ransom is complete acquittal for Matt Engarde.\nGumshoe:\nWait, the deal is \"complete acquittal\" in exchange for Maya, you mean...? Then this means Matt Engarde is obviously the killer, pal! No doubt about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut the guy said that Mr. Engarde is innocent...\nGumshoe:\nYou really believe what a KIDNAPPER tells you, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he has a point... If Engarde is really innocent, then why the kidnapping?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd on top of everything else, there's all this evidence we keep finding.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nThe forensics team's having a field day back there. (Changed from [The guys with the eagle eyes are really lapping it up like they just caught a huge fish.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nGumshoe:\nBut it's strange. There's so much evidence that it feels like something's wrong.\nPhoenix:\nThere's too much evidence? Is that possible? (Actually, didn't the kidnapper say something about Engarde being \"set-up\"...?)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, looks like you won't be leaving here tonight, pal. Just sit tight and cooperate with the investigation. Tomorrow you can start yours.\nPhoenix:\n...A-Alright... (Isn't there another way...?)\nGumshoe:\nWe've also got to be careful about pushing the kidnapper the wrong way.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right...\nDate:\u00a0??? Time:\u00a0???Location:\u00a0???\nMaya:\nNnngh... Oww, my head... (Wh-Where... Where am I!? I wonder if I'm still in that hotel... Wh-What happened to me...?) Nick... Pearly! ... (Come on, you guys. This isn't funny anymore...)\n...*ka-click*...\n???:\nI see you have awoken.\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Wh-Wh-Wh-Who are you!?\n???:\nMe? ...I am known as \"De Killer\".\nMaya:\n\"D-De Killer\"!? You mean like an \"ASSASSIN\"!? (I... I'm too young to die!)\n???:\nDon't worry. You are not my target. ...For now anyway.\nMaya:\nA-Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Nick! Nick! Where are you!? ...Help me...\n???:\nYes, that's right. Only one person can save you now, and that is Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\n...Huh? Wh-What? Nick... Nick's going to save me...?\n???:\nCalm down and be a good girl. Think of this as a business transaction.\nMaya:\nA... A business transaction?\n???:\nI am going to contact him now. I hope you'll cooperate and play your assigned role well.\nMaya:\n...Nick... What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearly... (Changed from [What's going to happen to me? Nick... Pearls...] in the original release) ...Sis...\n???:\n... Is this Mr. Phoenix Wright, the attorney? ... You don't need to know who I am. I think you have other things to be concerning yourself with...

If only I had gone with you... (Changed from [Ah, Mystic Maya! If only... If only I went with you that time...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Pearls... She's been like this since last night... We managed to get home somehow, yesterday evening... Thanks to Detective Gumshoe gently holding her by the hand and leading her here... But by the looks of it, I don't think Pearls got any sleep at all last night.)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Mystic Maya... She's alright, right!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she's alright. Either way, I'm going to save her. You can trust me on that.\nPearl:\nPlease... Please... Help her...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm only able to stay this calm and collected...

I have a thought...\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nPearl:\nYou're going to represent Mr. Engarde... aren't you?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I don't really seem to have a choice.\nPearl:\nUm, but what if... What if he... ...is the real murderer? What would you do then, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWould you fight to get a not guilty for a murderer to save Mystic Maya...?\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Let's talk to Mr. Engarde first, OK? ...We can think all the bad things we want, but it doesn't change a thing.\nPearl:\nY-Yeah, you're right... I'm sorry. I... I can't stop thinking about it...\nMaya's situation\nPhoenix:\nPearls... You're really worried about Maya, aren't you?\nPearl:\nI... I don't have anyone else left in this world.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean...?\nPearl:\nMy family's all gone...\nPhoenix:\n(...Her family...)\nPearl:\nMy father... He left my mother and the village behind and went away.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry...\nPearl:\nAnd... my mother... She did that thing... all for me...\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nMystic Maya...

How are you today?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI know this situation might be a little tough for you...\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... We're...\nEngarde:\nOh, sorry dude...\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nI already signed up...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me...?\nEngarde:\nI already have life insurance. I signed up a long time ago cause my job is, you know...\nPhoenix:\n... Oh! No no no... We're not insurance salespeople!\nEngarde:\nReally...? Dude, I really don't need that right now either.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEngarde:\nFire extinguishers. I mean, this building isn't my house, so...\nPhoenix:\n... No no no... We're not here to sell you fire extinguishers either! I'm a lawyer. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nEngarde:\nA lawyer...? ... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my manager, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nThe Nickel Samurai sure is a strange person, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(I think \"strange\" is an understatement.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. You're just in time.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\nEngarde:\nYou're a lawyer dude, right? My manager's looking for a good one right now, so how about it?\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! This is our chance!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to make him let me take his case! I have to!)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera. Mr. Engarde keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nPhoenix:\nSorry to intrude, but I would like to ask you a few personal questions.\nEngarde:\nUm, that's OK, but dude, my autobiography's coming out soon, so... If I say stuff without the publisher's approval, then I'm gonna be in real hot water... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna ask my publisher, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nMr. Engarde is so lucky! He has so many people he can talk to.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... I don't know if he actually has anyone he can really talk to...)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. Like I thought, the publisher said it'd be \"real bad\" if I said anything, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(Does he have a mind of his own!?)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, I would like to ask you about the murder...\nEngarde:\nOh, are you covering this for a tabloid as a side job, dude? Um, um... Well, if you want my statement on this, you should ask through my staff...\nPhoenix:\nNo no no... I'm not asking on behalf of a tabloid...\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the president of the studio, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nIs he alright, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(If we're talking about Mr. Engarde's brain here, I wouldn't put my money on it.)\nEngarde:\nSorry about that. The studio president said, \"Even Neo Mt. Fuji itself knows that I'm not the murderer!\"\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? What's \"Neo Mt. Fuji\"...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a mountain in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo; the city the Nickel Samurai protects.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nMr. Engarde, this is an attorney's badge.\nEngarde:\nDude, I'm sorry, but I don't have the free time to be looking at things like that.\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nEngarde:\nI'm much too busy with Nickel Samurai stuff right now.\nEngarde:\nI don't have the time to take a lawyer's correspondence course...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does he believe I'm a salesman!? Insurance, then extinguishers... Now this!!)\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\n...? What's that?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a ticket for the press conference. You were going to give one after winning the Grand Prix, right?\nEngarde:\nHuh? Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. While you were in costume, no less. ([in costume] hyphenated in the original release)\nEngarde:\nUm, I never heard anything like that, dude. I only heard about the stage show. I always leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't know...? That's odd...)\nRadio Transceiver\nPearl:\n...Mr. Nick? What are you going to do with that?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know yet, but I figured I could at least show it to him...\nEngarde:\nIs that a transceiver? Hey, it looks like a real nice one, too.\nPhoenix:\nI got it as a \"present\" from someone.\nEngarde:\nHmm? Interesting.\nPhoenix:\nI've also been instructed to take your case.\nEngarde:\nIs that what you heard from the transceiver?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nEngarde:\nDude, that's terrible! Don't let some disembodied voice boss you around!\nPhoenix:\n(This coming from a man with a cell phone on his wrist...)\nWill Powers profile\nEngarde:\nI've seen him somewhere before... Is he a member of my fan club?\nPhoenix:\nThat's Mr. Powers. Isn't he supposed to be kind of like a mentor to you?\nEngarde:\nPowers...? Oh yeah! He's the guy on that kid's exercise program. I gave him an autograph just the other day.\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't see Mr. Powers as a mentor at all...)\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nMan, it's too bad he's dead...\nPhoenix:\nYou killed him... That's the most logical conclusion, don't you agree?\nEngarde:\nDude, what are you talking about!? You're making a huge mistake.\nPhoenix:\nIf that's such a mistake, then why did they issue an arrest warrant for you!?\nEngarde:\nHold on a sec. I'm gonna ask the guy in charge of this place, OK? ... ...\nPearl:\nStars sure know a lot of people, don't they?\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that phone even really gets reception in here...)\nEngarde:\n...Um, I guess you're right about the warrant after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we might be making some progress here!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nEngarde:\nYeah... I'm such a handsome devil.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um, yeah...\nEngarde:\nAnd I'm way good at sports! Karate, tennis, judo, soccer, football, hockey, fencing...

Now you dudes use kids to pull in clients, too?\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't take me as your lawyer, then De Killer is going to...!\nEngarde:\n... Wait... What did you just say?\nPhoenix:\n\"De Killer\"...\nEngarde:\nD-De Killer!?\nPhoenix:\n(...What's he doing? He looks like he's mulling something over...)\nEngarde:\n... Alright, dude. I accept your terms.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEngarde:\nI'll let you represent me in court.\nPearl:\nW-We did it! We did it, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah... (I don't feel any better for it... And he doesn't look too happy either...)\nEngarde:\nGo ahead, ask me anything. I'll help out as much as I can...\nTalk\nMatt Engarde\nEngarde:\nMan, I thank my lucky stars that people know my name.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're quite the hero, and you're in the national spotlight.\nPearl:\nI didn't know who he is... Does that mean I'm not a good citizen...?\nEngarde:\nAh, it's really great to be the Nickel Samurai. Dude, lately, I just keep on getting more and more popular.\nPhoenix:\n(True enough... \"The Nickel Samurai\" is very popular among high schoolers and secretaries right now. I guess Mr. Engarde has a way of catching the eyes of women...)\nEngarde:\nDo you know my motto? \"Refreshing like a spring breeze.\" That's what I am.\nPearl:\nA spring breeze...\nEngarde:\nThat's why this kind of scandal is disastrous, dude. I mean, even if I get out of here tomorrow, it's still gonna look bad.\nPhoenix:\n(But everyone loves a good scandal...) (Changed from [Everyone loves a good scandal...] in the original release)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me about your activities last night?\nEngarde:\nAfter I got the award, I took a break and went back to my room. I had that post-ceremony stage show to do. So I was in my Nickel Samurai costume.\nPhoenix:\nAnd you were alone the entire time?\nEngarde:\nMy manager was running around being busy, so yeah.\nPhoenix:\nBecause of the press conference you were supposed to have after the show?\nEngarde:\nI told you, dude. I have no idea about any press conference, alright?\nPhoenix:\n(That's strange... I thought the Nickel Samurai was going to confess something...)\nEngarde:\nAnyway, when I was leaving my room, that's when I noticed it was kinda noisy...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida was already dead at that time...?\nEngarde:\nYeah, that's what I gathered anyway from my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm beginning to gather that this guy can't do a thing on his own...) (Changed from [With the way he's always talking about his manager, it's as if she runs his life.] in the original release)\nEngarde:\nAnd that's when the detective in the green coat showed up. He searched me... And then, out of the blue, the dude arrested me.\nThe victim (appears after \"Matt Engarde\")\nPhoenix:\nAbout you and the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida, what sort of...\nEngarde:\nThat's got nothing to do with anything, dude. Man, with that face of his, you can't even tell he's the same age as me. And he wanted to try making a \"Jammin' Ninja\" movie, even though we all know it'd fail.\nPhoenix:\nThe Nickel Samurai still won in the end, right?\nEngarde:\nYeah. I took the Grand Prix by storm. So why would I, the winner, have any reason to kill the guy anyway? Dude, you'd think it'd be the other way around, you know?\nThe charge of murder (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know why you were arrested?\nEngarde:\nI guess maybe my full body search went badly.\nPhoenix:\nDid they find something on you?\nEngarde:\nThey found a button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nPhoenix:\nA button...?\nEngarde:\nI don't get it either. It was caught in the pleats of my samurai pants, or \"hakama\".\nPearl:\nAaah!\nEngarde:\nDude, I really think someone planted it there though. I'm serious.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if that's what really happened...?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... (...I guess this is about all I'm going to get out of him...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nPearl:\nLet's ask one last thing. Let's test Mr. Engarde to see if he really is innocent or not...\nPhoenix:\nW-We can do that...?\nPearl:\nYes. If you use this...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's Magatama!)\nPearl:\nHe won't be able to hide any secrets from you, Mr. Nick. I'm sure of it.\nPhoenix:\n(I get it...!) ...Mr. Engarde, I'd like to ask you one more question. Please answer me honestly.\nEngarde:\nWhat is it, dude?\nPhoenix:\nDid you kill Mr. Juan Corrida?\nEngarde:\n...\nPhoenix:\nPlease put the phone away and answer this question yourself.\nEngarde:\nAlright. Just so we're clear, dude, I didn't kill anyone, and that includes Juan Corrida, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...\nPearl:\nWell, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nNothing. Not a chain or lock in sight.\nPearl:\nWhich means... I think it is alright to trust him.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it does appear that way. Well, at least I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing my client is innocent.)\nEngarde:\nUm... The trial's tomorrow, right? I'm counting on you, dude.\nTo be continued.\nMarch 21, 11:34 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWell, at least we were able to get Mr. Matt Engarde as our client. And we know that he didn't do it... Which is very important...\nPearl:\nSo! So now what should we do!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the trial is tomorrow. And we only get this one chance. There's only one way to prove Mr. Engarde's innocence. We have to find the real killer.\nPearl:\nOK! Then let's start looking!\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Actually, the crime happened at the recently completed hotel in the center of town, the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. ...Just how far are they going to expand their empire...?\nCharley the plant\nPearl:\nOh! I'll water it!\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's OK... I already did that...\nPearl:\n...The watering can... Where are you, Mr. Watering Can...?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls gets too wound up if she's not doing something to distract herself... I hope Charley can withstand Typhoon Pearls...)\nPoster\nPearl:\nThis is the Nickel Samurai... right?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's right.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Please take care of Mystic Maya, and be her \"Nickel Samurai\", alright!?\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.\nPearl:\nOh! Do you need to look something up in one of these law books, Mr. Nick!? Wh-Which book is it!? Which book do you need!? ... Umm... I can't read those hard books, and... um... I can't reach them either...\nPhoenix:\nI-It's OK, Pearls. Really.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMy desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...\nPearl:\nOh! I cleaned it up some more for you last night! ...Because I couldn't sleep...\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSince there were no Psyche-Locks, then that means we can trust Mr. Engarde to be innocent.\nPearl:\nI really feel much better knowing that. Ever since last night, I was so worried that I kept wondering... \"What if he is the real killer...? What then...?\"\nAny ideas\nPhoenix:\nHey, I have something I want to ask you, Pearls.\nPearl:\nOK, what is it?\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you so interested in how Maya and I get along? I mean, she and I don't have anything special go--\nPearl:\nHuh!? Wh-What do you mean!? B-But I thought... I thought you and Mystic Maya were... I-I've been mistaken all this time!? No way...!\nPhoenix:\n(Aaaah! She really wasn't kidding! Pearls actually believes Maya and I are... ...Maybe I should've just left it alone...)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Stop it! Don't hide your true feelings from me!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! She slapped me!!)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPearl:\nThat's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nI guess?\nPearl:\nI feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...)\nMaya Fey profile\nPearl:\nOh, Mystic Maya... I wonder if you're alright...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure she's OK. We have to be patient for just one more day. I'm sure we can save her. Trust me.\nPearl:\nIf there's anything I can do, please tell me, OK!?\nPearl Fey profile\nPearl:\nTo tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me.\nPhoenix:\nI think your hair now suits you perfectly.\nPearl:\nR-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget*\nPhoenix:\n*fidget, fidget*\nDick Gumshoe profile\nPearl:\nI'm sure that Mr. Detective would be our ally if we asked!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I think so too. (Looking back, we've known each other for a while now... He's always been trustworthy... A bit \"off\", but still trustworthy. What a paradox.)\nWill Powers profile\nPearl:\nHe's a really kind and nice old man, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is really perceptive when it comes to people... But what does she mean by \"old man\"...?) Hey, Pearls? What about me...?\nPearl:\nWhat about you, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, I don't think I want to hear this...)\nAnything else\nPearl:\nUm, there are still so many things in this world that I don't understand yet. ...Honestly, I still don't have enough training.\nPhoenix:\nAh, no, it's OK. I don't have any ideas myself...\nPearl:\nI'm sorry. I'm really sorry!\nMarch 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEngarde:\nAh, the lawyer dude. So what did you find out?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... I'm still in the middle of investigating...\nEngarde:\nI see. ...But I've already told you everything I know, dude.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nEngarde:\nDude, like I told you, I don't know anything about that press conference. I leave that kind of stuff to my manager.\nPhoenix:\n(...This is harder than pulling bass from a river...)\nRadio Transceiver\nEngarde:\nSo, why are you carrying around that transceiver...?\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about it.\nEngarde:\nAnd why do you do everything it tells you to do? You know, the messages it sends you, dude.\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, he probably doesn't have anything to do with Maya's kidnapping.) ...That's a secret.\nEngarde:\nOK, whatever, dude.\nJuan Corrida profile\nEngarde:\nLook, dude, I didn't kill him. I mean, the Nickel Samurai kicked the Jammin' Ninja's butt, right? So it's not like I felt threatened by the likes of him.\nPearl:\nBeing rivals sounds like a sad way to relate to another person...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHotel Lobby\nOldbag:\nHey! What do you think you're doing!? You can't come in without...\nPearl:\nGood morning.\nOldbag:\nHold on, it's YOU! What is going on around here!?\nPhoenix:\nU-Uh... Um...\nOldbag:\nI heard poor Juan was killed. Is that true!? It's a bad rerun is what this is. Another \"Steel Samurai\" doing the most evil of deeds.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you know... That's not entirely...\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know that I was a huge fan of Juan's! Why, oh why, do all the stars I'm interested in drop one by one like flies!? It's always been that way! Ever since I was a little girl in elementary school! The class hamster was fine until it was my turn to clean its cage, and then it died! The other kids started calling me the \"Queen Reaper\". I swear that's what they dubbed me! \"Whoever you name in your evil spell dies within three minutes,\" they would taunt.\nPhoenix:\nUm... Actually, I wanted to ask you about the murder and what happened...\nOldbag:\nHmph! Don't push me, boy!\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? I... Um... I couldn't hear everything she said... because she was talking too fast...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, could you please speak a little slower...?\nOldbag:\nDon't boss me around, you spiky-haired, smarty-pants!\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\nExamine\nStage\nPhoenix:\nIt's the stage they were going to use for the post-ceremony stage show. After the show, there was supposed to be a press conference, but...\nPearl:\n...Even Mr. Engarde himself didn't seem to know, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(How does the person who's supposed to give a conference not know about it...?)\nTalk\nThe victim\nOldbag:\nMy dear Hammer died a year ago in that dreadful murder. And only recently did I finally find a star that makes this heart go *badump* again.\nPhoenix:\n...I don't know what to say...\nOldbag:\nI ask you, why does every star I cheer for always ends [sic] up kicking the bucket?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nI'd watch your words! No one's going to get away with saying anything bad about my Juan!\nPhoenix:\nBut I haven't said anything...\nOldbag:\nWell, I don't believe a word that woman says anyway!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What woman?\nOldbag:\nThat irritating, backwater girl with the afro and the horrible country accent. I mean, what is that manner of speaking supposed to be? And why does she never stop? Honestly, women these days. They don't know the meaning of the word \"modesty\". When I was a young maiden, I was so beautiful even the flowers of the field blushed. But despite this, I pressed flowers, or read the stars, or wrote beautiful love poems or\nPhoenix:\n...Pearls? Are you thirsty?\nPearl:\nUm, a little.\nPhoenix:\nOK. I'll go get you some juice or something.\nPearl:\nTh-Thank you very much.\nOldbag:\nHey! Are you paying attention!? Young'uns today!\nPhoenix:\n(So I'm guessing Ms. Oldbag heard everything from Lotta...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nI want to ask you about what happened around the time of the murder...\nOldbag:\nAh, I don't know anything about that. I was here getting ready.\nPhoenix:\nGetting ready? For what...?\nOldbag:\nThe show, of course! ...Well, and the press conference afterwards.\nPhoenix:\n(Cue mysterious music for the magical press conference.)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I don't know anything about the murder.\nPhoenix:\nAh, I see...\nOldbag:\n... But.\nPhoenix:\n?\nOldbag:\nBut if you're talking about what I saw, that's different. I saw it very clearly!\nPearl:\nWhat!?\nOldbag:\nI saw the most important moment of the night!\nWhat you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nTh-The most important moment!? You don't mean...!?\nOldbag:\nOh, so now you treat me with respect, you disrespectful child. When you speak to your elders, you should always be polite. Really, kids today.\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see!?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nOldbag:\nThe murder last night was gruesome, wasn't it? But then, what murder isn't?\nPhoenix:\n(Please don't stray onto another tangent... Please...)\nOldbag:\nIf you want to hear more, then show your respect and bring this lady a present!\nWhat you witnessed (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me! What did you see on the night of the murder!?\nRay Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPearl:\nP-Please! Mystic Maya's life is...\nOldbag:\nAh, but you haven't given me my present yet. ...Hmm... Let's see... I'll only tell it to you if you can bring me Juan's autograph!\nPhoenix:\n(What an unreasonable request... You might as well have asked for the moon!)\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nI don't have anything to say to delinquents like you!\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr... She's clamming up like the old clam she is...)\nPearl:\nPlease! Anything would be helpful!\nOldbag:\nWell then, how about I tell you my measurements?\nPhoenix:\n...Um... No, that's okay... Really.\nPearl:\nShe really doesn't like you, does she Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI know, I know...\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like the investigation is still in full swing. The hotel staff and the police are running around like a bunch of headless chickens.\nPearl:\nI wonder if we can do any investigating of our own in this kind of atmosphere...\nPhoenix:\n...Well, got to roll up the sleeves and try, I guess.\nExamine\nDoors on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a grand set of doors over there. It's the doors Maya followed the bellboy out of, only to disappear... ...If only we had all gone together...\nChandelier\nPearl:\nThat is such a beautiful sight.\nPhoenix:\nThe chandelier?\nPearl:\nYes. But I can't believe it... I can't believe that such a terrible murder happened under such beautiful lights... It's shocking.\nStage\nPhoenix:\nThe awards ceremony was held on that stage just last night. It was really fabulous.\nPearl:\nYou just reminded me of the circus for a second. I wonder if everyone is alright.\nPhoenix:\n(I heard that Berry Big Circus just recently started holding performances again...) I'm sure they're all fine, Pearls.\nFront table\nPearl:\nWe ate at this table last night, didn't we?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nPearl:\nI was really happy then.\nPhoenix:\n(I wish I could make you smile again... Even for a second...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelHallway\nLotta:\nHey! Yer here! Been waitin' for ya, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nLotta...\nLotta:\nHey! Mr. Cop fella! The thief's showed his face!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!?\nLotta:\nArrest him! Put him on trial! Find him guilty! Give him the death penalty!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong, Lotta!? Are you feeling alright?\nLotta:\nLooked here and there and up and down the mountain, but it ain't here! So why don'tcha just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep! (Changed from [So why don't ya just hurry up and give it back to me, ya creep!] in the original release)\nPearl:\nUm, what are you looking for...?\nLotta:\nMy CAMERA! C-A-M-E-R-A! It's my life blood! I'm gonna die without my $700 camera!!\nPhoenix:\nY-Your camera...?\nLotta:\nLook, don't lots of people say the criminal always goes back to the scene of the crime!? And lookie lookie, here ya are!\nPhoenix:\nYep. Here I am... Faced with a Lotta trouble.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nExamine\nTeddy bear\nPhoenix:\nI can understand flowers in front of the dressing rooms, but what are stuffed bears doing here...?\nLotta:\nI didn't touch them! Wasn't me, I tell ya! I give ya my word!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get the impression Lotta helped herself to one of them...?)\nFlowers on left\nPhoenix:\nCompared to the flowers on the other side of the hall, these are much more gorgeous. Let's see... Record companies, fan clubs, company workers, family... Carrying all these flowers home would be hard, I think...\nLotta:\nYeah, that's what I thought too, so I was a nice enough gal to lend a helpin' hand! ...Secretly, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(I have a feeling one of these days, I'm going to end up defending her in court...)\nDoor on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Juan Corrida's Room\".\nLotta:\nSo that's the scene of the murder, I reckon. I thought somethin' had gone on that night, but I didn't never think it was murder.\nDoor on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of paper taped to the door that says, \"Matt Engarde's Room\".\nPearl:\nSo Mr. Engarde was here during his break, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what he claims. (Hmm... The crime scene... If he had wanted to get to Mr. Corrida's room... He would have had to pass through this hallway.)\nTalk\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!\nPearl:\nHuh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?\nLotta:\nI had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon. I made this itty-bitty scratch on it and the manager got all huffed up in the face... He gave me his talkin' to and was real mean about it too. He done made me cry at that!\nPearl:\nWhen did you lose your camera?\nLotta:\nLast night, after the murder happened. Musta been when I was busy runnin' around lookin' into things! That's when I lost sight of my dear, darlin' expensive sweetie!\nPhoenix:\nLotta, what did you capture with that expensive camera of yours?\nLotta:\nI don't rightly know. I snapped a shot of anythin' that caught my eye. So I don't 'member. ...And 'sides, I couldn't get anythin' for my big scoop.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Lotta's missing camera is even connected to the murder...?)\nLotta's Camera added to the Court Record.\nCamera (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo you lost your camera...?\nLotta:\nIt ain't no ordinary camera! Ya buy it in a store and it's $1,600 brand new!\nPearl:\nHuh? But didn't you just say you bought it for $700?\nLotta:\nI had a nice long talk with the guy at the store... About five hours, I reckon.

Yeah, actually I was here until around the time Mr. Engarde was arrested.\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you doing here...?\nLotta:\nYou sure you went to school, City Boy? Wherever Lotta Hart goes, there's a story to be found! A big scoop to be had!\nPhoenix:\nA big scoop...?\nLotta:\nI told ya before. I'm gonna be the best tabloid photographer the world's ever seen! Reckon course that means I'm always lookin' for the perfect shot!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what \"scoop\" she was after this time...?)\nLotta:\nAlthough, I was also on the look out for the other stars that were here, so... maybe I wasn't here the entire time...\nBig scoop (appears after \"Camera\" and \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nLotta... Are you sure you weren't here the entire time? So you could take a picture for your big scoop?\nLotta:\nWell... Maybe I was. But that's what real journalists do! I got some juicy inside info, so I thought to myself, why not get a picture for proof?\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of story was it that you would hang around here...?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nOops, sorry, Mr. Lawyer. Can't be tellin' you that. Trade secret, ya know?\nPhoenix:\n(Not again... Why does everyone have something to hide...?)\nPearl:\nWe've been stopped, haven't we?\nLotta:\nHa ha, yeah! Take that, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here is happy... Ms. Lotta and your \"I rule!\" smile...)\nBig scoop (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou were on the hunt for your big scoop last night?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nLotta:\nIt's just a bunch of tabloid photos. They ain't got nothing to do with the murder.\nPearl:\nIt looks like we have no choice but to remove the Psyche-Locks.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I guess so.\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nLotta:\nHey, what's that? ...A press conference ticket? How come I ain't got myself one of them!?\nPhoenix:\nP-Please don't direct your anger at me...\nLotta:\nWhy in tarnations wasn't I invited to that!? How come someone on the bottom of the popularity chart like you got the info, but not me!? Info like that is worth nothin' to ya, am I right or what!?\nPhoenix:\n(...Is that the kind of person she thinks I am...?)\nPearl:\nAre you going to stand there and take that, Mr. Nick!?\nLotta's Camera\nLotta:\nNngh... And I just bought that camera... Who did it!? The thievin' rascal!\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't look straight at me while you're saying that...\nLotta:\nWhen I find the bugger who went and done this, they're gonna pay with a bullet!\nPhoenix:\n(And if you do that, don't expect me to defend you...)\nMaya Fey profile\nLotta:\nNow that I think about it, she isn't with y'all today, is she...?\nPearl:\nUm...\nLotta:\nShe's a spunky one! You shouldn't have been lettin' her outta yer sight. Who knows what she's up to now...\nPhoenix:\n(Like you're one to talk...)\nPearl:\n...\nPearl Fey profile\nLotta:\nAh, just wanna say sorry to ya.\nPearl:\nFor...?\nLotta:\nWell, I really, absolutely thought you were the murderer.\nPearl:\n...Huh?\nLotta:\nYou know... Last time, that thing with Maya Fey...\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!? But why!?\nLotta:\nI mean, you were all worked up, ya know?\nPearl:\n*sniffle* ...Meanie...\nPhoenix:\nLotta, that was very insensitive of you!\nLotta Hart profile\nLotta:\nThis kind of hairstyle is pretty hard to get, ya know. Hard to care for too. Just the other day, I ran my hand through my hair to fix it up, and suddenly, out pops this dollar coin! That's gotta be like hittin' the jackpot!\nPearl:\nWow, that's really lucky!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* What a deep conversation that was...)\nJuan Corrida or Matt Engarde profile\nLotta:\nI don't really care for 'em \"heroes\" or whatnot.\nPearl:\nOh, I see...\nLotta:\nAnd shows they got for kids, those adventures are just plain ol' borin'! Now, adults. We get more caught up in messy, sticky, real situations! ...Even me...\nPearl:\nO-Oh...\nLotta:\nSounds like the tyke's gettin' what I'm goin' with this!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a sec here! Don't go around getting her mixed up in things like that!\nSecurity Lady profile\nLotta:\nThis old granny? Ah, she kept on glarin' at me with those eyes of hers. As if it's my fault. Kept babblin' how she won't forgive people who write \"trash\" about her Juan... ...Ah, yeah, we sorta got into a little fight, ya know...\nPhoenix:\n(A \"little\" fight? Knowing those two, it was probably more of a blabbering contest.)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you know anything...\nLotta:\n...*sigh*... I've told ya how many times now? I'm a journalist. I've got so much info runnin' laps in my head I forget things here and there!\nPearl:\nPlease don't get so worked up over this...\nLotta:\nHah! I don't care if ya beg me! \"Be extra tough on kids!\" That's this gal's motto on learnin' youngsters.\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelEngarde's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nUm... Where are we?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Matt Engarde's dressing room... This is our client's room.\n???:\nMay I help you with something?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... We're...\n???:\nYou're Mr. Engarde's lawyer, correct? I gathered as much. I also looked for lawyers on my end, but to no avail.\nPhoenix:\nUm... How did you know I'm his lawyer...?\n???:\nYou were just saying that he is your client. In a situation like this, the only person who would use such a word would be his lawyer.\nPearl:\nWow...\n???:\nIt's simple deduction, really. The trial is tomorrow, and Mr. Engarde's situation is looking rather grim. So you came here, one stop in your mad dash, to find clues to build his case, correct?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're not totally right, but you're not totally off either.\nPearl:\nIt's really not the time to be showing off, Mr. Nick.\nAndrews:\nI am Adrian Andrews. I hate to waste time, so let's get down to business.\nPhoenix:\nA-Alright... (She may be of small stature, but appearances can be deceiving...)\nExamine\nRed suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's probably Mr. Engarde's suitcase. For someone who was only going to be here for the award show, this is a lot of stuff. Looks like he has about three days' worth of clothes in here.\nPearl:\nStars really are different from us, aren't they...?\nBedroom\nPhoenix:\nThat's the bedroom over there.\nPearl:\nThat's a bed...? Wow, they have really big beds here!\nSofa\nPhoenix:\nThere's some samurai-looking clothes on the sofa here.\nPearl:\nUm, I think that jacket looking thing is called a \"happi\".\nPhoenix:\n(Whatever it is, I'm sure something like that would make a great souvenir. Maya would be absolutely thrilled...)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nLooks like dishes left over from dinner... A dinner for two, at that.\nPearl:\nI'm sure they're Mr. Engarde and Ms. Andrews' plates.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they had T-bone steaks... What's with Global Studios and T-bone steaks...?\nPlate on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's a giant bone sitting on the plate.\nPearl:\nI... I don't really like meat...\nPhoenix:\n(...? There's something... weird about this plate... I just wish I could put my finger on what it is...)\nTalk\nNight of the murder\nAndrews:\nI assume the first thing you need to know is what everyone was doing that night, correct?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, that is correct.\nAndrews:\nThen I will tell you. Before the award ceremony, I had dinner with Mr. Engarde. In this very room, I might add.\nPhoenix:\n\"Dinner\"? What did you eat?\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate to waste time with trifling details. If you took a look at the table yourself, you wouldn't need to ask me.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet she's a lot of fun at parties...)\nAndrews:\nWhen the award show was starting, I headed for Viola Hall.\nPhoenix:\nAnd after the show ended, you came back to this room...?\nAndrews:\nNo, I had some small errands to run. I helped with the preparations in the lobby.\nPhoenix:\nOh... (Preparations for the post-ceremony show, I guess...)\nAndrews:\nWhen it was time for the post-ceremony show, I came back to call for Mr. Engarde. After that, I went to visit Mr. Corrida...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you found his body, isn't it?\nAndrews:\n...\nPearl:\nYou really held strong through everything...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... She does seem to be mentally tough as nails...)\nRelation to Engarde\nPhoenix:\nUm, so... About you and...\nAndrews:\nStop right there. You aren't seriously about to ask how Mr. Engarde and I are related, are you? (Changed from [Don't expect me to believe you have been talking to me without knowing how we relate.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nAndrews:\nI have no idea how he could chose [sic] you as his lawyer. (Changed from [I have no idea why Mr. Engarde chose you as his lawyer.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Why did she have to go and say something like that...?)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Calm down and hang in there. I'll give you a shoulder rub to relieve your stress later, alright?\nAndrews:\nI already gave you my name earlier, but I'll add that I'm Mr. Engarde's manager.\nPhoenix:\nHis manager... Speaking of managers, did the victim, Mr. Corrida have one?\nAndrews:\nNo, he did not.\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't?\nAndrews:\nGlobal Studios has a very different policy from Worldwide Studios in that Worldwide Studios does not assign individual managers to their stars.\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nAndrews:\nThis industry is very ruthless and unforgiving. Actually, you look quite ruthless and unforgiving yourself to your poor partner. Dragging a little girl like her to places like this. Honestly.\nPearl:\nYou're wrong! I... I'm doing this to help Mystic Maya...!\nPhoenix:\nPearls... Calm down and hang in there. I'll buy you a juice later, alright?\nPearl:\nNngh...\nMotive for murder (appears after presenting Juan Corrida profile)\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any ideas?\nAndrews:\nAs to...?\nPhoenix:\nAs to why Mr. Corrida was murdered?\nAndrews:\nWhy would you ask me about such a thing...?\nPhoenix:\nI'm just doing my job. So, do you have any ideas?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nSorry, but there's nothing more I have to add to this conversation.\nPearl:\nIs it a Psyche-Lock, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYes... There's getting to be more and more of these lately.\nMotive for murder (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou know something, don't you? About why Mr. Corrida was murdered...\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nAndrews:\nWhy are you asking me? Don't tell me you can see inside my heart.\nPhoenix:\n(No, but I can see the locks you have on your psyche.)\nPearl:\nIf you don't remove her locks...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, it's worthless to even ask...)\nPresent\nPress Conference Ticket\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one taking care of the arrangements for this press conference, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, that's right.\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Engarde said he \"didn't know\" about it.\nAndrews:\n... Is that what he said...?\nPearl:\nHuh...?\nAndrews:\nActually, I didn't know all the details either. It was a request from the publicity department. All I did was help out and do what I was asked.\nPearl:\nOh... I see.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder about that... I wouldn't take her to be the type of person to do something without knowing the details.)\nWill Powers profile\nAndrews:\nThat's Mr. Will Powers. He's an actor contracted with Global Studios. He's a very nice man. A man with a good heart. ...But that's all he is and ever will be.\nPhoenix:\n(Urk... What a horrible thing to say...)\nAndrews:\n...Society doesn't care about genuinely nice people, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? For a second, her face twisted in pain...)\nPearl:\nI wonder if something happened to Ms. Andrews...\nJuan Corrida profile\nPhoenix:\nDid you know the victim, Mr. Corrida?\nAndrews:\nYes, I knew him. The world is such a small place, after all.\nPearl:\nDid you know about his rivalry with the Nickel Samurai?\nAndrews:\nHonestly, they were like children when it came to that. Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most trivial things. (Changed from [Time and time again, those two competed with each other over the most uninteresting things.] in the original release) ... If either one of them wasn't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die. (Changed from [If either one of them weren't so stubborn, then maybe no one would have needed to die.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n! (...I've got a hunch that this woman knows more than she's letting on... She must know why Juan Corrida was killed!)\nMatt Engarde profile\nAndrews:\nI asked to become Mr. Engarde's manager. He's a pleasure to manage with his nice disposition.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Mr. Engarde does seem like a rather weak-willed man; always doing as he's told...)\nPearl:\nHe's always saying, \"my manager,\" right Mr. Nick?\nAndrews:\n...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAndrews:\nI hate talking about myself. It's a trifling matter, that's why.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... (Take away that layer of sarcasm and she really does seem to hate herself...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, I'd like to ask you about this...\nAndrews:\nI told you. I hate trifling matters. It's a waste of time to show me things that are of no relevance to me.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... This is the first time I've been shut down this badly...)\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelCorrida's Hotel Room\nPearl:\nMr. Nick... Where are we...?\nPhoenix:\nWe're in Mr. Juan Corrida's room, Pearls.\nPearl:\nMr. Corrida...?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim... Which makes this the crime scene, too.\nGumshoe:\nOh! It's you! So!? What's happened!? The kidnapper! Has he contacted you again!?\nPhoenix:\nNot yet. He probably won't until we win Mr. Engarde's acquittal.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... You doing OK, pal? Hanging in there?\nPhoenix:\n(I just want Maya to be alright...)\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nWe don't have a lot of time left, but I'm going to help you as much as I can, pal.\nPhoenix:\nCan you do that? Even if we want to look around the crime scene...?\nGumshoe:\nJust this once... \"Special circumstances\" right, pal? I'll even tell you everything I know. But you've gotta keep quiet. It's my neck on the line here.\nPhoenix:\nThank you.\nGumshoe:\nOh, that's right. I got you guys a map of the hotel, pal. Here you go, little missy.\nPearl:\nWow, you're giving it to me!? Thank you!\nGumshoe:\nHa ha. Wouldn't want you to get lost in a hotel too big for its own good.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I got a map!\nPhoenix:\nThat's great, Pearls!\nPearl:\n... Um... But Mr. Nick, I can't read what it says...\nHotel Guidemap added to the Court Record.\nExamine\nRefrigerator\nPhoenix:\nThere are all sorts of things in this refrigerator...\nPearl:\nThe carrot juice bottle and the tomato juice bottle are both empty...\nPhoenix:\nEmpty...? (It's too much of a hassle to throw them away, I guess.) They're all vegetable juices. I guess he must've been a real health nut.\nPearl:\n...Oh! There's a beet, some ketchup, and a bottle of strawberry jam too!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe red was his favorite color...?\nStuffed bears\nPearl:\nWow, there are a lot of bears!\nPhoenix:\n(Alarm clock ones, collector's editions, stuffed teddies, plastic models... It's pretty overwhelming... Is there a kind of bear he doesn't have...?)\nPearl:\nThere's even a few in the trash can...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I get the feeling maybe the guy didn't really like bears.\nPearl:\nPoor teddies...\nIt's hard to \"bear\" with all these problems... Growl! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!\nPhoenix:\n... (I don't think I want to \"bear\" with the trauma the last case caused me...)\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mr. Nick?\nDesk\nPearl:\nHmph! It's so messy here!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls really likes things neat and tidy, I take it...)\nPearl:\nThere are a lot of electronic things in here that I've never seen before. Hey, Mr. Nick! Tell me what they are, pretty please?\nPhoenix:\nOK. That over there is a \"watch\". You wear it on your wrist.\nPearl:\n... I know what a watch is...\nPhoenix:\n(Oops. For a second there, I forgot I was talking with Pearls, not Maya...)\nBlue suitcase\nPhoenix:\nIt's a suitcase. There are so many things in it that I bet it barely closes. There's his clothes, a dryer, an electric shaver, a calculator...\nPearl:\nDo all stars pack too much stuff like Mr. Corrida?\nTable on right\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Mr. Corrida had dinner last night.\nPearl:\nThis bottle... It's tomato juice.\nPhoenix:\n(We had a lot of food at the award show last night... But I wonder if the stars had gone onstage after only eating a meager meal like this...)\nBedroom\nPearl:\nSo that's a bed, right?\nPhoenix:\nYup. It's big, but it's a bed.\nPearl:\nAaah! Mr. Nick! It's sooooo soft!\nPhoenix:\n(Big beds must be a rarity for her...)\nScattered items near guitar case\nPhoenix:\nBottles of cosmetics are scattered all over the floor. This is probably where Mr. Corrida fought his assailant.\nPearl:\nWhat's this glass fragment from...?\nPhoenix:\nA flower vase maybe? There are flowers on the floor, but I don't know what they are.\nPearl:\nYou don't know much about flowers, do you Mr. Nick?\nGuitar case\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess. A little beat up, but still useable.\nPearl:\nThat's strange. The guitar is not here...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he forgot to bring it to the show?\nPearl:\nBut Mystic Maya... She said the bright red guitar was the Jammin' Ninja's signature item...\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Huh? This guitar case is wet. But it's only wet on the top of the lid...\nPearl:\nYeah... There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nGuitar Case added to the Court Record.\nGuitar case (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis is... a guitar case, I guess.

There's no water inside the case... This is water, isn't it...?\nWine glass\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww. Tomato juice. I don't really like it much.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bottle of it on the table over there. That's probably where this came from.\nPearl:\nBut doesn't it seem weird?\nPhoenix:\n...What seems weird?\nPearl:\nI mean, everything else is scattered all over the floor.\nPhoenix:\n... (She's right. The flower vase was broken and the make-up is strewn everywhere.)\nPearl:\nWhy is this glass the only thing that's still alright...?\nWine Glass added to the Court Record.\nWine glass (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful wine glass, and there's... tomato juice in it.\nPearl:\nEwww.

(Changed from [one look at the scene of the crime should tell you, pal.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIt should...? (Changed from [The scene of the crime...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Here's a picture.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a knife in his chest.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal, that's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was stabbed to death...)\nGumshoe:\nThey're looking at the fingerprints down at the lab right now.\nPhoenix:\nThere were fingerprints on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nYup. And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nCause of death (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nDo you know what was the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nWell, technically, the final autopsy report isn't out yet, but... one look at the victim should tell you, pal.

And it looks like they're pretty sure they're Mr. Engarde's prints, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(That's bad... Real bad...)\nReason for arrest\nPhoenix:\nWhy was Mr. Engarde arrested?\nGumshoe:\nBecause we had evidence on him.\nPearl:\nEvidence...?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the victim, Juan Corrida, really put up a big fight.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, one look at the crime scene and you can tell. There's signs of a struggle everywhere.\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah. During the fight, his button came off...\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Engarde said something about a button... Something like, one of the Jammin' Ninja's buttons got caught in his \"hakama\"...)\nGumshoe:\nBut that's not all...\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nThere was a witness, pal.\nPhoenix:\nA witness!? Wh-Who is it!?\nGumshoe:\nThat lady... Ms. Oldbag.\nPhoenix:\n(Please... Anyone but her!)\nGumshoe:\nThe prosecution has plenty of evidence to make a solid case... Not to mention there's something around where the vic was that's a little off. (Changed from [Not to mention there's something at the crime scene that was a little off.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nSomething that's a little off...? As in...? (Changed from [Something that was a little off...? As in...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nAs in, that's for you to figure out, pal!\nPearl:\nAlright, let's try to figure it out, Mr. Nick!\nPresent\nRadio Transceiver\nGumshoe:\nThat's your \"present\" from the kidnapper, huh? While you're talking, it sends and receives radio waves... If we could trace that...\nPearl:\nYeah! We could use it to find out where the bad guy is!\nPhoenix:\n(It uses radio waves, huh?)\nGumshoe:\nI got it! I'll go find a radio scanner, and let you borrow it, pal!\nGuitar Case\nPhoenix:\nWhat can you tell me about this guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nOh, that. This is just what I heard, pal, but that's the Jammin' Ninja's signature item.\nPhoenix:\nThe guitar case?\nGumshoe:\nNo, not that! What do you take me as? I mean the guitar inside, of course!\nPearl:\nBut... The guitar is missing.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, we looked for it too. It's not normal for a person to forget to bring their most famous item to an award show.\nPhoenix:\n(It's starting to sound like that red guitar is related to this case after all...)\nWine Glass\nPhoenix:\nSo about this wine glass...\nGumshoe:\nAh, so you noticed it, pal. The whole crime scene was a mess, but this glass was the only thing that was untouched.\nPhoenix:\nYou noticed that too, Detective Gumshoe...?\nGumshoe:\nNo, actually Ms. von Karma noticed it first.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Pearls noticed it before me too... Hey, wait a minute. So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's here at the hotel...? (Changed from [So... does that mean Ms. von Karma's coming here...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nYeah, she's around. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal. (Changed from [Yeah, she's coming. Man, you're going to be in so much trouble, pal.] in the original release) Especially if she catches you in here. (Changed from [I think it'd be best if you didn't bump into her here.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou can bet the instant I see her, I'll be running the 1,000 meter dash.\nCrime Photo\nGumshoe:\nYou look at this photo and you can't help it. It makes you want to say, \"I can't believe this is the scene of a murder.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Stabbed with a knife after a struggle... A clue is sleeping in this photo somewhere... I know it.)\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm sorry.\nPhoenix:\n...For what?\nGumshoe:\nI really want to help you look for her, pal.\nPearl:\nMr. Detective...\nGumshoe:\nIf anything happens, let me know, OK? I want to help in any way I can!\nPearl Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, little missy. Listen good, OK?\nPearl:\nOK. What is it?\nGumshoe:\nDon't ever pick up a whip, OK? Don't even think about it.\nPearl:\nHuh!?\nGumshoe:\nIf you ever find yourself thinking you want one, try to make due with a good slap to the face. Got that? Slap the person in the face. Promise me, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(Personal experience tells me Gumshoe should be careful what he wishes for...)\nLotta Hart profile\nGumshoe:\nIf I had a choice, she would be number three on my list of people I don't want to see.\nPhoenix:\n...Because I'm in the number one spot?\nGumshoe:\nDon't get all high and mighty on me here. You've taken a tumble into second place, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really? Then who's in first...?\nGumshoe:\nMs. von Karma's miles and miles ahead of you in this race.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh...\nGumshoe:\nShe's really scary... Right now... M-Ms. von Karma... You really don't...\nPhoenix:\n(He's so scared of her that he's whispering now...)\nMatt Engarde profile\nGumshoe:\nHey, why don't we let bygones be bygones, pal? Look, this guy is guilty. A buck says so.\nPhoenix:\nOne dollar...? Sure you're not talking about Pearls' allowance money?\nGumshoe:\nI... I can't bet any more than that... My salary... It's...\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't matter what we think... I still have to defend Mr. Engarde in court or else!)\nPearl:\nMr. Nick...\nSecurity Lady profile\nGumshoe:\nI thought she was an alien from outer space.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, probably because she's wearing that strange helmet.\nGumshoe:\nNah, even with her helmet off, I thought she was an alien, pal.\nPhoenix:\n... I think that's probably best kept to yourself, if you know what I mean...\nAdrian Andrews profile\nGumshoe:\nShe's Mr. Engarde's manager, right? No matter what I do, I really stink at talking with people like her. As soon as I open my mouth, I get all flustered. See, she's one of those women with a brain. She's someone who \"gets things done\".\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she does give that sort of impression, like she's got it all together.\nGumshoe:\nCompared to her, you can easily tell I'm a \"can't do anything right\" kind of guy. That's why I get all nervous and start messing up.\nPhoenix:\n(I feel sort of bad for him...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you know about this?\nGumshoe:\nUm... There's nothing special I can tell you about this, pal. Look pal, we don't have a lot of time. Why don't you show me something more important? If Ms. von Karma saw me here like this... I'd have to switch sides real fast...\nAfter clearing all Talk options, examining guitar case, and presenting Wine Glass:\n...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*...\nPearl:\nWh-What's that beeping noise, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I've heard this sound somewhere before...)\nGumshoe:\nIt's Ms. von Karma...\nPearl:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nFor some reason, whenever I hear that sound, she pops out of nowhere and whips me! (Changed from [Whenever I hear that sound, for some reason, she pops out of nowhere and whips me!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, that's exactly what happen [sic] the last time...) (Changed from [Come to think of it, that did happen the last time...] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nS-Sorry! I've gotta make myself scarce! Later, pal! Eowww!\nvon Karma:\nAt last, you reveal your true nature... Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(*gulp* Would it be too much to ask for you to be nice to me for a change...?)\nvon Karma:\nSo you're the type to steal information from pitifully hopeless detectives! That's very dishonorable of you!\nPhoenix:\n(Owww!)\nvon Karma:\nHey! Don't you dare run away, Scruffy McTrenchcoat!\nGumshoe:\nAh!\nvon Karma:\nI didn't think the detectives of this country could be this pitiful...\nGumshoe:\nUwaah!\nvon Karma:\nDetective! Come over here for a second!\nGumshoe:\nYeooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!\nvon Karma:\n...Hmph. I feel better knowing at least you were man enough to face your punishment.\nPhoenix:\n(He was so scared, he just froze up on the spot...)\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright! You... You have soiled my perfect prosecution record. I'll never forget that. This time... Victory is mine!\nPhoenix:\n... Victory is yours? Is that all this means to you...?\nvon Karma:\nWh-What...!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nvon Karma:\n... H-Hmph! Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin. (Changed from [Come, Scruff-face! The investigation briefing is about to begin.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!\nvon Karma:\nThis isn't over yet... I swear on my family's honor!\nPhoenix:\n(Ow! What did she throw at me NOW...!? (Changed from [Ow! Now what did she throw at me...!?] in the original release) What is this...?)\nGumshoe:\n...Well, I guess this means I've gotta get back to the precinct now, pal. If you ever need me, come down to the Criminal Affairs Department, alright? And if you can, try not to let Ms. von Karma see you...\nExamine\nPaper on desk\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, what's this piece of paper...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's called an \"autograph\".\nPearl:\nAuto-graff?\nPhoenix:\nIt's got Mr. Corrida's name written on it, so it's his autograph.\nPearl:\nI can't read it at all. To be honest, I've never seen writing that looks like this.\nPhoenix:\nAh, it's a special way of writing called \"cursive\". Look here. See how it says, \"To my dearest Wendy\" in more normal letters here?\nPearl:\nTh-This sloppy, unreadable writing! It's crazy and cruel to give this to someone!\nPhoenix:\n(Hold on...)\nPearl:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nWendy... I've heard that name somewhere before...\nMr. Corrida's Autograph added to the Court Record.\nAfter visiting Enguarde's Hotel Room:\nMarch 21Gatewater HotelViola Hall\nPowers:\nOh, Mr. Wright! How are you?\nPhoenix:\nAh, Mr. Powers. Have you been here the entire time?\nPowers:\nYeah. People connected to the murder aren't allowed to go home, let alone leave...\nTalk\nThe Nickel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me a little more about the Nickel Samurai TV show?\nPowers:\nOK. \"The Nickel Samurai\" is an action hero program aimed towards kids. It's the sequel to \"The Steel Samurai\".\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nPowers:\nThis time, there are three Samurai Brothers: Aluminum Samurai, Tin Samurai... And of course, the Nickel Samurai. It's a love \"Y\" in Neo Olde Tokyo!\nPhoenix:\nI see... ... W-Wait... A love what...?\nPowers:\nA love \"Y\". This girl, Sayo, works at a tea shop and all three guys fall for her at the same time.\nPhoenix:\nOh... I guess the \"Y\" shape is like the 3 brothers colliding over this one girl?\nPowers:\nAnyway, Sayo is actually the daughter of the evil Strawberry Clan's leader!\nPhoenix:\nSounds like an unusual situation. Like Romeo and Juliet... times three.\nPowers:\nY-Yeah... Strange thing is, this sort of forbidden love story is really big with the office ladies.\nPearl:\nUm...\nPowers:\nYes, Pearl?\nPearl:\nWh-What happens next!? I want to know! Ms. Sayo... Does Ms. Sayo fall in love? She does, doesn't she?\nPowers:\nEvery Sunday at 8 AM.\nPearl:\nI'm going to stop watching \"Kids' Masterpiece Theatre\" starting this week!\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe she's really considering it!)\nJammin' Ninja\nPhoenix:\nSo what's the \"Jammin' Ninja\" TV show like?\nPowers:\nIt started from a remake of an old movie, to tell you the truth. The Jammin' Ninja is, like the Samurai shows, aimed towards kids. It's the story of a ninja who can't climb a wall, but became a big pop star.\nPhoenix:\n...Uh, what?\nPowers:\nHe was a really lousy ninja. Absolutely couldn't do any ninja things right at all. But boy could he sing! With his trusty bright red guitar in hand, he took the ancient world by storm.\nPhoenix:\nA... A ninja... With a bright red guitar...!?\nPowers:\nAnd then, the final fight in front of his beloved Princess Misola! \"Jammin' versus the Muromachi Five!\" Suddenly! Our brave hero catches a not so Jammin' cold the night before Battle 3!\nPhoenix:\nAww, that's too bad for him...\nPowers:\nY-Yeah... But this kind of pop music-based love story is something high school girls really like.\nPearl:\nUm...\nPowers:\nYes, Pearl?\nPearl:\nWh-What happens next!? I want to know!\nPearl:\nJammin'... The Jammin' Ninja! Will he be able to sing!? What about Princess Misola!?\nPowers:\nEvery Sunday at 8 AM.\nPearl:\nUmm... Which show should I watch...? Hmm...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe she's really  considering it!)\nThe gossip on Adrian (appears after presenting Adrian Andrews profile)\nPhoenix:\nWould you mind telling me about this \"gossip\"?\nPowers:\nAh, so you ARE interested in it! I figured you would be! (Changed from [Ah, so you're interested in it too!

And I didn't suspect a thing because he looked like such a normal old man...\nPhoenix:\n(Old man, huh...)\nGuitar Case\nPowers:\nThat guitar case... That was Juan's...\nPhoenix:\nI'm guessing you've seen this case before?\nPowers:\nIt's pretty famous by now. It stands out because it holds THE bright red guitar.\nPhoenix:\n(The bright red guitar... The Jammin' Ninja's signature item.)\nPearl:\nBut if the guitar is so important, how could he forget it for the award ceremony?\nPhoenix:\n(That does seem a little strange...)\nMaya Fey profile\nPowers:\nI...

In any case, this means that the defendant had a motive to kill.\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I keep doing this to myself...?)Andrews:\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nB-But didn't you already testify earlier that Mr. Engarde was... \"Taking a nap in his room\"!? Are you telling me now that, that too, was a lie so you could cover for Mr. Engarde!?\nAndrews:\nI'm not telling you anything of the sort. When I went to get him for the show, he honestly was sleeping. However, as to whether he was sleeping the entire time, that I cannot say. I was too busy setting up the stage at the time.\nJudge:\nHmm... I keep trying, but I can find no flaws with what Ms. Andrews has said. I can't say the same for some people here in this courtroom, however.\nPhoenix:\n(The judge is glaring straight at Mia...)\nMia:\nHe's glaring at you, smart guy!Andrews:\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou can hardly call the knife \"decisive evidence\"! The fingerprints on the knife could very well be a clever camouflage!\nAndrews:\nThen... What about the button?\nPhoenix:\nThe button...?\nAndrews:\nIt's clear from the crime scene that the victim and the murderer fought. And during the fight, the killer ripped the button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nJudge:\nYou're talking about this button, correct?\nAndrews:\nThat button was found in the pleats of Matt's hakama, isn't that correct? I would think that makes it very decisive evidence.\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nJudge:\nLooks like you were out-foxed again, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nA-Anyway! The knife doesn't prove a thing! Please fix your testimony!\nAndrews:\nI can't stand the sight of a man who can't gracefully accept his defeat.\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(... Thank goodness Mia can still look at me...)\nMia:\nWith an icy stare, yes.\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews, for Mr. Wright's sake, please add this information to your testimony.\nChanges statement from \"My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\" to \"That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\"Andrews:\nThat button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd how do you know that?\nAndrews:\nWhen the ends of the threads on the button and the costume were matched up, they were found to fit together perfectly... Or so I heard.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I've heard that before too. But why would Ms. Andrews know about this case down to such a fine detail?)\nAndrews:\nDon't look at me like that! Just because I'm prepared and you are not!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... And I thought I had her this time for sure. If there's anything to trip her up on, it has to be here. ...But where and what?)Present Juan's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is the victim's autopsy report.\"Andrews:\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut what you really did was stab the guy in the back, didn't you? And at the worst possible time.\nAndrews:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nWho's to say she really \"stabbed the guy in the back\" as you put it?\nPhoenix:\nThis witness could have disclosed things about Mr. Engarde at any time. Why, then, would she wait until there was a large audience before doing so? It's the same reason why Mr. Corrida planned such an elaborate conference. Ms. Andrews wanted to cause Mr. Engarde as much damage as she possibly could! This witness bears ill-will towards the defendant!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis isn't the \"Phoenix Wright Wax Philosophical Power Hour\". And please, stop slandering the witness.\nAndrews:\n...Phoenix:\nAs I expected, Ms. Andrews' testimony seems pretty solid.Mia:\nReally? Because to me, it sounded a little wishy-washy.Phoenix:\nWishy-washy? (Well, I guess we'll see if I press a little more...)Mia:\nYou should know this by now, but you'll need strong, decisive evidence to make her talk.Phoenix:\nGot it, Chief! (...I'm going to pin you down this time, Ms. Andrews!)Phoenix:\nThis is the victim's autopsy report. It clearly states that the cause of death was \"strangulation by a scarf\".Andrews:\nS...Strangulation...Phoenix:\nThe knife stab to the victim was done after the victim had already died.Judge:\nA-And what does that mean?Phoenix:\nLet's examine the evidence. This button has the victim's blood on it. Which would mean that it was ripped off of the costume... when?Edgeworth:\nAfter the knife was stabbed into the victim...Phoenix:\nExactly! Which means... It is impossible that this button was torn off during the victim's final struggle, because the victim was strangled to death in that fight!Andrews:\nAh...Phoenix:\nThat's right, Ms. Andrews. There is no way this button was ripped off during the struggle. This button was consciously pulled off of the victim's already dead body!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Wh-What is the meaning--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWhat is the meaning of this, Wright!? So what if the button was torn off the body after the victim had already died? What does that change!?Phoenix:\nLet me ask you one simple question, Mr. Edgeworth. Why was the button torn off? What purpose did that serve?Edgeworth:\nWhat \"purpose\"...?Phoenix:\nWe now know this button was not torn off during the fight. So the murderer took the time and effort to purposely rip this from the victim's body. That would mean that the murderer had something in mind, wouldn't it?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nMr. Wright! Does this mean... Does this mean you know what the murderer wanted to do with this button!? What was it!?To have a memento of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaybe this was the criminal's first crime and since it went so well, the person wanted something as a memento...\nEdgeworth:\nWright... I'll give this button to you as a memento.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nA reminder to never set foot in another court of law again for as long as you live!\nJudge:\nYes... I think it would be for the best if you stayed away from the attorney's bench.\nPhoenix:\nW-W-Wait! Please, Your Honor! I... I'll get it right this time! I'm sure of it!\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\"To pin the crime on Engarde\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is only one logical reason for doing something like that.\"To destroy evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was to destroy the evidence, of course!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... To destroy the evidence...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, we heard you the first time! And which blasted piece of evidence was the person trying to destroy, Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! If you continue like this, I'm afraid you'll only destroy yourself!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\"Phoenix:\nThere is only one logical reason for doing something like that. It was to pin the crime on Mr. Engarde!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nThere is no way anyone would put a bloodied button in their own pants! That's right! Mr. Engarde was set up! By the real killer, of course!Judge:\nAnd... The real murder is...? Well, Mr. Wright!? Who in the world is the real killer then!?Phoenix:\n(Finally... I can't believe I managed to bring this trial all the way up to this point...)Mia:\nPhoenix... You can't let your guard down yet! Not until the very end!Phoenix:\nThe real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...Present Adrian Andrews profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Adrian Andrews!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWright. Which of these four doesn't belong here? Up, down, left, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nUm, \"Wright\"?\nEdgeworth:\nThank you, I feel much better. I'm relieved to know you can at least pick that much out. I worry about you. You seem to fail every time you try to make logical sense!\nMia:\nOr in other words, \"think before you speak\", Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\n(Is it just me or is everyone ganging up on me?)\nJudge:\nThat's enough dawdling now, Mr. Wright. We don't have all day.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"The real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...\"Phoenix:\nMs. Adrian Andrews! I choose you! You are Mr. Corrida's killer!Andrews:\nWh-What!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!! Mr. Wright! This is a very grave matter! Do you have any evidence that supports your charge...?Phoenix:\n\"Any evidence\"...? ALL of the evidence points to Ms. Andrews!Andrews:\nWh... How preposterous! You can't stick any of that on me!Phoenix:\nI can't, can I? Would you care to test me?Andrews:\nThen... Then what about this knife!?Phoenix:\nThe knife was used to stab the victim after he had already been strangled to death. It was used to throw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, naturally. A knife covered in the defendant's fingerprints could only be taken from his room. And the only one who had dinner with him, and knew which knife to take, was you.Andrews:\n...Tsk! Th-Then! What... What about the button that was found in Matt's hakama!?Phoenix:\nThis button was removed from the victim's body after he had already died. The only people who could've done so were the person who found his body or the killer. However, if Mr. Engarde was the real killer, there is no way he would have put such incriminating evidence in his own hakama!Andrews:\nUghn...Phoenix:\nThe only person who could have put this button into Mr. Engarde's hakama, is the person who went to wake him from his nap... which is you, yet again, Ms. Andrews.Judge:\nI... I see... What about the empty guitar case...?Phoenix:\nThat is also another piece of evidence that incriminates Ms. Andrews. That costume was used to hide the real killer's identity as they fled the crime scene. Now, who could have known that there was just such a costume inside the guitar case...? It could only have been the person who prepared the costume for the victim. And that person is... you, Ms. Adrian Andrews!Andrews:\nN...No... I...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nBut Ms. Andrews' fingerprints were nowhere to be found on the guitar case! And it was you who proved that she was not wearing gloves at the time!Judge:\n...! Th-That's right!Phoenix:\nThat's because she did not intend on leaving any prints. If anyone had found out that she had touched the case, they would have asked her why. So to avoid leaving any prints, she used a towel or something else to open it. But! The glass of tomato juice is a different story! Ms. Andrews purposefully left her fingerprints on the glass to show that yes, indeed, she was the classic \"dazed discoverer\" of a dead body!Andrews:\nAaaaaah!Phoenix:\nAnd to top it all off, there is this photo! A photo of the killer as they exited the scene of the crime. No reasonable person on Earth can believe this Nickel Samurai is Mr. Engarde! He would be much too short for his own costume if it was him.Andrews:\n...!Phoenix:\nSpeaking of how tall people are... Ms. Andrews, you're also kind of short in stature, are you not?Andrews:\nP-Please... Stop...Phoenix:\nWell, how about it, Ms. Andrews!?Andrews:\nUm...Phoenix:\n(I've got her this time!)Andrews:\n...Judge:\nMs. Andrews...?Andrews:\n... I... I... I refuse... to testify.Phoenix:\nWhat was that...?Andrews:\nTh-There's a law... It says I can't be forced to testify about something... if it can incriminate me!Judge:\nWell, yes... You are absolutely correct, Ms. Andrews. The law does provide us with a way to avoid self-incrimination... by allowing a witness to not testify if the testimony can cause damage to themselves.Phoenix:\nWHAT!? (\"Pleading the fifth\" is not something most people would think to do on the spot! Actually... Thinking back to yesterday in Mr. Engarde's room...)von Karma:\nAdrian Andrews!Andrews:\nY-Yes...?von Karma:\nThink hard about what we just discussed. Understood!?Andrews:\nA-Alright... ...Phoenix:\n(That's it. That's when Franziska planted this idea into her head... She must have told Ms. Andrews to not testify if things looked bad.)Mia:\nYou did a good job proving everything up to this point, Phoenix. But there is still one thing you haven't done.Phoenix:\nSomething I haven't done...?Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh. What's wrong, Wright? Are you finished already? Run out of evidence?Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nWhat is so humorous, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nI'm sure you realize this as well, Your Honor... But, everything the good lawyer here has proven up to this point is meaningless.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Edgeworth:\nEverything you have proven is circumstantial.Phoenix:\nCircumstantial...?Edgeworth:\nYes, circumstantial. You have yet to provide a single piece of definitive proof. Proof that Ms. Andrews, did in fact, harbor a wish to murder Mr. Corrida!Judge:\nM-Ms. Andrews! You... Did you want to kill Mr. Corrida...?Andrews:\nI believe this may lead to me incriminating myself, so I will abstain from answering.Judge:\nBut Ms. Andrews... If you do that, it would be the same as admitting your guilt, don't you think...?Andrews:\nMaybe so, or maybe not. There is nothing to prove it either way. Besides, you don't even know what crime I would be \"guilty\" of due to my silence.Phoenix:\n(NO!! She's taking that defiant attitude again!) M-Mia! What should we do...?Mia:\nSomehow, we've landed in the worst possible situation.Judge:\nI think we have reached a certain conclusion at this point in time. Ms. Adrian Andrews has refused to testify. And the defense's theory that she is the actual murderer... has not been fully substantiated with solid, definitive proof.Phoenix:\nBut! That's not true!Judge:\nIn this situation, there is only one thing this court can do. And that is to declare a recess.Phoenix:\nR-Recess...!?Judge:\nI request that both the prosecution and the defense look further into this matter. And at tomorrow's trial...Phoenix:\n(T-Tomorrow...!? We don't have a \"tomorrow\"! If we don't get a not guilty verdict today, then...)Phoenix:Phoenix:\nPlease wait, Your Honor! Th...That's not necessary! The trial... Please continue the trial!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you sweating for...? Your client is getting one more day to live, isn't he?Phoenix:\nThat... That's not it! This isn't about that. Edgeworth! I know you know who the real killer is! Please... Let the trial continue! If I don't get the verdict... then Maya...Edgeworth:\n...?Judge:\nBut it's impossible to continue as long as the witness refuses to testify. Now then, this court is...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nIt is not impossible for this trial to continue.Andrews:\n...!Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you...Edgeworth:\nIt's true Ms. Andrews holds the right against self-incrimination; however, if the topic of conversation were something unrelated to whatever she may be guilty of, then she has no right to withhold testimony!Judge:\nY-Yes, that is very true, but...Edgeworth:\nActually, there is one little thing that I'm curious about. Ms. Andrews.Andrews:\n...Edgeworth:\nWhen you found the victim's dead body, you poured yourself a glass of juice.Andrews:\nY-Yes... And...?Edgeworth:\nI can't help but think how unnatural that is. Usually when one finds a body, they are shaken up, not stirring a glass of juice.Andrews:\nSo my actions were \"unusual\"? But I've already...Edgeworth:\nBefore you speak, I want to state that if you have a reason behind your actions, I would like you to testify to that effect.Andrews:\nTestify...!?Edgeworth:\nYour Honor! I would like to request that the witness testify again as to what happened when she first discovered the victim's body! Whatever we find out in this testimony should in no way implicate the witness.Judge:\nHmm...Mia:\nI don't know what it is about Edgeworth today, but I can't get a good read off of him. Is he friend or foe? I just don't know...Judge:\nThe court acknowledges the prosecution's request. Ms. Andrews, if you please.Witness Testimony-- When I Found the Body --Andrews:\nThat glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.\nI was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.\nAnd Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.\nWhen I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.\nTo be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.\nWhen I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.Judge:\nHmm... So you poured that glass of juice for the victim. Why didn't you say so in your earlier testimony?Andrews:\n...I didn't think I needed to include something so trivial.Mia:\nPhoenix. Please be careful here. If you can't find anything wrong with this testimony, then there's nothing left...Phoenix:\nI know. (Edgeworth... What the heck is going on in that brain of yours...?)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- When I Found the Body --Andrews:\nThat glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut... There wasn't anyone else in the room, right?\nAndrews:\nOf course not.\nPhoenix:\nThen... who did you pour it for?\nAndrews:\nMr. Wright. There is a rhyme and reason for everything. Can you wait just a little longer for it to be revealed to you?\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, Wright, \"Be quiet and listen.\"\nAndrews:\nPrecisely! I couldn't have said it better myself.\nPhoenix:\nUnnngh...Andrews:\nI was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, it was a \"mess\"? Are you sure it wasn't messy because of your fight with Mr. Corrida...?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI understand your frustrations at not being able to prove your theory. However... Before you go accusing people of crimes, go find yourself some evidence!\nPhoenix:\n(Grr...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnd then, what did you see next, witness?Andrews:\nAnd Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSlumped over?\nAndrews:\nYes, he was just sitting there with his head tilted forward, eyes closed. He really looked like he was sleeping.\nPhoenix:\n(...Is it just me or did that right there sound a little... odd?)Andrews:\nWhen I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThen what did cross your mind?\nAndrews:\nI thought maybe he had smashed everything up in anger because he lost the Grand Prix. And then felt tired after his rampage, so he decided to take a nap... Anyways, that's what I thought...\nJudge:\nI see. So you didn't think he was dead at all.Present Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"Andrews:\nTo be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou thought he fainted...?\nAndrews:\nI thought he was asleep at first. But then, the room was in such a messy state... I thought maybe he had gotten into a fight with someone...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that's when you went to pour the glass of juice?\nAndrews:\nYes. He always has a hard time waking up. So Juan always has a glass of tomato juice to drink.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. And after that, what happened next?Present Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"Andrews:\nWhen I realized that he was dead...

So I set the glass down on the dresser and tried to take his pulse. I... I was shocked... and staggered backward...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd knocked the flower vase over. So that's what happened.\nAndrews:\n...Yes.Present Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"Mia:\n...

The answer needs to be in the specified JSON format.\n\nLooking at the testimonies given by Adrian Andrews, particularly testimony 3: \"When I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.\" She claims she didn't realize he was dead at first. \n\nThe Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows Juan Corrida with a knife in his chest. If he was slumped over with a visible knife wound, it's unlikely someone wouldn't immediately notice he was dead. So the photo contradicts her statement that she didn't think he was dead. \n\nTherefore, the evidence Crime Photo (index 9) contradicts testimony 3 (index 3).\n\n{\"evidence\": 9, \"testimony\": 3}",

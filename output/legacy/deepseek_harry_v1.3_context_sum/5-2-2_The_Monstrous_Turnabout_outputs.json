    "response": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, we need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair, so I have to look through each testimony and check the evidences to see where there's a conflict.\n\nFirst, let me list out the testimonies. Testimony 3 says that Mayor Tenma attacked Kyubi, impaling him with a spear. The evidence related to the murder weapon would be key here. The autopsy report (Evidence 14) states cause of death as stabbing with a spear, which matches. But maybe there's another angle.\n\nLooking at Testimony 1, Fulbright claims Mayor Tenma's fingerprints were on the murder weapon. However, in Evidence 9, the crime photo shows neither man wearing gloves. If the murder weapon is the spear, and the mayor's fingerprints were found on it, but the photo shows he wasn't wearing gloves, that might not be a contradiction. Wait, but the actual murder weapon might be a different item. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, Evidence 7 is the Fox and Demon Statue. It says it's the weapon used to bludgeon the mayor, with his blood but no fingerprints. So the statue was used to hit the mayor. The spear was used to kill Kyubi. So the statue is the weapon used against the mayor, while the spear killed Kyubi. \n\nTestimony 3 says Mayor Tenma attacked Kyubi with the spear. But according to Evidence 7, the statue was used to bludgeon the mayor. Wait, the crime photo (Evidence 9) shows Kyubi impaled by a spear, and the mayor with a head wound. Testimony 4 says Kyubi grabbed a statue and struck back. So the statue was used by Kyubi to hit the mayor. Then the mayor's blood would be on the statue, which is what Evidence 7 says. But Testimony 3 says the mayor used the spear on Kyubi. \n\nWait, the contradiction here is in Testimony 1: Fulbright says Mayor Tenma's fingerprints were on the murder weapon (the spear). But Evidence 7 (the statue) has the mayor's blood but no fingerprints. If the spear was the murder weapon, and if the mayor's fingerprints were on it, but in the crime photo (Evidence 9), neither were wearing gloves. However, the problem is, if the mayor was holding the spear, his fingerprints should be on it, but if he wasn't wearing gloves, then that's possible. Wait, but maybe the real contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nWait, Testimony 1 says the mayor's fingerprints were on the murder weapon (the spear), but Evidence 7 (the statue) is the weapon used to bludgeon the mayor. The murder weapon for Kyubi is the spear. So Testimony 1's claim about fingerprints on the spear might conflict with something else. Let me check the evidence related to the spear.\n\nLooking at Evidence 9 (Crime Photo), the spear impales Kyubi, and the mayor is sitting with a head wound. The statue (Evidence 7) was used to hit the mayor. So the murder weapon (spear) would have the mayor's fingerprints if he used it. But if he wasn't wearing gloves (as per the photo), then his fingerprints should be on the spear. But the problem could be that the autopsy report (Evidence 14) says Kyubi was asleep due to drugs. So if he was asleep, how did he grab the statue? Testimony 4 says that the pain jolted him awake, allowing him to strike back. That's possible.\n\nWait, but let's look for a direct contradiction. For example, Testimony 1 says the mayor's fingerprints were on the murder weapon (spear). But if the spear is part of the crime scene, and the mayor was in a struggle, maybe his fingerprints are there. But what if there's evidence that the spear couldn't have his fingerprints? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, the key contradiction could be between Testimony 3 and Evidence 7. Testimony 3 says the mayor attacked with the spear. But Evidence 7 says the statue was used to bludgeon the mayor (which would be Kyubi's action). So maybe that's not a contradiction. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the problem might be with Testimony 1. If the murder weapon (the spear) has the mayor's fingerprints, but the statue (Evidence 7) used against the mayor has his blood but no fingerprints. However, the statue is a different weapon. Maybe another angle: the fingerprints on the murder weapon (spear) can't be the mayor's if he wasn't wearing gloves, but that's not a contradiction. Unless there's evidence that the spear couldn't have fingerprints. Wait, Evidence 7 says the statue has the mayor's blood but no fingerprints. The statue was wrapped in a cloth, so maybe that's why no fingerprints. But Testimony 1 is about the spear. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Testimony 0: Alderman Kyubi was murdered with a spear that had been on the wall. That's supported by the autopsy. But let's check other evidences. The Hand Cream (Evidence 19) was dropped in the Forbidden Chamber. Maybe that's related to someone else. The Golden Fur (Evidence 8) found at the scene. The Amazing Nine-Tails Mask (Evidence 10) has white hair inside. Since Kyubi had snow-white hair (Character 4), maybe the mask's hair is his. But how does that relate to the testimonies?\n\nWait, Testimony 1 says the mayor's fingerprints were on the murder weapon. If the murder weapon is the spear, but the photo (Evidence 9) shows the mayor in a green suit with blood on his head, sitting on the sofa. If he was the one who used the spear, then his fingerprints would be on it. But the problem could be that the crime photo shows the mayor was sitting injured, maybe unable to have used the spear. But that's speculative.\n\nAnother angle: The key contradiction could be between Testimony 1 (mayor's fingerprints on the murder weapon) and Evidence 7 (the statue, which was used to hit the mayor, has no fingerprints). But Testimony 1 is about the spear, so maybe that's not conflicting. Wait, maybe the murder weapon according to the testimony is the spear, but the actual murder weapon (the statue) has no fingerprints. No, the murder of Kyubi is by the spear. The statue was used by Kyubi to hit the mayor. So the mayor's fingerprints on the spear would be Testimony 1, but if the spear was on the wall (Testimony 0), maybe the mayor didn't touch it. Wait, if the spear was on the wall, then the mayor would have had to take it down, leaving fingerprints. But if the mayor was the attacker, his fingerprints would be there, which Testimony 1 says. But maybe there's evidence that the spear couldn't have his fingerprints. Wait, the problem is that the crime photo (Evidence 9) shows neither were wearing gloves. So if the mayor took the spear from the wall, his fingerprints should be on it, which is what Testimony 1 says. So that seems consistent.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look elsewhere. Let's check Testimony 4: Kyubi grabbed a statue and struck back. Evidence 7 is the statue, which has the mayor's blood but no fingerprints. So if Kyubi grabbed it, his fingerprints should be on it, but the evidence says no fingerprints. But Testimony 4 doesn't mention fingerprints. Wait, the statue was wrapped in a cloth (Evidence 7 description), so maybe the cloth prevented fingerprints. So that might not be a contradiction.\n\nWait, another angle: Testimony 3 says Mayor Tenma attacked Kyubi with the spear. But according to Evidence 14 (autopsy), Kyubi was in a drug-induced slumber. So he was asleep. Testimony 4 says the pain jolted him awake, allowing him to strike back. That seems plausible. So no contradiction there.\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (mayor's fingerprints on the murder weapon) and Evidence 9 (the crime photo shows neither wearing gloves). But if the mayor was wearing gloves, there would be no fingerprints. But the photo shows neither were wearing gloves. So if the mayor touched the spear without gloves, his fingerprints should be there, which Testimony 1 confirms. So that's consistent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14): time of death around 3:20 PM. The TV Listings (Evidence 13) show that Filch was watching the wrestling match at 3 PM. If Filch was guarding the entrance (Character 6), but was watching TV, maybe he wasn't at his post. But how does that contradict a testimony?\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 2 says Kyubi was asleep from a drug he unwittingly ingested. Evidence 14 confirms that, so no contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe the key contradiction is Testimony 1 (mayor's fingerprints on the murder weapon) and the fact that the spear was on the wall. If the spear was on the wall and the mayor took it down, his fingerprints would be there. But maybe there's evidence that the spear wasn't touched. Wait, but Testimony 0 says the murder weapon was the spear from the wall. So that's consistent.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the Fox and Demon Statue (Evidence 7). It's stated that the statue was the weapon used to bludgeon the mayor, and it had his blood but no fingerprints. The testimony says that Kyubi struck back with the statue. So if Kyubi grabbed it, why no fingerprints? Because he was wearing gloves? But the crime photo says neither were wearing gloves. So that's a contradiction. Because Kyubi wasn't wearing gloves, his fingerprints should be on the statue, but Evidence 7 says no fingerprints could be lifted. Therefore, Testimony 4 (Kyubi grabbed the statue and struck back) contradicts Evidence 7 (no fingerprints on the statue). \n\nBut wait, Testimony 4 is about the action of Kyubi grabbing the statue. If Kyubi wasn't wearing gloves, his fingerprints should be on it. But Evidence 7 says no fingerprints. That's a contradiction. So the testimony says Kyubi grabbed the statue, but the evidence shows no fingerprints. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 7 and Testimony 4. But the question asks for evidence and testimony contradicting each other. So Testimony 4 (Kyubi grabbed the statue) is contradicted by Evidence 7 (no fingerprints on the statue), given that Kyubi wasn't wearing gloves (per Evidence 9). \n\nSo the answer would be Evidence 7 and Testimony 4. Therefore, the JSON should be {\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 4}.\n\n{\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 4}",

    "response": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So, the user wants one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the testimonies given by Fulbright. There are four of them. Let's look at each one and see what they claim, then check the evidences to find contradictions.\n\nTestimony 3 says: \"The strange feathers and tracks he planted made it look like a yokai was the killer.\" So Fulbright is claiming that Mayor Tenma planted feathers and tracks to frame a yokai.\n\nNow, looking at the evidence list. Evidence 9 is the Crime Photo, which mentions \"bloody footprints and black feathers scattered on top of the blood.\" The photo shows that there were actual feathers and footprints at the scene. However, according to Fulbright's testimony, these were planted by the mayor. But let's check if there's evidence that these feathers or footprints couldn't have been planted by the mayor, or if there's another source.\n\nEvidence 10 is the Amazing Nine-Tails Mask, which has white hair inside. The mask is connected to The Amazing Nine-Tails, the wrestler. Also, Evidence 8 is Golden Fur found at the scene. Wait, the feathers in the crime photo are black (from Evidence 9's description), but the mask has white hair. Hmm. Maybe the black feathers are from Tenma Taro's depiction in the Yokai Legend Scroll (Evidence 1), where Tenma Taro has black feathers. So if the mayor was planting feathers to make it look like Tenma Taro, the black feathers would be part of that setup. But the testimony says the mayor planted them. However, perhaps the actual feathers found (black ones in the photo) might have another origin that contradicts the mayor planting them.\n\nWait, the Amazing Nine-Tails is a wrestler with a nine-tailed cape. The mask (Evidence 10) has white hair inside, which might belong to Rex Kyubi (since he has snow-white hair, Character 4). If the mask was found with white hair, maybe indicating that the wrestler was actually Kyubi, but he's the victim. Alternatively, the fur in Evidence 8 is golden, which could be from the Nine-Tails' costume. \n\nWait, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows black feathers and bloody footprints. The Yokai Legend Scroll (Evidence 1) shows Tenma Taro with black feathers. So if the mayor planted those feathers to frame a yokai, that's what Fulbright's Testimony 3 claims. But maybe there's evidence that the feathers couldn't have been planted by the mayor. Alternatively, maybe the feathers are from another source that the mayor couldn't have accessed. \n\nLooking at Evidence 10, the Amazing Nine-Tails Mask has white hair inside, which could be from Rex Kyubi (since he has white hair). But the feathers in the crime scene are black. The mayor's aide is L'Belle (Character 8), who uses a hair color product (Evidence 18: Couleur Me L'Belle!), which washes out. Maybe the black feathers are from the Tenma Taro statue or something else. \n\nWait, the Fox and Demon Statue (Evidence 7) was used as the weapon, wrapped in cloth, and the original statue's appearance is only known by Jinxie. But maybe the statue's depiction of Tenma Taro includes black feathers, which matches the feathers in the crime scene. So if the mayor planted the feathers, but the feathers actually come from the statue, which is part of the original crime scene, that could be a contradiction. Or perhaps the fact that the mayor was unconscious at the scene (Character 3) and couldn't have planted them. \n\nAlternatively, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) says Kyubi was in a drug-induced slumber when killed, stabbed with a spear. The murder weapon (the statue) was used to bludgeon the mayor, but the mayor was found unconscious. Wait, the statue was the weapon used to bludgeon the mayor, not Kyubi. Kyubi was stabbed with a spear. So the mayor was attacked with the statue. \n\nWait, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows two men: one in a beige suit (probably Kyubi, since he's the alderman) lying on a table with a spear, and another in a green suit (Mayor Tenma, since he's in a suit) with head blood. The Autopsy Report (14) says Kyubi was stabbed with a spear, time of death 3:20 PM. So the mayor was found unconscious with head injury from the statue. \n\nFulbright's Testimony 4 says Mayor Tenma killed Kyubi after planting feathers and tracks. But according to the Autopsy Report, Kyubi was stabbed with a spear, and the mayor was bludgeoned with the statue. If the mayor was found unconscious, how could he have stabbed Kyubi if he was himself attacked? That could be a contradiction. Wait, maybe the timeline. The mayor was unconscious at the scene, but Fulbright claims he killed Kyubi. But the Autopsy Report's time of death is around 3:20 PM. If the mayor was unconscious, maybe he couldn't have done it. \n\nBut maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let's go back to Testimony 3: the mayor planted feathers and tracks. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows black feathers. The Yokai Scroll (Evidence 1) says Tenma Taro has black feathers. The mayor's plan was to make it look like Tenma Taro did it. But the Amazing Nine-Tails Mask (Evidence 10) has white hair, which could be from Kyubi. If the mask was found with white hair, that might link to Kyubi, but the mayor's plan was to use black feathers. Alternatively, the Golden Fur (Evidence 8) is from an animal, maybe the Nine-Tails' costume. \n\nWait, the contradiction might be between Testimony 3 (mayor planted feathers) and the fact that the feathers in the crime scene (black) are consistent with the scroll's depiction of Tenma Taro, which is part of the village's superstitions. However, if the mayor was unconscious, maybe he couldn't have planted them. But that's more about opportunity. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 4: \"Mayor Tenma killed the sleeping alderman after planting the feathers and tracks.\" But the Autopsy Report (14) says Kyubi was in a drug-induced slumber. If he was asleep, maybe the mayor didn't need to plant feathers after killing him, but Fulbright's testimony says he planted feathers and tracks first, then killed him. However, the timing might not contradict. \n\nWait, another angle: The Special Edition Paper (Evidence 4) has a photo of Tenma Taro soaring, which could be related to the mayor fabricating the monster (Testimony 2). But how does that contradict?\n\nLooking at Testimony 3 again: the mayor planted feathers and tracks. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the feathers and footprints. If there's evidence that the feathers couldn't have been planted by the mayor, perhaps because they are linked to someone else. For example, the Golden Fur (Evidence 8) is animal fur, maybe from the Nine-Tails' costume. If the fur is from the wrestler's costume, which is separate from the mayor's plan, that could indicate someone else was involved. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the Hand Cream (Evidence 19) was dropped in the Forbidden Chamber and has L'Belle's logo. L'Belle is the mayor's aide. If he was in the foyer with Filch (Character 8's testimony), but the Hand Cream was found in the Forbidden Chamber, that might place him there, contradicting his alibi. But how does that relate to Fulbright's testimonies?\n\nAlternatively, the Blackmail Letter (Evidence 15) was found in Kyubi's pocket, and it's likely L'Belle took it from the mayor's briefcase. That could imply L'Belle was involved in blackmail, but again, how does that contradict Fulbright's testimony?\n\nWait, Testimony 0 says the case is about a municipal merger opposition. Testimony 1 says the mayor panicked when the Nine-Tails helped protestors. Testimony 2: mayor fabricated a monster. Testimony 3: planted feathers/tracks. Testimony 4: mayor killed Kyubi after planting.\n\nThe key contradiction might be between Testimony 4 (mayor killed Kyubi) and the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) which states Kyubi was stabbed with a spear. But the mayor was found unconscious, possibly bludgeoned. If the mayor was knocked out, could he have stabbed Kyubi? Maybe not, but that's a possibility. However, the murder weapon for Kyubi is the spear, while the mayor was attacked with the statue. So if the mayor was the killer, he would have had to stab Kyubi with the spear, then someone else hit him with the statue. But according to Fulbright's Testimony 4, the mayor killed Kyubi after planting evidence. So if the mayor was found unconscious, maybe he couldn't have done both. But this is more about the sequence of events rather than direct evidence contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Testimony 3 (planted feathers and tracks) and Evidence 9 (the photo shows feathers and footprints). If the feathers are from the Yokai legend, but the Golden Fur (Evidence 8) is from an animal, which could be part of the Nine-Tails' costume. If the fur is from the wrestler's costume, that suggests the Nine-Tails was present, contradicting the idea that the mayor planted everything. So if the fur is from the wrestler, then maybe the real Nine-Tails was involved, which contradicts the mayor fabricating the monster.\n\nBut wait, the Amazing Nine-Tails is a wrestler who inspired the monster craze (Evidence 11). The mayor's plan was to fabricate a monster (Testimony 2), but the presence of the Nine-Tails' fur (if that's the case) might indicate that the wrestler was actually there, making the monster real, which contradicts the mayor's fabrication.\n\nBut Evidence 8 is Golden Fur, which is long and soft. The Nine-Tails' costume might have golden fur, so if that fur was found at the scene, it suggests the wrestler was present. If Fulbright's testimony claims the mayor fabricated the monster, but the presence of the wrestler's fur indicates the monster (Nine-Tails) was actually there, that's a contradiction. So Testimony 3 (mayor planted feathers and tracks to make it look like a yokai) and Evidence 8 (Golden Fur from the Nine-Tails' costume) would contradict, because the fur would be from a real person (the wrestler) being present, not a fabricated yokai.\n\nAlternatively, the feathers in the crime scene (black, from Tenma Taro) and the fur (golden, from Nine-Tails) could both be part of the setup, but if the fur is linked to the wrestler's actual presence, which is a real person, then the mayor's plan to fabricate a yokai would be undermined by the real presence of the wrestler. However, Fulbright's testimony says the mayor fabricated the monster, but the fur suggests the wrestler (a real person dressed as a monster) was there, which could mean the mayor didn't fabricate it but the wrestler was involved.\n\nAlternatively, the Amazing Nine-Tails Mask (Evidence 10) has white hair inside, which matches Rex Kyubi's hair (snow-white). If the mask was worn by Kyubi, but he's the victim, that might indicate someone else was impersonating him. But this might not directly contradict the testimony.\n\nWait, Testimony 3 says the mayor planted feathers and tracks. The feathers in the crime photo (black) are from the Yokai legend (Tenma Taro). However, the Tenma Taro Warding Charm (Evidence 2) was given by Jinxie, which suggests that Tenma Taro is a demon in the local lore. If the mayor planted those feathers, but the actual statue (Fox and Demon Statue, Evidence 7) was used as a weapon and wrapped in cloth, which was the original statue that only Jinxie knew, perhaps the feathers from the statue were already present, meaning the mayor didn't need to plant them. But the testimony says he planted them. If the feathers were part of the statue's design, then they were already there, contradicting the idea that the mayor planted them. For example, if the statue naturally has black feathers as part of its depiction, then the feathers at the scene could be from the statue being broken, not planted by the mayor. That would contradict Testimony 3, which claims the mayor planted the feathers.\n\nSo Evidence 7 (Fox and Demon Statue) describes the statue as depicting Tenma Taro and the Nine-Tailed Fox in battle. The statue was used as the weapon, and the original appearance is known only to Jinxie. The Yokai Legend Scroll (Evidence 1) shows Tenma Taro with black feathers. If the statue also has black feathers as part of its design, then breaking it during the attack would scatter those feathers naturally, without the mayor needing to plant them. Therefore, Testimony 3 (mayor planted the feathers) would be contradicted by Evidence 7 and 1, as the feathers could have come from the statue being used as the weapon, not planted by the mayor.\n\nTherefore, the pair would be Testimony 3 (mayor planted feathers) and Evidence 7 (statue used as weapon, which has feathers as part of its design, implying the feathers were from the statue's destruction, not planted). But wait, the description of Evidence 7 says the statue was wrapped in a large cloth. If it was wrapped, maybe the feathers were not accessible unless the statue was unwrapped. Hmm. So if the statue was wrapped, the feathers wouldn't be scattered unless the cloth was removed. If the mayor used the statue (wrapped in cloth) to bludgeon someone, then the feathers wouldn't come out unless the statue was broken open. But the crime photo shows feathers scattered on the blood. If the statue's feathers were inside and only came out when it was broken, then the mayor didn't plant them; they were a result of the attack. Therefore, Testimony 3's claim that the mayor planted the feathers is contradicted by Evidence 7 and 1, which show that the feathers are part of the statue, which was used as a weapon, thus the feathers came from the attack, not pre-planted.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (mayor planted feathers) and Evidence 7 (statue's feathers were part of it, so they came from the attack). But the user wants the evidence number and testimony number. Testimony 3 is Fulbright's third testimony. Evidence 7 is the Fox and Demon Statue. So the pair would be {\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 3}.\n\n{\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 3}",

    "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidence, and testimonies. The main focus here is on Filch's testimonies and the evidence that might contradict them.\n\nLooking at Filch's testimonies: He claims he was on guard duty in the foyer, making sure no one could get to the guest, was in his office watching when the murder happened after 3 PM, and didn't see anything unusual. \n\nNow, checking the evidence. Evidence 13 is the TV Listings. It mentions that Filch's TV program guide has the 3 PM wrestling match circled, and he told Apollo that he watched it, which was a disaster. The autopsy report (Evidence 14) states the time of death around 3:20 PM. If Filch was watching TV at 3 PM, which was a disaster (maybe the match went longer or something happened), but he was supposed to be guarding the foyer. If the murder happened around 3:20 PM, but Filch was watching TV during that time, maybe he wasn't actually keeping watch as he claimed. \n\nSo, his Testimony 2 says he was in his office keeping watch when the murder happened after 3 PM. But if he was watching the wrestling match at 3 PM, which might have overlapped with the time of the murder, he couldn't have been properly guarding. The TV Listings (Evidence 13) showing he was watching TV during that time contradicts his statement that he was keeping a good watch. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (or maybe 0) and Evidence 13. Wait, Testimony 2 says he was in his office keeping watch when the murder happened after 3 PM. The murder was around 3:20 PM. If he was watching TV at 3 PM, perhaps the program ran past 3 PM, causing him to be distracted. So his claim that he was keeping a good watch would be contradicted by the fact that he was actually watching TV instead of monitoring the area. Therefore, the evidence (13) and testimony (2) contradict each other. Alternatively, Testimony 3 says he didn't see anything out of the ordinary, but if he was watching TV, he might have missed something. But the main contradiction is that he was supposed to be on guard, but the TV evidence shows he was watching a program during that time. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 13 and Testimony 2. Wait, but Testimony 2 says \"after 3 PM\", but the TV program was at 3 PM. However, the murder happened around 3:20 PM. So maybe Filch was watching TV at 3 PM and the program lasted until after 3 PM, overlapping with the murder time. Therefore, his claim to be keeping a good watch (Testimony 2) would be contradicted by the TV Listings (Evidence 13) showing he was watching TV during that time. That makes sense. So the contradiction is between Evidence 13 and Testimony 2. Alternatively, Testimony 0 also says he was on guard duty as per Mr. Kyubi's request. But the key here is the timing. The TV program at 3 PM (as per Evidence 13) and the time of death at 3:20 PM. If Filch was watching TV during the time he was supposed to be guarding, that's a contradiction. So the correct pair is Evidence 13 (TV Listings) and Testimony 2 (being in office keeping watch when the murder happened after 3 PM). Because if he was watching TV, he wasn't keeping a good watch. So the JSON answer would be {\"evidence\": 13, \"testimony\": 2}.\n\n{\"evidence\": 13, \"testimony\": 2}",

Evidence 1 is the Yokai Legend Scroll, which describes Tenma Taro. The scroll says that Tenma Taro does not wield any weapon. So if Tenma Taro doesn't have a staff, then Filch's testimony about hearing a staff's jingle is based on a false premise.

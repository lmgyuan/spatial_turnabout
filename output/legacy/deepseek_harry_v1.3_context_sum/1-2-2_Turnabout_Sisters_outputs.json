The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through the testimonies and evidences one by one.\n\nFirst, the testimonies from Gumshoe. Testimony 2 says that the word \"Maya\" was written in blood on a memo found next to the victim's body. Testimony 3 confirms the blood was the victim's, and Testimony 5 states that the victim wrote the killer's name before dying. So according to Gumshoe, Mia wrote \"Maya\" in her own blood, implicating her sister.\n\nNow looking at the evidence. Evidence 1 is The Thinker statue, the murder weapon. Evidence 3 is the receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder. Evidence 2 is the glass shards from a broken light stand. The autopsy report (Evidence 5) says Mia died from a single blunt force trauma but may have lived a few minutes after being hit. \n\nWait, the receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand bought the day before. The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken light stand. So the receipt is for the light stand that was broken into shards. The receipt's date matches the day before the murder, so it was purchased then. But how does this relate to the testimony?\n\nGumshoe's Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name before dying. However, the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says Mia died from a single blow, but may have lived a few minutes. So maybe she had time to write the name. But the contradiction might be elsewhere. \n\nWait, the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are described as broken beyond recognition, which suggests the original light stand was completely shattered. The receipt (Evidence 3) has a note written in blood on the back. If the victim wrote \"Maya\" in blood on the receipt, then the receipt was present at the scene. But the receipt is for the glass light stand, which is now in shards (Evidence 2). But if the light stand was broken into shards, maybe that's the weapon? But the murder weapon is The Thinker statue (Evidence 1). \n\nWait, the autopsy says cause was blunt force trauma with a blunt object, which would be the statue. The glass shards might be a separate thing. \n\nBut the main contradiction could be between Testimony 2 and 3 (blood written as \"Maya\") and some evidence. Alternatively, the receipt (Evidence 3) is a department store receipt with letters in blood on the back. The memo that Gumshoe found (Testimony 1 and 2) is a memo with \"Maya\" in blood. However, Evidence 3 is a receipt with blood writing. Are these the same item? If the receipt has blood writing, but Gumshoe is testifying about a memo (which is Evidence 4 or 14?), maybe there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo, which is a conversation recorded on her cell phone. Evidence 14 is Mia's Memo, a list of names. The memo Gumshoe found (Testimony 1) is a piece of paper next to the body with \"Maya\" written in blood. That might be the receipt (Evidence 3) since it's a receipt with blood on the back. So if the receipt is the memo mentioned in the testimony, but the receipt's date is the day before the murder, then how could the victim have written on it at the time of the murder? Unless the receipt was already present, and she wrote on it. But maybe the problem is that the receipt's purchase date is the day before, but the murder happened the next day. So the receipt being present at the crime scene isn't impossible. \n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between the autopsy report and Testimony 5. The autopsy says death was instantaneous, but Testimony 5 says she wrote the name before dying. But the autopsy actually says \"Death was instantaneous. Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit.\" Wait, that's conflicting. It says death was instantaneous but may have lived a few minutes. That might be a translation error or inconsistency. If the victim died instantly, she couldn't have written anything. But the autopsy report says \"may have lived a few minutes after being hit.\" So that allows her time to write. So that's not a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the receipt (Evidence 3) has blood writing on the back, which is the \"Maya\" name. But the receipt was purchased the day before. If the receipt was in the office before the murder, then Mia could have written on it during the murder. But why would the receipt have blood on it? Alternatively, if the receipt was for the light stand that was broken, and the shards are there, but the murder weapon was the statue. So maybe the receipt's existence doesn't contradict, but perhaps the testimony claims the victim wrote the name on a memo (piece of paper), but the evidence is that the writing is on the receipt, which is a different item. However, if the memo found (Testimony 1) is the receipt, then it's possible. But the problem could be that the receipt's purchase date is the day before, so the victim couldn't have written on it at the time of the murder unless she had it with her. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 5: \"Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\" But the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are the broken light stand, which was purchased the day before (Evidence 3). If the glass shards are from the light stand that was broken, maybe the murder weapon was actually the light stand, but the autopsy says the weapon was a blunt object (the statue). So that's a contradiction? But the statue is confirmed as the murder weapon. Therefore, the glass shards are unrelated. \n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (word \"Maya\" written in blood on the memo) and Evidence 3 (receipt with blood writing). If the receipt is the memo, but the receipt was purchased the day before, then the blood on it would have to be from the murder day. But how does that contradict? Maybe the receipt's back has letters in blood, but the word is \"Maya,\" but the receipt's purchase date is the day before, meaning it was already in the office. So Mia could have written on it during the murder. But that's possible.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is with the blood on the victim's finger (Testimony 4). If she wrote \"Maya\" in her own blood, then there would be blood on her finger. But the autopsy says she died from a single blow. If the blow was fatal, maybe she couldn't move to write. But the autopsy says she may have lived a few minutes. So she could have written it. So that's not a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the \"Maya's Memo\" (Evidence 4) is a conversation recorded on her cell phone. If the memo mentioned in Testimony 1 is this, but it's a physical memo, then that's a contradiction. But the testimony says a memo written on paper, while Evidence 4 is a cell phone recording. So that's a contradiction. But in Testimony 1, Gumshoe says he found a memo written on paper next to the body. Evidence 4 is Maya's memo, which is a cell phone recording. So those are different. Therefore, the memo found (Testimony 1) is not Evidence 4. So maybe the memo found is the receipt (Evidence 3), which has blood writing. But the receipt is a department store receipt. So if the memo is the receipt, then the testimony refers to that. But how does that contradict?\n\nWait, let's see: The receipt (Evidence 3) has blood letters on the back. The testimony says that the victim wrote the name in blood. So if the receipt was purchased the day before, then the receipt was in the office, and the victim wrote on it during the murder. That's possible. But the contradiction might be elsewhere.\n\nWait, the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are broken beyond recognition. The receipt (Evidence 3) is for the glass light stand. So the receipt shows that the light stand was purchased the day before, and the glass shards are its remains. But the murder weapon is the statue (Evidence 1). So the glass shards are from a different object. But the receipt is for the light stand, which was broken. So that's okay. No contradiction there.\n\nWait, another angle: Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name before dying. But the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says cause of death was a single blow, but may have lived a few minutes. So if she was hit and then lived a few minutes, she could have written the name. So no contradiction here.\n\nHmm. Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and the autopsy report. Wait, the testimony says she wrote the name before dying, but the autopsy says death was instantaneous. Wait, but the autopsy actually says: \"Death was instantaneous. [...] May have lived for a few minutes after being hit.\" That's conflicting. Maybe the translation is off, but in the given data, it's stated that the cause was a single blunt force trauma, death was instantaneous, but also says may have lived a few minutes. That's contradictory. So if the death was instantaneous, she couldn't have written anything. But Testimony 5 says she wrote the name before dying. So this would contradict. But the autopsy is Evidence 5, and Testimony 5 is Testimony 5. So that would be a possible pair. But the user asked for one pair. However, according to the problem statement, we need to find which evidence and testimony contradict. So if the autopsy (Evidence 5) says death was instantaneous, but Testimony 5 claims she wrote the name before dying (which requires her to be alive after the injury), then that's a contradiction. \n\nBut looking at the exact wording: \"Death was instantaneous. Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous. Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit.\" Wait, the same line says death was instantaneous and may have lived a few minutes. That's conflicting. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that the blow caused immediate death, but she might have survived briefly. But if the cause was a single blow leading to instantaneous death, then she couldn't have written anything. Therefore, Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name) contradicts the autopsy's assertion of instantaneous death.\n\nBut in the given data, the autopsy report (Evidence 5) states both \"Death was instantaneous\" and \"May have lived for a few minutes after being hit.\" So maybe there's a mistake in the autopsy report. If that's the case, then Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name) is contradicted by the part of the autopsy that says death was instantaneous. But the autopsy also says she may have lived a few minutes. So perhaps the contradiction is not there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the memo that Gumshoe found (Testimony 1) with \"Maya\" written in blood (Testimony 2) is actually the receipt (Evidence 3), which has blood on it. But the receipt is for a purchase the day before, which would mean the receipt was already present. If the receipt was purchased the day before, then the blood on it is from the murder day. So Mia wrote on the receipt during the murder. That seems possible. So no contradiction here.\n\nWait, another angle: The Thinker statue (Evidence 1) is the murder weapon. Its gears were removed. So maybe the statue couldn't have been used as a clock, but that's not directly relevant. The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand, which is broken (Evidence 2). The glass shards are broken beyond recognition. If the murder weapon was the statue, then the glass shards are unrelated. But the receipt's existence shows that the light stand was purchased the day before. Maybe the light stand was broken during the murder, but the actual murder weapon was the statue. So no contradiction there.\n\nWait, looking at Testimony 9 (which is part of the Evidence list, not Testimonies). Oh wait, the user listed Testimonies 0 to 5, and Evidences 0 to 14. So Testimony 0-5 are given, and Evidence 0-14. \n\nWait, let me check the user's input again. The Testimonies are Testimony 0 to 5, all by Gumshoe. The Evidences include the May Testimony (Evidence 9), which is April May's testimony that she saw Maya commit the murder. \n\nBut back to the problem. Which evidence and testimony contradict each other. \n\nWait, Testimony 2 and 3 state that the memo had \"Maya\" in the victim's blood. Evidence 3 is the receipt with blood writing. So if the memo is the receipt, then that's consistent. However, maybe the receipt's back has blood writing, but the receipt's date is the day before. So if the victim wrote on it during the murder, that's possible. No contradiction here.\n\nAnother angle: The Thinker statue (Evidence 1) has its gears removed. If the gears were removed, maybe the statue was too light to cause a fatal blow. But that's speculative. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a glass light stand purchased the day before (Evidence 3's receipt). If the light stand was broken, maybe the glass shards could have been used as a weapon, but the autopsy says the weapon was a blunt object (the statue). So that's not a contradiction. The glass shards could be from a different event.\n\nWait, the testimony from Gumshoe (Testimony 5) says the victim wrote the killer's name before dying. But the receipt (Evidence 3) has the name written in blood, which would require the victim to have written it. However, the receipt's date is the day before the murder. So the receipt was already present in the office. If the victim wrote on the receipt during the murder, that's possible. So no contradiction here.\n\nAlternatively, the victim's memo (Evidence 14) is a list of names. If that list includes someone else, but Testimony 2 says \"Maya\" was written, but perhaps the actual list contradicts that. But there's no info on what names are on Mia's memo.\n\nWait, the photograph (Evidences 10 and 11) relate to DL-6 incident, which might be unrelated here. \n\nWhat about the wiretap (Evidence 7) found in April May's hotel room. If there's a wiretap, maybe someone was listening in, but not directly related to the testimonies.\n\nHmm. Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name) and Evidence 5 (autopsy report). Wait, the autopsy says \"Death was instantaneous. [...] May have lived for a few minutes after being hit.\" That's conflicting. If death was instantaneous, she couldn't have written anything. But the report also says she may have lived a few minutes. So perhaps the contradiction is that the autopsy says two conflicting things. But the question is about evidence and testimony contradicting each other. So if Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name) is contradicted by the autopsy's \"death was instantaneous\" part, then Evidence 5 (autopsy) contradicts Testimony 5. But the user might want the pair Evidence 5 and Testimony 5. But in the given data, Testimony 5 is by Gumshoe, claiming the victim wrote the name before dying. The autopsy report (Evidence 5) says death was instantaneous, but also that she may have lived a few minutes. So perhaps that's a possible contradiction. But maybe another pair is better.\n\nWait, looking again at the receipt (Evidence 3). It's a receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The back has letters written in blood. If the victim wrote that, but the receipt was purchased the day before, that's possible. But maybe the receipt's purchase date indicates that the light stand was bought before the murder, and the glass shards (Evidence 2) are from that light stand. But the murder weapon was the statue. So the glass shards are from a different incident. That's okay. No contradiction.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 2 says \"Maya\" was written in blood on the memo. Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo, which is a conversation recorded on her cell phone. If the memo mentioned in the testimony is a physical piece of paper, but Evidence 4 is a phone recording, that's a contradiction. But Testimony 1 says the memo was a piece of paper. Evidence 4 is on a cell phone. So those are different memos. Therefore, no contradiction.\n\nWait, the memo mentioned in Testimony 1 is a physical memo, while Maya's Memo (Evidence 4) is a phone recording. So different items. So no contradiction.\n\nHmm. Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (victim wrote \"Maya\" in blood) and Evidence 4 (Maya's cell phone has a conversation). If the phone conversation is alibi evidence, but that's not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, the testimony claims the victim wrote \"Maya\" in her own blood, but the receipt (Evidence 3) is the actual item with the blood writing, which is a receipt for a light stand purchased the day before. If the receipt was already present, then Mia could have written on it. So no contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) being broken beyond recognition contradict Testimony 9 (which is part of the evidences as May Testimony). Wait, Testimony 9 is Evidence 9, which is part of the evidence list. Testimony 9 says the victim dodged an attack then ran to the right but was caught and struck. If the glass shards are from a broken light stand, maybe that indicates a struggle, which aligns with May's testimony. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name) and the fact that the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a light stand, implying that the real weapon was something else. But the murder weapon is already the statue. So that's not a contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe the receipt (Evidence 3) has the blood writing, but the victim's blood on the receipt (Testimony 3) and the victim's finger (Testimony 4) would be consistent. So no contradiction there.\n\nHmm. I'm struggling to find the contradiction. Let me try another approach. Look for a testimony that says one thing and evidence that directly contradicts it.\n\nTestimony 3 says lab tests showed the blood was the victim's. That's supported by Evidence 3 (receipt with victim's blood). No contradiction there.\n\nTestimony 2 says \"Maya\" was written in blood. Evidence 3 is the receipt with blood writing. If the receipt's blood writing is \"Maya\", then that's consistent. But what if the receipt's blood writing isn't \"Maya\"? For example, if the receipt's blood writing is something else, then Testimony 2 would be contradicted by Evidence 3. But according to the given data, Testimony 2 says the memo has \"Maya\" written in blood. Evidence 3 is the receipt with letters in blood. If the receipt is the memo, then the name \"Maya\" is written on it, which aligns. But if the receipt's blood writing isn't \"Maya\", but the testimony says it is, that's a contradiction. But the user's data doesn't specify what's written on the receipt's back. Wait, in the evidence list, Evidence 3 is a receipt with letters written in blood. The testimony says the word \"Maya\" was written. So if the receipt's blood letters are \"Maya\", then no contradiction. But if the receipt's letters are different, then contradiction. However, the problem states that the user has to assume the given data as complete. Since the evidence description for Evidence 3 says \"letters written in blood\", but the testimony says the word \"Maya\" is written, perhaps those are different items. For example, the memo Gumshoe found (Testimony 1) is a different piece of paper (not the receipt), and the receipt is a separate evidence. So if the memo with \"Maya\" is not the receipt, then there's a contradiction because the receipt's blood letters could be different. But since the data doesn't specify what's written on the receipt, we can't assume that. Therefore, this might not be the contradiction.\n\nWait, another thought: The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken glass light stand. The murder weapon is the statue (Evidence 1). So the glass light stand was broken, but it wasn't the murder weapon. So the receipt's purchase is for an item unrelated to the murder. No contradiction there.\n\nWait, the bellboy's affidavit (Evidence 12) describes the man with April May. If that man is Redd White (Character 7), but not sure.\n\nHmm. Let me try to find the answer from memory of the game. In the first Phoenix Wright case, the contradiction is between the receipt and the testimony about the victim writing Maya's name. The victim couldn't have written the name because the receipt was already in the office, purchased the day before. Wait, but that's not a direct contradiction. Wait, the receipt in the game is for a lamp purchased by Redd White, and the victim wrote \"Maya\" on it, but since the receipt was from the day before, it's possible. Wait, maybe the contradiction is that the victim's blood is on the receipt, which was purchased the day before, meaning she couldn't have written on it after being attacked because the receipt was already there. Wait, no. The receipt being purchased the day before doesn't affect when the blood was written on it. The receipt could have been present, and she wrote on it during the murder.\n\nBut I think the actual contradiction in the game is that the victim was hit on the head, and the statue was the murder weapon. The receipt's date shows that the lamp was bought the day before, and the lamp was broken into shards. But the victim wrote \"Maya\" on the receipt, which was already there. However, the lamp's shards (Evidence 2) are from the lamp that was purchased the day before. The Thinker statue (Evidence 1) is the murder weapon, which had its gears removed. The contradiction in the game is that the victim couldn't have written \"Maya\" because the name was actually written by the real culprit, and the memo was a fake. But in the given data, the key contradiction is between the autopsy report and the testimony about the victim writing the name. Alternatively, in the game, the receipt's date shows that the lamp was bought before the murder, but the real killer used the statue. The memo with \"Maya\" was written in blood on the receipt, but the victim couldn't have written it because she was killed instantly. However, the autopsy here says she may have lived a few minutes. So maybe not.\n\nWait, another angle: The receipt (Evidence 3) is a department store receipt with the purchase date the day before. The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are the broken remains. If the glass light stand was broken during the murder, but the receipt's date is the day before, that aligns. But if the receipt's back has the blood writing, and the victim wrote it, then no contradiction. Unless the receipt was bought by the killer, but that's not indicated here.\n\nI think the correct contradiction is between the autopsy report (Evidence 5) stating that death was instantaneous, and Testimony 5 stating the victim wrote the name before dying. Because if death was instantaneous, she couldn't have written anything. However, the autopsy also says \"may have lived for a few minutes after being hit,\" which conflicts. So this might be a trick question. But since the user wants one pair, maybe the intended answer is the receipt (Evidence 3) and Testimony 2. Because the receipt's back has the name written in blood, but the receipt's date is the day before, implying it was already present. But how does that contradict the testimony?\n\nAlternatively, in the game, the actual contradiction is that the receipt has blood writing, but the victim couldn't have written it because the killer did. But the evidence here doesn't state that. \n\nAlternatively, the testimony says the victim wrote the name in blood (Testimony 5), but the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are broken beyond recognition, which could mean that the victim couldn't have used them to write, but that's not directly related.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 9 (May Testimony). Wait, Testimony 9 is part of the Evidences as Evidence 9, which is April May's testimony that she saw Maya commit the murder. But the user's question is about Testimonies (the ones numbered 0-5, given under Testimonies section). So Testimonies 0-5 are all from Gumshoe. The other testimonies (like May's) are in the Evidences section as Evidence 9.\n\nSo the possible contradiction is between Gumshoe's Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name) and the autopsy report (Evidence 5) saying death was instantaneous. But the autopsy report also says may have lived a few minutes. So it's a bit conflicting. But the answer might be this pair.\n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Maya's name written in blood) and Evidence 3 (receipt with blood writing). If the receipt is the memo, and the receipt's purchase date is the day before, then the victim could have written on it. No contradiction here.\n\nAnother angle: The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a glass light stand, but the murder weapon was the statue (Evidence 1). The receipt (Evidence 3) is for the light stand. If the light stand was broken, but not used as the weapon, then no contradiction. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the classic contradiction from the game. In the first Phoenix Wright case, the contradiction is that the victim was struck with the statue, but the phone call recording proves that Maya was on the phone when the murder happened, thus she couldn't have done it. The memo on the receipt was actually written by the killer, not the victim. The key contradiction is between the phone call (Evidence 6) and April May's testimony. But the user's question asks for evidence and testimony contradicting each other. The phone call (Evidence 6) would contradict April May's testimony (Evidence 9), but April May's testimony is in the Evidences list. \n\nAlternatively, in the given data, the testimony from Gumshoe (Testimony 5) says the victim wrote the killer's name, but the cell phone (Evidence 6) has a conversation between Mia and Maya, indicating Maya wasn't present. So if the phone call was ongoing during the murder, Maya couldn't have been there. Therefore, the cell phone (Evidence 6) contradicts Testimony 5. But the problem is that the user is asking for a pair of evidence and testimony from the list provided. The testimonies are only Gumshoe's (0-5), and the evidences include the cell phone (6). \n\nSo if during the phone call, Maya was on the phone with Mia, then she couldn't have been at the scene, contradicting Gumshoe's testimony that the victim wrote her name. But how does this relate to the evidence and testimony pairs?\n\nFor example, Evidence 6 (Maya's Cell Phone) holds a conversation between Mia and Maya. If the conversation occurred around the time of the murder, then Maya was not present at the scene, contradicting Testimony 5 (victim wrote Maya's name). So the pair would be Evidence 6 and Testimony 5. But the user's answer must be in {\"evidence\": x, \"testimony\": y} format.\n\nBut according to the problem's data, Testimony 5 is Gumshoe's assertion that the victim wrote the killer's name. If the cell phone recording (Evidence 6) shows that Maya was on the phone with Mia during the murder, then Maya couldn't have been the killer, contradicting Gumshoe's testimonies (Testimony 2, 3, 5). Therefore, the cell phone evidence (6) contradicts the testimonies that implicate Maya.\n\nBut the question asks for one pair. So the contradiction would be between Evidence 6 (Maya's Cell Phone with the conversation) and Testimony 5 (victim wrote Maya's name). Because the phone call would prove Maya's innocence, contradicting the testimony that she's the killer.\n\nYes, this seems right. So the answer would be {\"evidence\": 6, \"testimony\": 5}.\n\n{\"evidence\": 6, \"testimony\": 5}",

    "response": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So, the problem is to find one pair where what the evidence says doesn't match with a testimony.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each testimony by April May and check against the evidences provided. Let's start by listing out April's testimonies:\n\nTestimony 0: She claims she saw everything. But maybe this is more about her credibility than a direct contradiction.\n\nTestimony1: The victim (Mia) dodged the first attack and ran to the right.\n\nTestimony2: The girl in hippie clothes (Maya) ran after her...\n\nTestimony3: She hit her with the weapon (The Thinker statue). April says she saw it.\n\nTestimony4: She identifies the weapon as The Thinker statue clock.\n\nNow looking at the evidence. The key ones here would be related to the murder weapon and the timeline. Let's check the autopsy report (Evidence5). It says Mia died from a single blunt force trauma, death was instantaneous, but also mentions she may have lived a few minutes after being hit. Hmm, that might be a point to check against the testimony of the sequence of events.\n\nBut wait, the main contradiction might be elsewhere. Let's look at The Thinker (Evidence1). The description says it's a clock but the gears were removed. If the gears are removed, maybe the clock wasn't functional. But does that contradict any testimony? April's Testimony4 refers to it as a statue-y clock, which matches. So maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony3 says Maya hit her with the weapon. But if the autopsy says death was instantaneous, but the receipt (Evidence3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The glass shards (Evidence2) are broken remains of a glass light stand. So the receipt and glass shards are connected. The receipt's date is the day before, which might mean the light stand was present at the scene.\n\nWait, the Glass Shards (Evidence2) are from a broken light stand, and the Receipt (Evidence3) is for that light stand. But April's testimony says the murder weapon was The Thinker statue. So if the actual murder weapon was the glass light stand (now shattered into shards), then April's testimony that the killer used The Thinker would be contradicted by the evidence showing the glass light stand was the weapon. But how?\n\nWait, the autopsy says cause of death is blunt force trauma from a blunt object. The Thinker is a statue (blunt object), but if the glass light stand was the actual weapon, maybe that's a contradiction. But the autopsy doesn't specify which object. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the glass shards being present indicate the light stand was broken during the attack. If the murder weapon was the light stand, then the Thinker statue (which is supposed to be the weapon according to April) would not be the actual murder weapon, contradicting her testimony.\n\nBut how does the evidence connect? The glass shards (Evidence2) are from a glass light stand, which was purchased the day before (per Receipt Evidence3). If the light stand was broken during the murder, maybe that's the actual weapon. But the Thinker is also a possible weapon. So if the autopsy says blunt force trauma, either could cause that. However, the Thinker's gears were removed, making it a solid statue, which could be a weapon. The glass shards might be from another object broken during the struggle.\n\nWait, but according to the testimony, the victim dodged an attack (Testimony1), ran right, then was caught and struck (Testimony3). If the Thinker was the weapon, but the glass shards are from a broken light stand, maybe the initial attack was with the light stand, which shattered, and then the Thinker was used? But April's testimony says the killer hit her with the Thinker. However, if the glass shards are from the murder weapon, then that would contradict April's claim that the Thinker was the weapon.\n\nAlternatively, the autopsy report says death was from a single blow. If the Thinker was used, but the glass light stand was broken, perhaps there were two objects involved, but only one caused death. But the contradiction would be if the actual murder weapon (as per evidence) was the glass light stand, but April testifies it was the Thinker. That would be a contradiction between Evidence2 (Glass Shards from light stand) and Testimony3 (hit with The Thinker).\n\nBut how do we know the glass light stand was the weapon? The autopsy says blunt force, which could be either. But the glass shards being broken beyond recognition might indicate it was shattered with force, perhaps during the attack. But maybe the Thinker was the actual weapon, and the glass was broken in another context. But according to the receipt (Evidence3), the light stand was purchased the day before, so it was in the office. If the light stand was broken during the murder, perhaps the killer used the light stand, not the Thinker. Then April's testimony that the Thinker was the weapon would be contradicted by the presence of the glass shards (from the light stand) as the actual weapon.\n\nBut I need to be precise here. The evidence list includes the Glass Shards (Evidence2) which are the remains of a glass light stand. The Receipt (Evidence3) shows purchase of the light stand. The Thinker (Evidence1) is a statue clock with gears removed. The Autopsy (Evidence5) says cause was a blunt object. So if the actual murder weapon was the light stand (now broken into shards), but April testifies it was the Thinker statue, that's a contradiction. So Evidence2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony3 (hit with The Thinker) would contradict. Because if the weapon was the light stand, the Thinker wasn't used, so April's testimony is false.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony3 says the girl hit her with \"that weapon\" (The Thinker). But if the glass shards are from the actual weapon (the light stand), then the testimony is wrong. Therefore, Evidence2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony3 would contradict.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. So the answer would be evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and testimony 3 (hit with the Thinker).\n\n{\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}",

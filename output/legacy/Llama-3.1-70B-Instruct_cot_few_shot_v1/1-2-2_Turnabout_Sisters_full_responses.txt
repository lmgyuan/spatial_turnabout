Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states, "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!" However, Evidence 3, which is "Receipt," states that it has "letters written in blood on the back", but it does not state that it is the killer's name, but it does not contradict the testimony. However, Evidence 5, which is "Mia's Autopsy Report," states that "Death was instantaneous", which implies that the victim did not have time to write the killer's name.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 3 states, "And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!" However, Evidence 5, which is "Mia's Autopsy Report," states that "Death was instantaneous" and "Cause: single blunt force trauma", but it does not state that the victim was hit by the killer after running off to the right. However, Testimony 1 states, "The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right", which contradicts the instantaneous death.

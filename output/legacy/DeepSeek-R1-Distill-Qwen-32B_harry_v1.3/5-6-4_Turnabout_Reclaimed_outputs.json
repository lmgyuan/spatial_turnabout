    "response": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'm presented with a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies related to a murder case involving an orca named Orla. The goal is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the key points from the evidence and testimonies to understand the context better.\n\n**Evidence Overview:**\n- **Evidence 1 (Swashbuckler Flyer):** An advertisement for a new show featuring an orca dressed as a pirate. It mentions that Sasha was not slated to return, implying she might not be part of the current show.\n- **Evidence 2 (Photo of the Body):** Crime scene photos taken in the orca pool room, which are hard to make out.\n- **Evidence 3 (Orca Pool Diagram):** A cross-section view of the pool, showing its depth and layout.\n- **Evidence 4 (Whistle):** Used to command Orla, who performs one trick per signal.\n- **Evidence 5 (Security Footage):** Video from the visitor's corridor starting at 10 AM.\n- **Evidence 6 (Fish):** Smelly fish for feeding Penguin Rifle.\n- **Evidence 7 (Walkie-Talkie):** Used for staff communication.\n- **Evidence 8 (Calendar):** A penguin-shaped calendar switched between Pearl and Rimes, with a meeting scheduled for 7 AM.\n- **Evidence 9 (Bloodstained Coin):** Found near the pool, possibly a murder weapon.\n- **Evidence 10 (Swashbuckler Video):** Shows a performance with Orla, Sasha, and Jack Shipley.\n- **Evidence 11 (TV Phone):** A phone used by staff, with videos of Azura Summers.\n- **Evidence 12 (Shipley's Data):** Details of Jack Shipley's death, including blunt force trauma and estimated time of death.\n- **Evidence 13 (Book):** About a previous case involving an orca.\n- **Evidence 14 (Security Card):** Only Sasha and the victim had access to the pool.\n- **Evidence 15 (Prescription Bag):** Found in Sasha's residence.\n- **Evidence 16 (Skull Rock):** Bloodstained rock Orla might have hit.\n- **Evidence 17 (Pool Bottom Photo):** Shows bloodstains.\n- **Evidence 18 (Capsule):** Sleeping pill found in Orla's stomach.\n- **Evidence 19 (Sign):** Made by Sasha for the new show.\n- **Evidence 20 (Ladder Prints):** Rimes's fingerprints found.\n- **Evidence 21 (Charm):** Found in Rifle's stomach.\n- **Evidence 22 (TORPEDO Data):** Shows when Rifle ate.\n\n**Testimonies Overview:**\n- **Testimony 0-6 (Crab):** Details about cleaning schedules, pool usage, and Orla's care.\n\nNow, focusing on the specific evidence and testimony in question:\n\n**Evidence 1 (Swashbuckler Flyer):** Indicates Sasha wasn't part of the current show.\n**Testimony 3 (Crab):** States that during cleaning, the pool water is drained.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe contradiction arises because if the pool was drained during cleaning, as per Testimony 3, it wouldn't align with the evidence suggesting Sasha was involved in the show (Evidence 1). However, upon closer inspection, the evidence about the pool's state doesn't directly contradict the testimony about Sasha's involvement. Instead, the key contradiction lies elsewhere.\n\nUpon re-examining, the critical point is the timing and access to the pool. Evidence 8 suggests Sasha had access, while Testimony 3 implies she wasn't present during cleaning. This mismatch indicates a contradiction.\n</think>\n\n{\"evidence\": 8, \"testimony\": 3}",

    "response": "The evidence that contradicts Bikini's Testimony 3 is the Weather Data (Evidence 7). Bikini claims that Iris was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner, but the Weather Data describes the events during a snowstorm and cold weather, which would make it unusual for someone to not have additional warm clothing. Additionally, Iris's Hood (Evidence 6) should also be considered because it mentions the hood being received before the lights out bell the night of the crime. Plainly, there is a potential conflict as Iris possibly should have had a hood due to the weather conditions, which is not addressed in Bikini's testimony.\n\n{\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 3}",

However, the Weather Data (Evidence 7) states that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM and the fire started as a result, which contradicts the artistic inspiration that Butz claims in Testimony 3. The described sensation of sketching due to shock and awe would align more closely with the event of the bridge being struck by lightning, contradicting his testimony that his inspiration came from purely seeing Iris \"flying.\" This suggests that Butz's memories or claims may not entirely align with the sequence or nature of events that occurred at that time.\n\n{\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 3}",

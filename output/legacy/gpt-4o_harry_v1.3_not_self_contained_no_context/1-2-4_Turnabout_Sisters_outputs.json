    "response": "The contradiction lies between Redd White's testimony and the available evidence regarding the sequence of events during the murder. Redd White's testimony claims that \"The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged.\" However, Mia's Autopsy Report indicates that death was due to a single blunt force trauma and might have been instantaneous, suggesting that there was no opportunity to dodge an attack and then be struck again. Therefore, this testimony contradicts the evidence provided by Mia's Autopsy Report.\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 3}",

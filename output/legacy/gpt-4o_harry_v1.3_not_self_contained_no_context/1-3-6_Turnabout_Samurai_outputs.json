    "response": "The contradiction lies in Vasquez's testimony that they went to Studio One for a rehearsal because she was fatigued, so Sal drove her, which implies they left the meeting between 2:30 PM and 4:00 PM. However, Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11) blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, meaning they could not have gone to Studio One during that period. Thus, her testimony about going to Studio One during that time contradicts the evidence about the path being blocked.\n\n{\"evidence\": 11, \"testimony\": 3}",

    "response": "To determine which piece of evidence contradicts a testimony, let's examine Vasquez's testimonies along with the provided evidence.\n\nTestimony 3 by Vasquez states: \"The security lady, Oldbag, was quite agitated. Pointing at Powers, saying 'he did it!'\". This testimony suggests that the security lady, known as Oldbag, was convinced that Will Powers was responsible based on her observations at the scene.\n\nHowever, the evidence of Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11) indicates that the path to the scene of the crime was blocked between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. This contradicts the security lady's assertion that she saw Powers heading to the scene, as the path would have been blocked.\n\nThis contradiction suggests that the security lady could not have seen Powers at the scene of the crime at the alleged time, undermining her credibility and Vasquez's testimony about her reaction.\n\nTherefore, the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are: \n\nEvidence: 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head), Testimony 3 (Vasquez's statement about the security lady's observation). \n\n{\"evidence\": 11, \"testimony\": 3}",

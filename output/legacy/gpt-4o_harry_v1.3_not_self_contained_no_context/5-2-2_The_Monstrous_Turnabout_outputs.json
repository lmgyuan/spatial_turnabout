The autopsy report (Evidence 14): It states that Alderman Kyubi's cause of death was being stabbed with a spear and that he was in a drug-induced slumber at the time of death. This makes it unlikely that he was \"jolted awake\" and struck back, as he was under the influence of drugs and effectively unconscious.\n\nTherefore, the testimony that Alderman Kyubi woke up and struck back with a statue contradicts the autopsy report, which indicates that he was asleep due to a drug.\n\n{\"evidence\": 14, \"testimony\": 4}",

He claims he was on guard duty in the foyer at the time of the murder. (Testimony 0)\n2. He claims he was ensuring no one could get to their guest. (Testimony 1)\n3. He claims he was in his office keeping a good watch when the murder happened after 3 PM. (Testimony 2)\n4. He claims he didn't see anything out of the ordinary. (Testimony 3)\n\nIt's mentioned in Testimony 2 that Filch was in his office when the murder happened after 3 PM. However, in Filch's TV Listings (Evidence 13), the \"Temma Town Pro Wrestling\" is circled in red at 3 PM. This suggests that Filch might have been watching TV instead of keeping a good watch, contradicting his claim in Testimony 3 that he didn't see anything out of the ordinary.\n\nThus, the evidence that contradicts the testimony is the TV Listings and Filch's claim of not seeing anything unusual while he was supposedly watching TV.\n\n{\"evidence\": 13, \"testimony\": 3}",

The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "In Testimony 3, Atmey claims to have sent his card 10 days beforehand because he knew the urn was an extremely valuable treasure. However, according to Evidence 5, the DeMasque's Calling Card, it specifically mentions that the speckled urn was not a valuable item, as it states: \"Take good care of the speckled urn, won't you...?\" This suggests the urn was supposedly priceless but had no monetary value, contradicting Atmey's statement that he thought it was extremely valuable. This contradiction between the perception of the urn's value as expressed in the testimony and the nature outlined in the calling card suggests that Atmey's claim may not be genuine.\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 3}",

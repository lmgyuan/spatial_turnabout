    "response": "A contradiction exists between Furio Tigre's testimony where he claims he was about to \"flatten the guy\" when Glen Elg started screaming about winning \"half a million bucks\" (Testimony 3 and 4) and the Victim's Lottery Ticket (Evidence 14). Tigre suggested that Glen Elg screamed in front of him about winning the money; however, the lottery ticket was actually found during a body search of Maggey Byrde, suggesting she wasn't necessarily involved with Glen Elg at the time he supposedly won. This discrepancy suggests that Tigre's account may not be accurate or truthful.\n\n{\"evidence\": 14, \"testimony\": 4}",

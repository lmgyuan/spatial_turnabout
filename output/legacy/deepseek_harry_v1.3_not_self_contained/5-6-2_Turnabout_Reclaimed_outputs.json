You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let's start by looking through the evidence and testimonies to find contradictions. \n\nFirst, let's check the testimonies from Rimes. Testimony 3 says that the orca knows a specific spot where people stand to play volleyball with her. So Orla is trained to target that spot.\n\nNow, looking at the evidence. Evidence 16 is the Skull Rock, which was moved from the show pool. The autopsy report (Evidence 12) mentions the victim died from a brain contusion due to blunt force trauma. The bloodstained coin (Evidence 9) is considered the murder weapon, but the Skull Rock might have been the actual object he hit. \n\nWait, but Rimes' Testimony 4 suggests that Orla knocked down stuff piled up in that spot, hitting the captain. However, Evidence 4, the Whistle, states that Orla can only perform one trick per signal. If someone used the whistle to command her to do a trick, she couldn't have done another action like knocking things over unless there was another signal. But how does that connect to the testimonies?\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and the Whistle's limitation. Testimony 3 implies Orla targets the volleyball spot, which could be a trained behavior. But if the whistle was used, then Orla could only perform one trick. If the murder required her to both knock over something and hit the captain, that would require two commands, which isn't possible with the whistle. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 4, Rimes says Orla knocked down the stuff and hit the captain. But the Whistle (Evidence 4) says she can't perform two tricks at once. So if she was commanded to knock down the stuff (one trick), she couldn't also hit the captain unless that's part of the same trick. Wait, maybe the act of knocking things down and hitting the captain is considered a single action, but the coins (Evidence 9) being the weapon might require a different action. \n\nAlternatively, Evidence 3 (Orla Pool Diagram) mentions Pearls entered the staff corridor. Maybe there's a contradiction with Rimes' testimony about being in the staff room at 10:10 AM (Testimony 0). Wait, but the calendar (Evidence 8) mentions that Pearls and Rimes switched calendars around 10:10. So Rimes' alibi at 10:10 might be contradicted by the calendar switch timing. Hmm, but how does that directly contradict a testimony?\n\nWait, maybe focusing on Testimony 2: Rimes says he saw coins scattered around. But Evidence 9 says there are 300 coins, which weigh 7 pounds. If the coins were the murder weapon, but the autopsy report (Evidence 12) says the cause was blunt force trauma from the skull rock (Evidence 16), then the coins might not be the actual weapon. So Testimony 4 (Orla knocked down stuff and hit the captain with the coins) contradicts the evidence that the real cause was the Skull Rock. But how to link that.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 says Orla knows the volleyball spot. If the Skull Rock was moved from the show pool (Evidence 16), maybe that's where the victim was hit. But Rimes' testimony suggests the coins were involved. So the contradiction might be between Testimony 4 (Orla hit the captain with knocked-down stuff) and the actual cause of death being the Skull Rock, implying the murder weapon wasn't the coins. But which evidence directly contradicts that?\n\nWait, the autopsy report (Evidence 12) says signs of blunt force trauma all over, but the coin is the likely murder weapon (Evidence 9). However, the Skull Rock (Evidence 16) is also a possible cause. But the contradiction here is that if the coins were the weapon, but the autopsy indicates a different object. But this might not be a direct contradiction. Alternatively, the coins being 300 in total, but only one is bloodstained. Maybe that's not enough to cause death.\n\nAlternatively, the security footage (Evidence 5) might show something conflicting with the testimonies. But the details are not clear. \n\nWait, let's go back. The key is to find a testimony that directly contradicts an evidence. For example, if a testimony says \"X happened\" but evidence proves \"X couldn't have happened\".\n\nLooking at Testimony 0: Rimes says he was in the staff room at 10:10 AM. But the calendar (Evidence 8) mentions that Pearls and Rimes switched calendars around 10:10. If Pearls met Rimes at 10:10, then his testimony about being in the staff room would be contradicted. Because if they met, he couldn't be in the staff room. So Evidence 8 (calendar) contradicts Testimony 0. \n\nYes, because in Evidence 8, Pearl says she met Rimes around 10:10 when the calendars were switched, but Rimes claims he was in the staff room at that time. That's a direct contradiction. So the evidence is Evidence 8, testimony 0. \n\nBut let's check the exact details. Pearl says she first went into the prep room at 10:10, which is when she switched calendars. Rimes' Testimony 0 says he was in the staff room at 10:10 AM. If switching the calendars required them to meet, then Rimes couldn't be in two places at once. Therefore, Evidence 8 (the calendar switch at 10:10) contradicts Testimony 0 (Rimes was in the staff room at 10:10). \n\nSo the answer would be evidence 8 and testimony 0.\n\n{\"evidence\": 8, \"testimony\": 0}",

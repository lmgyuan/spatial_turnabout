Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 8 from Mr. Redd White states, "The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!" This suggests that the victim ran to the left during the attack.

However, Evidence 9, which is May's Testimony, states, "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." This directly contradicts Mr. White's testimony by indicating that the victim ran to the right, not the left.

These two accounts of the victim's actions are in direct contradiction with each other.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony from White states in Testimony 6: "You see? You hit her twice!" This suggests that Mia was struck twice during the incident.

However, Evidence 5, "Mia's Autopsy Report," specifies: "Time of death: 9/5 at 9:00 PM. Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous."

The autopsy report clearly indicates that Mia was only struck once, as the cause of death was a "single blunt force trauma," contradicting the testimony that she was hit twice.

Therefore, the contradiction lies between:

- Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report)
- Testimony 6 (White's statement about being hit twice)

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 6}
******************************
Let's examine the evidence and testimonies to identify any contradictions.

**Evidence 5, Mia's Autopsy Report:**
- States that the time of death was at 9:00 PM, caused by a single blunt force trauma. It mentions that the death was instantaneous.

**Testimony 2:**
- White claims, "Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!"

If Mia died instantly from a single blow, as stated in the autopsy report, she could not have run anywhere afterward. This directly contradicts White's claim that Mia ran to the left after being struck.

Thus, the contradiction exists between the Autopsy Report and White's testimony stating that Mia ran after being attacked.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "That is when I saw this glass light stand."

Evidence 2 describes the "Glass Shards" as the broken remains of a glass light stand, and Evidence 3 is the receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder.

Given that the glass light stand was purchased only the day before the murder, it's impossible for White to have seen the stand a week before during his visit to place the wiretap.

Therefore, Testimony 3 given by White is contradicted by the evidence related to the glass light stand.

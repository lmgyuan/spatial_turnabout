Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 1 states, "The meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00." However, Evidence 11, which is "Mr. Monkey's Head," states that it "blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM."

If the path was blocked during that time, then the claim in Testimony 2 that there was a meeting followed by moving to Studio One seems suspicious around the time of the crime, which took place at 2:30 PM per the "Jack's Autopsy Report" and "Samurai Spear" evidence, implying that no one could have immediately gone to Studio One through the blocked path without breaking during 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.

The contradiction here is that "Mr. Monkey's Head" blocking the path negates any claim of moving to Studio One through that path immediately after the meeting during the stated hours.

******************************
To identify which evidence and testimony contradict each other, we need to carefully analyze the information related to the time of death, the murder weapon, and the testimony involving the sequence of events.

1. **Review of Key Evidences:**
   - **Evidence 3: Jack's Autopsy Report** states that the "Time of death: 10/15 at 2:30 PM."
   - **Evidence 6: Samurai Spear** is noted as the murder weapon.
   - **Evidence 11: Mr. Monkey's Head** blocked the path to the crime scene between "2:15 PM and 4:00 PM."

2. **Review of Testimonies:**
   - **Testimony 0:** Vasquez states she "was with Sal and Oldbag when they found the body."
   - **Testimony 2:** Vasquez claims "I immediately called the police. Then Powers showed up."
   - **Testimony 5:** Vasquez insists, "I went back to the trailer to get my script and direction notes."

3. **Key Contradiction:**
   - **Testimony 0 and Evidence 11:** Vasquez claims she was with others when they found the body, but the path to the crime scene (Mr. Monkey's Head) was blocked from 2:15 PM onward. If the time of death is 2:30 PM, they couldn't have discovered the body unless they had been there prior to the crime scene being blocked.
   - Additionally, if Vasquez returned essentially after the discovery (Testimony 5) and was involved in the immediate aftermath (Testimony 0 and 2), the timeline clashes with Mr. Monkey's Head blocking the path from 2:15 PM.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The contradiction primarily lies between the testimony where Vasquez claims to have discovered the body and the object evidence that shows the path was blocked during the crucial time frame.

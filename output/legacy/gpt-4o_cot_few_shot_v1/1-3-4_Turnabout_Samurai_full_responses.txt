Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Cody testifies (in Testimony 6) that he witnessed the Steel Samurai and "right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!" He then also insists (in Testimony 7) that the Steel Samurai "took him down" in front of him. The implication from Cody's testimonies is that he witnessed a fight scene between the Steel Samurai and the "bad guy", Jack Hammer dressed in his Evil Magistrate costume, at the studio.

However, Evidence 11, Mr. Monkey's Head, states that the path to the scene of the crime was blocked between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, suggesting that Cody could not have witnessed any events occurring at Studio One during that time window, which is when the murder took place (as per Evidence 3, Jack's Autopsy Report).

Given that the time of death in Jack's Autopsy Report was 2:30 PM and considering the block from Mr. Monkey's Head, Codyâ€™s testimony claiming he witnessed the battle must be false or misrepresented, as it should not have been possible to witness the event if the path was impassable.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em." This indicates that Cody took pictures but claims to have erased them later.

However, Evidence 14, "Path to Glory," contains photos of every victory scene in every battle the Steel Samurai has won, suggesting that Cody actually kept these photos.

This contradiction implies that Cody still has the photos, contrary to his testimony that he erased them.

Analyzing the evidence and testimonies:

1. Testimony 3 states, "The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back." This implies that the victim, Dr. Grey, did not resist or make any defensive moves during the incident.

2. Evidence 8, "Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report," reveals that Dr. Grey was both stabbed in the chest and then shot in the forehead at point-blank range. The presence of both a stabbing and a shooting suggests that the victim was likely involved in some type of struggle before the fatal shot. The report further shows gunpowder residue, indicating a close-range shot.

The autopsy details contradict the testimony stating that the victim did not fight back, as the combination of stabbing and shooting implies a confrontation of some sort. Thus, Testimony 3 and Evidence 8 are at odds with each other.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Gumshoe's testimonies describe the sequence of events during the crime involving Dr. Grey and Maya Fey. 

- Testimony 3 claims, "The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed."

Now, let's review the relevant evidence:

- Evidence 9, "Pistol," states that it was Grey's murder weapon and that "Two shots fired" with Maya's and Grey's fingerprints on it.

- Evidence 8, "Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report," states that Dr. Grey was "shot in the forehead at point-blank" after being stabbed.

The contradiction is that Gumshoe's Testimony 3 indicates the shot was a miss, but the autopsy report confirms Dr. Grey was hit with a shot at point-blank range. Therefore, these points contradict each other.

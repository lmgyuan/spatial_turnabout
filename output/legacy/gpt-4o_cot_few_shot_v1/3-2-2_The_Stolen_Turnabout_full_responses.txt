Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided to determine which evidence and testimony contradict each other.

Testimony 3 by Gumshoe states, "His pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces."

Evidence 4, the description of the Sacred Urn, states, "Supposedly priceless, but has no monetary value."

This means the Sacred Urn, which was the target in the case involving Mask☆DeMasque, does not align with the pattern described in Testimony 3 where Mask☆DeMasque supposedly targets only the most precious art pieces. Thus, there is a contradiction between Testimony 3 and the evidence of the Sacred Urn's true value.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 2 states, "Just as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!" This implies that Atmey was struck at 1:00 AM by his account.

Evidence 6, "Shichishito," states that Mask☆DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime with a blow to the back of the head. This is consistent with Atmey being struck.

However, Evidence 15, "Kane's Autopsy Report," states that Kane Bullard died due to "cerebral hemorrhaging from blunt trauma to the head" at "1 AM." Kane Bullard died at the same time Atmey claims he was struck, which is a contradiction. Atmey could not have been struck at the exact same moment, especially considering he claims to have been unconscious and unable to notify the police until 30 minutes later, contradicting his story of immediate pursuit of Mask☆DeMasque.

Thus, the contradiction lies between Testimony 2 and Evidence 15, as they indicate two different events occurring simultaneously, both with head trauma, challenging Atmey's timeline.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 by Luke Atmey states, "I put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye." This implies he was hit in the forehead.

However, Evidence 6, which is the Shichishito, states, "DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime with a blow to the back of the head."

There's a contradiction here as Atmey claims he was struck in the front on his "third eye" (forehead), yet the evidence states he was hit on the back of the head.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 5}

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 by Ron states, "As for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!" However, Evidence 14, which describes "DeMasque's Broach," says it was "found in the shadow of Ami Fey's statue," suggesting that the broach was not snagged on a door handle as Ron claimed, but rather torn off during a struggle near the statue.

Thus, Testimony 5 contradicts Evidence 14.

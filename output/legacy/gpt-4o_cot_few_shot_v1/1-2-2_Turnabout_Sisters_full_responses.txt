Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!", implying that Mia Fey wrote "Maya" before dying. However, Evidence 5, which is "Mia's Autopsy Report," indicates that Mia's death was instantaneous due to a "single blunt force trauma." This implies that she could not have written anything after the attack because she died instantly.

Therefore, Testimony 5 contradicts Evidence 5.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 1 states, "The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right." This statement implies that the victim had the ability to move or dodge after the initial attack. However, Evidence 5, which is "Mia's Autopsy Report," states that the cause of death was "single blunt force trauma" and that the death was instantaneous. This means that the victim could not have dodged or moved after being struck, as she died immediately from a single blow.

Therefore, Testimony 1 contradicts Evidence 5.

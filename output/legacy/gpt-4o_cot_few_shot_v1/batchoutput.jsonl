The camera is actually set to take pictures when it hears a loud noise (as described in Evidence 2), but Lotta's testimony claims that the purpose was to capture pictures of a meteor shower, which wouldn't correlate because the act of photographing shooting stars wouldn't typically involve capturing loud noises. This discrepancy suggests that either Lotta misunderstood how her equipment worked or deliberately gave an inaccurate statement to mislead regarding the events surrounding the murder.\n\nLet's finalize this discrepancy in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}\n```", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3069, "completion_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 3262, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_de57b65c90"}}, "error": null}

Evidence 30 describes a bellboy's uniform that was worn by De Killer, indicating that De Killer disguised himself as a bellboy. This direct link suggests the bellboy (De Killer) was indeed tied to the crime scene.\n\nHowever, if Powers believed the bellboy was empty-handed when leaving Corrida's room, but Evidence 18 suggests the bellboy (actually De Killer in disguise) would likely have taken or left something significant like the Picture Card found next to the victim, there is no direct contradiction.

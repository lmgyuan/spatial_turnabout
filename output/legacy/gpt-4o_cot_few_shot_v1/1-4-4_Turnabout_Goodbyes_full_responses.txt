Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "So after I heard that single gunshot I went home." This implies that the witness, Larry Butz, heard only one gunshot.

However, Evidence 11, "Lotta's Deposition," states, "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25." This suggests there were two gunshots heard that night, contradicting Larry Butz's claim of hearing only one gunshot.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 from Larry Butz states, "Just when she said 'Hey! It's almost Christmas!' I heard the gunshot!" This implies that the gunshot was heard just before midnight on Christmas Eve, December 24th.

However, Evidence 3, "Robert's Autopsy Report," indicates the time of death is sometime on the 24th or 25th, but coupled with Evidence 11, "Lotta's Deposition," which mentions hearing the sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25, it corroborates that the crucial event occurred after the time Butz specifies.

Therefore, if the gunshot sounds were confirmed to be at 12:15 AM on December 25th by the "Lake Photo" (Evidence 4), it contradicts Butz's timeline of hearing the gunshot just before Christmas as claimed in the testimony.

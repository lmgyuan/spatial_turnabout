Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "At last, I held the urn in my hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th." This implies that Luke Atmey handled the Sacred Urn himself at 1 AM, which coincides with the timing of the theft.

Let's consider the evidence:

- Evidence 5, "DeMasque's Calling Card," states the heist was intended for the speckled urn. 
- Evidence 9, "Security Camera Photo," would corroborate the time if it shows activity matching the Testimony.

However, Evidence 15, "Kane's Autopsy Report," indicates the time of death was at 1 AM, and considering that Kane Bullard was dead at KB Security, it would have been impossible for Atmey to also be stealing the urn from the Treasures Exhibit at the same time, suggesting Atmey's duplicity in coordinating two events to frame Ron DeLite, who was at KB Security.

Here, the contradiction lies in the timing, as Atmey claims he held the urn at the exact time that the murder occurred elsewhere.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 0 states, "I, Luke Atmey, had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever." However, the evidence suggests otherwise. Evidence 10, which is the "Blackmail Letter," was found in Ron DeLite's room and was written by Kane Bullard. It implies that there was a connection between Kane Bullard and Ron DeLite, and since at the same time Mask DeMasque (Luke Atmey's "alter ego") was involved in a blackmailing scheme, it suggests that Atmey has indirectly been in contact with Bullard in relation to these criminal activities.

Thus, Testimony 0 from Atmey contradicts the implication from the blackmail evidence that Atmey and Bullard had some level of interaction through their interconnected circumstances.

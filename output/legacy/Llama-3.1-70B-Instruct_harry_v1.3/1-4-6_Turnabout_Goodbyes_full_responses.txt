Evidence 21 (DL-6 Bullet) and Testimony 5 (A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 21 states that the bullet taken from Gregory Edgeworth's heart still bears clear ballistic markings, which implies that the bullet was fired from the gun that killed Gregory Edgeworth. However, Testimony 5 claims that there was only a single gunshot, which contradicts the fact that the DL-6 Case File (Evidence 18) states that the murder weapon was fired twice.

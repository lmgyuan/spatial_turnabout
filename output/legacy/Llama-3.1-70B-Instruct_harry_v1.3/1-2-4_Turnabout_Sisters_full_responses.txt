Evidence 8 (Floor Plans) and Testimony 7 (The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!) and Testimony 8 (The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!) seem to be related, but they do not directly contradict each other.

However, a pair that does contradict each other is Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 9 (Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...). Evidence 5 states that the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma and that death was instantaneous. However, Testimony 9 describes a sequence of events where the victim runs away, the attacker gives chase, and then there is a "terrible impaction". This sequence of events contradicts the instantaneous death described in Evidence 5.

Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 2 (And then you hit her, savagely! That is what I saw) and Testimony 4 (You chased her, and delivered the final blow) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 5 states that the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma and that death was instantaneous. However, Testimonies 2 and 4 describe a sequence of events where the victim is hit twice, once savagely and then again for the final blow. This sequence of events contradicts the single blunt force trauma described in Evidence 5.

Evidence 8 (Floor Plans) and Testimony 1 (A light stand was lying on the floor when I looked) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 8 states that the stand is blocked from view looking from the office. However, Testimony 1 claims that White saw the light stand lying on the floor when he looked at the other window. This implies that White was able to see the stand, which contradicts the fact that it is blocked from view.

Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 3 (That is when I saw this glass light stand) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 2 states that the glass light stand is broken beyond all recognition, which implies that it was already broken at the time of the investigation. However, Testimony 3 claims that White saw the glass light stand intact when he entered the Fey & Co. Law Offices to place the wiretap, which was the week before the murder. This implies that the glass light stand was not broken at that time, which contradicts the fact that it was already broken beyond all recognition.

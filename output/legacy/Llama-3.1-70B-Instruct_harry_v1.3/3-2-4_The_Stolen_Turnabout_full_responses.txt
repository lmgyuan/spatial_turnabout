Evidence 5 (DeMasque's Calling Card) and Testimony 3 (I knew it was an extremely valuable treasure, so I sent my card 10 days beforehand) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 5 states that DeMasque's calling card was sent to the security at Lordly Tailor, warning them that he would be coming to steal the Sacred Urn. However, Testimony 3 claims that Atmey sent his card 10 days beforehand, which contradicts the fact that DeMasque's calling card was sent to the security at Lordly Tailor, suggesting that Atmey may not have been the one who sent the card.

Evidence 10 (Blackmail Letter) and Testimony 2 (It was Mr. Bullard who wrote the blackmail letter and sent it to Ron DeLite) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 10 states that the blackmail letter was written with a fountain pen and found in Ron's room, which implies that the letter was sent to Ron by someone else. However, Testimony 2 claims that Mr. Bullard wrote the blackmail letter and sent it to Ron DeLite, which contradicts the fact that the letter was found in Ron's room, suggesting that Ron may have written the letter himself.

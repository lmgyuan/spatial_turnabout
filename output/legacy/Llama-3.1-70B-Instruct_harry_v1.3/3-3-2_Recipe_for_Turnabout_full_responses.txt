Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 5 (And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 12 states that there are some pieces of paper near the coffee table, which implies that there may have been something else at the crime scene. However, Testimony 5 claims that there was nothing else missing from the crime scene, which contradicts the fact that there are pieces of paper visible in the crime photo.

Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) and Testimony 0 (The young man was reading the sports paper) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 3 states that the sports paper has a doodle of 'MC Bomber' with an arrow pointing to '100,000' that was crossed out, which implies that the paper was not just being read, but was also being used to write on. However, Testimony 0 claims that the young man was simply reading the sports paper, which contradicts the fact that the paper has a doodle on it.

Evidence 19 (Millionaire Radio Flyer) and Testimony 2 (The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 19 states that the Millionaire Radio show is broadcast every Monday at 1:30 PM, which implies that the show was likely being broadcast at the time of the incident. However, Testimony 2 claims that the young man was listening to the wireless, which contradicts the fact that the radio show was likely being broadcast, suggesting that the young man may have been listening to something else.

Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 3 (It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 12 states that the crime photo shows an intact vase on each table, which implies that the vase was not broken. However, Testimony 3 claims that the vase was knocked over and broke, which contradicts the fact that the vase is intact in the crime photo.

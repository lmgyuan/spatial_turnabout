Evidence 15 (Max G. Bust) and Testimony 2 (However, lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 15 states that the Max G. Bust is a bronze statue that looks rather heavy, which implies that it would be difficult to lift. However, Testimony 2 claims that Acro says it would be impossible for him to lift the bust and look out of the window, but earlier in Testimony 0, Acro says that he could have lifted something the size of the bust. This contradiction suggests that Acro may be downplaying his abilities.

However, the main contradiction is between Evidence 15 and Testimony 1 (I have a strong upper body from working as an acrobat, and only my legs were injured). This implies that Acro's upper body is strong enough to lift the bust, which contradicts the fact that the bust is described as looking rather heavy.

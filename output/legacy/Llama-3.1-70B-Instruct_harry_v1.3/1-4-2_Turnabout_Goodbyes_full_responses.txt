Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) and Testimony 0 (I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!) seem to contradict each other.

Testimony 0 claims that Lotta saw Edgeworth on the boat, but Evidence 2 states that Lotta's camera was set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected and faces the lake, which implies that Lotta was not actually present on the boat to see Edgeworth.

Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) and Testimony 3 (The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 2 states that the camera was set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected, but Testimony 3 claims that the camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower, which implies that it was not set to take pictures of loud noises.

Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) and Testimony 5 (When I heard the "bang" I looked right straight out at that lake) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 2 states that the camera was set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected, but Testimony 5 claims that Lotta looked straight out at the lake when she heard the "bang", which implies that she was actively observing the lake, not just relying on the camera to take a picture.

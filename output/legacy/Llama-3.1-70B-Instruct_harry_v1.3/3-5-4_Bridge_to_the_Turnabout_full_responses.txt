Evidence 5 (Photo of Elise) and Testimony 1 (I saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff!) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 5 states that the photo of Elise shows her wearing a white robe and a hood, and holding a book and a staff. However, Testimony 1 claims that Mystic Elise struck Mystic Maya with her staff, which contradicts the fact that the photo shows Elise holding a book and a staff, not using it to strike someone.

Evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) and Testimony 0 (Mystic Maya stumbled briefly after being hit over the head with the staff...) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 6 states that Iris's Hood is a magical hood said to offer protection from evil spirits. However, Testimony 0 claims that Mystic Maya was hit over the head with the staff, which contradicts the fact that Iris's Hood offers protection from evil spirits, suggesting that the hood may not have been effective in protecting Mystic Maya.

Evidence 7 (Weather Data) and Testimony 6 (By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 7 states that it was snowing from 7 to approximately 10:50 PM, and lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45. However, Testimony 6 claims that the snow had already stopped by the time the murder took place, which contradicts the fact that it was still snowing at 10:45.

Evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) and Testimony 4 (I could see a man behind my attacker by the light of the stone lantern) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 6 states that Iris's Hood is a magical hood said to offer protection from evil spirits. However, Testimony 4 claims that Maya could see a man behind her attacker by the light of the stone lantern, which contradicts the fact that the lantern was not lit the night of the crime, as stated in Evidence 20.

Evidence 20 (Stone Lantern) and Testimony 4 (And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 20 states that the Stone Lantern was not lit the night of the crime. However, Testimony 4 claims that the torches were lit, which contradicts the fact that the Stone Lantern was not lit, suggesting that the lantern may have been lit.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 3}
Evidence 20 (Stone Lantern) and Testimony 3 (That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 20 states that the Stone Lantern was not lit the night of the crime. However, Testimony 3 claims that Godot found Pearly, and the testimony implies that the lantern was lit, as it mentions Godot cheering Pearly up. This contradicts the fact that the lantern was not lit, suggesting that the lantern may have been lit.

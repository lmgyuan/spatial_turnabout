Evidence 5 (Powers'(?) Photo) and Testimony 6 (Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM) and Testimony 7 (It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 5 is a photo of the Steel Samurai taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios at 2:00 PM. However, Testimonies 6 and 7 claim that Powers was seen walking towards the studio at 2:00 PM, which implies that Powers was not wearing the Steel Samurai costume at that time. This contradicts the fact that the photo shows the Steel Samurai at 2:00 PM.

Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head) and Testimony 2 (No one else went there!) and Testimony 3 (If they had, I would have seen them!) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 11 states that Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, which implies that it was not possible for Oldbag to see everyone who went to the studio. However, Testimonies 2 and 3 claim that Oldbag would have seen anyone who went to the studio, which contradicts the fact that Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path.

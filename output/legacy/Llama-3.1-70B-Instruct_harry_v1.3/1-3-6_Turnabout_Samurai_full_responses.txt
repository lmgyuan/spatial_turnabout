Evidence 18 (Van) and Testimony 3 (I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me) seem to contradict each other.

Testimony 3 claims that Vasquez was fatigued and had Sal take her, which implies that Vasquez was not in a state to move around on her own. However, Evidence 18 states that Manella used the van to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer, which implies that Vasquez was able to get into the van and travel to Studio One.

However, the main contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer) and Evidence 16 (Steak Plate). Testimony 5 claims that Vasquez and Sal ate t-bone steaks in front of the trailer, but Evidence 16 states that the steak plate was found in the employee area, which is not in front of the trailer.

Evidence 10 (Script) and Testimony 7 (I knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so I left them behind) seem to contradict each other.

Testimony 7 claims that Vasquez left the action scenes behind because Hammer was injured and couldn't do them. However, Evidence 10 states that the script for Episode 13 was found, which implies that the action scenes were still present in the script.

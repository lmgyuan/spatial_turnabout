Evidence 15 (Cody's Camera) and Testimony 8 (If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 15 states that Cody always carries his camera with him, though he's still learning how to use it. However, Testimony 8 claims that Cody did not have his camera with him at the time of the Steel Samurai rehearsal, which contradicts the fact that he always carries it.

Evidence 15 (Cody's Camera) and Testimony 2 (So I held up my camera to take a picture!) and Testimony 3 (But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 15 states that Cody's camera is a new digital camera that he always carries with him, though he's still learning how to use it. However, Testimonies 2 and 3 claim that Cody tried to take a picture with his camera, but the lens wouldn't open in time, which implies that he was unable to use the camera. However, this is not the main contradiction.

The main contradiction is that Cody said he erased the photos he took (Testimony 5), but earlier he said he missed the shot because the lens wouldn't open in time (Testimony 3). If he missed the shot, then there would be no photos to erase.

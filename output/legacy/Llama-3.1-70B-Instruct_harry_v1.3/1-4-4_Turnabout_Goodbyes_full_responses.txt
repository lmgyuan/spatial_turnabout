Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition) and Testimony 5 (So after I heard that single gunshot I went home) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 11 states that Lotta heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25, but Testimony 5 claims that Butz heard a single gunshot, which contradicts Lotta's testimony.

Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) and Testimony 3 (But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 2 states that Lotta's camera was set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected, which implies that the camera would have taken a picture of the boat on the lake when the gunshot was fired. However, Testimony 3 claims that Butz heard the gunshot, but did not see the boat, which contradicts the fact that the camera would have taken a picture of the boat.

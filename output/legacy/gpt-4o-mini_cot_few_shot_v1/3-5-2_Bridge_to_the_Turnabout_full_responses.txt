Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 3 states, "Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner," suggesting that Iris did not change her clothing during that time. However, Evidence 6, which is "Iris's Hood," states it was "received before the lights out bell the night of the crime," indicating that Iris was likely seen wearing the hood around that time. This raises questions about Iris's whereabouts and attire when the crime occurred.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 5 states, "The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window." However, Evidence 11, which is "Elise's Autopsy Report," states that the time of death was between 10 - 11 PM due to a stab wound, and it indicates that she was already dead before she fell. This means that the stabbing could not have occurred after she was pushed, as she had already been killed.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 5 states, "And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!" However, Evidence 11, which is "Elise's Autopsy Report," indicates that the cause of death was "loss of blood from stab in back," suggesting she was indeed stabbed in the back. Testimony 5 contradicts the context since Bikini does not explicitly see the act happening but claims she saw Ami doing it after fainting, leading to confusion about how she could witness that moment at all given her earlier admission of fainting. This raises the question of whether she truly observed the stabbing or is misremembering the order of events.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 0 states, "I saw the murder at around 11 PM..." However, Evidence 11, which is "Elise's Autopsy Report," states that the time of death was between 10 - 11 PM, which implies that if Bikini saw the murder at exactly 11 PM, it contradicts the time of death noted in the autopsy report, indicating she could not have witnessed it after it had already occurred.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 0 states, "I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM..." However, Evidence 11, which is "Elise's Autopsy Report," states that the time of death was between 10 PM and 11 PM. If Butz went to the shack at 9 PM, his timeline does not account for the time of death occurring shortly after 10 PM, suggesting he could not have arrived there if he had also witnessed the death happening right before that.

Testimony 2 states, "I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!" which implies that Iris was present in a significant manner during the time of the incident. However, Evidence 12, Iris's Testimony, claims that she "rang lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room until the murder was discovered", contradicting the assertion that she was flying at the time of the crime.

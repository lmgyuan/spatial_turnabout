Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 1 states, "I saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff!" However, Evidence 11, which is "Elise's Autopsy Report," states that the time of death was between "10 - 11 PM" with the cause being "loss of blood from stab in back," implying that Elise was already dead at the time of the alleged attack. Thus, this testimony contradicts the evidence as Elise could not have struck anyone after her death.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 3 states, "That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!" However, Evidence 11, which is "Elise's Autopsy Report," indicates that the cause of death was from a stab in the back, but does not clarify who delivered the fatal blow. This creates ambiguity because if Maya was supposedly in a confrontation with Elise, we need to ascertain whether she indeed stabbed her from the back, contradicting the claim made in Testimony 3.

Thus, this inconsistency suggests that while Iris is asserting Maya's involvement in the stabbing directly, the evidence does not clearly corroborate this claim, leading to uncertainty regarding the actual events during the murder.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 6 states, "... by the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped." However, Evidence 7, which is "Weather Data," indicates that it was snowing until approximately 10:50 PM and a lightning strike occurred shortly before the timeframe of the murder, suggesting that the snow was still falling during that time.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 0 states, "I was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened." However, Evidence 11, which is "Elise's Autopsy Report," states that the time of death was between 10 - 11 PM, and the murder was discovered shortly after. This timing contradiction raises questions about Maya's presence and actions at that moment, as she mentions no delay or any events that could align her passing through the garden with the time of the attack.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 4 states, "And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too." However, Evidence 20, which is "Stone Lantern," states, "Was not lit the night of the crime," implying that the snow around the stone lantern would not have been cleaned up, as it suggests an absence of activity around the lantern during the critical time.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 4}
******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 0 from Maya states, "Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night!" suggesting that Pearly, presumably Pearl Fey, was present at the Inner Temple when the murder occurred. However, Evidence 12 – "Iris's Testimony" – states that Iris rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room until the murder was discovered, implying there was no one else at the Inner Temple during that time. This creates a contradiction as Maya's statement implies Pearly was present when Iris's testimony suggests otherwise.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 5 states, "A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream." However, Evidence 3 indicates that Robert's Autopsy Report shows he died from "one bullet shot to the heart" sometime on the "24th or 25th," which implies that the gunshot could not have occurred from the events described by Edgeworth if it correlates with the timing of the murder.

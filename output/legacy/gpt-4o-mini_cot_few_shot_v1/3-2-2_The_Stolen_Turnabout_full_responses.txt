Testimony 2 states that "This was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor", suggesting that this crime is consistent with Mask☆DeMasque's known pattern. However, Evidence 10 indicates that the Blackmail Letter found in Ron's room was written by Bullard, which implies that the overall scenario may not align with the M.O. of Mask☆DeMasque as a carefree thief, indicating a contradiction.

Testimony 0 states, "It was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed." However, Evidence 15, which is "Kane's Autopsy Report," indicates the time of death was at 1 AM on October 12, implying that it is the same timeframe Atmey describes but doesn't account for Atmey being attacked around that time, marking him as a suspect or contradicting his timeline.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 0 states, "Indeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment." However, Evidence 19, which is "Buzzer Record," indicates that the buzzer went off once at 1:02 AM, suggesting someone might have been at the door when Atmey looked away. This creates a contradiction regarding the timeline and the presence of the thief.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 2 states, "I don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all!" However, Evidence 7, which is "Camera Data," states that the warehouse camera went off at around 1 AM on the night of the crime, implying that there is at least some recorded activity around that time that could contradict Ron's lack of an alibi.

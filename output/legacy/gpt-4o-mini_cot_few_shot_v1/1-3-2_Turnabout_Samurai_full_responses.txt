Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 5 states, "Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?" This is consistent with the timeline. However, Testimony 6 follows up with, "Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM," which seems to imply that a man (specifically, Powers as indicated in Testimony 7) was seen heading towards the studio before the murder was supposed to occur. Given that the murder happens at 2:30 PM and Powers is seen heading toward the area 30 minutes prior suggests he may not have had the opportunity unless he was at the location the whole time without being noticed or was seen later than stated.

This creates ambiguity in how Oldbag is tracking the timeline and Powers' movements, hinting at a contradiction in her observation about Powers' presence at the scene of the crime relative to the actual timing of the murder based on the timelines.

Therefore, the contradiction lies in the timelines and testimonies related to Powers' presence just before the murder.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 1 states, "The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!" This contradicts Evidence 5, which indicates that a photo was taken at 2:00 PM showing the Steel Samurai dragging one leg, implying that someone else could have been at the scene before the time mentioned by the witness.

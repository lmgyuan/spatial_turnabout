Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 7 states, "The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!" implying that Maya was running from the scene after the incident. However, Evidence 5 states that "Mia's Autopsy Report" shows the time of death was at 9:00 PM, indicating that Mia was already dead and could not have been running away. This contradiction suggests that White's testimony cannot be true, as Mia would not have been alive to run away from anything.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 4 states, "You chased her, and delivered the final blow." However, Evidence 5 states that Mia died from "single blunt force trauma," which implies she was hit once, not multiple times as suggested by Testimony 4. Thus, the testimony contradicts the evidence regarding the number of blows.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 3 states, "The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged." However, Evidence 5, which is "Mia's Autopsy Report," states the cause of death was a "single blunt force trauma," indicating that Mia did not have the opportunity to dodge the attack if it was instantaneous death.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 3 states, "That is when I saw this glass light stand," referring to the time he entered the Fey & Co. Law Offices to place the wiretap. However, Evidence 2, which is "Glass Shards," indicates that the glass light stand was broken beyond all recognition, suggesting that the witness, White, could not have seen it intact.

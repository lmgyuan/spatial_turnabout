Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 2 states, "As you can see, it's covered in blood." However, Evidence 11, which is "Maya's Costume," describes it as having blood splatters and a bullet hole in the sleeve, but not all of it is covered in blood as implied by Testimony 2. This suggests a contradiction regarding the extent of blood on the costume.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 4 states, "the defendant then picked up on the opening and took the victim's gun, and ended it..." This suggests that the defendant took the gun from the victim. However, Evidence 9, which is "Pistol," states that it belongs to the victim (Dr. Grey) and bears both Maya's and Grey's fingerprints, implying that the gun was not solely in the victim's control at the time of the murder. The implication of possession and use of the gun contradicts the scenario presented in Testimony 4.

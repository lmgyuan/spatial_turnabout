Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 0 states, "I entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon." However, according to Testimony 1, "The meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00." This implies that if Vasquez entered the trailer before noon, she could not have entered "before noon" if the meeting was scheduled to start precisely at noon, contradicting her statement.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 1 states, "The assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent," implying that Will Powers was not present at the scene. However, Evidence 5, "Powers'(?) Photo," indicates that a photo was taken at the scene at 2:00 PM when Powers was dragging one leg, implying he was indeed there.

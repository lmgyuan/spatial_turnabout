Testimony 0 states, \"I was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened.\" However, Evidence 11, which is \"Elise's Autopsy Report,\" states that the time of death was between 10 - 11 PM, and the murder was discovered shortly after. This timing contradiction raises questions about Maya's presence and actions at that moment, as she mentions no delay or any events that could align her passing through the garden with the time of the attack. \n\n{\"evidence\": 11, \"testimony\": 0}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3460, "completion_tokens": 127, "total_tokens": 3587, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_27322b4e16"}}, "error": null}

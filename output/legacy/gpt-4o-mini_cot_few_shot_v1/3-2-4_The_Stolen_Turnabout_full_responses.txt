Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 5 states, "At last, I held the urn in my hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th." However, Evidence 15, which is "Kane's Autopsy Report," confirms that the time of death was "10/12 at 1 AM," indicating that Kane was deceased at that time and could not have been present to secure the urn as Atmey claims. This contradiction suggests that Atmey's testimony about holding the urn cannot be true.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 0 states, "I, Luke Atmey, had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever.‚Äù However, Evidence 15, which is "Kane's Autopsy Report," indicates that there was an assault leading to the victim's death, implying some interaction or contact was present during the incident. This contradiction suggests that Atmey's claim of having no contact with the victim is false.

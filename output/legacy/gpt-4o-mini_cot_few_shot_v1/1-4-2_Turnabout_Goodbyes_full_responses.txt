Testimony 0 states, "I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!" However, Evidence 10, which is "Pistol," states that the pistol bears prints from Edgeworth's right hand, implying he was handling the weapon, which contradicts the assertion that he was on the boat where the shooting occurred without arousing suspicion. This creates ambiguity regarding Edgeworth being the shooter.

Testimony 4 states, "When I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars." This contradicts Evidence 2, which states that Lotta's Camera is set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected, indicating that she should have been capturing the event rather than looking through binoculars at that time. This inconsistency suggests that her testimony cannot be true as it implies she was not using her camera when she should have been.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 7 states, "Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot." However, Evidence 3, which is "Robert's Autopsy Report," indicates that Robert was shot and died on the 24th or 25th from a bullet shot to the heart. This implies that Robert could not have been shot again after that time frame, contradicting Lotta's statement of hearing another gunshot after the time of death.

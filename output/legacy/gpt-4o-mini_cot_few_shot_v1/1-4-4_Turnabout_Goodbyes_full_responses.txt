Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 5 states, "So after I heard that single gunshot I went home." However, Evidence 11, which is "Lotta's Deposition," states, "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25," indicating that there were two sounds and not just a single gunshot, contradicting Butz's testimony.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 5 states, "Just when she said 'Hey! It's almost Christmas!' I heard the gunshot!" This implies that the gunshot was heard just before Christmas. However, Evidence 4, which is "Lake Photo," indicates that a photo was automatically taken at 12:15 AM on 12/25, confirming that the gunshot occurred after Christmas had begun. This contradiction in timing implies that the testimony does not align with the evidence.

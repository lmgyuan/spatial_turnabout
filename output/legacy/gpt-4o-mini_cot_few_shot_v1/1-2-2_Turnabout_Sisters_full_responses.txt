Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 2 states, "On it, the word 'Maya' was written clearly in blood!" However, Evidence 5, which is "Mia's Autopsy Report," states that the cause of death was a "single blunt force trauma" and that her death was "instantaneous," implying that she could not have written anything after being struck. This contradiction between the testimony and the evidence suggests that the witness might be mistaken.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 1 states, "The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right." However, Evidence 5, which is "Mia's Autopsy Report," states that the cause of death was a "single blunt force trauma" suggesting that the victim, Mia, did not evade the attack successfully, contradicting April's testimony.

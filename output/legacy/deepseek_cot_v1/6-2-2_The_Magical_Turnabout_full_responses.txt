Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So I need to look through all the testimonies and see which one is contradicted by one of the evidences.

Looking at the testimonies first. The testimonies are from Ema. Let's go through them one by one.

Testimony 0: The victim planned revenge on Troupe Gramarye during Trucy's show. That seems to align with some of the evidence like the Gramarye Notebook and the poster about Mr. Reus being ousted. Maybe not conflicting here.

Testimony 1: Mr. Reus was going to steal the Gramarye notebook from the defendant (probably Trucy). Evidence 5 is the Gramarye Notebook. But then in Testimony 3, Ema says that the victim did steal the notebook. Wait, but Evidence 3 mentions fingerprints from Betty and Bonny on the top. Hmm. Wait, maybe the notebook's status?

Wait, let's check Testimony 3: "He did, in fact, steal the notebook..." So according to Ema, the victim stole the notebook. But looking at Evidence 5: the notebook's description says it's the Troupe Gramarye creed written inside. Is there any evidence indicating that the notebook was stolen? Or maybe the fact that the fingerprints on the notebook are from Betty and Bonny, but not Trucy. Wait, but if the victim (Mr. Reus) stole it, his fingerprints should be on it. But the fingerprinting results (Evidence 3) mention the victim's prints, along with Bonny and Betty's. Wait, no. Wait, Evidence 3 is about the fingerprints on the "top"—but wait, which object? Let me check again. Evidence 3 is "Fingerprinting Results: In addition to prints from the victim and Bonny, Betty de Famme's fingerprints were found on the top. There is no fingerprint evidence for Trucy Wright, however."

Wait, the "top"—the top of what? Maybe the top of the coffin mentioned in Evidence 2? Or another item. Wait, maybe the evidence is referring to the top of the tape? Wait, but the testimonies include Testimony 5: "The defendant's prints were on the tape. I guess she must've moved it during the show." But Evidence 3's fingerprint results include the victim, Bonny, and Betty, but not Trucy. So if the defendant (Trucy) had her prints on the tape according to Testimony 5, but Evidence 3 says no fingerprints for Trucy. That's a contradiction. Because Testimony 5 says Trucy's prints were on the tape (so she must have moved it), but Evidence 3 states that there's no fingerprint evidence for Trucy. That would directly contradict each other. 

Wait, but Testimony 5 says the defendant's prints were on the tape. If the defendant is Trucy, then Evidence 3 says her prints weren't found. So that's a contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 3. But let me confirm:

Testimony 5: Ema claims the defendant (Trucy) has prints on the tape. But Evidence 3 (Fingerprinting Results) says there's no fingerprint evidence for Trucy. So if the tape is part of the evidence where fingerprints were checked, this is a contradiction. 

Alternatively, maybe the "top" in Evidence 3 refers to the top of the coffin? Then the tape's fingerprints would be a separate item. But perhaps the "tape" in Testimony 5 refers to the same item where the fingerprints were checked. If the tape had Trucy's prints according to the testimony, but the evidence says no, then that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says "the tape"—maybe the murder weapon or another piece of evidence. But if the fingerprints on the tape are supposed to be Trucy's, but the results don't show hers, that's a contradiction.

So the contradiction would be between Testimony 5 (defendant's prints on the tape) and Evidence 3 (no Trucy's fingerprints found). So the answer would be Evidence 3 and Testimony 5.

Wait, but let me check again. Testimony 5 is "The defendant's prints were on the tape. I guess she must've moved it during the show." So according to Ema, the defendant (Trucy) has prints on the tape, implying she handled it. But Evidence 3 says that on the "top" (maybe the top of the coffin or another object), the fingerprints found are victim, Bonny, Betty, but not Trucy. If the "tape" mentioned in Testimony 5 is part of the same item where fingerprints were checked (like the top of the coffin), then this is a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the tape refers to something else, like the video tape (Evidence 12?), but that's a disc. Wait, the "tape" in Testimony 5 could be the murder weapon or another item. Wait, let's check other evidences. Evidence 14 (Autopsy Report) says the victim's blood is on the murder weapon. Evidence 2 (Crime Photo) mentions blood in the coffin's holes. The Sword Stand (Evidence 10) has the rubber sword. The Fire Bucket (Evidence 4) is empty and dusty.

But perhaps the "tape" refers to adhesive tape used in the crime? Or maybe it's part of the stage setup. If the testimony says Trucy's prints are on the tape, but the fingerprint results don't show hers, then that's a contradiction. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 3 and Testimony 5. 

Another possible contradiction could be Testimony 4, which claims the defendant murdered the victim before he could reveal the secrets. But Evidence 15 says the prank plan script (by Roger Retinz) included the corpse appearing and set piece falling as staged. So maybe the murder wasn't part of the plan, suggesting someone else did it. But that's more about who the murderer is, not a direct contradiction between testimony and evidence.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 4: Ema says the defendant murdered him before he could reveal the secrets. But Evidence 6 (poster) says Mr. Reus was ousted 13 years ago due to an injury. Maybe that's not a direct contradiction. 

Another angle: Testimony 3 says the victim did steal the notebook. But if the notebook's fingerprints include the victim's, then that supports that he stole it. But Evidence 3's fingerprint results are about the "top"—maybe the notebook's fingerprints are different. Wait, no. Evidence 3 is about the top of something else. Wait, the description of Evidence 3 is: "In addition to prints from the victim and Bonny, Betty de Famme's fingerprints were found on the top. There is no fingerprint evidence for Trucy Wright, however." The "top" here is unclear. Maybe the top of the coffin from Evidence 2? So if the victim's fingerprints are on the top, maybe that supports he was there. But how does that contradict any testimony?

Alternatively, the Show Script (Evidence 7) mentions the fire trick was canceled, and the script says to make sure the fire bucket is ready. But the Fire Bucket (Evidence 4) was empty and dusty, which contradicts the script's instruction, but that's evidence to evidence, not testimony.

Wait, Testimony 0-4 are about the victim's plan to get revenge by stealing the notebook and revealing tricks, but he was killed before revealing. However, Evidence 15 (Prank Plan Script) says that the corpse appearing was staged by Roger Retinz, implying that maybe the murder was part of a prank, but that's conflicting with the idea that Trucy actually murdered him. But Testimony 4 says the defendant did it. So perhaps the contradiction here is that if the corpse appearing was staged, then maybe the murder didn't happen, but the autopsy report confirms the death. So maybe that's not a direct contradiction with the testimony.

Wait, the prank plan script (Evidence 15) is about the corpse appearing and the set piece falling being staged by Retinz. But the autopsy report (14) confirms the victim was actually murdered. So Retinz's prank was supposed to stage a fake corpse, but the real murder happened. So that might not contradict Testimony 4 directly.

Going back to the Testimony 5 and Evidence 3. Testimony 5 claims Trucy's prints are on the tape, but Evidence 3 says there are no fingerprints from Trucy. So if the tape was part of the evidence checked in Evidence 3, that's a direct contradiction. Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 3 and Testimony 5.

====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to find one pair where the evidence contradicts the testimony.

First, let me go through each testimony and check if any evidence directly contradicts what's being said. 

Looking at the testimonies:

Testimony 0: Betty says she had business in the understage passage because of the upcoming trick. Evidence 1 is a stage diagram that includes the understage passage. Not sure if that's a contradiction yet.

Testimony 3: Bonny mentions that the fire trick was in the script, and she wanted to see it but couldn't because of the accident. Let me check the evidence related to the script. Evidence 7 is the Show Script. The script says the fire trick was canceled due to the incident. Wait, if the script had the fire trick but it was canceled, then Bonny's statement that it was in the script might still be true. But the contradiction could be that the script actually says the fire trick was canceled. Wait, Evidence 7's description says "the fire trick was canceled due to the incident." So if Bonny says the fire trick was in the script and she wanted to see it but couldn't because of the accident, that aligns. Because the script originally had it but was canceled. Hmm, maybe not a contradiction here.

Wait, but Testimony 1: Bonny says "It was the fire trick, right? The one Mr. Reus was supposed to do?" Then Testimony 3: Bonny says "It was in the script... I really wanted to see it... but couldn't because of the accident." But according to Evidence 7, the script says the fire trick was canceled. Wait, does that mean the script originally had the fire trick, but after the incident, it was canceled? So Bonny is saying that the fire trick was in the script (which it was), but due to the accident (the incident), it was canceled. That seems consistent. Maybe not a contradiction here.

What else? Let's look at other testimonies. Testimony 5: Bonny says she was way too busy to have the chance to kill Mr. Reus. But maybe some evidence shows she had the opportunity. Let's check. Evidence 3 is the fingerprinting results. It says Betty's fingerprints were found on the top, along with the victim and Bonny. But Trucy's prints aren't there. If Bonny's prints are present, that might imply she was there. But her testimony says she was too busy. Hmm, maybe not a direct contradiction here.

Looking at Evidence 15: Prank Plan Script, which says the corpse and set piece falling were staged by Roger Retinz. Maybe that contradicts someone's testimony about the accident being real. But which testimony? Let's check. Testimony 3 mentions the accident, but if the accident was part of the prank, then that's a contradiction. Wait, the prank plan is by Retinz, so maybe the accident wasn't real. But Testimony 3 refers to the accident preventing the fire trick from happening. If the accident was staged, then perhaps the fire trick wasn't actually canceled, but that's part of the prank. Hmm, not sure. Need to cross-reference.

Evidence 16: Trucy's Note. The note says "Bonny, Get the video camera after Mr. Reus comes tumbling out." The signature matches Trucy's contract. But if the note is a forgery, maybe. But Bonny's testimony might not address this directly.

Wait, Evidence 4 is the Fire Bucket, which was supposed to be ready but was empty and dusty. The script (Evidence 7) mentions making sure the fire bucket is ready. If the fire bucket wasn't prepared, that contradicts someone's testimony about being prepared. Let's see. Testimony 2: Betty says "That's right. It's a very dangerous trick, so I had to make sure we were prepared for it." But the fire bucket was empty and dusty (Evidence 4), which shows they weren't prepared. So Betty's Testimony 2 (saying they were prepared) is contradicted by Evidence 4 (the empty fire bucket). That seems like a contradiction.

So, Testimony 2 by Betty claims they were prepared for the dangerous fire trick, but Evidence 4 shows the fire bucket was empty and dusty, indicating they were not prepared. That's a contradiction. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 4 and Testimony 2.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to identify one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, I'll review the testimonies given by Gumshoe. There are five testimonies (Testimony 0 to 4). Let me go through each one and see what they claim.

Testimony 0: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man. That's just the time of the report, so maybe check if any evidence mentions the time conflicting with this. The victim's time of death is between 1:30 and 2:30 PM (Evidence 10), so the report time is after the possible death time. Not sure if that's a contradiction yet.

Testimony 1: Maggey passed out from shock. This is more about her state, maybe emotional. Not sure if evidence contradicts this directly.

Testimony 2: The victim didn't have any ID. But Evidence 14 says the victim's lottery ticket was found on Maggey during a search. Wait, but the lottery ticket is the victim's? So the victim didn't have ID on him (as per Testimony 2), but his lottery ticket was found on Maggey. But how does that contradict? Maybe if the lottery ticket is considered identification, but the testimony says no ID was found on the victim. The ticket was found on Maggey, not the victim. So maybe Testimony 2 is accurate because the victim didn't have ID, but the lottery ticket (Evidence 14) is his, but found on Maggey. Hmm, that might not be a direct contradiction.

Testimony 3: They figured out the victim's identity quickly. Evidence 2 is a magazine clipping about the case where the client was found guilty, but not sure. Maybe Glen's calendar (Evidence 20) mentions a meeting with "The Tiger" (Furio Tigre), which could link to Tender Lender. But how does that affect the identity? The autopsy report (Evidence 10) gives time of death, but not ID. Maybe the victim's autopsy report would have his name if they identified him through other means. The testimony says they figured it out quickly. If the victim had no ID, maybe they used other evidence. Not sure if any evidence contradicts that.

Testimony 4: When Maggey was searched, they found the lottery ticket and poison. So the testimony says they found the poison (Evidence 16) and lottery ticket (14) on her. But Evidence 4 mentions job listings thrown away by the old man. Not sure. Wait, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Now looking at the evidences. Let's look for something that conflicts with the testimonies. Testimony 5 from Gumshoe says "And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene." Wait, but Evidence 1 (Maya's Magatama) was recovered in the kitchen. If the Magatama was recovered there, but wasn't part of the initial investigation, perhaps it's something missing? Wait, the Magatama is on loan from Maya and was recovered in the kitchen. But Testimony 5 says nothing else was missing. If the Magatama was found in the kitchen, but not mentioned in the evidence collected, maybe that's a contradiction. But I need to check.

Alternatively, Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) says he broke the vase at his seat. But in the Crime Photo (Evidence 12), there are two vases, each on the tables. If Victor broke his vase, then the photo should show a broken vase. But the photo description says "intact vase on each table." So that's a contradiction. Wait, Victor's Testimony (18) says he broke the vase at his seat. But the Crime Photo (12) shows both vases intact. So that would mean that Testimony 18 (Victor's statement) contradicts Evidence 12. However, Testimony 18 is from Victor, not Gumshoe. The testimonies listed here are only from Gumshoe (Testimonies 0-4). Wait, the Testimonies section lists five testimonies, all from Gumshoe. So Testimony 18 is not part of these. Therefore, the user's provided testimonies are only 0-4 from Gumshoe.

Wait, in the Testimonies section, the user lists Testimony 0 to 4, all from Gumshoe. The other testimonies (like Victor's) are under Evidences. So in the testimonies we need to check, they're only the five by Gumshoe.

So back to Testimony 5 (if there is one). Wait, the user lists Testimony 0 to 4. Testimony 4 is about finding the lottery ticket and poison. Then Testimony 5: "And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene." So according to Testimony 5, nothing else was missing. But Evidence 1 is Maya's Magatama, which was recovered in the kitchen. If the Magatama was in the kitchen but wasn't part of the initial evidence collected by the police, that might indicate something was missing. But since the Magatama was recovered there, maybe the police didn't find it, implying something was missing from the crime scene.

Alternatively, Evidence 14 (Victim's Lottery Ticket) was found on Maggey. The victim's lottery ticket should have been in the victim's possession. If Maggey had it, then it's possible that the ticket was taken from the victim, implying something was missing from the crime scene. But Testimony 5 says nothing else was missing. Therefore, the lottery ticket being found on Maggey would mean it was missing from the victim's belongings, contradicting Testimony 5.

So Testimony 5 (which is Testimony 4 in the list, as the user's testimonies go up to 4?), wait the user's list is:

Testimonies:
Testimony 0: Gumshoe
Testimony 1: Gumshoe
Testimony 2: Gumshoe
Testimony 3: Gumshoe
Testimony 4: Gumshoe
Testimony 5: Gumshoe (but in the user's input, it's listed up to Testimony 4. Wait, looking back:

Wait, the user's input under Testimonies lists:

Testimony 0
Person: Gumshoe

Testimony 1
Person: Gumshoe

Testimony 2
Person: Gumshoe

Testimony 3
Person: Gumshoe

Testimony 4
Person: Gumshoe

Testimony 5
Person: Gumshoe

Wait, the user's input has Testimony 0 to Testimony 5, all from Gumshoe. Let me check again.

Wait, in the user's input, under Testimonies:

Testimony 0
Testimony: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.
Person: Gumshoe

Testimony 1
Testimony: Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.
Person: Gumshoe

Testimony 2
Testimony: The victim didn't have any identification on him.
Person: Gumshoe

Testimony 3
Testimony: But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.
Person: Gumshoe

Testimony 4
Testimony: When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.
Person: Gumshoe

Testimony 5
Testimony: And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.
Person: Gumshoe

Wait, the user lists six testimonies (0-5), all from Gumshoe. So Testimony 5 is the one stating nothing else was missing. Now, if the victim's lottery ticket (Evidence 14) was found on Maggey, that suggests that the ticket was taken from the crime scene (the victim's possession) and thus was missing. But Testimony 5 says nothing was missing. Therefore, Evidence 14 (Victim's Lottery Ticket found on Maggey) contradicts Testimony 5 (nothing missing). Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 5.

Alternatively, the victim's prescription bag (Evidence 17) is empty. The victim was supposed to have ear medicine (Evidence 6 is the small bottle, which was the victim's ear medicine found in the kitchen). The prescription bag is empty. So if the victim had a prescription bag that was empty, but the ear medicine was found in the kitchen, perhaps that suggests that the medicine was moved, which would mean something was taken from the crime scene, thus contradicting Testimony 5. But the ear medicine's fingerprints are covered in unidentified ones, and it's in the kitchen. So if the medicine was supposed to be in the prescription bag (which is empty), then the medicine being in the kitchen would mean it was moved, implying something was missing from the victim's belongings. However, the testimony says nothing was missing from the crime scene. So that could be a contradiction between Evidence 17 (empty prescription bag) and Testimony 5.

But let's focus on the lottery ticket. The lottery ticket is Evidence 14: found during a body search of Maggey. The victim's lottery ticket should have been on him. If it was found on Maggey, that implies it was taken from the victim, so the ticket was missing from the victim's belongings, hence the crime scene. Therefore, Testimony 5 (nothing missing) is contradicted by Evidence 14 (ticket found on Maggey). So the pair would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 5.

Another possibility: Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) says he broke the vase. But in the Crime Photo (Evidence 12), the vases are intact. That's a contradiction, but Victor's testimony isn't part of the testimonies provided here (since all testimonies are from Gumshoe). So that's not applicable here.

Another angle: Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) has a doodle 'MC Bomber' pointing to 100,000 crossed out. Maybe that's related to the virus program (Evidence 23) found at Tender Lender. But how does that relate to Gumshoe's testimonies?

Alternatively, Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) is the victim's ear medicine found in the kitchen with unidentified fingerprints. The victim's prescription bag (Evidence 17) is empty. So the bottle should have been in the bag. If it's found in the kitchen, then it was moved, hence missing from the victim's belongings. Testimony 5 says nothing was missing. So Evidence 17 and 6 contradict Testimony 5. But the key is which pair to choose.

Alternatively, the victim's autopsy report (Evidence 10) states time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. Testimony 0 says the crime was reported at 2:25 PM. If the victim died at 2:30 PM, then the report at 2:25 PM would be before the time of death. But that's possible if the death happened around that time. Not necessarily a contradiction.

Another thought: Testimony 4 says that when Maggey was searched, they found the lottery ticket and poison. But Evidence 16 (Potassium Cyanide) is in her apron pocket. Evidence 14 (lottery ticket) found on her. So that aligns. So Testimony 4 is supported by Evidence 14 and 16.

But Testimony 5 (nothing else missing) would be contradicted by Evidence 14 if the lottery ticket was supposed to be with the victim. Since the ticket was found on Maggey, it implies it was taken from the victim, hence missing from the crime scene. Therefore, Testimony 5 says nothing was missing, but the ticket was taken, so contradiction.

So the answer would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 5.

But let me check the numbers. The user lists Evidence 0 to 27. Testimony 0 to 5. So Testimony 5 is index 5, and Evidence 14 is index 14. Therefore, {"evidence": 14, "testimony":5}.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 5}
Alright, let's tackle this problem. We need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies provided. Let's go through the testimonies and cross-check them with the evidence.

Starting with the testimonies from Kudo (Testimony 0 to 6). Testimony 1 and 2 are about Maggey putting white powder in the victim's coffee. The Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) mentions that the coffee had potassium cyanide, which matches the powder. But then, Evidence 16 says the potassium cyanide was found in Maggey's apron with her fingerprints. Wait, but if she put the powder in the coffee, her fingerprints would be on the cyanide container. However, Testimony 2 says she put the powder "conspicuously" into the coffee. But the evidence shows the cyanide was in her apron. Maybe the contradiction is here? Let me check.

Wait, Evidence 13 says the coffee cup has both the victim and Maggey's fingerprints. That makes sense if she served it. But the cyanide was in her apron. How did she put the powder in the coffee if the cyanide was still in her apron? Unless she used the cyanide from the apron, but then why is there still cyanide in her pocket? Or maybe the real killer planted it there. Hmm, that's possible. But the question is about contradiction between testimony and evidence.

Looking at Testimony 5: Kudo mentions the apron's straps were loose. Evidence 15 (Apron) says the apron has small pockets but big stains. If the straps were loose, maybe the pockets were accessible. But the cyanide was found in the pocket. Wait, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Testimony 6 says there wasn't anything that caught his interest when he saw her from the front. However, Testimony 5 mentions a ribbon in her hair and loose apron straps. So if he noticed those details, that contradicts Testimony 6. But that's between testimonies, not evidence.

Wait, let's look at Testimony 1: Kudo says Maggey brought the victim a javaccino and put something in it. Evidence 13 (Coffee Cup) has the victim and Maggey's fingerprints. But the Coffee Cup's description also mentions a lip stain on the front and a floral handle to the right. If the victim drank from the cup, his lip stain would be there. However, the Coffee Cup's handle is on the right, which suggests the cup was positioned in a certain way. Wait, maybe the position of the cup when served versus how it was found?

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) which has a doodle 'MC Bomber' and '100,000' crossed out. Testimony 0 says Kudo was reading the sports paper. But the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) was left by a customer on Dec 3rd. If Kudo was reading it, maybe he's the one who left it. But how does that contradict?

Wait, Testimony 0 says "The young man was reading the sports paper." The person is Kudo. But the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) was left by a customer on Dec 3rd. If Kudo was reading it, maybe he's the one who left it. However, the doodle on the paper is related to 'MC Bomber', which is linked to Evidence 23 (MC Bomber disc at Tender Lender). Maybe there's a connection there. But where's the contradiction?

Another angle: Testimony 4 says Kudo identifies Maggey as the serving girl. But Evidence 15 (Apron) and the fact that Maggey's fingerprints are on the cup and cyanide. But if the apron's straps were loose (Testimony 5), maybe someone else could have accessed the pockets. However, that's speculation.

Wait, Testimony 2 states that Kudo saw Maggey put white powder in the coffee. But Evidence 16 says the cyanide was found in her apron pocket with her fingerprints. If she used the cyanide to poison the coffee, the container would have been used up or at least have some residue missing. But the fact that the cyanide was still in her pocket with her prints might suggest she didn't use it, contradicting the testimony that she put it in the coffee. Alternatively, if she did put the powder in the coffee, the container should have been empty or partially empty. But the evidence says the small bottle (Evidence 6) was the victim's ear medicine. Wait, no. Evidence 16 is the Potassium Cyanide in her apron. So if she used some of the cyanide to poison the coffee, the bottle would still be in her pocket with her prints. But Testimony 2 says she put the powder in the coffee. The presence of the cyanide in her pocket could imply she didn't use it, but maybe the real killer planted it. However, the question is about a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, look at the Coffee Cup's description: the handle is on the right. If the coffee was served with the handle on the right, then when the victim drinks, the lip stain should be on the side opposite the handle. But the cup's description says the lip stain is on the front, and the handle is to the right. Depending on how the cup was oriented when served, maybe the lip stain's position contradicts how someone would drink from it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about Testimony 5: Kudo mentions the apron's straps were loose. Evidence 15 says the apron has small pockets. If the straps were loose, maybe the pockets were more accessible. But that's not a contradiction.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 1 and 2 say Maggey put something in the coffee. The Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has Maggey's fingerprints, which supports that. However, the Potassium Cyanide (Evidence 16) in her pocket has her prints. But if she used the cyanide, she would have had to handle it, so her prints being there makes sense. So maybe no contradiction here.

Looking at Testimony 3: "The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed." The Autopsy Report (Evidence 10) says death was due to potassium cyanide, which acts quickly. So that's consistent.

Hmm, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let's check Evidence 14: Victim's Lottery Ticket found on Maggey. If she's innocent, how did she get it? But that's a motive, not a contradiction with testimony.

Wait, Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony): He broke the vase at his seat. But looking at the Crime Photo (Evidence 12), there are two vases on each table, both intact. Wait, no, Evidence 12 says in the crime photo, there are two tables separated by a folding screen. The victim's table has a knocked-over coffee cup, but the vases on both tables are intact. However, Victor's Testimony (Testimony 18) says he broke the vase at his seat. But in the Crime Photo, the vases are intact. So that's a contradiction between Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony) and Evidence 12 (Crime Photo). However, the user's testimonies provided are only Testimony 0-6 by Kudo. Wait, the Testimonies listed here are Testimony 0 to 6, all by Kudo. Wait, the user provided Testimonies as Testimony 0 to 6, all by Kudo. The other testimonies like Victor's are listed under Evidence 18. Wait, looking back:

Wait, the user listed Testimonies as:

Testimonies:
Testimony 0
Testimony: The young man was reading the sports paper.
Person: Kudo

Testimony 1
Testimony: The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!
Person: Kudo

Testimony 2
Testimony: There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.
Person: Kudo

Testimony 3
Testimony: The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.
Person: Kudo

Testimony 4
Testimony: That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!
Person: Kudo

Testimony 5
Testimony: There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.
Person: Kudo

Testimony 6
Testimony: There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.
Person: Kudo

So all testimonies here are by Kudo. The other testimonies like Victor's are part of the evidences (Evidence 18). So we need to check contradictions between Kudo's testimonies (0-6) and the evidences (0-27).

Let's look at Testimony 5 and 6. Testimony 5 says Maggey had a ribbon and loose apron straps. Testimony 6 says there was nothing interesting when he saw her from the front. But noticing a ribbon and loose straps would be interesting details, contradicting Testimony 6. But this is between testimonies, not evidence. The problem asks for a contradiction between evidence and testimony.

Let's check Testimony 2: Kudo claims Maggey put white powder in the coffee. The Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has Maggey's fingerprints, which supports that. But the Potassium Cyanide (Evidence 16) in her apron has her prints. However, the presence of the cyanide in her apron with prints doesn't necessarily contradict the testimony unless there's evidence she couldn't have done it. Alternatively, maybe the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is the victim's ear medicine, but it has unidentified fingerprints. If the poison was in the Small Bottle, but Evidence 16 says the cyanide was in Maggey's apron. Hmm.

Wait, the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is described as the victim's ear medicine with unidentified fingerprints. But the Potassium Cyanide (Evidence 16) is a different item. So the actual poison used was in the coffee cup, which had cyanide. The Small Bottle is unrelated. So maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Wait, Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) has a doodle mentioning 'MC Bomber' and '100,000' crossed out. Testimony 0 says Kudo was reading the sports paper. If the sports paper in evidence was left by a customer on Dec 3rd, and Kudo was reading it, then he must have been the customer who left it. But the description of Evidence 3 says it was left by a customer on Dec 3rd. So if Kudo was reading it, that's consistent. Not a contradiction.

Wait, looking at Testimony 6: Kudo says there wasn't anything that caught his interest about her when he saw her from the front. But Evidence 15 (Apron) has big stains. If the apron had big stains, that would be noticeable from the front, contradicting Testimony 6. So if Kudo claims he didn't notice anything interesting about her from the front, but her apron had big stains, which should be noticeable, that's a contradiction. So Evidence 15 (Apron with big stains) contradicts Testimony 6 (nothing caught his interest from the front). That seems like a solid contradiction.

{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 6}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and we need to find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts a statement in the testimony.

First, let's understand the testimonies. Testimony 3 by Kudo says: "Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino." The key points here are the mention of a "javaccino" being brought by Maggey, the waitress.

Now, looking at the evidence related to the coffee. Evidence 13 is the Coffee Cup, which contained potassium cyanide. The description mentions that the cup has a floral handle on the right and a lip stain on the front. Importantly, the cup is described as a coffee cup, not a javaccino. Javaccino might be a specific type of coffee drink, perhaps a cappuccino variant. However, the main contradiction here might be about how the coffee was served or presented.

Wait, but Testimony 3 says the serving girl (Maggey) brought the javaccino. However, the evidence related to the Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) describes it as a regular coffee cup. But where is the contradiction here? Maybe if there's evidence that the victim couldn't have ordered a javaccino, or if the cup in evidence doesn't match what a javaccino would use. Alternatively, maybe the timing or the way the coffee was served contradicts something else.

Another angle: looking at the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) which mentions a doodle about 'MC Bomber' and the date is December 3rd, the day of the incident. The testimony is about the serving of the javaccino. Hmm, not sure how that connects.

Alternatively, Testimony 4 by Kudo says the victim picked up the cup with his free hand (since he had a newspaper in his right hand, according to Testimony 1). The Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) mentions that when facing the cup, the lip stain is on the front and the handle is to the right. If the victim used his free hand (left hand, assuming the right hand was holding the newspaper), then the handle being on the right would mean he'd have to use his right hand to hold it comfortably. But if he was holding the newspaper in his right, he would use his left hand to pick up the cup. If the handle is on the right side, that might be awkward for a left-handed grip, possibly leading to the cup being turned, which could affect the lip stain's position. However, this might be a stretch. 

Wait, the Coffee Cup's description says the lip stain is on the front when facing the cup, with the handle to the right. If the victim was left-handed, the handle on the right would be natural. But if the victim used his left hand to pick up the cup, the lip stain would be on the side where his lips touched. But Testimony 4 says he used his free hand (left, if right was holding the newspaper), which would align with the handle being on the right. So maybe that's not a contradiction.

Another possible contradiction: The Coffee Cup's fingerprints include Maggey's and the victim's. But Testimony 3 says Maggey brought the javaccino, which would explain her fingerprints. However, the presence of the poison in the coffee (Evidence 13) with Maggey's fingerprints on the cyanide (Evidence 16) in her apron might suggest she handled it. But that's more of a connection than a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is in the vase mentioned in the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) and Victor's Testimony (Testimony 18). Victor's Testimony 18 says he broke the vase at his seat during the incident. But the Crime Photo shows two vases, each on the tables, and both are intact. Wait, no—the Crime Photo description says "There is an intact vase on each table." But Victor's testimony says he broke the vase. So if the photo was taken after the incident, and the vase is intact, that contradicts his statement. But looking at the testimonies provided here, the Testimony 18 is from Victor, not Kudo. However, the user is asking for a pair among the provided testimonies (Testimony 0-4 by Kudo) and the evidences. So maybe that's not the right path.

Wait, let's check the Testimonies again. The Testimony in question here is Testimony 3 by Kudo: bringing the javaccino. The evidence that might contradict this is the Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) if the cup doesn't match what a javaccino would use. For example, a javaccino might typically be served in a different type of cup, like a tall glass or a mug, but Evidence 13 describes a coffee cup with a handle. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the lip stain and the handle's position contradicts how the victim would have held it if he was using his left hand. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, looking at the Sports Paper (Evidence 3). The doodle mentions 'MC Bomber' and '100,000' crossed out. The victim's lottery ticket (Evidence 14) is a winning ticket for half a million dollars. Maybe the 100,000 crossed out relates to the lottery, but not directly conflicting with a testimony.

Wait, Testimony 2 by Kudo says the young man (victim) was listening to the wireless. The Millionaire Radio Flyer (Evidence 19) mentions a radio program every Monday at 1:30 PM. The time of death is between 1:30 and 2:30 PM (Evidence 10). If the victim was listening to the radio at the time, maybe the program mentioned in Evidence 19 was what he was listening to. But how does that contradict?

Alternatively, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 10) states time of death between 1:30-2:30 PM. The Radio Flyer (Evidence 19) is at 1:30 PM every Monday. If the incident happened on Dec 3rd, which was a Monday (since the Radio Flyer is every Monday), then the victim could have been listening to the radio program at 1:30 PM. But how does that contradict any testimony?

Wait, Testimony 3 says that Maggey brought the javaccino. If the coffee cup (Evidence 13) was the murder weapon with cyanide, and Maggey's fingerprints are on it, that supports her involvement. But maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let's consider the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) which has a doodle of 'MC Bomber' with 100,000 crossed out, and 'Ahahahaha'. The victim's calendar (Evidence 20) says he was supposed to meet "The Tiger", which is Furio Tigre (Character 10). The MC Bomber is a virus (Evidence 23), found at Tender Lender. If the victim was involved with Tigre, maybe the MC Bomber was part of a scheme. But how does this relate to the testimonies?

Alternatively, looking at the Lunch Special (Evidence 5) which is Trés Bien's lunch that tastes bad. The victim had a prescription bag (Evidence 17) which is empty. If the victim took medication before going to Trés Bien, perhaps the poison was in the medicine, but the autopsy says potassium cyanide in the coffee. So maybe the empty prescription bag is a red herring.

Wait, the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is the victim's ear medicine, found in the kitchen with fingerprints. If the victim needed ear medicine, perhaps he couldn't hear well, contradicting Testimony 2 where he was listening to the wireless. But Testimony 2 says he was listening to the wireless, so if he had ear issues, maybe he couldn't, but that's not a direct contradiction unless the medicine affects hearing. The description of the Small Bottle says it's ear medicine, so maybe the victim had ear problems, making it hard to listen to the radio. That could contradict Testimony 2 where Kudo says the victim was listening to the wireless. If the victim had ear issues, he might not be able to hear the radio, making Kudo's testimony false. Therefore, Evidence 6 (Small Bottle - ear medicine) contradicts Testimony 2 (victim listening to wireless).

But is there a more direct contradiction? Let me verify. Evidence 6 is the victim's ear medicine. If he needed ear medicine, perhaps he had an ear infection or hearing loss, making it unlikely he was listening to the radio. Testimony 2 says he was listening to the wireless. So the contradiction is that if he had ear problems requiring medicine, he wouldn't be able to listen to the radio, thus Kudo's testimony is a lie or mistake. That seems plausible.

Another angle: The Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has a lip stain on the front and a handle to the right. Testimony 4 says the victim picked up the cup with his free hand (left hand, since he was holding the newspaper in his right). If the handle is on the right, using the left hand would require reaching across, which might be awkward. The lip stain's position might indicate which side the victim drank from. If the handle is on the right, a right-handed person would naturally hold it with the right hand, causing the lip stain to be on the left side. But the description says the lip stain is on the front when facing the cup, so perhaps the orientation is such that regardless of the hand used, the lip stain would be front. But this is speculative. Maybe this isn't a strong contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) with the doodle 'MC Bomber' and '100,000' crossed out. The victim's lottery ticket (Evidence 14) is for half a million. The crossed-out 100,000 could relate to a different amount, but I'm not sure how that contradicts testimony.

Going back to the earlier thought about the ear medicine and Testimony 2. The Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is the victim's ear medicine. If he needed to use ear medicine, perhaps he had impaired hearing, making it unlikely he was listening to the wireless (radio). Therefore, Testimony 2 by Kudo, which states the victim was listening to the wireless, would contradict Evidence 6. That seems like a valid contradiction.

So the pair would be Evidence 6 and Testimony 2. Let me check again:

Evidence 6: Small Bottle. Victim's ear medicine. If the victim had ear issues, he might not be able to listen to the radio. Testimony 2: Kudo says the victim was listening to the wireless. Contradiction here is that the victim's ear condition would prevent him from doing so, making Kudo's testimony false or mistaken.

Therefore, the answer should be {"evidence": 6, "testimony": 2}.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 2}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to find one pair where the evidence and testimony don't match up.

First, I'll go through the testimonies. Testimony 0 is from Kudo, but he says he's not sure. Testimony 1: He mentions the victim slumping after sipping javaccino. Testimony 2: He says the clumsy idiot (maybe referring to someone else) knocked over the vase. Testimony 3: The vase broke and the tablecloth got soaked. Testimony 4 is more of a taunt, so maybe not relevant.

Looking at the evidence, maybe something related to the vase. Let's check. Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony where he says he broke the vase at his seat. But in Testimony 2, Kudo says "the clumsy idiot upset the vase" implying someone else did it. Wait, but Victor is the one who actually broke the vase according to his own testimony (Evidence 18). However, Testimony 2 and 3 are from Kudo, talking about the vase being broken. Wait, if Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) says he broke the vase, but Kudo's Testimony 2 and 3 describe the vase being broken by someone else. Wait, but maybe the contradiction is between Kudo's testimony and another piece of evidence.

Wait, let's check the Crime Photo (Evidence 12). The photo shows two vases, each on a table, both intact. But according to Testimony 2 and 3, the vase was broken. So the photo shows intact vases, but the testimony says the vase was broken. That would be a contradiction. But wait, in Evidence 18, Victor's Testimony says he broke the vase. So maybe the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows the vases as intact, but according to the testimonies (Testimony 2 and 3) and Victor's own testimony (Evidence 18), the vase was broken. Therefore, the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) contradicts Testimony 2 or 3. Let me check the exact details of the Crime Photo. The description says "an intact vase on each table." But according to the testimonies, the vase was broken. So the photo shows intact vases, which contradicts the testimony that the vase was broken. Therefore, Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) contradicts Testimony 2 or 3. Testimony 3 says the vase broke and the cloth got soaked. The photo shows intact vases, which means that the vase wasn't broken. So the contradiction is between Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 3. But wait, the testimonies are from Kudo. Testimony 2: "Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over." Testimony 3: "It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!" But the Crime Photo shows the vases intact. That's a direct contradiction. So the pair would be Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 3. But Evidence 12 is the Crime Photo, which is photo evidence that the vases are intact. But Kudo's Testimony 3 says the vase broke. That's a clear contradiction. So the answer would be {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3}.

Wait, but another possibility: Let me check the other evidences. For example, the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) has a doodle about 'MC Bomber' and some numbers. Testimony 4 is Kudo's "How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm?" Not sure. Another angle: The victim's autopsy (Evidence 10) says time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. The Millionaire Radio Flyer (Evidence 19) mentions 1:30 PM on Mondays. Maybe not directly conflicting with a testimony. Let's check again. The key contradiction is the vase's status in the Crime Photo versus the testimonies. So yes, Evidence 12 (Crime Photo showing intact vases) contradicts Testimony 3 (which says the vase broke and the cloth was soaked). That's the correct pair.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3}

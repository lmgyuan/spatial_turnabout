Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair, so I have to look through all the evidence and testimonies to spot a contradiction.

First, let's recap the testimonies. Testimony 0 to 4 are all from Ihmus. Testimony 4 says that Ihmus saw the accused stab the high priest with a dagger. But let's check the evidence for contradictions.

Looking at Evidence 1, the Rites Guide. It describes the Purification Rite, which includes the Rite of Water where the priestess (Lady Kee'ra) enters the spring, and the high priest purifies her and the dagger. Then, during the Rite of Fire, they circle the flames. The curtain (Evidence 4) is closed during the rite, isolating the sanctum. Also, Evidence 15, the Inner Sanctum Diagram, shows where Maya and the high priest were. 

Wait, Evidence 8 is Maya's statement that when she and the high priest arrived at the Inner Sanctum, the water was already red. That suggests the stabbing happened before they arrived, but the testimony says Ihmus saw the stabbing during the rite. Maybe there's a timing issue here.

But the main contradiction might be about visibility. Testimony 3 says Ihmus used binoculars to spy on the rite. However, Evidence 4 is the Ritual Curtain that isolates the sanctum during the rite. If the curtain was closed, Ihmus couldn't have seen inside. So Testimony 3 and 4 (claiming to have seen the stabbing) contradict Evidence 4 (the curtain was shut, blocking the view). 

So the evidence that the curtain was closed (Evidence 4) contradicts Ihmus's testimony about spying on the rite with binoculars (Testimony 3), because the curtain would block the view. Therefore, the pair should be Evidence 4 and Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 3}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. First, I need to look through the testimonies and the evidences to find inconsistencies.

The testimonies given are by Ihmus. Testimony 0 says they saw shadowy silhouettes on the ritual curtain. Testimony 1 explains that the figures were created by the light of the full moon on a clear, still night. Testimony 2 claims that even though it was a shadow, they could tell the accused was holding a dagger reverse-grip.

Now, looking at the evidence. Evidence 1 is the Rites Guide, which mentions that during the Purification Rite, there's a curtain around the sanctum, isolating it. The guide also says the rite starts with the high priest donning Lady Kee'ra's robes, and the priestess enters the spring. Evidence 4 is the Ritual Curtain itself, noting the entrance was shut during the rite. Evidence 11 is the Mountain Range Poster, showing the heights and positions of Mt. Poniponi and the Inner Sanctum. Evidence 2 is the May 9th Newspaper, which mentions the weather: clear skies during the day, but a cold front moving in overnight. Also, the ice had melted, allowing the rite to proceed.

Wait, Testimony 1 says the figures were created by the full moon's light on a clear night. But the newspaper (Evidence 2) mentions that the weather forecast included a cold front moving in overnight. If the cold front brought clouds, maybe the moon wasn't visible. Or does the timing matter? The Purification Rite starts when the moon is over Mt. Poniponi, which would be during the night. But the newspaper says the weather during the day was clear, but overnight there would be a cold front. So if the rite happened at night when the moon was up, perhaps the cold front had already arrived, causing clouds that would obscure the moon. If that's the case, the moonlight wouldn't be strong enough to cast shadows, contradicting Testimony 1's claim that the full moon's light created the figures.

So the contradiction would be between Testimony 1 (about full moon light on a clear night) and Evidence 2 (newspaper mentioning a cold front moving in overnight, which might mean cloudy skies, not clear). Therefore, the testimony about clear night with full moon light would be contradicted by the weather report indicating the cold front and possible cloud cover that night.

====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts a testimony here. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to find one pair where evidence and testimony contradict each other.

First, let me go through the testimonies. All the testimonies are from Ihmus, who seems to be claiming he wasn't at the Inner Sanctum and that it was impossible to get there. Let's look at each testimony:

Testimony 0: "I was never at the Inner Sanctum, I tell ya!" So he's denying being there.

Testimony 1: "That much I'm sure of, even with the fuzzy memory." Still asserting his certainty.

Testimony 2: "Besides, it woulda been impossible to get there in the first place!" He's saying accessing the Inner Sanctum was impossible.

Testimony 3: "No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly!" He's talking about the cliffs being unclimbable.

Testimony 4: "The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum." The gate is locked, so another barrier.

Testimony 5: "It's not like I can fly through the air, either!" So no way to get there by flying.

Testimony 6: Just a comment about lawyers being scary.

Now, looking at the evidence. I need to find evidence that shows that it was possible to get to the Inner Sanctum despite the claims in the testimonies.

Evidence 11: Mountain Range Poster. It mentions the Inner Sanctum is at 2310 meters east, Mt. Poniponi 2298 meters west. Wait, but how does that relate? Maybe the elevation difference?

Wait, maybe Evidence 6: Sanctum Prayer Flags. They're sewn into a long banner. Could that be used as a rope or something to climb?

Evidence 12: Envelope with three holes. Not sure. Evidence 19: Brand New Flag with writing. Hmm. Or maybe Evidence 7: Inner Sanctum Photo shows a shoveled-out area of snow and a broken lantern. Maybe there's a path created by shoveling?

Alternatively, Evidence 4: Ritual Curtain. The entrance was shut during the rite. But Ihmus is talking about getting to the Inner Sanctum, maybe via the cliffs or the gate.

Wait, Testimony 3 says the cliffs are unclimbable. But maybe there's evidence that shows the cliffs were climbable. Let's check Evidence 3: Tahrust's Autopsy Report. No, that's about cause of death.

Evidence 2: May 9th Newspaper. Let's see. The newspaper mentions that the ice has melted, allowing the rite to proceed. Also, a cold front moving in overnight. But Testimony 3 is about cliffs being loose and crumbly. If the ice melted, maybe the rocks were more accessible? Not sure.

Wait, the newspaper (Evidence 2) says that the thick white ice from the Inner Sanctum to the Plaza of Devotion had melted, allowing the rite to proceed. But Testimony 3 is about cliffs (maybe the cliffs near the Inner Sanctum) being unclimbable because of loose rocks. If the ice melted, perhaps the path was clear, but the cliffs were still difficult. Hmm, not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe the Mountain Range Poster (Evidence 11) shows that Mt. Poniponi is west and the Inner Sanctum east, but the elevations are 2298 vs 2310. So the Inner Sanctum is slightly higher. Maybe that's relevant? But how does that contradict Testimony 3 about the cliffs?

Wait, perhaps the prayer flags (Evidence 6) being sewn into a long banner. If they were used as a rope or something to climb the cliffs, that would contradict Testimony 3's claim that the cliffs are unclimbable. So if the flags were used as a rope, then someone could climb, contradicting the testimony that the cliffs can't be climbed because of loose rocks. But the testimony is from Ihmus, maybe the evidence shows a way to climb despite that.

Alternatively, the Envelope (Evidence 12) with three holes. If those holes were made by something like arrowheads, matching the Warbaa'd Arrow (Evidence 10), maybe indicating that someone shot an arrow to create a path? Not sure.

Wait, looking back at Testimony 3: "No one could climb up those cliffs. The rocks are all loose and crumbly!" So the claim is that the cliffs can't be climbed. But if there's evidence that someone did climb them, then that contradicts.

Evidence 26: Rebel Hideout Photo. It mentions a luminol reaction near the entrance. Maybe indicating blood, which could be from someone entering. But how does that relate to the cliffs?

Alternatively, Evidence 27: Warbaa'd Statue. It has sharp feathers that killed Zeh'lot and is a revolving door. Maybe the statue provided a hidden entrance or path, allowing access without climbing the cliffs. But how does that relate to Testimony 3?

Alternatively, Evidence 19: Brand New Flag with writing. If the flag's writing indicates a different path, but that's speculative.

Wait, let's check Evidence 6 again. The Sanctum Prayer Flags are sewn into a long banner. If they were used as a rope or something to assist in climbing, that would mean that the cliffs could be climbed with the help of the banner, contradicting Testimony 3. So Evidence 6 (Sanctum Prayer Flags) would contradict Testimony 3 (cliffs unclimbable due to loose rocks). But is that the case?

Alternatively, maybe the shoveled snow in the Inner Sanctum Photo (Evidence 7). If the snow was shoveled, perhaps creating a path that wasn't there before, but that's about snow, not cliffs.

Wait, perhaps the Mountain Range Poster (Evidence 11) shows that the Inner Sanctum is higher than Mt. Poniponi. If someone could come from Mt. Poniponi to the Inner Sanctum via a different route, but the testimonies are about cliffs being unclimbable. Maybe not.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 4: The plaza gate is locked from the Inner Sanctum side. So if someone wanted to enter from the plaza, they couldn't. But if there's another way in, like through the cliffs. But Testimony 3 says cliffs are unclimbable. So if there's evidence that the cliffs were climbable, that would contradict Testimony 3.

Evidence 6 (Prayer Flags as a long banner) could be that someone used the flags as a rope to climb the cliffs. So the existence of a long banner made of prayer flags (Evidence 6) would allow someone to climb, contradicting Testimony 3's assertion that the cliffs can't be climbed. So that's a possible contradiction.

Alternatively, Evidence 12: Envelope with three holes. If the holes were made by arrows (like Warbaa'd Arrow, Evidence 10), then maybe someone used arrows to climb, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the newspaper (Evidence 2) mentions that the ice had melted, allowing the rite to proceed. But Testimony 3 is about cliffs being unclimbable. If the ice melting made the cliffs accessible, but the testimony says the rocks are loose. Maybe the melting ice made the cliffs more dangerous, but the testimony is about the rocks being loose regardless. Not sure.

Wait, in the Rites Guide (Evidence 1), it mentions the Purification Rite's steps. The Rite of Water involves the priestess entering the spring. Then the Rite of Fire. The ceremony ends two days later. But how does that relate?

Alternatively, looking at the Tome of Secrets (Evidence 23), which is given to the one playing Lady Kee'ra. Not directly related.

Wait, going back to the contradiction. Testimony 3 says the cliffs can't be climbed because rocks are loose. If there's evidence that a method exists to climb despite that, then that's a contradiction.

The prayer flags (Evidence 6) sewn into a long banner could be used as a rope to assist in climbing. So if someone used the prayer flags as a rope, they could climb the cliffs even if the rocks are loose. Therefore, Evidence 6 contradicts Testimony 3.

Alternatively, the Warbaa'd Arrow (Evidence 10) found near the high priest's home. If the arrow was used to create a grappling hook or something to climb, but there's no direct mention of that.

Alternatively, the shoveled snow in the Inner Sanctum Photo (Evidence 7). If the snow was shoveled to create a path, but again, not directly related to cliffs.

Another angle: The Mountain Range Poster (Evidence 11) shows the Inner Sanctum is higher than Mt. Poniponi. If the two mountains are close, perhaps there's a way to traverse between them that doesn't involve climbing the cliffs. But Testimony 3 is about the cliffs near the Inner Sanctum. Hmm.

Alternatively, the escaped prisoner mentioned in the newspaper (Evidence 2). The wanted poster (Evidence 13) and the Envelope (Evidence 12) with three holes. Maybe the prisoner used a method to get in that bypasses the cliffs, like through the rebel hideout (Evidence 25 and 26). If the rebel hideout has a secret entrance, that would allow access without climbing cliffs. But Evidence 26's photo shows a luminol reaction near the entrance, indicating blood. If the hideout is connected to the Inner Sanctum, then maybe someone could have gotten in that way, contradicting the testimonies about access. But which testimony would that contradict? Testimony 2 says it's impossible to get there in the first place. If there's a secret path via the rebel hideout, that would contradict Testimony 2. But where's the evidence for that?

The Golden Orb (Evidence 25) is the key to the rebel hideout. The Rebel Hideout Photo (Evidence 26) shows the entrance with luminol reaction. If the hideout connects to the Inner Sanctum, then someone could enter through there, making Testimony 2 ("impossible to get there") false. So Evidence 26 would contradict Testimony 2. But the Rebel Hideout Photo's description says it's a photo of the hideout as Abbot Inmee saw it after the incident. If the hideout is connected to the Inner Sanctum, then that's a possible route. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the escaped prisoner alert (Evidence 2's newspaper) mentions an insurgent who escaped. The wanted poster (Evidence 13) could be related. If the prisoner used the rebel hideout path, which is accessible via the Golden Orb, then that's a way into the Inner Sanctum without climbing cliffs or the gate. So Testimony 2 claims it's impossible to get there, but Evidence 26 (Rebel Hideout Photo) shows a secret entrance. Thus, the contradiction would be between Testimony 2 and Evidence 26.

But wait, Testimony 2 is "Besides, it woulda been impossible to get there in the first place!" and Testimony 3 is about the cliffs. If the rebel hideout provides a secret entrance, then it's possible to get there, contradicting Testimony 2. However, I need to check if the Rebel Hideout is connected to the Inner Sanctum. The description of Evidence 26 says the hideout is "secret rebel hideout. There was a luminol reaction near the entrance. A photo of the secret rebel hideout. It is just as Abbot Inmee saw it after the incident." But does that photo show a connection to the Inner Sanctum? Maybe not explicitly. But the Golden Orb (Evidence 25) is the key to the hideout. If the Orb allows access to the hideout which is near the Inner Sanctum, then maybe that's a way in.

Alternatively, perhaps the Plumed Punisher Strap (Evidence 14) plays a theme. Not relevant.

Wait, let's consider the timing. The Purification Rite starts when the moon is over Mt. Poniponi (Evidence 1). The Mountain Range Poster (Evidence 11) shows the Inner Sanctum is east and higher. If the moon is over Mt. Poniponi (west), then the shadow might create a path, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, the Ritual Curtain (Evidence 4) isolates the sanctum. The entrance was shut during the rite. But Testimony 4 says the plaza gate is locked from the Inner Sanctum side. So maybe the only way in is through the curtain, but it's shut. Unless there's another entrance, like the cliffs. But Testimony 3 says cliffs are unclimbable.

Wait, but if the prayer flags (Evidence 6) are a long banner, perhaps they were used to bridge a gap or as a rope. For example, if someone used the banner as a rope to climb down from a higher point (like the Inner Sanctum, which is higher) to another area, or to assist in climbing the cliffs despite loose rocks. If the banner is long enough, it could help in climbing, making Testimony 3's claim about the cliffs being unclimbable false. Therefore, Evidence 6 contradicts Testimony 3.

Alternatively, the Envelope (Evidence 12) has three holes. If those holes are from an arrow (Evidence 10), maybe indicating that someone shot an arrow with a rope attached, creating a way to climb. So the envelope's holes could be from the arrow, suggesting a method to climb, contradicting Testimony 3. But that's speculative.

But the Warbaa'd Arrow (Evidence 10) is discovered near the high priest's home. If that arrow was used to shoot a rope to the cliffs, then maybe. But without explicit evidence, it's hard to say.

So, considering the options, the most direct contradiction might be between Testimony 3 (cliffs unclimbable) and Evidence 6 (prayer flags sewn into a long banner, which could be used as a climbing aid). Therefore, Evidence 6 contradicts Testimony 3.

====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to go through each testimony and check the evidence to see if there's a conflict.

Looking at the testimonies from Ihmus (Testimony 0 to 5), they all seem to be about his paragliding accident. For example, Testimony 3 says he had to land due to gale force winds. But wait, the Evidence 2 is the May 9th Newspaper. The newspaper's weather forecast mentions calm, clear skies around the Inner Sanctum on the day of the rite. If Ihmus claims there were gale force winds causing his emergency landing, that contradicts the weather report stating calm conditions. That's a contradiction. So the testimony about sudden gale winds (Testimony 3) doesn't align with the weather evidence (Evidence 2). That must be the pair.

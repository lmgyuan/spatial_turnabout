Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to pick one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, let me go through the testimonies. The testimonies from Gumshoe (Testimony 0 to 5) are pointing towards Matt Engarde as the murderer. Specifically, Testimony 4 says that the defendant's (Matt Engarde) fingerprints were on the knife. The corresponding evidence here would be Evidence 15, the Knife, which indeed has Engarde's fingerprints. But wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 14) states that the cause of death was strangulation with a scarf, followed by a stabbing. So the actual cause of death is strangulation, not the stabbing. The knife was used post-mortem. If the murder was premeditated, as per Testimony 5, then the knife being the murder weapon is a problem. But if the victim was already dead from strangulation, then the stabbing with the knife (which has Engarde's prints) would be after death, meaning the real cause of death is different. That could create a contradiction. However, Testimony 5 is about premeditation because Engarde bought the knife. The autopsy report's cause of death being strangulation might mean the knife wasn't the murder weapon, so Engarde's fingerprints on the knife wouldn't prove he committed the murder. Therefore, the contradiction here would be between Testimony 4 (Engarde's prints on the knife) and the autopsy report (Evidence 14) stating the cause was strangulation. But wait, the autopsy report says cause of death is both strangulation and stabbing. Wait, no, the autopsy report says "Strangled to death with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife." So the actual cause of death is strangulation. The stabbing happened after death. Therefore, the presence of Engarde's prints on the knife doesn't necessarily mean he did the murder, since the stabbing was after the victim was already dead. That could mean someone else strangled him, and Engarde (or someone else) stabbed him post-mortem. Therefore, Testimony 4 and 5's claim that the knife was used in the murder (premeditated) is contradicted by the autopsy report (Evidence 14) showing that the murder was via strangulation. Therefore, the knife with Engarde's prints is not the murder weapon. So the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (fingerprints on the knife) and Evidence 14 (cause of death is strangulation). But the user wants one evidence and one testimony pair. Alternatively, Testimony 5 says the knife was bought for a premeditated murder, but the murder method was strangulation. Therefore, the knife wasn't the murder weapon. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (premeditated via buying the knife) and the autopsy report (Evidence 14) that the actual cause was strangulation. However, Testimony 5 is about the knife being the murder weapon. Alternatively, maybe another angle: The knife's description (Evidence 15) says it has Engarde's fingerprints and the victim's blood. But if the stabbing was after death, the blood might not be from the actual killing. Wait, the autopsy says cause of death is strangulation, but the stabbing would still cause bleeding. So the presence of blood on the knife would make sense. So maybe that's not the contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3: The Jammin' Ninja's button was found in Engarde's hakama. The button is Evidence 16, which is covered in Corrida's blood. If Engarde's hakama had the button, that suggests he was in a struggle. But maybe the button was planted. Alternatively, the guitar case (Evidence 7) only has Corrida's fingerprints. If there was a struggle, maybe there should be others' prints. Hmm. Let me check other evidences. The spy camera (Evidence 21) was recording the room during the murder. The stuffed bear (Evidence 23) had the spy camera, and Engarde bought an identical bear (Evidence 24). So Engarde set up the camera. But the video tape (Evidence 29) from De Killer's hideout might show something else. Wait, but the testimonies are about the button and the knife. Let's think again. The contradiction could be that the autopsy report (Evidence 14) states the time of death as 8:15 PM. The spy camera was set to record from 8 PM for 1 hour. The crime photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim in a samurai outfit with the knife in his chest. However, Lotta's Photo (Evidence 17) shows a person in samurai garb outside the door right after the murder. If the time of death was 8:15 PM, and the camera was running, maybe the spy camera footage would show the actual murder. But if the spy camera was in the room (stuffed bear in the victim's room), then maybe the footage would show the real killer. However, the video tape (Evidence 29) was retrieved from De Killer's hideout, and its contents are unknown. So maybe the video shows that Engarde wasn't the killer. But since the contents are unknown, maybe that's not the right path. Alternatively, the fact that the guitar case (Evidence 7) only has Corrida's fingerprints. If the button was ripped off during a struggle, but the guitar case only has his prints, perhaps indicating that the button was planted. But how does that contradict a testimony? Testimony 3 says the button was found in Engarde's hakama. If the button was ripped off during a struggle, but the guitar case (which was next to the victim) has only Corrida's prints, that might suggest that there wasn't a struggle there. But maybe that's not a direct contradiction. Another angle: The knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints and the victim's blood. The autopsy says he was strangled first. So even if Engarde's prints are on the knife, the actual cause of death wasn't the stabbing. Therefore, the presence of the knife with his prints doesn't prove he committed the murder. But Testimony 4 and 5 suggest that the knife is the murder weapon, which contradicts the autopsy. So the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (fingerprints on the knife) and the autopsy report (Evidence 14) showing that the stabbing wasn't the cause of death. Therefore, the presence of the knife with Engarde's prints doesn't mean he killed Corrida, since the actual murder was via strangulation. Therefore, the testimony that Engarde's fingerprints are on the knife (Testimony 4) is contradicted by the autopsy report (Evidence 14) which shows the murder was by strangulation, making the knife irrelevant to the actual killing. Thus, the contradiction would be between Testimony 4 (Engarde's prints on the knife) and Evidence 14 (cause of death is strangulation). But how exactly do they contradict? The testimony states that the knife has Engarde's prints, which is true (Evidence 15). The autopsy says cause of death is strangulation, then stabbing. The testimony 4 is presented as evidence that Engarde is the murderer. But if the actual cause of death is strangulation, then the knife's role is post-mortem. So the real killer could have strangled Corrida, and then Engarde (or someone else) stabbed him. Therefore, Engarde's fingerprints on the knife don't prove he committed the murder. Hence, Testimony 4's implication that the knife is the murder weapon is contradicted by the autopsy's cause of death. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 4. But let me check the numbers. Evidence 14 is Juan's Autopsy Report. Testimony 4 is "The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife." So the contradiction is that the defendant's fingerprints on the knife are presented as evidence he committed the murder, but the autopsy shows that the murder was by strangulation, so the stabbing (with the knife) was after death. Therefore, the knife's fingerprints don't link him to the actual murder. So the testimony (Testimony 4) is contradicted by Evidence 14. Therefore, the answer would be {"evidence": 14, "testimony": 4}.

Wait, but Evidence 15 (Knife) says it has Engarde's fingerprints. Testimony 4 says the same. So Testimony 4 is correct. The contradiction is not between Testimony 4 and Evidence 15. The issue is that the cause of death was strangulation, making the knife irrelevant. So the testimony (Testimony 5) that it's premeditated because Engarde bought the knife is contradicted by the fact that the knife wasn't the murder weapon. But Testimony 5 says "the defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!" So if the knife wasn't the murder weapon (since the actual cause was strangulation), then Testimony 5 is contradicted by Evidence 14. But Evidence 15 does mention that the knife has the victim's blood and Engarde's prints. So the knife was used to stab the body, but not to kill. Therefore, buying the knife for the crime (Testimony 5) is incorrect, since the actual murder was via strangulation. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 14. But how does that work? Testimony 5's assertion that buying the knife makes it premeditated is based on the knife being the murder weapon. But if the knife wasn't the murder weapon, then that testimony's basis is flawed. So the pair would be Evidence 14 (autopsy report) and Testimony 5. However, I need to check if that's the case. Alternatively, Testimony 4 and 5 are both about the knife. The real contradiction is that the cause of death wasn't from the knife, hence the knife's presence and Engarde's prints don't prove he's the killer. So the evidence that contradicts is the autopsy report (14) and testimony 4 or 5. The most direct contradiction would be between the autopsy report and Testimony 5, which claims the murder was premeditated with the knife. But the actual murder was via strangulation, so the knife purchase doesn't directly relate to the murder method. So Testimony 5 is contradicted by Evidence 14. Therefore, the answer is {"evidence": 14, "testimony": 5}. But wait, let me check the testimony 5: "The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!" If the knife wasn't used to kill, but just to stab a corpse, then buying the knife for the crime is incorrect. Therefore, the testimony 5 is contradicted by Evidence 14 (cause of death is strangulation, not the stabbing). So this would be the correct pair. Alternatively, maybe another angle. Let's think about the time of death. The spy camera (Evidence 21) was recording from 8 PM for 1 hour. The time of death is 8:15 PM. The Video Tape (Evidence 29) from De Killer's hideout might have footage that shows the actual killer. But the contents are unknown. However, the existence of the spy camera in the room would mean that the murder should have been recorded. If the spy camera was set up by Engarde (since he bought the bear), then maybe the footage would show someone else committing the murder, exonerating Engarde. But since the video tape is from De Killer's hideout, perhaps it's different. However, the user might not have that information. Alternatively, the stuffed bear (Evidence 23) with the spy camera was in the victim's room. The spy camera was set to record from 8 PM. The time of death is 8:15 PM. Therefore, the camera should have recorded the murder. But the existence of this camera (and the fact that Engarde bought a similar bear) suggests that Engarde wanted to record the murder. If the footage shows someone else, that would contradict the testimonies. But since the video tape's contents are unknown (as per Evidence 29), maybe that's not the contradiction. However, if the spy camera was active and the video was retrieved, then the footage could show the real killer, contradicting the testimonies. But since the user hasn't been given the contents, perhaps this isn't the right path. Therefore, returning to the earlier conclusion: Testimony 5 claims the knife was bought for the crime, making it premeditated. But the autopsy report (Evidence 14) shows the actual murder was by strangulation. Thus, the knife wasn't the murder weapon, so Testimony 5's basis is contradicted. Therefore, the pair is Evidence 14 and Testimony 5. Alternatively, Testimony 4 says the defendant's fingerprints are on the knife. The knife (Evidence 15) does have Engarde's prints. So that's not a contradiction. The contradiction is the use of the knife as the murder weapon versus the actual cause of death. So Testimony 5 claims the knife was used in the premeditated murder, but Evidence 14 shows that the murder was via strangulation, so the knife wasn't the cause of death. Therefore, Testimony 5 is contradicted by Evidence 14. So the answer is {"evidence": 14, "testimony":5}.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The task is to pick one pair. Let's start by going through the testimonies and the evidences provided.

First, looking at the testimonies given by Oldbag (Testimony 0 to 5). Testimony 4 and 5 are key here. She claims that she saw Matt Engarde coming out of Juan Corrida's room, wearing his flashy racing jacket. So, according to her, Matt was dressed in his racing jacket at the time.

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 2 is a photo of the Nickel Samurai costume. Matt Engarde plays the Nickel Samurai. The Steel Samurai is Will Powers, but Matt's character is Nickel Samurai. The racing jacket mentioned by Oldbag might be part of his costume. However, let's check other evidences.

Evidence 15 is the knife with Engarde's fingerprints and "Gatewater" engraved. But the key contradiction might be elsewhere. 

Looking at Evidence 17, Lotta's Photo, which is a picture taken in the hallway right after the murder. The photo shows a person in samurai garb outside the door. If Oldbag's testimony says that Engarde was wearing his racing jacket (which is part of the Nickel Samurai costume), but the photo shows someone in samurai garb (which could be the same as the Nickel Samurai costume), perhaps there's a conflict here. Wait, but maybe the racing jacket is part of the samurai garb? Let me check the descriptions again.

Evidence 2: The Nickel Samurai costume photo. So if Matt Engarde was wearing his racing jacket (as per Testimony 5), that's part of his costume. The person in the photo (Evidence 17) is in samurai garb, which would match the Nickel Samurai costume. Hmm, maybe not a contradiction here.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Testimony 5 says Engarde was wearing his flashy racing jacket. But if the photo (Evidence 17) shows someone in samurai garb, which is a different outfit. Wait, the Nickel Samurai's costume would be samurai armor, perhaps, not a racing jacket. So if Oldbag says he was in a racing jacket, but the photo shows someone in samurai garb, that's a contradiction. Because the person exiting the room in the photo is in samurai garb, but Oldbag claims Engarde was in a racing jacket. Therefore, either the photo shows someone else, or Oldbag is lying.

Alternatively, maybe the racing jacket is part of the samurai costume. But the Nickel Samurai is a samurai character, so the racing jacket might not fit. The Steel Samurai (Will Powers) has a different costume. Wait, the racing jacket could be part of Matt's regular attire, not his costume. If the photo shows the samurai garb, which is different from the racing jacket, then Oldbag's testimony about the jacket contradicts the photo evidence showing someone in samurai garb. Therefore, the testimony and evidence would conflict.

So, Testimony 5 (Oldbag says Engarde was wearing his racing jacket) and Evidence 17 (the photo shows a person in samurai garb) contradict each other. Because the outfit described in the testimony (racing jacket) doesn't match the outfit in the photo (samurai garb). Therefore, the correct pair would be Evidence 17 and Testimony 5.

Wait, but let me check the Evidence 17 again. It's a photo taken right after the murder in the hallway. The person is in samurai garb. If Oldbag claims that Matt Engarde was wearing a racing jacket (Testimony 5), but the photo shows someone in samurai garb, then that's a contradiction. Because either Oldbag is mistaken about the clothing, or the person in the photo is not Engarde. Therefore, the evidence (17) contradicts Testimony 5.

Alternatively, let's look for another possible contradiction. For instance, the Security Lady (Oldbag) in Testimony 3 and 4 says she saw Matt Engarde leaving the room. But perhaps another evidence shows that Matt couldn't have been there. Let me check other evidences.

Evidence 24 is a credit card receipt showing Engarde bought a stuffed bear identical to the one found in the victim's room (Evidence 23). The stuffed bear had a spy camera. Maybe that's connected to the spy camera footage. Evidence 21 is the spy camera set to record from 8 PM for 1 hour. If the spy camera was in the room, but the testimony says Engarde was seen leaving, perhaps the camera footage would show something else. But the problem is, the video tape (Evidence 29) is from De Killer's hideout, and its contents are unknown. So maybe not directly related.

Alternatively, the knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but maybe the testimony is conflicting with that. However, the presence of fingerprints on the knife doesn't directly contradict the testimony. Unless the testimony is about the time of the murder. Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 14) says the time of death is 8:15 PM. The spy camera was running from 8 PM. So if the camera was in the room, perhaps it recorded the murder. But if Engarde was seen leaving, but the camera would have footage. However, the user hasn't provided the contents of the video, so maybe that's not helpful here.

Another angle: The Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has Corrida's fingerprints and water on the lid. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows a smashed vase with water on the carpet. Maybe that's connected. But how does that contradict a testimony?

Alternatively, consider Testimony 4 where Oldbag says she saw Matt Engarde leaving the room. But Evidence 17's photo shows a person in samurai garb outside the door. If the samurai garb is different from what Engarde was supposed to be wearing (like the racing jacket), that's a contradiction. So the testimony says he was in a racing jacket, but the photo shows samurai garb. Therefore, the person in the photo is someone else, which contradicts the testimony that it was Engarde. Therefore, Evidence 17 (photo showing samurai garb) contradicts Testimony 4 (says it was Engarde in a racing jacket). But Testimony 5 is about the jacket. Wait, Testimony 4 says Engarde was trying to sneak out of the room, and Testimony 5 adds that he was wearing the racing jacket. So the photo (Evidence 17) shows someone in samurai garb. Therefore, the contradiction is between the clothing described in Testimony 5 (racing jacket) and the clothing shown in Evidence 17 (samurai garb). Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 17 and Testimony 5.

But let me verify the numbers. Evidence 17 is "Lotta's Photo: Picture taken in the Hallway right after the murder. A person in samurai garb stands outside the door." Testimony 5: "He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show." So if the person in the photo is in samurai garb, not a racing jacket, then Oldbag's testimony about the jacket is contradicted by the photo showing samurai garb. Therefore, this is a contradiction. So the correct pair is Evidence 17 and Testimony 5.

{"evidence": 17, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's start by going through the problem. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. I need to analyze each testimony and check if any of the evidence directly contradicts it.

First, let me look at the testimonies. All four testimonies are from Oldbag (Testimony 0 to 4). Testimony 0 is her remembering something about Engarde, but Testimonies 1-4 are about the Nickel Samurai costume. She claims that the Nickel Samurai (Matt Engarde's character) was the one she saw committing the murder. She states that the killer must have worn the costume during the murder because he had to attend a stage show right after the crime. So her main point is that the murderer was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume.

Now, looking at the evidence, let's check what contradicts this. Evidence 2 is "The Nickel Samurai" which is a photo of the costume. But maybe there's another piece of evidence that shows the killer wasn't wearing that costume. Let me check other evidences.

Evidence 17 is Lotta's Photo, which is a picture taken in the hallway right after the murder showing a person in samurai garb outside the door. But that's just someone in samurai garb, not necessarily the Nickel Samurai. Wait, the costumes: Jammin' Ninja and Nickel Samurai are two different characters. The victim, Juan Corrida, played the Jammin' Ninja, while Matt Engarde plays the Nickel Samurai.

Wait, in the crime photo (Evidence 9), the victim is in a samurai outfit. But the autopsy report (Evidence 14) says he was strangled with a scarf and then stabbed. The knife found (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but there's also the Jammin' Ninja's button (Evidence 16) found in Engarde's hakama (which is part of the samurai costume). That might indicate a struggle, but not directly contradict Oldbag's testimony.

Wait, Oldbag says the killer was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume. However, the security camera footage from the spy camera (Evidence 21, 22, 23) might show something. The stuffed bear with the spy camera was in the victim's room, set to record from 8 PM for an hour. The murder happened at 8:15 PM. If the spy camera was recording, it would have captured the actual murder. But according to the video tape (Evidence 29), which was retrieved from De Killer's hideout, maybe that video shows something different. However, the contents are unknown. Hmm.

Wait, there's also Lotta's Camera (Evidence 5) which was stolen. The tabloid article (Evidence 11) mentions Corrida and Adrian Andrews. But how does that relate?

Wait, the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has only Corrida's fingerprints and has water on top. The vase was smashed, staining the carpet with water (Crime Photo 9). Maybe that's relevant to slipping or something, but not directly contradicting the testimony.

The key contradiction would be if Oldbag claims the killer was in the Nickel Samurai costume, but there's evidence showing the killer was in a different costume. Let's look at Evidence 17: Lotta's Photo shows a person in samurai garb outside the door. If that person was the killer, but the garb is not the Nickel Samurai's, that would contradict Oldbag. However, the testimony says it was the Nickel Samurai costume. But how can we confirm the garb in the photo?

Alternatively, the Video Tape (Evidence 29) might show the killer, but since the contents are unknown, we can't use that. The Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording during the murder. If that footage shows the killer in a different outfit, but since the Video Tape is separate, maybe not.

Wait, another angle: The Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) was found in Engarde's hakama. If Engarde's costume was the Nickel Samurai, why would he have a button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume? That might suggest he was involved with the victim, but not directly contradict the testimony.

Wait, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim in a samurai outfit. The victim is Corrida, who played Jammin' Ninja. So maybe his costume is different from Nickel Samurai. If the killer was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume, but the victim was in his own costume. However, the actual murder might have involved the killer in a different costume.

Alternatively, the testimony says the killer was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume to attend the stage show. But the security camera (spy camera) might show that the killer wasn't in that costume. For example, the stuffed bear's spy camera (Evidence 23) was in the victim's room. If the video from that camera (which is the Spy Camera Evidence 21) shows the killer in a different outfit, then that contradicts Oldbag's testimony. But since the Spy Camera's footage isn't described beyond being set to record, we don't know. The Video Tape (29) might be related, but the contents are unknown. However, the user might expect us to find another contradiction.

Looking back at the testimonies, Oldbag's Testimony 4 states that the killer must have worn the Nickel Samurai costume during the stabbing. But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) says the cause of death was strangulation with a scarf, then stabbed. The stabbing occurred after death. If the killer strangled him first, maybe without the costume, then stabbed with the knife that has Engarde's prints. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Wait, the Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints. If Engarde was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume when he stabbed, then his fingerprints would be on the knife, which matches. But if the actual murder (strangulation) was done without the costume, then the stabbing was post-mortem. So the real cause of death was strangulation, not the stabbing. Therefore, the actual murder was via strangulation, which may not have required the costume. But Oldbag claims the killer was wearing the costume during the stabbing. However, since the stabbing was after death, maybe the costume wasn't necessary. But this might not directly contradict.

Alternatively, the testimony says the killer had to go to the stage show right after the crime (Testimony 3), so he wore the costume. But the Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) mentions the Nickel Samurai confessing something after the stage show. If the stage show was after the murder, but the murder occurred at 8:15 PM, what time was the stage show? If the stage show was at a time that would require the killer to be there, but the actual murderer was someone else who didn't need to attend, then maybe the testimony is contradicted.

Alternatively, consider the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) found next to the victim. It has water on the lid and only Corrida's fingerprints. If the killer used the guitar case to carry something, but the fingerprints are only Corrida's, maybe implying that the killer didn't touch it, which may not directly relate.

Wait, the key contradiction could be between Oldbag's Testimony 4 (killer wore Nickel Samurai costume during stabbing) and the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) stating that the victim was strangled first, then stabbed. If the stabbing was post-mortem, then the actual cause of death was the strangulation, not the stabbing. Therefore, the killer didn't need to wear the costume during the actual murder (strangulation), only during the stabbing, which was after death. But Oldbag claims the killer was in costume when stabbing, which is possible. However, this might not be a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording the room during the murder. If the footage shows the killer not in the Nickel Samurai costume during the time of the murder (8:15 PM), that would contradict Oldbag's testimony. However, since the Spy Camera's footage is mentioned but not its content, perhaps the Video Tape (29) is the same as the spy camera's footage. But the Video Tape's contents are unknown. However, the user might not expect us to infer that.

Alternatively, looking at the security lady's testimony (Oldbag) that she saw the Nickel Samurai, but the Jammin' Ninja's button (Evidence 16) was found in Engarde's costume. If Engarde's costume (Nickel Samurai) had a button from the victim's costume (Jammin' Ninja), that might suggest a struggle. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Wait, the key point is that Oldbag says the killer was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume. However, the crime photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim in a samurai outfit, but that's his own costume. The person in Lotta's Photo (Evidence 17) is in samurai garb, but if that's the killer, and if that garb is the Nickel Samurai's, then it supports her testimony. But if the garb is different, like the Jammin' Ninja, then that contradicts. But we don't have info on the photo's details.

Wait, the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has water on top. The vase was broken, spilling water. If the killer stepped in the water, maybe leaving footprints, but that's not mentioned. Alternatively, the killer could have used the guitar case to carry something, but again, not directly contradicting.

Another angle: The knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints. If Engarde was in the Nickel Samurai costume, he could have left fingerprints. But Oldbag's testimony is about seeing the costume, not the fingerprints.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and the Press Conference Ticket. Testimony 3 says the killer had to go to the stage show right after the crime, hence wore the costume. The Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) says the Nickel Samurai is to confess something after the stage show. If the stage show was after the murder, and the real killer (Shelly de Killer) had no need to attend, but Engarde was supposed to be at the stage show, then perhaps the real killer (De Killer) wasn't Engarde. But the testimony claims the killer was Engarde in the costume. However, the Video Tape (29) from De Killer's hideout might show that he's the killer, but we can't confirm.

Alternatively, the Spy Camera's footage (Evidence 21) would have recorded the actual murder. If the Spy Camera was in the stuffed bear (Evidence 23) in the victim's room, then it should have captured the murderer. If the murderer was in the Nickel Samurai costume, then the footage would confirm that. But if the footage shows someone else, like Adrian Andrews or Shelly de Killer, then it contradicts Oldbag's testimony. However, the evidence doesn't explicitly state what the footage shows, but there's the Video Tape (29) which might be the same footage. Since De Killer tried to recover the Video Tape, it's possible that the tape shows the real killer. If the real killer is De Killer, who was disguised as the bellboy (Bellboy's Uniform, Evidence 30), then Oldbag's testimony about seeing the Nickel Samurai is contradicted. The Bellboy's Uniform (30) is missing a button, which could link to the Jammin' Ninja's button (16) found in Engarde's costume, suggesting that the button came from De Killer's uniform. Wait, but the Jammin' Ninja's button is from Corrida's costume. Hmm.

Wait, the Bellboy's Uniform (30) is missing a special button. If the Jammin' Ninja's button (16) is the missing one, that would link De Killer (who wore the bellboy uniform) to planting the button in Engarde's costume. But I'm not sure. However, if the Spy Camera's footage (21) shows De Killer (in bellboy uniform) committing the murder, then that contradicts Oldbag's testimony that it was the Nickel Samurai (Engarde). Therefore, the evidence that contradicts Oldbag's testimony is the Spy Camera (21) or the Video Tape (29), but since the Video Tape's contents are unknown, perhaps the Spy Camera's existence and the fact that it was recording during the murder would imply that the footage could contradict her testimony. However, the user might be looking for a more direct contradiction.

Wait, let's think again. The testimonies from Oldbag all state that the killer was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume. However, the Autopsy Report (14) says the cause of death was strangulation, then a stabbing. The stabbing happened post-mortem, so the actual murder was via strangulation. If the killer strangled the victim without needing the costume, and then later stabbed with the knife (which had Engarde's prints), perhaps the stabbing was done by someone else. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Alternatively, the Security Lady (Oldbag) claims she saw the Nickel Samurai, but the person she saw was actually the Jammin' Ninja (the victim) in his own costume. But the victim was already dead, so that's not possible. Alternatively, she saw someone else in the costume. If the Spy Camera's footage shows that the real killer was not in the Nickel Samurai costume, then that contradicts. But without knowing the footage's content, we can't be certain. However, maybe the key contradiction is between Oldbag's Testimony 4 (killer wore Nickel Samurai costume when stabbing) and the fact that the knife (15) with Engarde's prints was used for stabbing, implying he did the stabbing. But if Engarde was at the stage show, as per the Press Conference Ticket (3), maybe he had an alibi. If the stage show was at 8 PM and the murder was at 8:15 PM, he couldn't be in both places. But the Press Conference Ticket says the stage show is after the post-ceremony, so timing may vary.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 ("he had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime") and the Spy Camera (21) which was recording from 8 PM for 1 hour. If the stage show was during that time, and the Spy Camera shows Engarde in his room (if he's there), but that's speculative. Alternatively, the Credit Card Receipt (24) shows Engarde bought a stuffed bear identical to the one in the victim's room (23), which was the spy camera. So Engarde set up the spy camera. If the footage shows that he wasn't present during the murder, then he couldn't be the killer. But how does that contradict Oldbag's testimony?

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Oldbag's testimony that the killer was in the Nickel Samurai costume (Testimony 4) and Lotta's Photo (17) showing a person in samurai garb outside the door. If the samurai garb in the photo is the Jammin' Ninja's (victim's) costume, then the person in the photo would be the victim, but he was already dead. Therefore, the photo must show the killer. If the garb is different, like the Nickel Samurai's, then it supports the testimony. But if the garb is the Jammin' Ninja's, that would contradict. But the evidence doesn't specify which costume the person in the photo is wearing. Hmm.

Wait, the Jammin' Ninja and Nickel Samurai are two different characters. The victim (Corrida) was the Jammin' Ninja. If the photo shows someone in the Jammin' Ninja costume, then that's the victim, but he's dead. So the person in the photo must be the killer. But if the killer is wearing the Jammin' Ninja's costume, that contradicts Oldbag's testimony that it was the Nickel Samurai. However, the photo's description says "a person in samurai garb", which could be either costume. Without more details, this is unclear.

Wait, the key here is that Oldbag's testimony is about the killer wearing the Nickel Samurai costume. The contradiction would be if there's evidence that the killer was wearing a different costume. Let's think of the Bellboy's Uniform (30) which was worn by De Killer. If the killer was dressed as a bellboy, then Oldbag's testimony is wrong. The Spy Camera's footage (21) would show De Killer in the bellboy uniform committing the murder. However, since the Spy Camera's evidence is mentioned, and the Video Tape (29) is from De Killer's hideout (possibly containing the footage), but since the contents are unknown, maybe this isn't the way to go.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Oldbag's Testimony 3 and the Press Conference Ticket (3). Testimony 3 says the killer had to go to the stage show right after the crime. The Press Conference Ticket says the stage show is after the post-ceremony. If the stage show was scheduled after the murder, and the killer (assuming it's Engarde) had to be there, but the murder time was 8:15 PM, and the stage show was at, say, 8:30 PM, then Engarde would have to leave the crime scene quickly. However, if the Spy Camera (21) shows that the killer was in the room beyond the time when Engarde needed to leave for the stage show, that could create a time contradiction. But this requires timing info we might not have.

Another angle: The Magazine Clipping (11) says Corrida was in a relationship with Adrian Andrews. If Adrian was involved, maybe she had a motive. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Wait, let me check the testimonies again. The testimonies from Oldbag (1-4) all point to Engarde in the Nickel Samurai costume committing the murder. The key evidence that contradicts this would be evidence showing that the actual killer was someone else or dressed differently.

The Autopsy Report (14) says the cause of death was strangulation, then stabbing. The Knife (15) has Engarde's fingerprints, which suggests he did the stabbing. But the stabbing occurred post-mortem. So the actual murder was the strangulation. If the strangulation was done by someone else (like Shelly de Killer), then Engarde only did the stabbing after. But how does that contradict the testimony?

If the Spy Camera (21) was recording during the murder, and the footage shows Shelly de Killer (not in the Nickel Samurai costume) strangling the victim, then that contradicts Oldbag's testimony. However, since the Spy Camera's footage is not described, but the Video Tape (29) is retrieved from De Killer's hideout and he tried to recover it, it's likely that the tape shows the real killer (De Killer) committing the murder. Therefore, the Video Tape (29) would contradict Oldbag's testimony. But since the Video Tape's details are unknown unless asked, the user might have intended that the Spy Camera (21) is the key. However, the problem states to choose one pair. The answer might be that the Spy Camera (21) contradicts Oldbag's Testimony 3 or 4 because the camera was recording during the murder and would show the real killer not in the costume. But how?

Wait, the Spy Camera (21) was set to record from 8 PM for 1 hour. The murder was at 8:15 PM, so the camera was active. If the footage shows the real killer (Shelly de Killer) in the bellboy uniform (Evidence 30) committing the murder, then that contradicts Oldbag's testimony. Therefore, the existence of the Spy Camera (21) as evidence would contradict Oldbag's Testimony 3 or 4 because her testimony is based on seeing the costume, but the camera would have captured the real killer in a different outfit. However, since the Spy Camera's footage isn't explicitly described as showing this, but the Video Tape (29) is related, but its content is unknown, perhaps this is not the intended pair.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (killer wore the costume when stabbing) and the fact that the stabbing was post-mortem. But that's more about the cause of death, not the costume.

Wait, another angle: The Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) says the Nickel Samurai is to confess something after the stage show. If Engarde (the Nickel Samurai) was supposed to be at the stage show, then he would have to be there at a specific time. If the murder occurred at 8:15 PM and the stage show was at the same time, he couldn't be in two places at once. But the testimony claims he was at the crime scene in the costume. If the stage show was scheduled at a time conflicting with the murder, then the Press Conference Ticket (3) would contradict Testimony 3. For example, if the stage show started at 8 PM and the murder was at 8:15, Engarde couldn't be both at the stage show and committing the murder. But the testimony says he had to go to the stage show right after the crime, implying the crime was before. The Press Conference Ticket might indicate that the stage show is after the ceremony, but without exact times, it's hard to say. This is a possible contradiction, but not certain.

Alternatively, looking back at the Security Lady's (Oldbag) testimonies, she claims that the killer was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume. But the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) only has Corrida's fingerprints. If the killer was in the costume, they might have touched the case, but it only has the victim's prints. However, that's not a direct contradiction.

Wait, the key contradiction is likely between Oldbag's Testimony 4 (killer was in the Nickel Samurai costume during the stabbing) and the Autopsy Report (14) stating that the victim was already dead from strangulation when stabbed. Therefore, the stabbing was post-mortem, and the killer didn't need to be in the costume during the actual murder (strangulation). However, the testimony specifically refers to the stabbing, which the killer did in the costume. The autopsy report doesn't directly contradict that. The killer could have strangled the victim without the costume and then put it on to stab. But that's possible, so not a contradiction.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to summarize:

- Oldbag's testimony: Killer was in Nickel Samurai costume during the murder (stabbing).
- Evidence that could contradict: Spy Camera (21) showing killer not in costume, Video Tape (29) showing De Killer, Bellboy's Uniform (30) worn by De Killer, etc.
- But since the contents of the Spy Camera and Video Tape are not described, except that the Video Tape was sought by De Killer, the user might expect the answer to be the Spy Camera (21) contradicting the testimony because if the camera was recording the room during the murder, it would have captured the killer, and if the killer wasn't in the Nickel Samurai costume, that contradicts Oldbag.

But how do we know that the Spy Camera's footage shows the killer? The Spy Camera was in the victim's room (stuffed bear), set to record from 8 PM. The murder occurred at 8:15 PM. Therefore, the Spy Camera must have recorded the murder. The Video Tape (29) retrieved from De Killer's hideout is likely the footage from the Spy Camera, which he tried to recover. Therefore, the Video Tape would show the real killer (De Killer) in the bellboy uniform, contradicting Oldbag's testimony that it was the Nickel Samurai. However, since the Video Tape's details are hidden unless asked, maybe the user wants us to use the Spy Camera (21) as the evidence that contradicts the testimony. But without knowing the content, this is a stretch.

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between Oldbag's Testimony 4 and the Autopsy Report (14) because the testimony claims the stabbing was the murder, but the autopsy says the victim was already dead from strangulation. Therefore, the stabbing wasn't the cause of death, so the killer didn't need to wear the costume during the actual murder (strangulation), but the testimony refers to the stabbing. However, the testimony is about the stabbing, which did happen, so maybe not a contradiction.

Wait, the Autopsy Report says the cause of death was strangulation. The stabbing was post-mortem. So the actual murder was via strangulation, which the killer could have done without the costume. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer stabbed him with the knife (possibly to frame Engarde by leaving his fingerprints). Therefore, the stabbing was done after the murder, and if the killer changed into the costume to do the stabbing (to align with the stage show), then the testimony is correct. But if the stabbing didn't require the costume, then maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

I think the most logical contradiction is between the Spy Camera (21) and Oldbag's testimony. The Spy Camera was recording during the murder, so it would have captured the killer. If the killer was not in the Nickel Samurai costume, then that contradicts Oldbag's testimony. Since the Spy Camera is evidence 21 and the testimony is 4, the pair would be {"evidence": 21, "testimony": 4}. But I need to confirm.

But wait, the Spy Camera (21) is described as being set to record the victim's room from 8 PM for 1 hour, running at the time of the murder. Therefore, if the footage exists, it would show the actual killer. If the real killer was Shelly de Killer in a bellboy uniform (as per Evidence 30), then the Spy Camera's footage would show that, contradicting Oldbag's claim that it was the Nickel Samurai. Therefore, the evidence is the Spy Camera (21) and the testimony is Oldbag's Testimony 4. That would be the pair.

{"evidence": 21, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. We need to find a contradiction between one of the evidences and one of the testimonies given the characters, evidences, and testimonies provided. The answer should be in the form of a JSON object indicating the evidence number and testimony number that contradict each other.

First, I'll review the testimonies. Testimony 0 to 5 are all from Adrian Andrews (Character 8). Let's go through each one.

Testimony 0: She went to get Matt from his room when the show was starting.
Testimony 1: She then went to Juan's room.
Testimony 2: Found Juan's dead body and was in shock.
Testimony 3: She saw the exact scene as in the crime photo (Evidence 9).
Testimony 4: She poured herself a glass of juice because she felt faint.
Testimony 5: She admits to knocking over the flower vase onto the guitar case.

Now, looking at the evidence related to these testimonies. Let's check Evidence 9, the crime photo. The description mentions a glass of juice on the dresser behind the victim, a full bottle on the desk, and a smashed vase staining the carpet with water next to the guitar case. 

In Testimony 5, Andrews says she knocked over the vase, causing water to get on the guitar case. However, looking at Evidence 7 (Guitar Case), it states that there's some water, but only on top of the lid. If the vase was knocked over and the water from the vase fell onto the guitar case, the water should be on the carpet (as per the crime photo) and possibly on the side or around the case. However, the guitar case's evidence specifically mentions water only on the lid. This seems contradictory because if the vase was knocked over next to the guitar case, the water would have spilled onto the floor (as per the crime photo) and perhaps splashed onto the case. But the guitar case's water is only on top, which might suggest it was placed there deliberately, not from a spill. 

Alternatively, Testimony 4 says she poured herself a glass of juice (Evidence 8: Wine Glass filled with tomato juice, her fingerprints). But the crime photo (Evidence 9) shows the glass of juice behind the victim on the dresser. If Andrews poured the juice for herself, why is the glass behind the victim? Also, the autopsy report (Evidence 14) states the cause of death was strangulation with a scarf and then stabbing. The knife in Evidence 15 has Engarde's fingerprints, but the autopsy says he was strangled first. However, that might not directly relate to the testimonies.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 3 says Andrews saw the exact scene as in the crime photo. The crime photo includes the smashed vase with water on the carpet. But in Testimony 5, Andrews says she knocked over the vase, causing it to fall onto the guitar case. However, the crime photo shows the guitar case next to the remains of the vase. If she knocked it over onto the case, maybe the water would have spilled onto the case's lid. But Evidence 7 says the guitar case has water only on top of the lid, which might imply that the water was placed there intentionally, not spilled from the vase. Alternatively, if the vase was smashed, the water would be on the carpet and possibly splashed on the case's side or around it, but the case's lid having water only on top suggests maybe someone placed water there, not from the vase. This could be a contradiction between Testimony 5 (Andrews says she knocked over the vase onto the guitar case) and Evidence 7 (water only on the lid), implying the water on the case isn't from the vase spill.

But wait, the crime photo (Evidence 9) mentions the smashed vase has stained the carpet with water. So the water from the vase is on the carpet, but the guitar case has water on the lid. If the vase was knocked over near the guitar case, maybe the water from the vase's fall would be on the floor and maybe splashed onto the case's lid. However, the guitar case's evidence says there's water only on the lid. If the vase was spilled next to it, maybe the case's lid would have water from the splash, but the description of the crime photo says the carpet is stained with water. The contradiction here is that if Andrews knocked over the vase onto the guitar case (Testimony 5), the water would have spilled both on the carpet and possibly the case. But the guitar case's water is only on the lid. That might not be a direct contradiction unless there's more.

Alternatively, looking at the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) which has Andrews' fingerprints and is filled with tomato juice. Testimony 4 says she poured herself a glass of juice, but the glass in the crime scene is behind the victim. If she poured it for herself, why is the glass behind the victim? Maybe she moved it there, but that's unclear. However, the autopsy report says the time of death is 8:15 PM. If the spy camera (Evidence 21) was set to record from 8 PM for an hour, it should have captured the murder. But the Video Tape (Evidence 29) is from De Killer's hideout and might have the footage. However, this might relate to another part.

Another angle: The Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but the autopsy says the cause of death was strangulation first. So the stabbing was post-mortem, which might mean the killer tried to frame Engarde by using his knife after death. But how does this relate to the testimonies?

Wait, let's refocus. The question is which testimony and evidence directly contradict each other. Let's check Testimony 3 where Andrews says she saw the exact scene as in the crime photo. The crime photo (Evidence 9) includes a glass of juice behind the victim on the dresser. But according to Testimony 4, she poured herself a glass of juice (the one with her fingerprints, Evidence 8). So the glass in the crime photo (behind the victim) would be the one she poured, but if she poured it after finding the body, how did the glass get there? Because the victim was already dead. Wait, the autopsy report says time of death is 8:15 PM. If Andrews went to the room after the show started, which was presumably after 8 PM, then she arrived after the murder. She poured the juice after seeing the body. So the glass she poured would be in the room, which is the one in the crime photo. But the crime photo shows the glass behind the victim on the dresser, which is where Andrews might have placed it. But Evidence 8 says the glass was found next to the victim. Wait, the crime photo's description says "a glass of juice sits behind him on the dresser". The Wine Glass (Evidence 8) is found next to the victim, filled with tomato juice. So there's a contradiction here. If the glass is behind the victim on the dresser (per the crime photo), but the Evidence 8 says it was found next to the victim, maybe that's a discrepancy. But perhaps the positioning is the same. Alternatively, maybe the glass in the crime photo is the one Andrews poured, which has her fingerprints. That's consistent. So Testimony 4 says she poured the juice, which matches Evidence 8 having her fingerprints. So no contradiction there.

Wait, maybe looking at Testimony 5. Andrews says she knocked over the vase, which fell onto the guitar case. The crime photo (Evidence 9) shows the smashed vase next to the guitar case, staining the carpet with water. The Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has water only on top of the lid. If the vase was knocked over onto the guitar case, the water would have spilled onto the case's lid and the carpet. But the guitar case's description says "some water, but only on top of the lid". This suggests that the water on the lid is from the vase being knocked over. However, if the vase was smashed on the floor, the water would primarily be on the carpet, but some might have splashed onto the case. But the case's lid having water only on top could imply that the water was placed there, not from the vase spill. Alternatively, maybe the vase's water spilled onto the lid when it fell. This might not be a direct contradiction. 

Wait another angle: The autopsy report (Evidence 14) states that the cause of death was strangulation with a scarf, then stabbed. The knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but the stabbing was after death. So the real cause was strangulation. However, if the killer used a scarf to strangle, then the knife is a red herring. But how does this relate to testimonies?

Alternatively, let's look at the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) set to record from 8 PM for 1 hour. If the murder happened at 8:15 PM, the camera should have recorded it. But the Video Tape (Evidence 29) from De Killer's hideout might have the footage. However, if the spy camera was in the stuffed bear (Evidence 23), which Engarde bought (Evidence 24), then Engarde set up the camera. If the camera was running, but the Video Tape is with De Killer, there's a contradiction. But maybe the footage shows something different. However, this might not directly relate to the testimonies.

Wait, Testimony 3 says Andrews saw the exact scene as in the crime photo. Let's look at the crime photo's details. The victim is sitting on a chair in a samurai outfit with a knife in his chest. The glass of juice is behind him, a full bottle in front, and the guitar case is open with the smashed vase. Now, the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) is empty with water only on the lid and Corrida's fingerprints. If the case was open, perhaps the guitar was missing. But the knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but the real cause was strangulation. The contradiction here is that the crime scene photo shows the knife in the chest, but the autopsy says the victim was strangled first. So the presence of the knife might be staged. But how does this relate to a testimony?

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3 (Andrews says she saw the exact scene as in the crime photo) and the crime photo (Evidence 9) which includes the knife in the chest. However, the autopsy report (Evidence 14) states the cause of death was strangulation, not the stabbing. Therefore, the knife was planted after death. If Andrews saw the knife in the chest when she arrived, that's consistent with the crime photo. But the real cause of death was strangulation. This isn't a direct contradiction between testimony and evidence, but rather between the autopsy and the presence of the knife. But the question is about a testimony and evidence contradicting.

Another angle: The Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has Andrews' fingerprints and is filled with tomato juice. Testimony 4 says she poured herself a glass of juice. However, the crime photo shows a full bottle of juice on the desk. If she poured from that bottle, the bottle would have been opened and partially empty, but the crime photo says it's a full bottle. That's a contradiction. Because if she poured a glass from the bottle, the bottle should no longer be full. But in the crime photo, the bottle is full. Therefore, Testimony 4 (Andrews pouring a glass) contradicts Evidence 9 (full bottle in the crime photo). Because after pouring, the bottle would not be full anymore. 

Yes, this seems like a solid contradiction. Let's verify:

Testimony 4: Andrews says she poured herself a glass of juice from the bottle. If the bottle was full before she poured, then after pouring a glass, the bottle should be less than full. However, Evidence 9 (crime photo) describes the bottle as full. Therefore, the testimony contradicts the evidence. The full bottle indicates that no one poured from it after the murder, but Andrews claims she did. So the evidence (full bottle) contradicts her testimony that she poured juice from it, which would require the bottle to be partially empty.

Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 4. However, Evidence 9's description says "a full bottle of juice sits on the desk in front of him." So if Andrews poured from that bottle, it shouldn't be full anymore. Thus, her testimony about pouring a glass contradicts the evidence of the full bottle.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to identify one pair where the evidence contradicts a testimony.

First, let me look through the testimonies. The testimonies given are all from Adrian Andrews (Testimony 0 to 3). Her statements are about opening the guitar case, knocking over a vase, and not knowing why she opened the case. The key points here are the guitar case and the vase.

Looking at the evidences related to the guitar case. Evidence 7 is the Guitar Case. It says the case was found empty with water only on the lid, and only Corrida's fingerprints. But according to Andrews' testimonies (Testimony 1 and 2), she opened the case after knocking over a vase. If she opened it, her fingerprints should be on the case. However, the evidence states that the case bears only Corrida's fingerprints. That's a contradiction because if Andrews touched it, her prints should be there. So her testimony says she opened the case, but the evidence says only the victim's prints are present. That would mean she's lying or mistaken, which is a contradiction.

Let me double-check. Testimony 1: Andrews says she opened the guitar case after knocking over the vase. Evidence 7: Guitar Case has only Corrida's fingerprints. Therefore, if she opened it, her prints should be on the case. Since they aren't, this is a contradiction. So the pair would be Evidence 7 and Testimony 1 or 2. Wait, Testimony 1 is about opening the case after knocking over the vase. The evidence says the case has only Corrida's fingerprints, so her testimony contradicts the evidence. Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 7 and Testimony 1.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 1}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Let me start by going through each testimony and cross-referencing with the evidence to spot inconsistencies.

Testimony 0: Adrian Andrews says that from the moment she saw the crime scene, she thought Matt was the murderer. The main evidence pointing to Matt would be the Knife (Evidence 15) with his fingerprints and the Jammin' Ninja's button (Evidence 16) in his hakama. Testimony 4 also mentions that the button and knife confirm her thoughts. But wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 14) says the cause of death was strangulation first, then stabbing. So the knife might have been planted after death. That could be a contradiction if the testimonies claim Matt killed him with the knife, but the actual cause was strangulation. However, Testimony 5 says the button was torn off during a fight between Matt and Juan. If the fight happened, but Juan was strangled first, maybe the fight was staged after death? Hmm.

Looking at Testimony 5: The button was torn off during their fight. But Evidence 16 says the button is covered in Corrida's blood. If the fight happened when Corrida was alive, the blood would be from the stabbing. But the autopsy says he was strangled first. If he was already dead when the button was torn, there wouldn't be much bleeding. So the presence of blood on the button suggests the fight happened before death. But according to the autopsy, the stabbing was post-mortem. Wait, the cause of death is strangulation. So the stabbing occurred after death. So if the button was torn during a fight, that fight would have happened before the strangulation? That might not make sense. Or perhaps the button was torn during the strangulation? But if Corrida was strangled, maybe there was a struggle where the button was ripped, leading to blood from a wound. But the autopsy says he was strangled to death first, then stabbed. So the blood on the button might be from the stabbing, which was post-mortem. But if Corrida was already dead when stabbed, then the blood wouldn't be flowing, so the button might not have much blood. This is a possible contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3: Andrews says Matt didn't have an alibi. But Evidence 21 is the spy camera set to record the victim's room from 8 PM for 1 hour. If the camera was running, maybe it shows that Matt wasn't there, but the evidence (like the stuffed bear purchased by Engarde, Evidence 24) suggests he set up the camera. If the spy camera was in the room, and Matt bought the bear with the camera, maybe he was elsewhere, but the alibi is covered by the camera's presence? Wait, but the testimony says he didn't have an alibi. If the spy camera's footage shows someone else, that would contradict the testimony. But the problem is that the video tape (Evidence 29) from De Killer's hideout might have the real footage. If the spy camera was transmitting via the transmitter (Evidence 22), and the Video Tape (29) might have the actual recording, which could show that someone else committed the murder. But I'm not sure if that's directly a contradiction with Andrews' testimony.

Another angle: The Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has Andrews' fingerprints. If she was present at the scene, but she's claiming Matt did it, perhaps her fingerprints being there contradict her testimony? But she might have a reason to be there. Also, the Magazine Clipping (11) talks about Corrida and A.A. (Adrian Andrews) having a relationship, which could be a motive for her. But how does that contradict her testimony?

Wait, looking at Testimony 5: The button was torn off during the fight between Matt and Juan. But Evidence 16 says the button is covered in Corrida's blood. If Corrida was strangled first, then stabbed, the blood from the stabbing would be post-mortem, which doesn't flow as much. So the presence of blood on the button suggests that the fight happened when Corrida was alive and bleeding, but the autopsy says he was strangled to death first. So the button being torn off during a fight (which would have to be before strangulation) but covered in blood from the stabbing (post-mortem) is a contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 5 (button torn during fight) and the autopsy report (Evidence 14) that says death by strangulation first. But how does that tie into the evidence vs testimony contradiction?

Alternatively, the actual contradiction could be between Testimony 5 (button torn during fight with Matt) and Evidence 16 (button covered in blood). If the fight happened before the strangulation, then the blood from the stabbing (post-mortem) wouldn't be present during the fight. Therefore, the button shouldn't have blood if the fight was before death by strangulation. But the button is covered in blood, implying the fight occurred when the stabbing happened. But the autopsy says death was from strangulation, then stabbed. So the stabbing was after death, so the blood wouldn't spurt, hence the button shouldn't have much blood. Therefore, the button's presence with blood contradicts Testimony 5's claim that it was torn during a fight (which would have to be before the strangulation). Therefore, the evidence (16) contradicts Testimony 5.

Alternatively, maybe the knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but the actual cause of death was strangulation, so the knife isn't the murder weapon. Therefore, Testimony 4, which says the knife and button confirmed her thoughts, contradicts Evidence 14 (autopsy) which shows the cause of death wasn't the stabbing. So Testimony 4 (points to the knife as evidence) contradicts the autopsy report (Evidence 14) which says cause of death was strangulation, not the stabbing. Therefore, the knife's presence with Engarde's prints might be a red herring, and the testimonies citing the knife as evidence are contradicted by the autopsy report.

So which pair should be the answer? The user wants one pair. Let's look for the most direct contradiction.

Testimony 4: "My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife..."

But the autopsy (Evidence 14) says the cause of death was strangulation. Therefore, even if the knife has Engarde's prints, it's not the murder weapon. Therefore, the testimony that the knife confirms Matt's guilt is contradicted by the autopsy report. So Evidence 14 (autopsy) contradicts Testimony 4 (which references the knife as evidence of murder). However, the testimony doesn't explicitly say the knife was the murder weapon, just that it's evidence. But if the prosecution claims Matt used the knife to kill, but the autopsy shows death was by strangulation, that's a contradiction. So the testimony (4) cites the knife as evidence of Matt's guilt, but the autopsy (14) shows that the stabbing wasn't the cause of death, making the knife irrelevant to the actual murder. Therefore, Evidence 14 and Testimony 4 contradict each other. However, the user's answer should be in the format {"evidence": number, "testimony": number}, so Evidence 14 (Juan's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 4 (Andrews' testimony about the button and knife confirming her thoughts). Alternatively, if the knife's fingerprints are on the knife, but the knife wasn't the murder weapon, then the presence of the knife is not proof of murder. Therefore, the testimony's reliance on the knife as evidence is contradicted by the autopsy report.

Another angle: Testimony 5 says the button was torn off during the fight between Matt and Juan. But the button (Evidence 16) is covered in blood, implying that the fight caused bleeding. However, if the victim was strangled first, then stabbed post-mortem, the blood from the stabbing would not be flowing, so the button shouldn't be covered in blood. Therefore, Testimony 5 (button torn during fight) is contradicted by the autopsy report (Evidence 14) which indicates that the stabbing (and thus the blood) happened after death. So the presence of blood on the button (Evidence 16) contradicts Testimony 5. Therefore, Evidence 16 and Testimony 5.

Alternatively, the testimony says the button was torn off during the fight, but if the victim was already dead (strangled), then there would be no struggle, so the button couldn't have been torn during a fight. Therefore, Testimony 5 is contradicted by the autopsy report (Evidence 14) which states that death was by strangulation, implying that the button was torn after death, possibly during the stabbing. But the stabbing was post-mortem, so the blood would be minimal, but the button is covered in blood. So perhaps the button was planted. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (button torn during fight) and Evidence 14 (cause of death is strangulation, so the fight couldn't have happened after death). Hence, the button's blood presence suggests it was part of the stabbing, which happened post-mortem, contradicting the testimony that it was torn during a fight (which would have to be before death).

But how does this link to the evidence? The button is Evidence 16, covered in blood. The testimony is Testimony 5. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 14 (autopsy) and Evidence 16.

Alternatively, the button (Evidence 16) being found in Engarde's hakama with Corrida's blood. If the fight happened during the murder, but the cause of death was strangulation, then the stabbing (which caused the blood) happened after death, so the button shouldn't have blood from the fight. Therefore, Testimony 5 (button torn during fight) is contradicted by the fact that the blood on the button came from a post-mortem stabbing, implying the button was placed there after death, not during a fight. Hence, the evidence (button with blood) and Testimony 5 contradict each other.

So the answer would be Evidence 16 and Testimony 5. Let me check again:

Testimony 5: The button was torn off during the fight between Matt and Juan.

Evidence 16: Button is covered in Corrida's blood.

But the autopsy says death was by strangulation first. So during the fight (if it happened before death), the victim would be alive, and the stabbing (with blood) happened after death. Therefore, if the button was torn during the fight, which was before strangulation, then the blood on the button must have come from the stabbing. But if the stabbing was post-mortem, there wouldn't be much blood. Therefore, the presence of blood on the button suggests that the button was torn during the stabbing, which contradicts Testimony 5's claim that it was torn during a fight (which would have to be before the strangulation). Therefore, the evidence (16) contradicts the testimony (5).

Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the JSON should be {"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}.

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to find one pair where the evidence and testimony don't align.

First, I'll look through the testimonies. The testimonies from Andrews (Testimony 0 to 5) are about her finding the victim and pouring juice. Let me check each testimony against the evidences.

Testimony 5 says: "When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over." So she claims she knocked over the vase when she realized he was dead.

Looking at the evidence related to the vase. Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) mentions the remains of a smashed vase that stained the carpet with water. Also, Evidence 7 (Guitar Case) says there's water on top of the lid. The crime photo shows the guitar case next to the smashed vase. If the vase was knocked over when she realized he was dead, then the water from the vase would have gotten on the guitar case. But Evidence 7 states the water is only on the lid of the guitar case. If the vase was smashed next to it, the water would have spilled around, possibly getting the case wet from the sides or the floor. However, the water is only on top, which might suggest the vase wasn't smashed there. Alternatively, maybe the timing is off. If she knocked over the vase after the guitar case was placed, the water would be on the lid. But according to her testimony, she knocked it over when she realized he was dead, which would be after the murder. The guitar case was already there, so the water from the vase would have splashed onto the case. But the evidence says only the lid has water. This could be a contradiction because if the vase was smashed next to the case, water would be on the case's lid and possibly other parts, but the evidence specifies only the lid. Alternatively, maybe the water on the lid comes from another source, like condensation, but the vase's water is from the smashed vase. Therefore, Andrews' testimony about knocking over the vase causing the water on the carpet and the guitar case's lid having water might not align. The contradiction would be that if the vase was knocked over next to the guitar case, the water would have splashed onto the case, but the evidence says only the lid has water, which might not fit if the vase was the source. Alternatively, maybe the guitar case was placed after the vase was smashed, but that's not indicated. So the contradiction here is between Testimony 5 (Andrews knocking over the vase upon realizing he's dead) and Evidence 7 (water only on the guitar case's lid), suggesting that the water from the vase should have affected more of the case or the carpet as per the crime photo. Wait, the crime photo says the smashed vase has stained the carpet with water, and the guitar case is next to it. But the guitar case's evidence says there's some water only on the lid. So if the vase was smashed next to the case, the water would have gotten on the lid and possibly the sides. The fact that only the lid has water might indicate that the vase was smashed after the case was placed, but how would that happen? Alternatively, maybe the water on the lid is from something else, not the vase. If Andrews knocked over the vase when she realized he was dead (as per her testimony), then the water from the vase would be on the carpet and possibly the case. But the guitar case's water is only on the lid. That might suggest that the water on the lid isn't from the vase. But the only source mentioned is the vase. So this inconsistency could be the contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 7 (Guitar Case) and Testimony 5 (Andrews knocking over the vase) contradict each other because the water on the guitar case's lid should have come from the vase, but the testimony says the vase was knocked over after the case was already there, yet the water is only on the lid. Alternatively, maybe the vase was broken before the case was placed, which would explain the water only on the lid, but Andrews' testimony says she broke it after finding the body. Therefore, this inconsistency points to a contradiction.

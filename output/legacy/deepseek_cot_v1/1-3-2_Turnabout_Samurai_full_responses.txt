Okay, let's start by looking through the testimonies and the evidences to find contradictions. The Security Lady (Character 4) is the one giving the testimonies here. Let me check her statements.

Testimony 3 says she arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Then Testimony 4 claims she was at the main gate from then until 5:00 PM. She also mentions in Testimony 6 and 7 that she saw Will Powers (the defendant) walking by her at 2:00 PM heading toward the studio.

Now, looking at the evidence, Evidence 5 is a photo taken at the gate at 2:00 PM (Photo #2). The caption mentions the Steel Samurai (who is Will Powers) dragging one leg. The photo's time is 2:00 PM. However, the Security Lady says she saw Powers in person at 2:00 PM. But if the photo was taken at the same time and shows the Steel Samurai (Powers) at the gate, then how could she have seen him in person if the photo captures him there? Wait, maybe the photo's time and her testimony conflict. Wait, the Security Lady claims she was at the main gate from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. If the photo shows Powers at 2:00 PM at the gate, then her seeing him there in person would align, but maybe there's a contradiction elsewhere.

Wait, the key contradiction might be the timing of the murder. The autopsy report (Evidence 3) states the time of death as 2:30 PM. The murder weapon is the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6). The Security Lady's Testimony 7 says Powers was heading toward the studio at 2:00 PM, implying he went there before the murder. However, Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head) blocked the path from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. So if Powers went to the studio at 2:00 PM, he would have had to pass before the path was blocked. But if the murder happened at 2:30 PM, the path was blocked from 2:15 PM onward. So if the killer needed to access the scene after 2:15 PM, they couldn't. But maybe the Security Lady's testimony that Powers went to the studio at 2:00 PM is contradicted by the photo evidence. Wait, Evidence 5 is the photo taken at 2:00 PM showing the Steel Samurai (Powers) at the gate. But the Security Lady claims she saw Powers in person at the same time. However, if the Steel Samurai in the photo is Powers, then that's consistent. But wait, in the photo's will, Powers says, "When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask..." So the photo is of the Steel Samurai, which is Powers. But if the Security Lady saw Powers (in costume) at 2:00 PM going towards the studio, and the photo shows him there, maybe there's no contradiction. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between the photo and her testimony. The photo is taken at 2:00 PM at the gate, showing the Steel Samurai. If the Security Lady was at the main gate from 1:00 to 5:00 PM, she would have seen the Steel Samurai (Powers) passing by. But the photo's caption says the Steel Samurai is dragging one leg. However, in the script (Evidence 10, Episode 13), maybe the Steel Samurai's movements are different. Alternatively, maybe the photo shows that the Steel Samurai was at the gate at 2:00 PM, but if the path was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head from 2:15 PM, then if Powers went in at 2:00 PM, he could have been at the scene. But the murder was at 2:30 PM. However, the problem could be that the Security Lady's testimony claims she saw Powers going to the studio at 2:00 PM, but Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head) would block the path starting at 2:15 PM. So if Powers went in at 2:00 PM, he could have been there, but how did he leave after 2:15 PM? But the murder happened at 2:30 PM. Wait, but the path was blocked until 4:00 PM. So if the killer had to be there at 2:30 PM, but the path was blocked, then only someone already in the studio could have done it. However, the Security Lady's testimony that Powers went in at 2:00 PM would mean he was there before the path was blocked, so he could have stayed and committed the murder. But maybe the contradiction is that the photo shows the Steel Samurai (Powers) at 2:00 PM, but if the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, then the Security Lady's testimony that he went towards the studio at 2:00 PM is possible, but maybe there's a contradiction with another evidence. Alternatively, perhaps the photo shows that the Steel Samurai was at the gate at 2:00 PM, but the Security Lady's testimony says she saw Powers (the man himself) at that time. However, if Powers was in the Steel Samurai costume, then she might not recognize him as Powers, unless she knew he was the one in the costume. Wait, but in the description of Evidence 5, the will of Powers says "No, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask..." implying that when he's in costume, he's unrecognizable. So the Security Lady claims she saw Powers (the person) at 2:00 PM, but the photo taken at the same time shows the Steel Samurai (costume) at the gate. If Powers was in costume, the Security Lady wouldn't have recognized him as Powers. Therefore, her Testimony 7, where she says she saw Powers, is contradicted by the photo which shows the Steel Samurai (Powers in costume) at the same time. Therefore, she couldn't have seen Powers' face, only the costume, meaning she couldn't have identified him as Powers. Therefore, her testimony that she saw Powers is contradicted by the photo, which shows the Steel Samurai (who is Powers) at 2:00 PM, implying she saw the costume, not the man's face. Thus, the Security Lady's Testimony 7 is contradicted by Evidence 5 (the photo) because she claims to have seen Powers in person, but the photo shows he was in costume, making identification impossible. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 7 (where she claims it was Powers) and Evidence 5 (showing the Steel Samurai, which is Powers in costume, so she couldn't have known it was him). So the pair is Evidence 5 and Testimony 7. But looking at the indexes: Testimony 7 is the one where she says "It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!" and Evidence 5 is the photo. Therefore, the answer would be {"evidence":5, "testimony":7}.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 7}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. We need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all given. Let's start by going through the testimonies first.

The testimonies in question are all from Oldbag (Security Lady, Character 4). Testimony 0 states the time of death as 2:30 PM, which matches the autopsy report (Evidence 3), so that seems consistent. Then Testimonies 1, 2, and 3 all revolve around Oldbag claiming that the only person she saw going to the studio before the time of death was Will Powers, and that no one else could have gone without her seeing them.

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 5 is Powers'(?) Photo, taken at the gate at 2:00 PM, showing the Steel Samurai dragging one leg. The description mentions that the camera automatically takes a picture when someone walks by. The photo shows the Steel Samurai (which is Will Powers' character) at 2:00 PM. But the murder happened at 2:30 PM. However, Oldbag claims that she saw Powers heading to the scene, and that no one else went there. But wait, if the camera took a photo at 2:00 PM of the Steel Samurai (Powers) entering, but the murder was at 2:30 PM, does that contradict her statement?

Wait, let me check. The Security Lady (Oldbag) says she saw Powers going to the studio before the time of death (2:30 PM). The photo shows the Steel Samurai (Powers) entering at 2:00 PM. That seems to support her testimony. But maybe there's another angle. Let's look at other evidences.

Evidence 11 is Mr. Monkey's Head, which blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. So after 2:15 PM, the path was blocked. The murder was at 2:30 PM. So if the path was blocked from 2:15 onwards, how did the killer get to the scene? Unless they were already there before 2:15. Wait, the victim died at 2:30 PM. So the murderer must have been present at the scene before 2:15 PM, when the path was blocked. Because after 2:15, they couldn't get in or out. So if the murderer was already there before 2:15, they could commit the murder at 2:30. 

But the Security Lady says she only saw Powers go in before the time of death. But if the path was blocked from 2:15, then Powers entered at 2:00 PM (per the photo), which is before 2:15, so he could have been there. However, if someone else entered before 2:15, the camera would have taken their photo. But Oldbag claims she didn't see anyone else. Wait, the camera takes a photo automatically when someone walks by. So if someone else entered, their photo would have been taken. The Security Lady's testimony (Testimony 3) says if someone else went in, she would have seen them. But maybe the camera's photo contradicts this. Let me check Evidence 5 again.

Evidence 5: Photo taken at 2:00 PM shows Steel Samurai (Powers) entering. The camera takes a photo automatically. So if someone else entered after Powers, say at 2:10 PM, the camera would have taken their photo. But Oldbag says she didn't see anyone else. However, there's no other photo mentioned. Unless there's another entry. Wait, but the photo is only of Powers. So if the camera automatically takes a photo whenever someone passes, then the absence of other photos would indicate that no one else entered. But wait, maybe the camera only takes a photo when someone enters, not exits. Or perhaps the murderer was already inside before the camera started taking photos. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the Steel Samurai in the photo isn't Powers. Wait, the photo's caption says "Steel Samurai is seen walking. He's dragging one leg." But the Steel Samurai is played by Will Powers (Character 3). However, if someone else was dressed as the Steel Samurai, that would be possible. For instance, if someone else put on the costume and entered, the camera would capture that person, but Oldbag would think it's Powers. But Powers is the defendant. So if the photo shows the Steel Samurai at 2:00 PM, but the real killer was someone else in the costume, then Oldbag's testimony that she only saw Powers (assuming the Steel Samurai is Powers) would be incorrect. However, the evidence doesn't explicitly state that the person in the photo is Powers, only that the caption says "Steel Samurai is seen walking." But according to the Characters list, Will Powers plays the Steel Samurai. So the assumption is that the person in the photo is Powers. But if someone else was wearing the costume, then that's a contradiction. 

Wait, let's think again. The testimony from Oldbag says she saw Powers going to the studio. The photo shows the Steel Samurai (Powers) entering at 2:00 PM. However, the murder happened at 2:30 PM. But the path was blocked from 2:15 PM onwards. So if Powers entered at 2:00 PM, he could be at the scene, but the path was blocked after 2:15, meaning he couldn't leave until after 4:00 PM. But the murder was at 2:30 PM. So Powers was there, but so could the killer, if the killer was already inside. However, the contradiction might come from another angle.

Wait, the Security Lady (Oldbag) says that no one else went to the studio, and she would have seen them. But Evidence 5's photo shows the Steel Samurai entering at 2:00 PM, but what if another person entered after that? The camera takes a photo automatically when someone walks by. If someone else entered after 2:00 PM but before 2:15 PM (when the path was blocked), their photo would have been taken. But there's no mention of another photo. Therefore, the lack of other photos supports Oldbag's testimony. Hmm. Then where's the contradiction?

Wait, let's check other evidences. Evidence 18 is the Van used by Manella to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer. If they were driven to Studio One after the meeting, perhaps after 2:15 PM, but the path was blocked. Wait, but the path was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head from 2:15 to 4:00 PM. So how did the van get through? Unless they took another route. But the guidemap (Evidence 2) might show alternative paths. Alternatively, maybe the van was used before the path was blocked. Hmm, but that's not directly conflicting with Oldbag's testimony.

Another angle: The script (Evidence 10) from Episode 13. Vasquez's memo (Evidence 9) says to bring the script. Maybe this relates to someone needing the script, but not sure how it contradicts.

The Empty Bottle (Evidence 7) has Jack Hammer's fingerprints and sleeping pills. The Steak Plate (Evidence 16) has traces of sleeping pills and a bone. Maybe someone drugged the steak, which Jack ate, making him unconscious. But the autopsy says cause of death was a spear through the chest, not the pills. So perhaps the pills were used to subdue him, but that's not directly conflicting with testimonies.

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Oldbag's testimony that only Powers entered and the possibility that someone else entered but wasn't detected. But how? The camera's photo at 2:00 PM of Powers (as Steel Samurai) entering. If the murderer was already inside before 2:00 PM, then they wouldn't trigger the camera. For example, if the killer was in the studio before 2:00 PM, they could commit the murder at 2:30 PM. But Oldbag's testimony says she only saw Powers go in before the murder. If someone else was already inside, she wouldn't have seen them enter, so her testimony that "no one else went there" would still hold. Wait, but the camera only takes photos when someone walks by. So if the killer was already inside before the camera started taking photos (assuming the camera operates only at certain times), but the photo at 2:00 PM suggests that the camera was active then. 

Alternatively, the contradiction could be that the photo shows the Steel Samurai dragging one leg. Will Powers, as an action star, might not drag his leg. If the real Powers has an injury, but maybe someone else in the costume is faking it. For example, if the real killer wore the costume and dragged their leg, making it seem like Powers, but Powers has an alibi. Wait, but the defendant is Will Powers. So if the photo shows the Steel Samurai dragging a leg, perhaps that's not Powers but someone else, meaning Oldbag's testimony that she saw Powers is incorrect. But the description of the photo says "Steel Samurai is seen walking. He's dragging one leg." The caption is from the photo. If Powers doesn't drag his leg normally, this could indicate it's an imposter. Therefore, Oldbag's testimony that she saw Powers (Testimony 1) is contradicted by the photo showing someone else in the costume (because of the leg dragging). But how do we know Powers doesn't drag his leg? The character description for Will Powers says he plays the Steel Samurai. If in the show, the Steel Samurai doesn't drag his leg, but the photo shows him doing so, that might indicate it's not the real actor. For example, if the real Steel Samurai (Powers) moves normally, but the person in the photo is limping, that could be someone else. Therefore, Oldbag's testimony that she saw Powers entering is contradicted by the photo suggesting it's someone else. Thus, Evidence 5 (Powers'(?) Photo) contradicts Testimony 1 or 3. 

But which testimony? Testimony 1: "The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!" If the photo shows someone else in the costume, then Oldbag's claim that she saw Powers is incorrect because she actually saw the impostor. But since the camera's photo is automated, it's possible that Oldbag didn't physically see the person but relies on the camera. Wait, the testimony says "If they had, I would have seen them!" (Testimony 3). But the camera's photo is automated, so even if someone else went in, the camera would have taken a photo. But the Security Lady claims she would have seen them. However, if someone else entered and the camera took their photo, but there's no other photo mentioned, then her testimony that no one else entered is supported. Unless there is another photo. Wait, but in Evidence 5, there's only Photo #2 at 2:00 PM. If the murderer entered at a different time, the camera would have taken another photo. But the evidence doesn't list other photos. Therefore, the Security Lady's testimony that no one else entered is supported by the camera's photos. So where's the contradiction?

Wait, the murder weapon is the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6), which has a break mended with duct tape. If the spear was broken and repaired, maybe that relates to a previous incident. The Five-Year-Old Photo (Evidence 17) shows an accident involving Jack Hammer. Maybe that's related to the broken spear. But not directly contradicting testimonies.

Another angle: The Security Lady says that Powers was the only one who went to the studio before the murder (2:30 PM). However, the Steel Samurai (Powers) was photographed entering at 2:00 PM, but the path was blocked from 2:15 PM. So if Powers entered at 2:00, he could have been at the scene. But the murder happened at 2:30 PM. However, the path was blocked at 2:15, meaning that after 2:15, no one could enter or exit. So the killer must have been there before 2:15. But the Security Lady's testimony is that no one else entered except Powers. If the killer was already inside before 2:00 PM, then they wouldn't have been seen by the camera or Oldbag. But Oldbag's testimony is about people going to the studio before the murder (before 2:30). So if the killer was already inside before 2:00 PM, they wouldn't have been seen entering, hence Oldbag's testimony that no one else went there would still hold. But how does that contradict?

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that the Security Lady claims she saw Powers going to the studio, but the photo shows the Steel Samurai (who she assumes is Powers) entering at 2:00 PM. However, if Powers had an alibi for that time, then the person in the photo is someone else. But the defendant is Powers, so the photo is used to implicate him. However, the leg dragging might indicate it's not him. For example, if Powers had an injury that caused him to drag his leg, then the photo supports it. But if he doesn't, then the photo suggests an imposter. But the character description doesn't mention any injury for Powers. So if the photo shows the Steel Samurai dragging a leg, and Powers doesn't do that, it implies someone else. Thus, the Security Lady's testimony that she saw Powers is contradicted by the photo showing someone else. Therefore, Evidence 5 contradicts Testimony 1 or 3. Specifically, Testimony 3: "If they had, I would have seen them!" But if the camera's photo shows someone else, then Oldbag's claim that she saw Powers is wrong. But the camera's photo is of the Steel Samurai, which she would assume is Powers. So maybe there's no contradiction here. Hmm.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 1 ("only person I saw was Powers") and the fact that the photo shows the Steel Samurai (Powers) entering at 2:00 PM, but the murder happened at 2:30 PM. However, if the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, then after that, no one could enter. Therefore, the only person who could have entered was Powers at 2:00 PM. So Oldbag's testimony holds. 

Wait, but the murder weapon is the Samurai Spear, which is from the show. If the killer had to retrieve the spear, maybe they had to go to a different location. But I'm not sure.

Another possible contradiction: The Security Lady (Oldbag) says she saw Powers going to the studio before the murder. However, Evidence 8 is the Trailer Key for Studio Two Trailer. If Powers was in Studio Two's trailer, then maybe he couldn't have been at the crime scene. But the key is found where? Not sure. Alternatively, the van (Evidence 18) was used to drive someone to Studio One after a meeting. If the meeting was in the trailer (Studio Two), and they went to Studio One after, maybe that's a different time.

Wait, the Director (Sal Manella) used the van to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer. If the meeting happened before the murder, then they could have been at Studio One during the time of the murder. But the path was blocked from 2:15 PM. So if they arrived at Studio One after 2:15, they couldn't have gotten there because the path was blocked. Unless they took another route. The guidemap (Evidence 2) might show alternative paths. If the van was used to go around the blocked path, then they could have accessed Studio One without passing through the camera's gate. Therefore, Oldbag's testimony that she didn't see anyone else could be contradicted by the fact that someone else (like Vasquez and the Director) used a different route via the van, thus not triggering the camera. Therefore, Evidence 18 (Van) contradicts Testimony 3 ("If they had, I would have seen them!") because they used the van to go to Studio One without passing by the Security Lady's post, thus she wouldn't have seen them. 

So, the van allows them to bypass the camera and the Security Lady's observation. Therefore, even though Oldbag claims no one else went to the studio (because she didn't see them), the van's existence shows that someone else could have accessed the studio without her knowledge. Thus, Evidence 18 contradicts Testimony 3. But let's check the times. The van was used after the meeting in the trailer. If the meeting was before 2:15 PM, and they drove to Studio One after the meeting, then they could have arrived before the path was blocked. Alternatively, if they used the van after 2:15 PM, but the path was blocked, perhaps the van could go around. The guidemap might show that Studio One is accessible via another route that doesn't pass the camera. Therefore, the van's use allows access without being detected by the camera or the Security Lady. Therefore, Oldbag's testimony that she would have seen anyone else is contradicted by the van's existence, as someone could have used it to reach the studio unseen. 

Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 18 and Testimony 3. 

Alternatively, another possibility: The photo in Evidence 5 shows the Steel Samurai (presumed to be Powers) entering at 2:00 PM. The murder happened at 2:30 PM. The path was blocked from 2:15 PM. Therefore, if Powers entered at 2:00 PM, he was there before the path was blocked and couldn't leave until after 4:00 PM. So he was present at the time of the murder. However, the Security Lady's testimony that no one else entered is supported by the camera. But if the real killer used the van to enter Studio One via another route, bypassing the camera and Security Lady, then they could have committed the murder. Thus, Evidence 18 (Van) contradicts Testimony 3, as the killer could have entered via the van without being seen. 

So the contradiction is between the van allowing access without being seen, thus contradicting Oldbag's claim that she would have seen anyone else. Therefore, the answer is Evidence 18 and Testimony 3. 

But wait, the testimonies are from Oldbag, and she's the Security Lady. The van is used by the Director to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting. If this happened after the path was blocked (2:15 PM), then they couldn't have gotten there via the normal path. But the van might have a different route. So if they arrived at Studio One via the van after 2:15 PM, then they would have been present at the scene during the murder (2:30 PM) without being seen by Oldbag or the camera. Therefore, their presence contradicts Oldbag's testimony that no one else entered. Hence, Evidence 18 and Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 3}

Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to go through the testimonies and cross-check them with the provided evidences. 

Looking at the testimonies, the Security Lady (Oldbag) has several statements. Testimony 7 says that she saw Powers walking towards the studio at 2:00 PM. But wait, there's Evidence 5: Powers'(?) Photo, taken at 2:00 PM showing the Steel Samurai (who is Will Powers' character) dragging one leg. The Security Lady claims she saw Powers in person, but the photo might show that it was actually someone in the Steel Samurai costume. If Powers was in the costume at 2 PM, how could she recognize him as Powers? Unless the costume doesn't hide the identity, but maybe the photo shows that the person in the costume was dragging a leg, which could be a clue that it wasn't Powers but someone else. Also, the autopsy report says the time of death was 2:30 PM, so if the real Powers was seen heading to the studio at 2 PM, but the murder happened at 2:30 PM, there's a time frame. However, the contradiction might be that the Security Lady's testimony of seeing Powers at 2 PM is contradicted by the photo showing the Steel Samurai (possibly an impersonator) at the same time, implying that she couldn't have seen Powers himself but someone in the costume.

Another angle: The Security Lady (Oldbag) in Testimony 4 says she was at the main gate from 1 PM until 5 PM, so she couldn't have left. But maybe that's not the contradiction. The key contradiction is between Testimony 7 (saw Powers at 2 PM) and Evidence 5 (photo at 2 PM showing Steel Samurai dragging leg, which might not be Powers). If Powers was in a different location or in costume, maybe the photo shows he wasn't there as himself. For example, if the real Powers was in his trailer or somewhere else, the person in the costume could be someone else, making Oldbag's testimony incorrect. Therefore, the evidence (photo) contradicts her testimony about seeing Powers at 2 PM, because the photo might indicate it was the costume, not Powers himself.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 7}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are given. 

First, let's look at the testimonies provided. Testimony 0 to 3 are all from Oldbag (Security Lady, Character 4). Her testimonies are:

0: Time of death is 2:30 PM (which matches the autopsy report, Evidence 3). So that's consistent.

1: She saw only Will Powers go to the studio before then (before 2:30 PM). 

2: No one else went there. 

3: If they had, she would have seen them.

So Oldbag claims that Powers was the only one who went to the studio before 2:30 PM, and no one else could have entered without her seeing. But I need to find evidence that contradicts her statement.

Looking at the evidences, let's check the ones related to the timeline or presence of others. 

Evidence 5 is a photo taken at the gate at 2:00 PM showing the Steel Samurai (which is Will Powers' character) dragging one leg. However, maybe there's another angle here. Wait, Evidence 18 mentions a van used by Manella (Director, Character 7) to drive Vasquez (Character 9) to Studio One after a meeting in the trailer. If they were driven there, maybe they entered the studio without passing through the security gate where Oldbag was stationed. 

Also, Evidence 18 says the van was used to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting. The time of death is 2:30 PM. If the van was used after the meeting, and the meeting might have been before 2:30, then Vasquez and the Director could have entered the studio via the van, bypassing the security check. Therefore, Oldbag wouldn't have seen them, contradicting her testimony that she would have seen anyone else who entered.

But wait, the photo in Evidence 5 is from 2:00 PM, showing the Steel Samurai (Powers) entering. Then, if the van was used after that, maybe after 2:00 PM but before 2:30 PM. The murder happened at 2:30 PM, so if someone else arrived via the van between 2:00 PM and 2:30 PM, they could have entered without Oldbag seeing. 

So Oldbag's testimony 3 says if anyone else went there, she would have seen them. But Evidence 18 shows that Manella drove Vasquez to Studio One using the van, possibly through another entrance not monitored by Oldbag. Therefore, they could have entered without her knowledge, contradicting her claim that she would have seen anyone else.

Alternatively, there's Evidence 11: Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. But how does that relate to the testimonies? Maybe if the path was blocked, but the murder happened at 2:30 PM, so someone had to get through before the blockage. Not sure if that directly contradicts.

Wait, the murder weapon is the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6), which was mended with duct tape. If the spear was broken, maybe the Steel Samurai in the photo (Evidence 5) dragging his leg is related. But perhaps the key contradiction is between the van (Evidence 18) allowing others to enter without being seen by Oldbag, thus contradicting her testimonies 1,2,3.

So the contradiction would be between Testimony 3 ("If they had, I would have seen them!") and Evidence 18 (Van used to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting). Because the van implies they entered without passing Oldbag's checkpoint, so she didn't see them. Therefore, her testimony is contradicted by Evidence 18, showing that someone else (Vasquez and the Director) could have entered without her seeing.

Wait, but the van is Evidence 18. Let me check the testimonies again. The Security Lady (Oldbag) claims she saw Powers going to the scene (Testimony 1), and no one else (Testimonies 2 and 3). But if the van was used to bring others, then they didn't go through her checkpoint, so she didn't see them. Therefore, Evidence 18 contradicts Testimony 3 (since someone else did go there without her seeing).

So the correct pair is Evidence 18 and Testimony 3. But wait, looking at the Evidence list, Evidence 18 is the van. The testimony in question is Testimony 3: "If they had, I would have seen them!"

Yes. So the van allowed others to enter without her seeing, thus contradicting her claim that she would have seen anyone else. Therefore, the pair is Evidence 18 and Testimony 3.

Wait, but in the answer format, the evidence is numbered. Let me check the evidence numbers:

Evidence 0: Badge

...

Evidence 18: Van (Yes, Evidence 18 is the van). So {"evidence": 18, "testimony": 3}

But wait, in the problem statement, the testimonies are numbered 0 to 3. Testimony 3 is "If they had, I would have seen them!" So the correct pair is Evidence 18 (Van) and Testimony 3.

Yes, that's the contradiction. So the answer should be evidence 18 and testimony 3.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 3}

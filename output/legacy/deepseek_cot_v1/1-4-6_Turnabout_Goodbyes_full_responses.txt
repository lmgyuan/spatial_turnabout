Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants me to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The key here is to go through each testimony and see if any of the evidence directly contradicts it.

First, I'll look at the testimonies provided. Testimony 5 by Edgeworth says there was a single gunshot followed by a scream. Then Testimony 6 mentions the scream. The DL-6 Case File (Evidence 18) states that the murder weapon was fired twice. But wait, Edgeworth's testimony mentions a single gunshot. If the case file says the gun was fired twice, that contradicts the testimony of a single shot. That seems like a contradiction.

But wait, let me check the evidence again. Evidence 18 says the DL-6 murder weapon was fired twice. But Edgeworth's testimony here is about the DL-6 incident, right? So he says there was one gunshot, but the case file says the gun was fired twice. So that's a contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 18. But in the provided list, the user might be looking for contradictions in the current case's evidence and testimony. Wait, the testimonies here are from Edgeworth about the DL-6 incident. The evidence includes DL-6 related items. So yes, Testimony 5 (Edgeworth's account of one gunshot) vs Evidence 18 (DL-6 case file stating two shots). That's a contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at the current case's evidence. Let's see. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) says Robert was shot once. The Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times. But the testimony from Lotta (Testimony 11) says she heard two gunshots. But the pistol was fired three times, which contradicts her two sounds. But Testimony 11 is from Lotta, not Edgeworth. Wait, the user's question is about which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The testimonies listed are from Edgeworth (Testimonies 0-6). So looking at Edgeworth's testimonies.

Wait, Testimony 5: Edgeworth says a single gunshot. But DL-6 Case File (Evidence 18) says the murder weapon was fired twice. That's a direct contradiction. So the pair would be Evidence 18 and Testimony 5. But let me check the numbers. Testimony 5 is Edgeworth's statement about a single gunshot. Evidence 18 is the DL-6 Case File stating the murder weapon was fired twice. So yes, they contradict. But the answer requires the evidence number and testimony number. Testimony 5 is number 5, Evidence 18 is 18. So {"evidence": 18, "testimony": 5}.

Wait, but the user might be looking for current case contradictions. Let me double-check. The DL-6 case is a past incident, but the current case's evidence includes the DL-6 related items. The testimonies here are Edgeworth's about the DL-6 incident. So the contradiction is between his testimony (single shot) and the case file (two shots). Therefore, that's the pair.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 5}

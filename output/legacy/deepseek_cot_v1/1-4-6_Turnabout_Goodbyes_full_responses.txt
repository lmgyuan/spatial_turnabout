Okay, let's start by going through each testimony and cross-referencing them with the evidence provided to find contradictions.

First, looking at Testimony 0 to 6 from Edgeworth. These testimonies are about the DL-6 Incident. Testimony 5 says there was a single gunshot followed by a scream. But looking at the evidence, the DL-6 Case File (Evidence 18) states that the murder weapon was fired twice. Also, the DL-6 Bullet (Evidence 21) was taken from Gregory's heart, which would be one bullet. But the gun being fired twice would mean there's another bullet involved. 

Wait, but in the DL-6 Incident, if the gun was fired twice, but Edgeworth's testimony mentions a single gunshot, that's a contradiction. The case file (Evidence 18) says the murder weapon was fired twice, which contradicts Edgeworth's testimony of a single gunshot. That's a possible contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 18. 

Another point to check: Evidence 19 is the DL-6 Incident Photo with a bullet hole in the door. If the gun was fired twice, there should be two bullet holes or another bullet somewhere. But Edgeworth's testimony says a single shot. So the case file's mention of two shots versus Edgeworth's account of one shot is a direct contradiction. 

Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Edgeworth stating a single gunshot) and Evidence 18 (DL-6 Case File stating the weapon was fired twice).

Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Let me start by going through the testimonies first.

Testimony 3 from Ema says that the victim (Puhray Zeh'lot) was an illegal immigrant, so they don't know his real name. But looking at the evidences, Evidence 16 is the Crime Photo (Zeh'lot), which mentions he has a peach-shaped tattoo on the nape of his neck. Then Rayfa's comment states that all Khura'inist clergy have such marks. Wait, but if Zeh'lot was an apprentice priest living in the high priest's house (Character 6), then he should be part of the clergy. So if all clergy members have that mark, and Zeh'lot has it, he should be recognized as clergy, not an illegal immigrant. But Ema's testimony 3 says he's an illegal immigrant whose real name is unknown. But his clergy mark would indicate he's part of the clergy, which might conflict with him being an illegal immigrant with a fake name. However, maybe being part of the clergy doesn't necessarily mean legal status. Hmm.

Wait, but the contradiction might be elsewhere. Let me check other parts. Evidence 19 is a Brand New Flag with some writing. Testimony 3 says they don't know his real name because he's an illegal immigrant. But if there's a flag with writing that might relate to his real name, but I don't see that. Let me look again.

Wait, Evidence 16's Crime Photo mentions the tattoo, which Rayfa says all clergy have. So if Zeh'lot has the clergy mark, he's a legitimate member, but Ema's testimony 3 claims he's an illegal immigrant. That could be a contradiction. Because if he's part of the clergy, maybe his identity should be known. But the testimony says they don't know his real name because he's an illegal immigrant. But if he's a clergy member, perhaps the authorities should know his real name. So the clergy mark (Evidence 16) would contradict Testimony 3. But wait, the user needs one pair. Let me confirm.

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is with Evidence 3 (Tahrust's Autopsy Report) and some testimony, but not sure. Let me check other testimonies. Testimony 0: latest victim is Zeh'lot. That's confirmed by Evidence 16 and 17. Testimony 1: he was training under the high priest and living there for two years. That's consistent with Character 6. Testimony 2: Beh'leeb identified the body. No contradiction. Testimony 4: mistaken for a rebel. Maybe linked to Evidence 13 (Wanted Poster) but not sure.

Wait, the key point is Testimony 3 says he's an illegal immigrant, so real name unknown. But if he's part of the clergy (as per Character 6 and the mark in Evidence 16), then perhaps he was a legitimate member, which would mean they should know his real name. So the existence of the clergy mark (Evidence 16) contradicts Testimony 3. Because if he has the clergy mark, he's a recognized member, hence not an illegal immigrant whose real name is unknown. Therefore, Evidence 16 and Testimony 3 contradict each other. So the answer would be {"evidence": 16, "testimony": 3}.

Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts which testimony. The characters and all the evidence and testimonies are given. Let's start by going through each testimony and see if any evidence directly contradicts it.

Looking at the testimonies, all of them are from Tahrust. Let's check each one:

Testimony 0: He was entertaining His Magistry and family when the crime occurred. Hmm. Evidence 22 is a family photo taken during the Feast of Blessings the day before the rite. Maybe that's related, but not sure if it contradicts.

Testimony 1: His wife Beh'leeb was in the kitchen cooking. Evidence 21 is Beh'leeb's statement about the Feast of Blessings, which was the day before. Not sure if that's a contradiction. Maybe the timing is different.

Testimony 2: He listened to a tape and heard a man and woman quarreling. Then Testimony 3 says it was Zeh'lot and Maya. But looking at the evidence, Evidence 8 is Maya's statement that when they arrived at the Inner Sanctum, the water was already red. If Maya was with the high priest (Tahrust) when they arrived, then during the rite, she was there. But if Tahrust's testimony says he heard them quarreling, but Maya was with him, that might be a contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 8 says that when Abbot Inmee (Tahrust) and Maya arrived at the Inner Sanctum, the water was already red. So during the rite, Maya was with Tahrust. But Testimony 3 claims that the altercation was between Zeh'lot and Maya. If Maya was with Tahrust during the rite, how could she be quarreling with Zeh'lot elsewhere? Unless the timing is different. But the Purification Rite was when the murder happened. If Tahrust was with Maya during the rite, then Tahrust's testimony about hearing Maya and Zeh'lot quarreling would be impossible because Maya was with him. That's a contradiction.

So Testimony 3 says the altercation was between Zeh'lot and Maya, but Evidence 8 (Maya's Statement) says she was with Tahrust when they arrived, implying they were together during the rite. Therefore, Maya couldn't have been quarreling with Zeh'lot at that time. So Testimony 3 is contradicted by Evidence 8.

Wait, but Evidence 8 is Maya's statement: On the day of the rite, the water was already red when they arrived. So the murder must have happened before they arrived. If Tahrust's testimony is about hearing the quarrel, which he claims to have heard during the time when he was with His Magistry (maybe during the rite), but Maya was with him, then that's a contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 3 (which implicates Maya in the quarrel) is contradicted by Evidence 8 (Maya was with Tahrust when they arrived, implying she was with him during the rite, so couldn't be elsewhere quarreling).

====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So, the task is to find one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony. Let's start by reviewing the given testimonies and the evidences provided.

First, the testimonies from Tahrust Inmee (Character 3). Testimony 0 says that Acolyte Fey (Maya) channeled Lady Kee'ra's spirit. Testimony 1 claims that since Maya knows Lady Kee'ra's true name, she could have done it (presumably referring to the murder). Testimony 2 suggests that the real Lady Kee'ra returned to root out rebels. Testimony 3 states that "She attacked and killed me with a strength far beyond any mortal woman." 

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 23 is the Tome of Secrets, which mentions that the priestess acting as Lady Kee'ra's representative must know her name (Ihmsan) and have seen her face. The Tome also says that speaking the name is unforgivable, so it's a secret. Importantly, there's an image of the goddess holding a bird-shaped dagger (probably the Warbaa'd Dagger, Evidence 18) in her right hand, wearing a mask and tiara.

Now, Testimony 3 says that the attacker had superhuman strength, implying it was the real Lady Kee'ra or a spirit. But according to the Tome of Secrets (Evidence 23), the representative (Maya) would need to know the name and have seen her face. However, Maya was supposed to be channeling the spirit, but the Tome's instructions are for the living priestess (Beh'leeb Inmee, since she usually plays Lady Kee'ra). Wait, but Maya was channeling her. Wait, maybe there's a contradiction here. Let me check.

Wait, in Testimony 0, Tahrust claims Maya channeled Lady Kee'ra. But according to the Tome of Secrets (Evidence 23), the representative (the one acting as Lady Kee'ra) must know her true name and have seen her face. However, Maya is a spirit medium from Kurain, so perhaps she wouldn't need to have seen the face if she's channeling the spirit. But according to the Tome, the priestess must know the name and have seen the face. If Maya was channeling Lady Kee'ra, does that mean she's acting as the representative? Or is Beh'leeb the usual one? Evidence 8 says Beh'leeb usually plays Lady Kee'ra, but on that day, maybe Maya was doing it. But according to Evidence 8 (Maya's Statement), when they arrived at the Inner Sanctum, the water was already red. So maybe Maya was there as part of the rite.

Wait, the Tome of Secrets says the priestess must know the name and have seen her face. If Maya was channeling, perhaps she didn't need to know the name because she's channeling the spirit. But if she's acting as the representative, she would need to know the name. However, the Tome says that the name is Ihmsan and that speaking it is forbidden. If Maya knew the name, that could be a problem. But in Testimony 1, Tahrust says she knows the name, hence she could have done it. But the Tome says that the priestess (the one acting as Lady Kee'ra) must know the name. So if Maya was the one acting as Lady Kee'ra, then she would have to know the name. But the contradiction might be elsewhere.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 claims that the attacker had superhuman strength, implying it was a spirit. However, Evidence 18 is the Warbaa'd Dagger, which is modeled after the one used by Lady Kee'ra. The Tome's image shows Lady Kee'ra holding such a dagger. If the murder was committed with this dagger, but the autopsy report (Evidence 3) says the cause was a bladed weapon. However, the testimony says it was done with superhuman strength, but the dagger is a physical weapon. Maybe the contradiction is that if the attack was done by a spirit with superhuman strength, why use a physical dagger? But that might not be a direct contradiction.

Wait, another angle. The Tome of Secrets (Evidence 23) mentions that the priestess must know the name and have seen her face, which is depicted with a mask. Wait, the image in the Tome shows the goddess wearing a mask, so how could the priestess have seen her face? That seems contradictory. Unless the mask is part of the ritual, but the priestess would have seen the face in some other context. Hmm, maybe that's a red herring.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 2: Tahrust says the real Lady Kee'ra returned. But if the Tome of Secrets requires that the priestess must know her name and have seen her face, then the real Lady Kee'ra wouldn't need a representative. But if the real Lady Kee'ra appeared, then the need for a representative is moot. However, the testimony says the real Lady Kee'ra returned, which would make the Tome's instructions irrelevant. But I'm not sure if that's the contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 3 says that the attacker had strength beyond a mortal woman, implying a spirit. But Evidence 3's autopsy report says death was due to blood loss from a bladed weapon. That doesn't directly contradict, unless the spirit would not need a physical weapon. But maybe the contradiction is that the dagger (Evidence 18) is a physical object, so a spirit would need a medium to wield it. If Maya was channeling the spirit, she could have used the dagger. But Tahrust's testimony says the attacker had superhuman strength, which could be explained by channeling. So maybe not a contradiction here.

Wait, another angle: Evidence 23 (Tome of Secrets) says the priestess must know the name Ihmsan. If Maya knew the name, then according to Testimony 1, she could have done it. However, the Tome also says that speaking the name is unforgivable and must be locked away. If Maya knew the name, perhaps she was the only one who could have acted as the representative, which might relate to the murder. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 0 where Tahrust claims that Maya channeled Lady Kee'ra's spirit. However, according to Evidence 23, the priestess acting as Lady Kee'ra's representative must have seen her face. But the image in the Tome shows Lady Kee'ra wearing a mask, so how could the priestess have seen her face? This might mean that the representative (Maya) couldn't have seen her face, thus contradicting the requirement, making it impossible for her to be the representative. Therefore, if Maya was supposed to channel Lady Kee'ra, but she couldn't have seen her face (since the image shows a mask), then Testimony 0 is contradicted by Evidence 23. Because the Tome says the priestess must have seen her face, but if Lady Kee'ra is depicted with a mask, how could anyone have seen her face? Unless the mask is removable, but the image doesn't show that. So perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 0 (Maya channeled Lady Kee'ra) and Evidence 23 (which requires seeing her face, which she couldn't if the goddess wears a mask). Therefore, Maya couldn't have been the legitimate representative because she hasn't seen the face, which would mean she couldn't channel her properly, thus contradicting Testimony 0.

Wait, but the Tome's caption says the image is of the goddess doing a ritual dance, holding the dagger, wearing a mask and tiara. So the mask is part of her depiction. So the priestess must have seen her face, but the image shows her with a mask. That's a contradiction. Therefore, the Tome's requirement that the priestess must have seen the face is impossible if the goddess is always depicted with a mask. Therefore, the only way the priestess could have seen her face is if the mask is removed, which isn't shown. Therefore, if Maya is channeling Lady Kee'ra, she must have seen her face, but according to the Tome's image, that's impossible. Therefore, Testimony 0 (that Maya channeled Lady Kee'ra) is contradicted by Evidence 23, because the Tome's requirements can't be met if the face is masked. Therefore, Maya couldn't have been the channeler, thus the testimony is false.

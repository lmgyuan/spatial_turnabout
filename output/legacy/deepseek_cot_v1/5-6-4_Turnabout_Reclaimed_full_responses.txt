Okay, let's start by going through the evidence and testimonies to find contradictions. The goal is to find one pair where evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, looking at the testimonies from Crab (Testimonies 0-6). Testimony 3 says that during cleaning, the pool water is drained. Testimony 5 adds that the pool water is only drained during cleaning. Now, Evidence 12 (Shipley's Data) mentions the estimated time of death between 12:00 AM and 10:00 AM on July 20th. If the body was found in the orca pool, which was drained during cleaning, but the cause of death is a contusion from a 65-foot fall, that suggests he fell into an empty pool. However, if the pool was drained during cleaning (as per testimony 3), and the cleaning was happening in the early morning (Testimony 0), then the pool would have been empty. But the time of death is estimated up to 10 AM. If the pool was drained during cleaning (which happened in the early morning), but the body was found in the pool, and the pool is refilled after cleaning. Wait, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. 

Wait, Evidence 16 (Skull Rock) mentions that the victim struck the rock when he fell to his death. The Skull Rock was moved from the show pool during cleaning time. So if the pool was being cleaned and drained, the rock would be there. But if the pool was drained only during cleaning, then the body could have been in the drained pool. But how does that relate to testimonies?

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3 (during cleaning, pool is drained) and Testimony 5 (pool is only drained when cleaned). Now, Evidence 12 says the cause of death is a fall from 65 feet into the pool, which would require the pool to be filled with water to have that depth. But if the pool was drained during cleaning, then the fall would be onto an empty pool, leading to a different injury. Wait, the Orca Pool Diagram (Evidence 3) says the pool is 65 feet deep. If the pool is drained, then the victim would fall 65 feet onto the empty pool floor, causing death. But the testimony says that the pool is drained during cleaning. However, the time of death is between 12 AM and 10 AM. If Sasha entered the pool room (as per Testimony 2) in the early morning for cleaning, then the pool was drained then. But if the victim died from a fall into the pool, which would be empty during cleaning, that would make sense. However, the cause of death is a contusion from head trauma, and the Skull Rock is mentioned as being in the pool. Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that if the pool was drained during cleaning, then the orca wouldn't be there (since Testimony 4 says Marlon was taking care of the orca in the show pool during cleaning). But the orca, Orla, is accused of murder. How?

Alternatively, let's look at Evidence 3 (Orca Pool Diagram) which mentions that the pool is about 65 feet deep. But Evidence 12 (Shipley's Data) says the ceiling to pool bottom is 100 feet, and the cause of death is a 65-foot fall. Wait, if the pool is 65 feet deep, then the fall from the ceiling (100 feet total) would mean a 65-foot drop into the water? Wait, maybe if the pool was drained, the fall would be 100 feet to the bottom, but the cause of death is from a 65-foot fall. That would be a contradiction. So if the pool was drained (as per Testimony 3), the fall would be 100 feet, but the cause of death is listed as a 65-foot fall. That contradicts. So Evidence 12 says the death was from a 65-foot fall, implying the pool was filled with water (since 100 feet ceiling to bottom, so if the pool has 65 feet of water, falling from the ceiling would be a 35-foot fall into water). Wait, maybe the math here is important. If the ceiling is 100 feet above the pool bottom, and the pool is 65 feet deep when filled, then the height from ceiling to water surface is 35 feet. So a fall from the ceiling into the filled pool would be 35 feet. But Shipley's Data says the cause is a 65-foot fall. That would mean the pool was not filled. Because 100 feet (ceiling to bottom) minus the pool's depth when filled (65 feet) would be a 35-foot drop into water. But if the pool was drained, then the fall is 100 feet onto the bottom. But the data says the death was from a 65-foot fall, which is the depth of the pool. That seems contradictory. So if the pool was drained (Testimony 3), the fall would be 100 feet, but the evidence says 65-foot fall. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 12 and Testimony 3. Because Testimony 3 says during cleaning, the pool is drained (so depth 0), but the cause of death is a 65-foot fall, which would match the pool's depth when filled. Therefore, if the pool was drained, the fall would be longer than 65 feet. Hence, the evidence contradicts the testimony.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's start by going through the problem. We need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to identify one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, I'll look at the testimonies given by Rimes. There are four of them:

Testimony 0: Sasha is lying to protect the orca.
Testimony 1: At 3:30 AM on the 20th, there was still water in the orca pool.
Testimony 2: The incident happened before the orca was moved to the show pool.
Testimony 3: Orla killed the captain by bashing him thirty feet high and making him slam into the water.
Testimony 4: So I thought the orca should pay the consequences.

Now, I need to check each testimony against the evidence provided. Let's go through each testimony one by one.

Starting with Testimony 3. Rimes claims that Orla killed Jack by bashing him 30 feet high, causing him to slam into the water. Let's look for evidence that contradicts this. 

Looking at Evidence 12 (Shipley's Data), it states that the cause of death was a contusion from head trauma, thought to be from a 65-foot fall into the pool. The ceiling to pool bottom is 100 feet. Also, there's a mention that the blow to the head was received after death. So, if the death was from a 65-foot fall, but Rimes says Orla bashed him 30 feet high, that might not align. Wait, but if the pool is 65 feet deep and the ceiling is 100 feet, a 65-foot fall would mean he fell from 65 feet up? Maybe the height from which he fell is important here.

Also, Evidence 16 (Skull Rock) mentions that the victim struck the rock when he fell to his death, and Orla also rammed into it. The rock had been moved from the show pool. So maybe the actual cause of death was the fall onto the rock, not Orla's attack. 

Furthermore, Evidence 12 mentions that the estimated time of death was between 12:00 and 10:00 AM on July 20th. But Testimony 2 says the incident happened before the orca was moved to the show pool. If the orca was moved after the incident, but the death occurred in the orca pool, then perhaps Orla wasn't in the show pool yet. However, Rimes's Testimony 3 claims that Orla bashed him, implying she was present. But if the pool was drained or the orca was moved, there's a contradiction here.

Wait, looking back at Testimony 1: At 3:30 AM on the 20th, there was still water in the orca pool. But if the pool was drained later, maybe the orca was moved after that. Evidence 16 mentions Skull Rock was moved from the show pool during cleaning time. So maybe the orca was in the show pool when the incident happened? Not sure yet.

Wait, Testimony 2 by Rimes says the incident happened before the orca was moved to the show pool. So the incident (murder) occurred in the orca pool, not the show pool. But if the death was caused by a 65-foot fall into the pool (as per Evidence 12), which is 65 feet deep, maybe the victim fell from the second floor (if the diagram in Evidence 3 shows the pool spans two floors). The Orca Pool Diagram (Evidence 3) mentions the pool is 65 feet deep and has a cross-section view of 1st and 2nd floors. So if someone fell from the second floor into the pool, that's a 65-foot fall. If the victim fell from the second floor, which is 65 feet up, that would result in the fatal injury. But Rimes says Orla bashed him thirty feet high. Thirty feet is much less than 65, so if the fall was from 65 feet, that contradicts Rimes' testimony about the height.

So, Evidence 12 states the cause of death is a 65-foot fall, which contradicts Testimony 3's claim that Orla bashed him thirty feet high. Therefore, the height of the fall as per evidence (65 feet) vs. the testimony (30 feet) is a contradiction. 

Another point: Evidence 12 also mentions that the blow to the head was received after death. So the head trauma that caused death was from the fall, not Orla's attack. This would mean Orla couldn't have killed him by bashing him, because he was already dead. That directly contradicts Rimes' Testimony 3. 

So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Orla caused death by bashing) and Evidence 12 (death was from a fall, with the head injury occurring post-mortem). Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 12 and Testimony 3. But wait, Evidence 12 is Shipley's Data (evidence index 12). And Testimony 3 is the one about Orla bashing him. So the JSON should be {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3}.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3}

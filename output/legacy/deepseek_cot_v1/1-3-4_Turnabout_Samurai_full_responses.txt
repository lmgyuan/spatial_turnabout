Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair. Let me start by going through the testimonies and the evidences provided.

First, the testimonies are all from Cody Hackins. He talks about sneaking into the studio to see a rehearsal. He mentions using a map from the internet, going through the woods to avoid the security lady, getting lost for 30 minutes, and then seeing the Steel Samurai fight the bad guy. He also says that if he had his camera, that would have been the time for a shot.

Looking at the evidences, let's check each one. Evidence 15 is Cody's Camera. The description says he always carries it, though he's still learning how to use it. But in Testimony 8, Cody says "If I had my camera with me..." which implies he didn't have it then. However, Evidence 15 states he always carries it. That seems like a contradiction. If he always has the camera, why would he say "if I had it"? So, the testimony 8 and evidence 15 contradict each other. That's probably the pair they're looking for.

{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 8}
Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a bunch of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Let me start by going through the testimonies first.

Looking at the testimonies from Cody Hackins (Testimonies 0-5). He mentions taking a picture with his camera but the lens wouldn't open in time, so he missed the shot. Then he says he took a few shots but erased them because it was too late. Wait, but there's an evidence related to Cody's Camera (Evidence 15). Also, Evidence 5 is Powers'(?) Photo taken at 2:00 PM. Wait, but Cody's testimony says he erased the photos because they were too late. But if there's a photo (Evidence 5) taken at 2:00 PM, that contradicts his statement that he erased the photos. Hmm.

Wait, Evidence 5 is a photo taken at 2:00 PM at the gate. The description says "He's dragging one leg." And Cody's Testimony 5 says he took a few shots but erased them. But if the photo exists, then he didn't erase all of them. So the existence of the photo (Evidence 5) contradicts Cody's Testimony 5 where he claims he erased the photos. That seems like a contradiction. So the pair would be Evidence 5 and Testimony 5. Let me check again.

Testimony 5: "I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em." But the photo (Evidence 5) exists, meaning he didn't erase all of them, or at least one wasn't erased. Therefore, Evidence 5 and Testimony 5 contradict each other.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 5}

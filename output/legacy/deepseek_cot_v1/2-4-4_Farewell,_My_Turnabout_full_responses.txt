Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. My job is to go through them and find a contradiction between one piece of evidence and one testimony.

First, I'll start by looking at the testimonies. The testimonies from Will Powers (Testimonies 0 to 5) mention a bellboy coming out of Juan Corrida's room. Specifically, Testimony 4 says: "I thought it was kinda strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed!" So Powers is saying the bellboy didn't have anything when he left the room.

Now, looking at the evidences, there's Evidence 30: Bellboy's Uniform. The details mention that it's from De Killer's hideout and that one of its special buttons is missing. Then there's Evidence 16: Jammin' Ninja's Button, which was found in Engarde's hakama, covered in Corrida's blood. The button was ripped from the costume, which belongs to the victim, Corrida.

Wait, but how does this connect to the testimony? The bellboy (De Killer in disguise) was wearing the uniform. If the button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume was found in Engarde's clothing, maybe that button came from the bellboy's uniform? Wait, no. Evidence 30's uniform is missing a button, but the button in Evidence 16 is from the Jammin' Ninja's costume. Hmm. Maybe that's not directly related.

Alternatively, let's think about the guitar case (Evidence 7). It was found next to the victim, empty with water on the lid. But the testimony says the bellboy left empty-handed. If the guitar case was supposed to contain something, maybe the bellboy took it. But the guitar case is empty. Wait, but the case was already empty at the scene. So if the bellboy left empty-handed, that would mean he didn't take anything. But maybe the guitar case was supposed to have something in it, like the knife or another item, but it's empty. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record from 8 PM for 1 hour. The time of death was 8:15 PM. The Video Tape (Evidence 29) is from De Killer's hideout and he tried to recover it. If the spy camera was recording, then maybe the video tape contains footage that contradicts the testimonies. But how does that relate to the testimonies given?

Looking back at the testimonies: Powers says he saw a bellboy come out of Corrida's room empty-handed. But if De Killer (the bellboy) was the assassin, maybe he would have taken something. However, the guitar case was left empty. But according to the Crime Photo (Evidence 9), the guitar case is open and empty. So maybe the bellboy didn't take anything, but there's an evidence that shows he should have had something. Wait, maybe the bellboy's uniform (Evidence 30) is missing a button, which could be the same as the Jammin' Ninja's button (Evidence 16). If the button from the victim's costume was found in Engarde's hakama, but the bellboy's uniform is missing a button, perhaps the button from the uniform is missing, but the testimony says he left empty-handed. But I'm not sure if that's the contradiction.

Alternatively, consider the fact that the bellboy's uniform (Evidence 30) is missing a special button, and the Jammin' Ninja's button (Evidence 16) was found in Engarde's clothing. If the button from the uniform is missing, but the button found is from the victim's costume, that might not directly connect. Maybe the contradiction is that the bellboy (De Killer) was wearing the uniform, which was missing a button, but the testimony says he left empty-handed. However, if the button from the victim's costume was found elsewhere, perhaps there's another angle.

Wait, let's think about the Spy Camera. The Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record the room during the murder. If the footage exists (on the Video Tape, Evidence 29), then it might show the killer. However, the testimonies mention a bellboy leaving the room. If the Spy Camera's footage shows that the bellboy didn't have anything, but there's evidence that the bellboy's uniform is missing a button (maybe the button was left at the scene?), but that's not directly conflicting.

Wait, the key contradiction here is that Powers says the bellboy left empty-handed (Testimony 4), but the bellboy's uniform (Evidence 30) is missing a button. If the button was lost during the crime, then the bellboy wasn't empty-handed when he left because he left behind a button. But the testimony claims he left empty-handed. Wait, but the missing button from the uniform would be part of the uniform itself, not something he was carrying. So the bellboy didn't carry anything out, but the uniform's button was lost. That doesn't necessarily contradict the testimony. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 7 (Guitar Case) which is empty with water on the lid. The victim's autopsy report (Evidence 14) says he was strangled and stabbed. The knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints. But the testimony is about the bellboy leaving empty-handed. If the murder weapon (the knife) was left at the scene, then the bellboy wouldn't have taken it. So maybe that's not conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (bellboy left empty-handed) and Evidence 30 (Bellboy's Uniform missing a button). If the bellboy's uniform was missing a button, that button could have been found at the crime scene. But in the evidences, the button found is from the Jammin' Ninja's costume (Evidence 16), not the bellboy's uniform. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, let's consider Evidence 30's description: the bellboy's uniform has a missing button. The Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has water on the lid. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) mentions a smashed vase with water on the carpet. If the bellboy had taken the guitar case, but it's empty, maybe the water on the lid suggests something was inside that had water, like the vase. But the vase was smashed, so the water was already on the carpet. The Guitar Case's water is on the lid, perhaps from the vase. But the testimony says the bellboy left empty-handed. If the Guitar Case was supposed to contain something, but it's empty, maybe the bellboy took the contents. But the testimony says he left empty-handed, which would mean he didn't take anything. However, the Guitar Case is empty, so if he took something from it, then he left with the item. But the testimony says he left empty-handed. So this could be a contradiction: if the Guitar Case was supposed to have something (like the knife) which the bellboy took, but he left empty-handed, then the knife should still be in the case, but the knife (Evidence 15) was found elsewhere. Wait, the knife is listed as separate evidence. So the knife was found with Engarde's fingerprints. Therefore, the bellboy didn't take the knife. So maybe the Guitar Case being empty doesn't relate directly to the bellboy leaving empty-handed.

Hmm. Let's look for another angle. The testimony says the bellboy left empty-handed, but maybe there's evidence that he did carry something. For example, the Lotta's Camera (Evidence 5) was stolen on the night of the murder. If the bellboy took the camera, then he didn't leave empty-handed. But according to Testimony 4, he did. So Evidence 5 (Lotta's Camera stolen) contradicts Testimony 4. Because if the camera was stolen, the bellboy might have taken it, but Powers says he left empty-handed. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 5.

Wait, but Lotta's Camera was stolen around the time of the murder. The article in the camera's case is a tabloid article about the victim. If the bellboy took the camera, then Powers' testimony that he left empty-handed would be false. Therefore, Evidence 5 (stolen camera) contradicts Testimony 4 (left empty-handed).

Yes, that seems like a contradiction. So the evidence is Lotta's Camera (Evidence 5) which was stolen, and the testimony is Testimony 4 where Powers claims the bellboy left empty-handed. If the camera was stolen, the bellboy would have had to carry it out, but Powers didn't see him carrying anything. Therefore, the testimony and evidence contradict each other.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to look through the given testimonies and evidence to find inconsistencies or contradictions.

First, let's review the testimonies provided by Shelly de Killer (Testimonies 0 to 6). The key points from his testimonies are:

- Testimony 2: "My client did it to frame another for the crime."
- Testimony 5: "But even more appalling is the creation and planting of the 'knife' and 'button'."
- Testimony 6: That act (planting the knife and button) is why the client broke the rules.

So according to de Killer, Adrian Andrews (his client) planted the knife and button to frame someone else. The planted items are the Knife (Evidence 15) and Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16). The knife has Engarde's fingerprints, which would implicate Matt Engarde. The button was found in Engarde's hakama, also pointing to him.

Now, looking at the evidence:

Evidence 15 (Knife) has Engarde's fingerprints. Evidence 16 (Button) is covered in Corrida's blood and found in Engarde's clothing. If these were planted by Adrian Andrews, as de Killer claims, then their presence should be due to her actions. However, let's check other evidence that might contradict this.

Looking at Evidence 8 (Wine Glass) which has Adrian Andrews' fingerprints. If she was at the scene, her fingerprints on the glass could support her presence. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Wait, Testimony 3 and 4 from de Killer state that Andrews pretended to be the first to discover the body but already knew Corrida was dead. However, the key contradiction might be in the planted evidence. 

But de Killer's Testimony 5 says Andrews created and planted the knife and button. However, Evidence 15 (Knife) has Engarde's fingerprints, not Andrews'. If she planted the knife, how did it get Engarde's fingerprints? Unless she had access to his fingerprints, which isn't mentioned here. But maybe there's another angle.

Wait, Evidence 16 (Button) is covered in Corrida's blood. If the button was planted, then the blood should be from the victim, which it is. But if the button was ripped from the victim's costume during the struggle, then it being in Engarde's clothing would implicate him. However, if Andrews planted it, that's possible. But de Killer's testimony says she planted both the knife and button. However, the knife has Engarde's fingerprints. So unless Andrews somehow obtained a knife that Engarde had touched, but that's not mentioned. 

Alternatively, maybe the real killer (who is de Killer's actual client, but he's lying here) would have planted these. Wait, but de Killer is claiming that Andrews is his client, which might be a lie. The real client could be Matt Engarde, who actually did the murder. But the question is about contradictions between testimony and evidence.

Wait, the contradiction could be that de Killer's Testimony 5 claims Andrews planted the knife (Evidence 15) and the button (Evidence 16). But the Knife (15) has Engarde's fingerprints. If Andrews planted it, how did she get Engarde's fingerprints on it? Unless she framed him by using a knife he had previously touched. But if Engarde's fingerprints are on the knife, that would suggest he handled it, which contradicts the idea that Andrews planted it unless she had access to his fingerprints. However, there's no evidence mentioned that she could have done that. 

Alternatively, the knife's description says it's engraved with "Gatewater" (Evidence 15). If the knife is from the hotel, maybe Engarde had handled it before. But if Andrews planted it, then the presence of Engarde's prints could be legitimate, but the contradiction might be elsewhere.

Wait, let's check other evidence. Evidence 21 is the Spy Camera set to record the victim's room from 8 PM for 1 hour. The Video Tape (29) from De Killer's hideout might show the actual murder, but that's not directly stated. However, if the Spy Camera (21) was running, then there should be footage. But the Video Tape (29) is retrieved from De Killer's hideout, and its contents are unknown. However, if the Spy Camera was set up by Engarde (as per Evidence 24, he bought a stuffed bear identical to the one with the spy camera), then the footage from the camera would show the real murderer. If the camera was active during the murder (time of death 8:15 PM), then the footage would show who did it. If de Killer's testimony claims that Andrews planted the knife and button, but the spy camera footage might contradict that by showing someone else (like Engarde or de Killer) committing the murder.

But how does that directly contradict the testimony? Let's think again. The Spy Camera (21) was set in the stuffed bear (23), which was bought by Engarde (24). So Engarde set up the camera to record the victim's room. If the camera was running during the murder, the footage would show who actually committed the crime. If de Killer's testimony says that Andrews planted the evidence to frame Engarde, but the spy camera's footage would show the real culprit, which might not be Andrews. However, since the Video Tape (29) is from De Killer's hideout and the contents are unknown, but the Spy Camera's footage (21 and 22) might have captured the real events.

Alternatively, the contradiction could be between de Killer's claim that Andrews planted the knife and button, but the knife has Engarde's fingerprints. If Andrews planted the knife, how did Engarde's fingerprints get on it unless he was involved. But de Killer's testimony says that Andrews is the one who planted them. So if the knife has Engarde's prints, that would support that Engarde used it, which contradicts the idea that Andrews planted it unless she somehow obtained a knife he had touched before. However, without evidence that she had access to such a knife, this could be a contradiction.

Wait, but according to the scenario, de Killer is the assassin, and his client is actually Matt Engarde, not Adrian Andrews. But in the testimonies, de Killer is claiming that Andrews is his client, which is a lie. Therefore, the planted evidence (knife and button) were actually placed by Engarde or de Killer to frame someone else. But the question is about contradiction between evidence and testimony, not the overall case.

So, if de Killer's Testimony 5 says that Andrews planted the knife and button, but the Knife (15) has Engarde's fingerprints, that could mean that Engarde's involvement is real, contradicting the testimony that Andrews planted them. Alternatively, the presence of Engarde's fingerprints on the knife supports that he used it, which would mean that Andrews couldn't have planted it unless she somehow got his prints on it, which is possible but not indicated here.

Alternatively, looking at the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) which has Andrews' fingerprints. If she was at the scene, maybe she handled the glass, but according to de Killer's Testimony 3 and 4, she pretended to discover the body but already knew he was dead. The presence of her fingerprints on the glass could support her being there, which might not be a contradiction. However, if the testimony says she planted the knife and button, but the knife has Engarde's prints, that's a possible contradiction.

Another angle: The Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has Corrida's fingerprints and water on the lid. The Crime Photo (9) shows the guitar case next to the victim, with a smashed vase that stained the carpet with water. The water on the guitar case's lid might have come from the vase. But how does this relate to the testimonies?

Wait, the key contradiction could be regarding the Spy Camera. If the camera was recording during the murder (8:15 PM), then the footage would show the actual events. If de Killer's testimony claims that Andrews planted the evidence, but the footage shows someone else (like Engarde or de Killer) committing the murder, that would contradict the testimony. However, the Video Tape (29) is from De Killer's hideout, and the contents are unknown, so maybe that's not directly conflicting. 

Alternatively, Evidence 21 (Spy Camera) was set to record from 8 PM for 1 hour, which includes the time of death (8:15 PM). If the camera was active, then there should be footage of the murder. However, the Video Tape (29) is from De Killer's hideout, which might have the real footage. But how does that contradict the testimony? The testimony says Andrews planted the evidence, but if the camera footage shows that she wasn't the killer, then that's a contradiction. However, without knowing the contents of the Video Tape (29), this is speculative.

Alternatively, the Figurine (25) has Celeste's Suicide Note (27) inside, which tells of Engarde's misdeeds. This connects Engarde to Celeste's suicide, which might provide a motive for Corrida to hold a grudge against Engarde. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Wait, the Magazine Clipping (11) suggests that Corrida was involved with Adrian Andrews (A.A.), which might be a motive for Andrews. But the Suicide Report (12) and Attempted Suicide Report (13) link Celeste's suicide to Corrida and Andrews. 

Another angle: The Security Lady (Character 3) has an autograph from Corrida (Evidence 10), which might indicate she was a fan, but not directly relevant here.

Looking back at the testimonies: Testimony 5 claims Andrews planted the knife and button. But the Knife (15) has Engarde's fingerprints. If Andrews planted the knife, then why would Engarde's prints be on it? Unless she took a knife that Engarde had previously used. However, if Engarde is the real killer, then his prints would naturally be there, which would mean that de Killer's testimony is false, implying that Andrews didn't plant the knife. This would be a contradiction between Testimony 5 (Andrews planted the knife) and Evidence 15 (knife has Engarde's prints, implying he used it). Therefore, the existence of Engarde's fingerprints on the knife contradicts the testimony that Andrews planted it, unless she framed him by using his own knife. However, without evidence that she had access to his knife, this is a contradiction.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Andrews planted the knife) and Evidence 15 (knife has Engarde's fingerprints), suggesting that Engarde used the knife, not that Andrews planted it. Hence, the evidence contradicts the testimony.

{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair. Let me start by going through the testimonies and the evidences.

First, looking at the testimonies from Shelly de Killer (Testimonies 0-4). Testimony 3 says that one of the tasks was to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews. The relevant evidence here might be the Figurine (Evidence 25) which is a wooden bear-shaped figurine covered in thin cuts. The description mentions that only Corrida and Andrews know how to open it. But according to de Killer's testimony, he was supposed to find the figurine and give it to Andrews. But wait, if only Corrida and Andrews know how to open it, then how would de Killer know where to find it or how to retrieve it unless he got the information from the client. But maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Looking at Evidence 25, the figurine's note says it's a puzzle only known to Corrida and Andrews. If de Killer was tasked to find it and give to Andrews, but the client would have to know how to open it. But the client is supposed to be someone else. Wait, maybe the client is supposed to be someone who knows how to open it. But according to the testimonies, de Killer thought the client was a man (Testimony 4: When I saw the name at the end of the letter, I thought my client to be a man). But if the client knew about the figurine's mechanism, which only Corrida and Andrews know, then the client might be one of them. However, Corrida is the victim, so he's dead. So the client would have to be Andrews. But de Killer thought the client was a man. But Adrian Andrews is a woman. So that could be a contradiction. Because the client's name in the letter made de Killer think the client was male, but if the client is Andrews, that's a contradiction. But how does this relate to the evidence?

Wait, Testimony 3 says de Killer was supposed to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews. But Evidence 25 says the figurine can only be opened by Corrida and Andrews. So if de Killer's client instructed him to retrieve the figurine and give it to Andrews, the client would need to know how to open it. But if the client is, say, Matt Engarde (a man), he wouldn't know how to open it. But if the client is Adrian Andrews, she could, but de Killer thought the client was a man based on the name. So perhaps the contradiction is that the client must be someone who knows how to open the figurine (so either Corrida or Andrews), but the name in the letter made de Killer think the client was a man. Corrida is dead, so the client couldn't be him. So if the client was Andrews, but the name in the letter was male, that would be a contradiction. But which evidence directly relates to this?

Evidence 25 states that only Corrida and Andrews know how to open it. So if the client told de Killer to get the figurine and give it to Andrews, the client must have known how to open it, meaning the client is either Corrida or Andrews. But Corrida is the victim, so he can't be the client. Therefore, the client should be Andrews, but de Killer thought the client was a man. Therefore, the testimony (Testimony 4) where de Killer thought the client was a man based on the name, and the fact that the client must be Andrews (a woman) creates a contradiction. But how does the evidence tie in?

The key evidence here is the Figurine (Evidence 25) which only Corrida and Andrews can open. If the client had to instruct de Killer to retrieve it, they must know how to access it, implying the client is either Corrida or Andrews. But since Corrida is dead, the client would be Andrews. However, de Killer's Testimony 4 says he thought the client was a man. So this contradiction would be between Testimony 4 (client thought to be male) and Evidence 25 (only Andrews and Corrida know how to open the figurine), but the client must be Andrews. So the contradiction is that the client's name in the letter made de Killer think it was a man, but the client is actually Andrews (a woman). Therefore, the evidence pointing to this would be the Figurine (25) and Testimony 4. Alternatively, maybe another angle.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3: de Killer was supposed to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews. But if the figurine was something that only Andrews and Corrida knew about, how did de Killer's client know to ask him to retrieve it? Unless the client was one of them. But since Corrida is dead, the client would have to be Andrews. But de Killer thought the client was a man. So the client's name in the letter must have been a man's name, but Andrews is a woman, creating a contradiction. Therefore, the client couldn't be Andrews, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, the evidence that shows that the client must be someone who knows how to open the figurine (Evidence 25) and Testimony 4 where de Killer thought the client was a man, which contradicts if the client is Andrews. Therefore, the pair is Evidence 25 and Testimony 3 or 4.

Wait, but Testimony 3 is about the task to give the figurine to Andrews, and Evidence 25 says only Corrida and Andrews know how to open it. If de Killer's client told him to retrieve it, the client must know how to open it. But since Corrida is dead, the client would be Andrews. But Testimony 4 says de Killer thought the client was a man. So the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 25. But how do we pair evidence and testimony?

Alternatively, Evidence 27 is Celeste's Suicide Note found inside the figurine. But that's not directly related. Wait, in Testimony 3, de Killer says one of the tasks was to give the figurine to Adrian Andrews. But according to Evidence 25, the figurine can only be opened by Corrida and Andrews. So if the client wanted de Killer to retrieve the figurine and give it to Andrews, the client must know how to get it, i.e., how to open it. Therefore, the client must be either Corrida or Andrews. But Corrida is dead, so client must be Andrews. But de Killer's Testimony 4 says he thought the client was a man. Therefore, this is a contradiction between Testimony 4 and the implication from Evidence 25. But the evidence number here would be 25 and testimony 4.

But the user wants the evidence and testimony that directly contradict each other. Alternatively, perhaps the testimony 3 says he was supposed to give the figurine to Adrian Andrews. But in Evidence 25, the figurine is a puzzle that only Corrida and Andrews know how to open. So if de Killer was supposed to retrieve it and give it to Andrews, that implies that the client knows that Andrews can open it, but the client would need to have access to the figurine's secret. Therefore, the client must be either Corrida or Andrews. Corrida is dead, so the client is Andrews, but de Killer thought the client was a man. So the testimony 4 (client's name made him think male) contradicts the fact that the client is Andrews (a woman), which is supported by Evidence 25 (only she and Corrida can open it). But the evidence here would be 25 and testimony 4.

Alternatively, another angle: The client instructed de Killer to retrieve the figurine and give it to Andrews. But Evidence 25 says the figurine is a puzzle that only Corrida and Andrews can open. So the client must know that the figurine exists and that it's important. If the client is Matt Engarde, how would he know about it? Unless he's involved with Celeste Inpax, whose suicide note is in the figurine (Evidence 27). But then, maybe the contradiction is that de Killer's testimony 3 (task to give figurine to Andrews) and the fact that the figurine can only be opened by Andrews and Corrida. If the client was someone else (like Engarde), he wouldn't know how to open it, so why ask de Killer to get it? Unless the client is Andrews. But if the client is Andrews, then Testimony 4 (thought client was a man) contradicts. So the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (client's name implied male) and Evidence 25 (client must be Andrews).

But according to the problem, the user wants one pair of evidence and testimony. So the correct pair would be Testimony 3 (about giving the figurine to Andrews) and Evidence 25 (which implies that only Corrida and Andrews can open it, so the client must be one of them). But the client can't be Corrida (he's dead), so client must be Andrews. But Testimony 4 says de Killer thought the client was male. So the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 25. But the question is which evidence and testimony directly contradict each other. Alternatively, the task in Testimony 3 (give figurine to Andrews) and the fact that the figurine can only be opened by Andrews and Corrida. If de Killer was supposed to retrieve it, how would he do that unless the client told him how, which the client could only do if they knew how to open it. But if the client is male, like Engarde, then he wouldn't know how to open the figurine. So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (task to retrieve and give figurine to Andrews) and Evidence 25 (only Corrida and Andrews can open it), implying the client must know how to open it. But if the client is Engarde, he can't, so contradiction. But the testimony is de Killer's, not the client's. So maybe the contradiction is that de Killer's testimony says he was tasked to retrieve the figurine and give it to Andrews, but the figurine can only be opened by Corrida and Andrews. Therefore, the client must be either of them. Since Corrida is dead, the client is Andrews. But Testimony 4 says de Killer thought the client was a man. So the evidence (25) and testimony (4) contradict. Therefore, the answer would be {"evidence": 25, "testimony": 4}.

But wait, another possibility: The client told de Killer to get the figurine and give it to Andrews. The client must have known that the figurine exists and that it's important. If the client is Engarde, then how would he know about the figurine? Unless he's connected to Celeste Inpax. But the suicide note in the figurine (Evidence 27) tells of Engarde's misdeeds. So Engarde might want to retrieve the figurine to destroy the evidence. But he wouldn't know how to open it. So he hires de Killer to get it. But since he can't open it, he needs de Killer to give it to Andrews, who can open it. But then, the client is Engarde, but according to Evidence 25, only Andrews and Corrida know how to open it. Therefore, Engarde can't open it, so he wants to give it to Andrews. But why? Maybe to incriminate her. But how does that relate to the contradiction.

Alternatively, the contradiction is that in Testimony 3, de Killer was supposed to give the figurine to Andrews, but the figurine can only be opened by Andrews and Corrida. So if de Killer's client was not Andrews, then the client must have instructed him to get the figurine, but the client can't open it. Therefore, the client would need to know that the figurine exists and that it's important, which could be possible. But perhaps the contradiction is in Testimony 3 and Evidence 25. If the client is not Andrews or Corrida, they wouldn't know how to open it, so why task de Killer to retrieve it. But that's not a direct contradiction. The contradiction would arise if the client couldn't have known about the figurine's existence unless they were Andrews or Corrida. But that's not necessarily stated. The evidence says that only they know how to open it, not that only they know about its existence.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look again. The user asks which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The answer is likely between Testimony 3 and Evidence 25. But I need to find a direct contradiction.

Testimony 3 says de Killer's client instructed him to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews. Evidence 25 says the figurine is a puzzle that only Corrida and Andrews can open. If the client wanted de Killer to retrieve the figurine and give it to Andrews, the client must have known that the figurine contains something important. But only Andrews and Corrida know how to open it. So the client must be either of them. But since Corrida is dead, the client is Andrews. But Testimony 4 says de Killer thought the client was a man. So if the client is Andrews (a woman), this contradicts Testimony 4. But the contradiction would be between Testimony 4 (client thought to be male) and Evidence 25 (client must be female, Andrews). Therefore, the evidence is 25 and testimony is 4.

Alternatively, maybe the Spy Camera evidence. Evidence 24 is a receipt showing Engarde bought a bear identical to the one in Evidence 23 (the spy camera in a stuffed bear). Testimony 2 says the request was for murder and other small things, including giving the figurine to Andrews. But if Engarde bought the bear, then he's the client. So the contradiction would be that de Killer thought the client was a man (Testimony 4) and Evidence 24 shows Engarde bought the bear. But that's not a contradiction; that would support that the client is Engarde, a man. But why would the client be Engarde? Because he bought the bear. But how does that relate to Testimony 3. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3: de Killer was to give the figurine to Andrews. But Evidence 25 says the figurine can only be opened by Corrida and Andrews. So if the client is Engarde, he couldn't open it, but he wants the figurine given to Andrews. So that's possible. But no direct contradiction here.

Wait, another angle: The client sent de Killer a letter. The name at the end made de Killer think the client was a man (Testimony 4). If the client is Engarde (a man), then there's no contradiction. But if the client is Adrian Andrews (a woman), then the name in the letter must have been a man's name. But that's possible if she used a fake name. But perhaps the contradiction is elsewhere.

Wait, looking at Evidence 10: Juan's Autograph to "Wendy" (Security Lady, Wendy Oldbag). Not sure. Or Evidence 11: the magazine clipping about Juan Corrida and A.A. (Adrian Andrews). But not directly related to the testimonies.

Wait, let's think about the Video Tape (Evidence 29). If the video tape was retrieved from de Killer's hideout and he tried to recover it. The contents are unknown. Maybe the tape shows something that contradicts a testimony, but we don't know.

Alternatively, the Pistol (Evidence 28) used by de Killer to shoot Franziska. But not directly related to the testimonies provided.

Another angle: The Letter of Introduction (Evidence 19) from Edgeworth, but not relevant here.

Looking back at the Testimony 3 and Evidence 25. If the client asked de Killer to give the figurine to Andrews, but the figurine can only be opened by her, that implies the client wanted her to have it. If the client is Engarde, he might want her to open it and find Celeste's suicide note (Evidence 27), which incriminates him. But how is that a contradiction?

Alternatively, the contradiction is in Testimony 3 where de Killer says he was to give the figurine to Andrews. But Evidence 25 says that the figurine is a puzzle only known to Corrida and Andrews. So if the client was Engarde, how would he know about the figurine and its importance unless he's connected to Celeste. But that's not a contradiction, just a clue.

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 3 (give figurine to Andrews) and Evidence 3 (Press Conference Ticket for the Nickel Samurai (Engarde) to confess something. If Engarde is the client, he's trying to frame someone else. But not directly a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) set to record the victim's room. Engarde bought the bear (Evidence 24), which contained the spy camera. So Engarde is the one who set up the spy camera. Therefore, he's involved in the murder. But de Killer's client is Engarde, which would align with Testimony 4 (client is a man). No contradiction there.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (give figurine to Andrews) and Evidence 25 (only Corrida and Andrews can open it). If the client is someone else, like Engarde, then he couldn't have known how to open it, so why task de Killer to retrieve it and give it to Andrews. But that's not a direct contradiction. It's possible that the client (Engarde) wants Andrews to have it for some reason, even if he can't open it. So no contradiction.

Wait, but Testimony 3 says the client's request included giving the figurine to Andrews. If the client is Engarde, and he doesn't know how to open it, why ask de Killer to retrieve it and give it to Andrews? Maybe because he knows that Andrews can open it, and perhaps there's something inside that he wants her to find. But that's possible. So no contradiction.

Alternatively, the contradiction is that if the client is Andrews, then she would be giving herself the figurine through de Killer, which is illogical. But de Killer's testimony says he was supposed to give it to her. If the client is Andrews, she's asking de Killer to give herself the figurine, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the client can't be Andrews. But according to Evidence 25, only she and Corrida can open it. If the client is not them, then how would the client know to retrieve it? Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (client tasking de Killer to give the figurine to Andrews) and Evidence 25 (only Andrews and Corrida can open it, implying the client must be one of them). Since Corrida is dead, client must be Andrews, but Testimony 4 says the client was thought to be male. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 25 and Testimony 4.

Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 25 and Testimony 4. So the answer is {"evidence": 25, "testimony": 4}.

{"evidence": 25, "testimony": 4}

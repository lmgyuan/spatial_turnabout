Okay, let's start by looking at the problem. We need to find which evidence contradicts which testimony. The testimonies are from Gumshoe, and he's presenting evidence against Maya. Let's go through each testimony and see what evidence might conflict with it.

First, Testimony 0 says there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence. Not sure which evidence that refers to yet. Testimony 1 is about the costume Maya was wearing. Testimony 2 mentions the costume being covered in blood. Testimony 3 claims Maya attacked someone who wasn't fighting back.

Looking at the evidence list, let's focus on the ones related to the attack. Evidence 11 is Maya's Costume. It has blood splatters and a bullet hole in the sleeve. The autopsy report (Evidence 8) says Dr. Grey was stabbed then shot. The pistol (Evidence 9) has Maya's and Grey's fingerprints, and two shots were fired. The knife (Evidence 10) has Maya's fingerprints. 

Now, Testimony 3 states the victim wasn't fighting back. If Dr. Grey was stabbed first, he might have been incapacitated, so he couldn't fight. But if the gun was his, how did Maya get it? Also, the pistol has two shots fired. Maybe the contradiction is between the blood on Maya's costume and the fact that she was shot at? Wait, the costume has a bullet hole in the sleeve. If Maya was wearing it, that suggests she was shot at. But Testimony 3 says the victim (Dr. Grey) wasn't fighting back. If he was shot in the forehead, he might have been already dead from the stab wound. But the gunpowder residue (Evidence 8) indicates he was shot at point-blank. But if Maya was the one who shot him, how does the bullet hole in her sleeve fit in? Maybe someone else shot at her, which would mean Dr. Grey could have been fighting back. But Testimony 3 says he wasn't. 

Wait, the key point here is that Testimony 3 claims Maya attacked someone who wasn't fighting back. If there's evidence that the victim did fight back, that would contradict it. The bullet hole in Maya's sleeve (Evidence 11) suggests that someone shot at her. If Dr. Grey was the one who shot (since the gun has his fingerprints), then he might have fired the gun. But according to the autopsy, he was stabbed first and then shot. So if he was already stabbed, how could he shoot? Unless the order is different. Wait, the autopsy says he was stabbed in the chest then shot. So after being stabbed, he was shot. The gun has both Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. Maybe Maya stabbed him, he tried to shoot her (hence the bullet hole in her sleeve), but then she shot him. But if that's the case, then Dr. Grey was fighting back by shooting, which contradicts Testimony 3. 

Therefore, Evidence 11 (Maya's Costume with bullet hole) contradicts Testimony 3 (victim wasn't fighting back). The presence of a bullet hole in Maya's sleeve implies that someone shot at her, suggesting the victim might have been able to fight back by firing the gun. That's a contradiction because Testimony 3 claims the victim didn't fight back.

Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the problem is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user has given a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, I'll go through each testimony and see what each one is claiming. Then I'll check the evidences to see if any of them provide information that contradicts that testimony.

Looking at the testimonies from Gumshoe (Testimonies 0 to 4):

Testimony 0: During the channeling, Maya (defendant) stabbed the victim (Dr. Grey) in the chest.

Testimony 1: The victim fought back after being stabbed.

Testimony 2: During the fight, the victim took out his gun.

Testimony 3: The victim shot but missed because they were too close.

Testimony 4: Maya then took the gun and shot him.

Now, the key here is to cross-reference these with the evidence provided. Let's check each testimony against the evidence.

Starting with Testimony 3: The victim took a shot but missed because they were too close. The evidence related to this would be the gun (Evidence 9), which says two shots were fired. Also, the autopsy report (Evidence 8) states that Dr. Grey was shot in the forehead at point-blank range. Additionally, there's Maya's Costume (Evidence 11), which has a bullet hole in the sleeve but no mention of burn marks. Since point-blank shots leave burn marks, if the shot was fired at point-blank, there should be a burn around the hole. However, the testimony says the victim missed because they were too close. Wait, that seems conflicting. If they were too close, how did he miss? But according to the autopsy, he was shot point-blank, which would mean the gun was very close. But the testimony says the shot missed. However, the autopsy says he was shot, so that's a contradiction. Wait, the testimony says the victim shot but missed, but the autopsy shows he was shot in the forehead. So that's a contradiction. But wait, maybe the initial shot missed, and then Maya shot him. Let me check the testimonies again.

Testimony 3: Victim shot but missed because they were too close. Then Testimony 4 says Maya took the gun and ended it. So according to the testimonies, the victim shot once (missed), then Maya took the gun and shot him (which would be the second shot). But the autopsy report (Evidence 8) says he was stabbed first, then shot. The pistol (Evidence 9) has two shots fired. The problem here is that the autopsy says he was shot at point-blank with gunpowder residue, which aligns with the shot that killed him. However, the testimony says the victim's shot missed. But if the victim shot and missed, that would be one shot, and then Maya shot him (second shot). But the autopsy report says he was shot once (the fatal shot). Wait, but Evidence 9 says two shots were fired. So maybe one shot was a miss, and the other hit. But the autopsy only mentions the shot to the forehead. So perhaps the victim shot once (missed), and Maya shot once (hit). That would total two shots, matching Evidence 9. But the autopsy report says he was shot after being stabbed. So the scenario would be: stabbed, then victim tries to shoot, misses, Maya takes the gun and shoots him. But the autopsy says he was shot in the forehead at point-blank. So the shot that hit him was from Maya. But the testimony says the victim missed because they were too close. However, being too close would make it harder to miss, but the shot was at point-blank. Wait, that's a contradiction. If the victim fired a shot at point-blank range, he couldn't have missed. But according to Testimony 3, he missed because they were too close. But Evidence 8 says the bullet hole has gunpowder residue, meaning it was point-blank. Therefore, if the victim shot at point-blank and missed, but the actual fatal shot was from Maya, then the presence of the gunpowder residue on Grey's wound (from Maya's shot) would be correct. But Testimony 3 claims the victim's shot missed. However, the bullet hole in Maya's sleeve (Evidence 11) would be from the victim's shot. But if the victim shot at point-blank, the sleeve would have a burn mark. But the description of Maya's Costume (Evidence 11) says "the robe is otherwise clean" and mentions a bullet hole in the sleeve but no burn marks. If the shot was fired at point-blank, there should be a burn mark. Therefore, the absence of a burn mark on Maya's sleeve (from the victim's shot) contradicts Testimony 3's claim that the victim fired at close range and missed. Because if he fired at close range (point-blank), the bullet hole would have a burn mark, but Evidence 11 doesn't mention a burn, implying the shot was not point-blank. Therefore, the testimony that the victim missed because they were too close (Testimony 3) is contradicted by the lack of burn marks on Maya's costume, which suggests the shot wasn't fired at point-blank. So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (claiming the victim shot at close range and missed) and Evidence 11 (Maya's Costume with a bullet hole but no burn, indicating the shot wasn't point-blank). Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 11 and Testimony 3. But wait, the user's answer format requires the evidence number and testimony number. Evidence 11 is the costume, Testimony 3 is the one about the victim missing because too close. So the JSON should be {"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}

Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Let me start by going through each testimony and checking the evidences to find contradictions.

First, looking at the testimonies by Bikini. Testimony 3 says, "Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner." So Bikini is claiming that Iris was wearing the same clothes as during dinner when she came to the Inner Temple. 

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 6 is Iris's Hood, which states that Iris gave her hood to Phoenix before the lights out bell the night of the crime. The hood is described as something Iris wears at all times. If Iris gave her hood to Phoenix before the lights out bell, which was at 10 PM according to Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony), then during dinner, Iris would have been wearing the hood. But after giving the hood away, she wouldn't have it anymore. 

So, if Bikini says that Iris was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner when she came to the Inner Temple, that would mean Iris was still wearing the hood. But according to Evidence 6, she had already given the hood to Phoenix before lights out (10 PM). So if Iris came to the Inner Temple after 10 PM (since the lights out was at 10), she shouldn't have the hood. Therefore, Bikini's Testimony 3 is contradicted by Evidence 6 because Iris couldn't have been dressed exactly as she was at dinner (with the hood) if she had already given the hood away.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's start by going through each testimony and see which ones might be contradicted by the evidence provided. The user wants me to find one pair where the evidence and testimony don't align.

First, looking at the testimonies by Bikini. Testimony 5 says, "The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window." But according to the autopsy report (Evidence 11), the cause of death was loss of blood from a stab in the back, and the body fell 10 feet after death. That means Elise was stabbed first, then fell. So the autopsy contradicts Bikini's statement that the stabbing happened after being pushed out. If she was pushed out after the stabbing, then the fall would be post-mortem, which matches the autopsy. Wait, no. Bikini says the stabbing happened after she was pushed out. But the autopsy says she was stabbed first, then fell. So if she was pushed out (fall), then stabbed, that's a contradiction. Because the autopsy states she was stabbed, then fell (after death). So Bikini's Testimony 5 claims the stabbing was after the fall, but the evidence shows the stabbing came first. That's a direct contradiction.

Another possible contradiction: Testimony 0 says Bikini finished her bath around 11 PM. The weather data (Evidence 7) mentions lightning until 11 PM. If the lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM, and the snow stopped around 10:50 PM. Maybe the timings here? Not sure. But the key contradiction is between Testimony 5 and the autopsy report. So the evidence would be 11 (autopsy) and testimony 5. But wait, the user wants evidence and testimony numbers. The evidence number for the autopsy is 11, and the testimony number 5. So that's one pair. Let me check again.

Testimony 5: Stabbing after being pushed out. Autopsy: Stabbed, then fell (so pushed out after stabbing). Therefore, Bikini's Testimony 5 is incorrect. The evidence (11) contradicts Testimony 5. Therefore, the answer should be evidence 11 and testimony 5.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and they want to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The answer must be in a JSON format specifying one pair.

First, I need to go through each testimony and see if any of the evidence directly contradicts it. Let me start by looking at the testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 from Bikini states: "And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!" So according to Bikini, she saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise in the back. However, looking at the evidence, specifically the autopsy report (Evidence 11), the cause of death is a stab wound in the back. That seems to align, but maybe there's more here.

Wait, the murder weapon is important here. Evidence 9 is the Victim's Staff, which has a sword hidden inside and is the actual murder weapon. Evidence 10 is the Shichishito, which is the apparent weapon with the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints, but it's stated that it's not the actual murder weapon. So the real weapon is the staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9), not the Shichishito (Evidence 10). 

Testimony 5 says that Bikini saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise with the sword (Shichishito?), but the actual murder weapon was the staff's hidden sword. If the Shichishito has the victim's blood but isn't the real weapon, then the testimony about seeing the stabbing with a sword (which would be the Shichishito) contradicts the evidence that the real weapon was the staff's sword. Therefore, Bikini's testimony about seeing the stabbing with that sword would be incorrect because the actual murder weapon was different. 

So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Bikini claiming to see the stabbing with a sword) and Evidence 10 (which states that the Shichishito had the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints but is not the actual murder weapon). Therefore, the testimony that the stabbing happened with the Shichishito (as per Bikini's account) is contradicted by Evidence 10's clarification that it's not the real weapon.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 5}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. My task is to pick one pair where the evidence and testimony don't match up.

First, let me go through the testimonies. Testimony 5 by Bikini says that Iris could have done it because she can drive a snowmobile. So Bikini is implying that Iris used the snowmobile. Now, looking at the evidences related to tracks or snowmobile use. 

Evidence 14 is the Tracks Photo, which shows one track leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If the snowmobile was used, there would be tracks. But according to Bikini's Testimony 2, she saw tracks indicating the snowmobile was used. Wait, but if there's only one track in the photo, maybe that's conflicting. Wait, no, Bikini says she saw tracks from the snowmobile. The photo shows one track. Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that the photo shows one track, implying the snowmobile was used once, but if someone went to the bridge and came back, there should be two tracks (there and back). But according to Testimony 4, Bikini suggests the culprit went to the bridge, threw the weapon, and came back. So the tracks should be going both ways, but the photo only shows one track. That would be a contradiction between Testimony 4 and Evidence 14. However, Testimony 4 is Bikini's speculation, but the photo is evidence of only one track. So if the snowmobile was used to go and come back, there should be two tracks, but the photo shows one. Therefore, Testimony 4 (about going and coming back) contradicts Evidence 14 (only one track). Alternatively, Testimony 2 says Bikini saw tracks indicating the snowmobile was used. But the photo only shows one track. Wait, maybe the snowmobile can only make one track? Or maybe the direction is such that it's a single track. Hmm. Wait, maybe the tracks photo shows tracks leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If someone went to the bridge and came back, there would be tracks both ways. But the photo only shows one set. Therefore, if someone went to the bridge, they must have not come back, but Testimony 4 suggests they came back. That would mean the tracks should have two sets, but there's only one. Therefore, Testimony 4 (culprit came back) contradicts Evidence 14 (only one track). So the pair would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 4. But Evidence 14 is the Tracks Photo. Let me check the numbers again. Evidence 14 is the Tracks Photo. Testimony 4 is Bikini's speculation about the culprit coming back. So the contradiction is that if they came back, there should be two tracks (to and from), but the photo shows only one track. Therefore, Evidence 14 contradicts Testimony 4. But the user wants the evidence and testimony that contradict each other. So the correct pair would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 4. Alternatively, maybe another pair. Let me check other possibilities. Testimony 5 says Iris can drive the snowmobile, but if Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room, but that's a different testimony. Wait, Bikini's Testimony 5 suggests Iris could have used the snowmobile, but if there's evidence that Iris couldn't have done that. For example, if Iris's own testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room, that would contradict. But the user is asking for evidence and testimony from the list provided. The Testimony list includes Testimony 0-5, all by Bikini. So I need to check contradictions between Bikini's testimonies and the evidence. Let me check each testimony against the evidence. Testimony 2: Bikini says she saw tracks from the snowmobile. Evidence 14 shows the tracks. So they support each other, no contradiction. Testimony 3: It takes 15 minutes to walk, 5 by snowmobile. That's not contradicted by any evidence. Testimony 4: Maybe they threw the weapon into the river and came back. But Evidence 14 shows only one track. If they went to the bridge, threw the weapon, and came back, they would have made two tracks (to and from). But the photo only shows one track, implying a one-way trip. So Testimony 4 is contradicted by Evidence 14. That's a possible pair. Another possible contradiction: Testimony 0 says Bikini saw the murder at around 11 PM. But the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the time of death was 10-11 PM. That's a range, so 11 PM is within that. No contradiction there. Testimony 1: After reporting, she went to the Main Gate. Not sure. Evidence 18 is a burnt letter from Morgan Fey, but not sure. Let's think again. The key contradiction is Testimony 4 (culprit came back) vs Evidence 14 (only one track). So that's the pair. Therefore, the answer should be evidence 14 and testimony 4. Let me check the numbers again. Evidence 14 is Tracks Photo. Testimony 4 is Bikini's speculation about coming back. So {"evidence": 14, "testimony": 4}.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 4}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to find one pair where the evidence and testimony don't match up.

First, I'll go through the testimonies. The testimonies are from Butz (Testimony 0 to 6). Let me check what each says.

Testimony 0: Butz says he went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM. Wait, maybe there's a time discrepancy here. If he went at 9, how does that lead to 10:30? Maybe he's talking about when he left or arrived. Not sure yet.

Looking at Evidence 7, which is the Weather Data. It mentions that the snow stopped around 10:50 PM and lightning occurred from 10 to 11 PM. Also, lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. There's a testimony from Bikini saying she saw the murder around 11 PM. Larry Butz (Testimony 5) says he arrived at the bridge and Nick (Phoenix) showed up less than a minute later. But according to the evidence, the lightning struck the bridge at 10:45. 

Wait, Testimony 5 says Butz arrived at the bridge and met Nick there. But in the crime timeline, Phoenix fell from the bridge and was hospitalized. The crime photo (Evidence 13) might show the scene. Also, in Evidence 7's notes, there's a mention that around 30 minutes passed between the fire starting and going out. The fire was from the lightning strike at 10:45. So the fire would have been from 10:45 to around 11:15? 

Butz's Testimony 2 says he looked out the window and saw Dusky Bridge on fire. Then Testimony 3 says he went to check it out despite some thunder. Testimony 5 says he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. However, according to the timeline in Evidence 7, the lightning hit at 10:45, causing the fire. But if Butz saw the fire right when it started (10:45), and then went to check, but the snow stopped around 10:50. The weather data says snow was from 7 to ~10:50 PM. So if Butz went out after the snow stopped, which would be after 10:50. But he claims he went right away when he saw the fire (at 10:45?), but the snow was still ongoing until 10:50. 

Wait, Testimony 0: Butz says he went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM. Hmm, maybe there's a time inconsistency here. If he went to the shack at 9 PM, how did that take until 10:30 PM? Or is he saying that the time he was there was around 10:30 PM? That might not directly conflict yet.

Looking at Testimony 5 again: Butz says he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. But according to the crime timeline, Phoenix fell from the bridge and was hospitalized. If Phoenix was at the bridge when the fire started (10:45), then Butz's arrival and meeting Phoenix would have to be around that time. But according to the weather data, the lightning struck at 10:45, starting the fire. Then, Phoenix was found at 11:06 PM in the courtyard, according to the note in Evidence 7. So Phoenix's scream was heard around 11:06 PM. But if Butz arrived at the bridge and met Nick there less than a minute later, but Phoenix was at the courtyard at 11:06, that might not align. Alternatively, maybe the timeline is conflicting here.

Wait, Testimony 5 is Butz saying he arrived at the bridge and met Nick there. But according to the evidence, Phoenix fell from the bridge and ended up hospitalized. So when Butz says he met Nick at the bridge, that contradicts the fact that Phoenix was there before falling. But the exact timing might matter. Let me check the evidence again.

Evidence 7's notes include a statement from Phoenix at 11:06 PM in the courtyard where he finds the body. The fire started at 10:45 PM, and took about 30 minutes to go out, so ending around 11:15. Butz's testimony about arriving at the bridge and meeting Nick (Phoenix) there would have to be after the fire started. But if Phoenix was at the bridge when the lightning struck (10:45), leading to his fall, then Butz couldn't have met him there after that. Alternatively, maybe the timings are conflicting.

Wait, let me cross-reference. Evidence 7's weather data: lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM. The fire lasted 30 minutes, so until around 11:15 PM. The murder of Elise Deauxnim's time of death is between 10-11 PM (Evidence 11). Phoenix was found in the courtyard at 11:06 PM, according to the note in Evidence 7. So Phoenix was at the bridge around 10:45 when the lightning hit, fell, and then ended up in the courtyard by 11:06. But Butz's Testimony 5 says he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. If Phoenix was already at the bridge when the lightning struck (10:45), then Butz couldn't have arrived after the fire started and met Phoenix there, because Phoenix would have fallen and been injured. Therefore, Butz's Testimony 5 contradicts the timeline in Evidence 7. Alternatively, maybe there's another contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3: Butz says there was still some thunder, but he went right away to check it out. The weather data says lightning (and thus thunder) was from 10 to approx. 11 PM. The lightning strike was at 10:45. If Butz went out after seeing the fire (from the lightning strike at 10:45), but the snow had stopped around 10:50. However, in his testimony, he mentions that when he went out, it had stopped snowing. Wait, in the Evidence 7 notes, there's a testimony from von Karma asking Butz how far the shack was from the bridge, and Butz replies that it had pretty much stopped snowing, so about a five-minute walk. So, if the snow stopped at 10:50, Butz left after that. But the lightning strike was at 10:45. If Butz saw the bridge on fire (from the lightning strike at 10:45), but didn't go out until after the snow stopped at 10:50, then there's a time gap. But how does that contradict?

Wait, the problem is that Testimony 5 says Butz arrived at the bridge and met Nick there less than a minute later. But according to the timeline, the lightning hit at 10:45, which caused the fire. Phoenix would have been there around that time, leading to his fall. But the murder of Elise happened between 10-11 PM. If Phoenix was at the bridge at 10:45, fell, and then was found in the courtyard at 11:06, then Butz couldn't have met Phoenix at the bridge after the fire started. Therefore, Testimony 5 contradicts the timeline, which states Phoenix was hospitalized after falling from the bridge. So Butz's testimony about meeting Phoenix at the bridge after the fire started (10:45) would be impossible, as Phoenix was already injured.

But the evidence that contradicts this would be Evidence 7, which provides the timeline of events. Therefore, Testimony 5 (Butz's statement that he arrived at the bridge and met Nick there) contradicts Evidence 7's timeline showing that Phoenix fell from the bridge and was hospitalized. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 7 and Testimony 5.

Wait, but the user wants the answer in JSON with the evidence number and testimony number. The evidence numbers are from 0 to 21. Testimony numbers from 0 to 6.

Looking back: Evidence 7 is the Weather Data with the timeline. Testimony 5 is Butz's Testimony 5. So the JSON would be {"evidence": 7, "testimony": 5}.

But let me check again. In Testimony 5: "I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later." But according to the evidence, the lightning struck the bridge at 10:45, and Phoenix fell. If Butz arrived at the bridge (after 10:45), then Phoenix was already injured, so he couldn't have shown up at the bridge after Butz arrived. Therefore, this testimony is impossible, contradicting the evidence (Weather Data) that shows the lightning strike and the events following. Therefore, the correct pair is evidence 7 and testimony 5.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 5}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So, I need to look through all the testimonies and see if any of them don't match up with the evidence provided.

First, let's look at the testimonies. The testimonies are from Butz (Larry). Testimony 0 to 4 are his statements. Let me go through each one.

Testimony 0: He says he's an artist and asks what he was doing. Then in Testimony 1, he claims he was sketching in front of the bridge. Testimony 2 says he saw Iris flying with her white hood fluttering. Testimony 3 is about him transferring his shock onto the page. Testimony 4 mentions the flames going out and someone coming up.

Now, checking the evidence. Let's see. Evidence 15 is Larry's Sketch, which is a horrible sketch of what he saw. The description says to click here for details, but maybe the key is in other evidence. Also, the Weather Data (Evidence 7) mentions that there was snow from 7 to around 10:50 PM and lightning until 11 PM. The lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. 

Wait, Larry said he was sketching in front of the bridge that night. But if there was heavy snow and lightning, especially around 10 PM when the lights out bell was rung (from Iris's Testimony, Evidence 12), how could Larry be outside sketching? The weather was bad, with snow until almost 11 PM. Also, the tracks photo (Evidence 14) shows only one track leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If Larry was out there sketching, wouldn't there be his tracks as well? But the photo shows only one set of tracks. That might be a contradiction. But which testimony does that contradict?

Testimony 1 says he was sketching in front of the bridge. If there's only one track, maybe his presence there isn't supported by the tracks. But the track could be someone else's. Alternatively, the weather was bad, so maybe he couldn't have been outside sketching during the snow. The snow stopped around 10:50 PM, but the lightning was until 11. If Larry was out there during the snow, his presence might leave tracks, but the tracks photo only shows one set. However, the track's timing isn't clear. Hmm.

Another angle: Testimony 2 says he saw Iris flying with her white hood. But Iris's Hood (Evidence 6) was given to Phoenix before the lights out bell at 10 PM. So Iris shouldn't have been wearing the hood during the time Larry claims he saw her. Because she gave the hood to Phoenix before 10 PM. So if Larry says he saw Iris flying with the white hood after 10 PM, that contradicts Evidence 6, which states that Phoenix had the hood. Therefore, Larry's Testimony 2 about seeing Iris in her hood after 10 PM is impossible because Phoenix had the hood already. That seems like a solid contradiction.

So the contradiction would be between Testimony 2 (Butz's claim of seeing Iris in the hood) and Evidence 6 (Iris's Hood given to Phoenix before the crime). Therefore, the evidence is 6 and testimony is 2.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 2}
====================================================================================================

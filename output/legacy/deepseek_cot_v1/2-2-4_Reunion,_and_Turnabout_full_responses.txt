Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies provided. Let's go through each testimony and see if any of the evidence items conflict with it.

First, looking at the Testimonies. Testimony 0: Ini says she was sleeping in the Side Room when the channeling started. Evidence 1 is the Guidemap of Fey Manor. The map shows that the Side Room is to the east, accessible through a winding path from the meditation room. Maybe the layout could relate, but not sure yet.

Testimony 2: Ini claims she saw her sister, Mimi Miney. But wait, Evidence 6's newspaper clipping states that Mimi died a year ago in a car accident. So if Mimi is dead, how could Ini see her? Unless someone was impersonating her, but the testimony says it was her sister. That seems contradictory because Mimi is supposed to be dead. But maybe channeling? Let's check other evidence. The autopsy report (Evidence 8) says Dr. Grey was stabbed then shot. The pistol (Evidence 9) has Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. The knife (Evidence 10) has Maya's prints. 

Wait, Testimony 2 says Ini saw her sister, but Mimi is dead. Unless there's a case of mistaken identity or channeling. However, the Sacred Urn (Evidence 14) is under repair, so maybe channeling wasn't possible. Also, the cloth scrap (Evidence 15) found in the incinerator might relate to a disguise. 

Looking at Testimony 4: Ini says her sister's costume looked totally normal. But if Mimi is dead, someone else must have been dressed as her. The Clothing Box (Evidence 17) has a bullet hole 8 inches off the ground, similar to the Folding Screen (Evidence 4). Maybe a bullet went through there. 

But back to Testimony 2. If Ini claims she saw Mimi, but Mimi is dead, the contradiction would be Evidence 6 (newspaper clipping about Mimi's death) conflicting with Testimony 2. Therefore, the existence of Mimi being dead contradicts Ini's testimony that she saw her sister. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 6 and Testimony 2.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 2}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are provided. Let me start by understanding the key points here.

First, looking at the testimonies from Ini Miney (Testimony 0 to 4). Testimony 3 says, "And then... like, I took my sister to the Channeling Chamber." Wait, but according to the evidence, specifically Evidence 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2), Mimi Miney died a year ago in a car accident. So Mimi is already dead. But Testimony 3 mentions Ini taking her sister (Mimi) to the Channeling Chamber. That doesn't make sense because Mimi is deceased.

But wait, maybe there's a possibility of channeling? The Fey family are spirit mediums. But the timing here is important. The murder of Dr. Grey is current, and Mimi died a year ago. If Ini took Mimi to the Channeling Chamber, that would imply that Mimi's spirit was channeled. However, the Sacred Urn (Evidence 14) was broken and under repair at the time of the murder. The urn contains Ami Fey's spirit, but maybe Mimi's spirit could be channeled without the urn. But according to Pearl's statement in Evidence 14, she fixed the urn in the hallway before the police arrived. So during the murder, the urn was broken. But channeling might still be possible if another medium did it. However, Maya was the one present, and she's a trainee. 

But the main contradiction here is that Testimony 3 says Ini took her sister (Mimi) to the Channeling Chamber, but Mimi is already dead. Therefore, unless Ini is lying or referring to a spirit, which would require channeling. But the evidence shows that Mimi is dead, so unless there's a channeling involved, Ini couldn't have physically taken her sister there. Since Ini is a college student into the occult, maybe she attempted a channeling? But according to the timeline, the channeling chamber was used for the murder. However, the presence of Mimi's spirit would need to be confirmed. But the key contradiction is that Ini's testimony claims she took her sister (Mimi) to the chamber, but Mimi is dead. Therefore, the testimony is conflicting with the evidence that Mimi is deceased. So the evidence 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2) states Mimi died a year ago. Testimony 3 claims Ini took her sister to the Channeling Chamber, which would be impossible if Mimi is dead. Therefore, this is a contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe Ini is lying, and the contradiction is between her testimony and the evidence about Mimi's death. So the pair would be Evidence 6 and Testimony 3. Wait, but the user asked for which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So in Testimony 3, Ini says she took her sister (Mimi) to the Channeling Chamber. But Evidence 6 clearly states Mimi died a year ago. Therefore, these two contradict each other because Ini couldn't have taken her dead sister there unless through channeling. However, unless Ini was involved in channeling, which would require a medium. But the Sacred Urn was broken, and Maya was the one present. But Ini isn't a medium as per her description (college student into occult). So unless Ini is lying, the testimony is impossible. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Ini took her sister to the chamber) and Evidence 6 (Mimi is dead).

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me start by understanding the problem. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user has provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. My task is to analyze these and find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, let me look at the testimonies. All the testimonies provided are from Ini Miney (Character 6). Testimony 0 says "That was... like, last year, in May." Testimony 1 mentions something bad happening at her sister's clinic. Testimony 2 states that on the night of the accident, her sister was tired while driving. Testimony 3 says Ini fell asleep in the passenger seat. Testimony 4 describes waking up to a jolt and flames. Testimony 5 is about escaping the car. Testimony 6 says she didn't have her license, so she couldn't take over driving.

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 6 is a newspaper clipping about the car accident involving Mimi and Ini Miney. The article states that Ini was the one driving and that she fell asleep at the wheel, leading to the crash. However, in Testimony 6, Ini claims she didn't have her license and couldn't take over driving. But according to the newspaper clipping, the driver was Mimi, and Ini was the passenger. Wait, but the article says "the driver had fallen asleep at the wheel" and quotes Ini as saying, "I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep. Then there was this crash..." Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the newspaper says that the driver was Mimi, but Ini's testimony in the article says she was the one driving. Let me check again.

Evidence 6's description says: The article mentions that Mimi Miney was the nurse at the clinic and that the crash happened when the driver fell asleep. But according to the article's quotes from Ini, she says, "I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep. Then there was this crash, and like, I woke up in a huge sea of flames. I was like, still half-asleep, but I opened the right door and like, got out. I don't, like, remember anything else." Then the article questions if it's a coincidence because Mimi was involved in the clinic's incident. Wait, Ini's statement in the article suggests she was the driver, but the article also says that the driver was Mimi. That's conflicting. Wait, but maybe the article is implying that Ini was lying. Because according to the article, if Ini's statement is to be believed, the driver was Mimi. Wait, no. Let me parse it again.

The article's section: "Ms. Ini Miney Holds Interview About Crash- I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep. Then there was this crash, and like, I woke up in a huge sea of flames. I was like, still half-asleep, but I opened the right door and like, got out. I don't, like, remember anything else. -Doctor Lurking in the Shadows? If Ms. Ini Miney is to be believed, the one driving the car was her sister, Mimi Miney. Mimi Miney was the nurse at Grey Surgical Clinic where 14 patients were accidentally overdosed to their death. Is this then, just a mere coincidence...?"

Wait, so Ini's testimony in the article says that she was the one who fell asleep (as the passenger?), but the article's analysis suggests that if Ini is to be believed, then Mimi was driving. But Ini's own testimony (Testimony 2 and 3) states that her sister was driving and tired, and she (Ini) was the passenger who fell asleep. But according to the newspaper clipping, Ini's statement in the interview implies that she was the driver. Because she says she was tired, fell asleep, then woke up in the crash. If she was the passenger, then the driver would be Mimi. But in the article, the police concluded that the driver fell asleep, which would be Mimi. But Ini's testimony in the article seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Ini's testimonies here and the evidence.

Wait, the user-provided testimonies (Testimony 2 and 3) from Ini say that her sister was driving and that Ini was in the passenger seat and fell asleep. However, Evidence 6's newspaper article quotes Ini as saying she (Ini) was the one who fell asleep while driving. Because in her interview, she says "I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep. Then there was this crash..." If she was the driver, then that contradicts her testimony here. But according to the user's provided testimonies (Testimony 2 and 3), Ini is saying that her sister was driving. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and 3 where Ini claims Mimi was driving and she was the passenger, versus Evidence 6 which, according to the article's quote from Ini, suggests she was the driver. However, the article's analysis then says "If Ms. Ini Miney is to be believed, the one driving the car was her sister, Mimi Miney." So there's confusion here. Wait, maybe I need to check the exact wording.

Ini's testimony (Testimony 2): "And like, the night of the accident, my sis was totally tired while she was driving." So Ini is stating that her sister was driving. Testimony 3: "I was, like, totally pooped too, so I, like, fell asleep in the passenger's seat..." So Ini was the passenger. However, in the newspaper clipping (Evidence 6), the article includes a quote from Ini where she says, "I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep. Then there was this crash..." If she was the passenger, then her falling asleep wouldn't cause the crash. But the article's quote from Ini makes it sound like she was the driver. Wait, unless she's lying. So the contradiction here is that in her testimony, Ini says her sister was driving, but in the newspaper article (Evidence 6), her own statement implies she was the driver. Therefore, Evidence 6 (the newspaper clipping) contradicts Testimony 2 and 3 where Ini claims her sister was driving.

But looking at the given testimonies, Testimony 6 says: "I, like, didn't have my license, so, like, I couldn't take over driving for her." So Ini didn't have a license, meaning she couldn't drive. But in the newspaper article, if she was the driver, that's impossible because she didn't have a license. Wait, but the article's quote from Ini says she was driving? Wait, no. Let me re-examine Evidence 6's description. It says: "The content is as follows-Highway of Nightmares-May 24 - Late last night, two women's car crashed into a highway center divide. One of the women was not able to escape the flaming wreckage and died at the site. Ongoing investigation has revealed that the driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. -Ms. Ini Miney Holds Interview About Crash- I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep. Then there was this crash, and like, I woke up in a huge sea of flames. I was like, still half-asleep, but I opened the right door and like, got out. I don't, like, remember anything else. -Doctor Lurking in the Shadows? If Ms. Ini Miney is to be believed, the one driving the car was her sister, Mimi Miney. Mimi Miney was the nurse at Grey Surgical Clinic where 14 patients were accidentally overdosed to their death. Is this then, just a mere coincidence...?"

Wait, so according to the article, the police investigation said the driver fell asleep (which would be Mimi, the sister). But the article quotes Ini as saying she (Ini) fell asleep. However, Ini was the passenger. If she fell asleep as a passenger, that's not relevant to the crash. But the driver (Mimi) falling asleep would be. But the article's initial report says the driver fell asleep. Then, the article quotes Ini's interview where she says she fell asleep. But if Ini was the passenger, her falling asleep wouldn't cause the crash. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. The police report says the driver (Mimi) fell asleep, but Ini's statement in the article implies she was driving and fell asleep. But Ini's testimonies in the given list (Testimonies 2,3,6) say she was the passenger, and Mimi was driving. However, in the newspaper article, Ini's own statement says she fell asleep, which as the passenger doesn't make sense. Unless she was actually the driver. Therefore, the contradiction is between Ini's testimony (Testimony 6) where she says she didn't have a license (so couldn't drive) and the newspaper article (Evidence 6) where Ini's statement implies she was driving. Wait, but the article's analysis says that if Ini is to be believed, the driver was Mimi. But Ini's own statement in the article is confusing. Let me parse this again.

Ini's statement in the article: "I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep. Then there was this crash, and like, I woke up in a huge sea of flames. I was like, still half-asleep, but I opened the right door and like, got out. I don't, like, remember anything else."

If Ini was the passenger, she fell asleep, then woke up during the crash. But the driver would be Mimi. However, the police concluded the driver fell asleep. So Mimi, the driver, fell asleep, leading to the crash. But Ini's statement in the article says she (Ini) fell asleep. Which would be as a passenger. But the police report says the driver fell asleep. So there's no contradiction there. Then where is the contradiction?

Wait, Testimony 6 from Ini says she didn't have her license, so couldn't take over driving. But Evidence 18 is a License Photo, which is Ini's driver's license photo, described as "Ini's photo for her driver's license. Director Hotti's treasured possession." So if Evidence 18 shows that Ini has a driver's license, that contradicts Testimony 6 where she claims she didn't have a license. That seems like a direct contradiction. Because if she has a license (as per Evidence 18), then Testimony 6 is a lie. Therefore, Evidence 18 (License Photo) contradicts Testimony 6.

Yes, that's a clear contradiction. Because Testimony 6 states that Ini didn't have a driver's license, but Evidence 18 is her driver's license photo, implying she did have one. Therefore, this pair is a contradiction.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 6}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by looking through the testimonies and see if any of them conflict with the evidence provided.

The testimonies given are all from Ini Miney (Character 6). Let me list them out:

Testimony 0: Ini was close to getting her license around that time (the time of the accident, I assume).
Testimony 1: Her sister Mimi loved cars and valued them a lot.
Testimony 2: Mimi had a new shiny red sports car.
Testimony 3: The car was a special model from England.
Testimony 4: Mimi wouldn't let a newb (beginner) drive her car.
Testimony 5: That's why Ini was in the passenger seat that night.

Now, looking at the evidence related to the car accident. Evidence 6 is a newspaper clipping about the accident. The article mentions that Ini Miney was the driver, but according to the testimonies, Ini claims she was in the passenger seat. Wait, no—the article says that according to Ini, Mimi was driving. Let me check that again.

The article says: "If Ms. Ini Miney is to be believed, the one driving the car was her sister, Mimi Miney." But the crash resulted in Mimi's death. However, the evidence also includes a driver's license photo (Evidence 18: Ini's license photo). If Ini had a driver's license, that would contradict her testimony where she said she was in the passenger seat because Mimi wouldn't let a newb drive. But wait, Testimony 0 says she was close to getting her license at the time of the accident (which was a year ago). If she now has a license (as per Evidence 18), that would imply she got it after, but during the accident, she didn't have it yet. However, if Evidence 18 is a current license, then perhaps that's not a direct contradiction. Wait, but the problem is to find a contradiction between testimony and evidence.

Wait, let me look again. The testimonies from Ini are about the car accident. She says that her sister Mimi was driving because Mimi wouldn't let a newb (Ini) drive. But the article in Evidence 6 mentions that the police investigation found that the driver had fallen asleep, and Ini claims Mimi was driving. However, if there's evidence that Ini was the driver, that would contradict her testimony.

But looking at Evidence 18: License Photo is Ini's driver's license photo, which is a "treasured possession" of Director Hotti. If Ini has a driver's license, that would mean she is licensed, but her testimony (Testimony 4) states that Mimi wouldn't let a newb drive. If Ini had a license at the time of the accident, then she's not a newb, which contradicts her claim that Mimi was driving because she (Ini) was a newb. Alternatively, if she didn't have a license at the time (Testimony 0 says she was close to getting it around that time), then maybe she got it later, but the existence of the license now (Evidence 18) might not directly contradict. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3: Mimi's car was a special model from England. If the car was a right-hand drive (as UK cars are), then the driver's seat is on the right. In the accident, if the car crashed into the center divide, which in some countries is on the left side of the road. If the driver was on the right (UK model), the passenger side would be on the left. If the article says that Ini escaped from the right door (as per Evidence 6's description: "I opened the right door and like, got out"), but in a right-hand drive car, the right door is the passenger side. So if Ini got out of the right door, that would mean she was in the passenger seat, which aligns with her testimony. However, if the car was left-hand drive (like in the US), then the right door would be the driver's side. Wait, but the article in Evidence 6 says the car was a UK model (from England, so right-hand drive). So in that case, the right door is the passenger side. So Ini opening the right door would mean she was the passenger, which matches her testimony. But wait, the accident happened in the US, maybe? The Highway of Nightmares article doesn't specify the location. Wait, but if the car is a UK model (right-hand drive), then the driver's seat is on the right. So the driver (Mimi) would be on the right side, and the passenger (Ini) on the left. But the car's doors would be: right side (driver's door) and left side (passenger door). If Ini opened the right door, that would be the driver's side, which would contradict her testimony that she was the passenger. Wait, but in a right-hand drive car, the driver's seat is on the right, so the right door is the driver's door. If Ini was the passenger, she would be on the left side and would exit via the left door. But in the testimony (from Evidence 6), Ini says she opened the right door. That would mean she was on the driver's side, implying she was driving. That contradicts her testimony that Mimi was driving. Therefore, the fact that the car was a UK model (Testimony 3) and the right door being opened by Ini (as per Evidence 6) would contradict her statement that she was in the passenger seat. Therefore, Evidence 6's article's details (Ini opening the right door) contradict Testimony 3 (the car being a UK model with right-hand drive). Because if the car is right-hand drive, the right door is the driver's door. So if Ini opened the right door to escape, she must have been the driver, which contradicts her testimony that Mimi was driving. Therefore, the evidence (6) and testimony (3) contradict each other. Wait, but Testimony 3 is about the car being a UK model, which implies right-hand drive. The article in Evidence 6 says Ini opened the right door. If she was the passenger, she would have been on the left side and opened the left door. So this would imply she was the driver, contradicting her other testimonies. Therefore, Evidence 6 and Testimony 3? Or perhaps another testimony. Let me check the testimonies again. 

Ini's Testimony 5 says she was in the passenger seat. But according to the car being right-hand drive (Testimony 3), the driver's door is on the right. The article (Evidence 6) states that Ini opened the right door. Therefore, Ini opened the driver's door, which would mean she was in the driver's seat. Therefore, her testimony that she was in the passenger seat (Testimony 5) is contradicted by the evidence (Evidence 6) which suggests she exited through the driver's door. But the problem is to find which testimony and evidence contradict each other. So in this case, Testimony 5 (Ini in passenger seat) is contradicted by Evidence 6 (Ini opened the right door, implying driver seat). But how does that link to the other testimonies? Testimony 3 is about the car being a UK model (right-hand drive). So combining Testimony 3 with Evidence 6, we can see a contradiction. Alternatively, Testimony 5 (passenger seat) is contradicted by Evidence 6's description. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 6 and Testimony 5. But let me check again. 

Wait, the user asks for one pair. Let's see. The key contradiction is that if the car is right-hand drive (Testimony 3), then the right door is driver's side. So if Ini opened the right door (as per Evidence 6), she was the driver, contradicting Testimony 5 where she says she was in the passenger seat. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 6. But the user's answer must be one pair. Alternatively, perhaps Testimony 3 (car is UK model) and Evidence 6 (Ini opened the right door) together create a contradiction with Testimony 5. But perhaps the direct contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 6. However, Testimony 5 is her saying she was in the passenger seat. But the evidence in the article (Evidence 6) says she opened the right door. If the car is right-hand drive (Testimony 3), then the right door is driver's side, so if she opened the right door, she was the driver. Therefore, the contradiction arises when combining Testimony 3 and Evidence 6 against Testimony 5. But the question is which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So the answer would pair Evidence 6 (which includes the info about Ini opening the right door and the car being Mimi's) and Testimony 3 (the car being a UK model, hence right-hand drive). The combination of Testimony 3 and Evidence 6 creates a contradiction with her other testimonies. Wait, but maybe the actual contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Ini in passenger seat) and Evidence 6 (she opened the right door, which in a right-hand drive car is driver's side). So the testimony that the car is a UK model (Testimony 3) and the evidence about the door she exited (Evidence 6) would combine to show she was the driver, contradicting Testimony 5. But the user wants only one pair of evidence and testimony. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is Testimony 5 and Evidence 6. But how? Let me think again.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 (car is UK model, right-hand drive) and Evidence 6 (Ini opened the right door) directly contradict each other if the right door is the driver's side. Therefore, if the car is right-hand drive, the right door is driver's. If Ini opened the right door, she was the driver. But in her testimonies (Testimonies 4 and 5), she says Mimi wouldn't let her drive, so she was passenger. Therefore, Testimony 3 and Evidence 6 together contradict Testimony 5. But the question is which single pair of evidence and testimony contradict. So maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (car is UK model) and Evidence 6 (Ini opened right door). Because in a UK model (right-hand drive), the driver's door is on the right. So if Ini opened the right door, she was the driver. But she says she was the passenger. Therefore, Testimony 5 (passenger seat) is contradicted by the combination of Testimony 3 and Evidence 6. However, the user is asking for one evidence and one testimony that contradict. So perhaps the answer is Evidence 6 (which includes the part where Ini opened the right door) and Testimony 3 (the car being UK model). Because the UK model implies right-hand drive, so the right door is driver's side. If she opened the right door, she was driving, contradicting her claim that Mimi was driving. But the problem is that the testimonies are from Ini, so Testimony 3 is her saying the car was a UK model, which combined with her statement in Evidence 6 about opening the right door, would mean she was driving, contradicting Testimony 5. Therefore, the actual contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Ini in passenger seat) and the combination of Testimony 3 and Evidence 6. But since the user wants one evidence and one testimony, perhaps the pair is Evidence 6 and Testimony 3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Evidence 18 (Ini's license photo) and Testimony 4. Testimony 4 says Mimi wouldn't let a newb drive. If Ini had a license (as per Evidence 18), she's not a newb, contradicting Testimony 4. But Testimony 0 says she was close to getting her license around that time (a year ago), but Evidence 18 is a current license. So if she got her license after the accident, that doesn't contradict. However, if the license was obtained before the accident, that would contradict Testimony 4. But the timing isn't clear. The accident was a year ago, and the current investigation is now. So Evidence 18 is a current license, which doesn't necessarily mean she had it a year ago. Therefore, this might not be a contradiction. 

Alternatively, look at Evidence 6's newspaper article. The article says that the driver was Mimi, based on Ini's statement. But if the car was right-hand drive and Ini opened the right door, that would suggest she was the driver, contradicting her statement. Therefore, the contradiction is between her Testimony 5 (passenger seat) and the evidence in the article (she opened the right door, implying driver's seat in a right-hand car). So the pair would be Evidence 6 and Testimony 5. But how does the article's content fit? The article says, "I opened the right door and like, got out." So Ini's statement in the article is that she opened the right door. If the car is right-hand drive (Testimony 3), then the right door is the driver's door. Therefore, Ini's action of opening the right door (Evidence 6) contradicts her Testimony 5 (she was in the passenger seat). Therefore, Evidence 6 and Testimony 5 contradict each other. But the user wants one pair. So the answer would be {"evidence": 6, "testimony": 5}. 

Wait, but let's confirm. Testimony 5 is Ini saying she was in the passenger seat. Evidence 6's article includes Ini's statement that she opened the right door. If the car is right-hand drive (Testimony 3), then the right door is driver's side. Therefore, if she opened the right door, she was in the driver's seat. Therefore, her testimony that she was in the passenger seat (Testimony 5) contradicts with the evidence (Evidence 6) when considering the car's model (Testimony 3). But since the user is only pairing one evidence and one testimony, maybe the correct pair is Testimony 3 and Evidence 6, because the car being a UK model (right-hand drive) and Ini opening the right door (as per Evidence 6) means she was driving, which contradicts her other testimonies. But which testimony? Testimony 5 is the one where she says she was in the passenger seat. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 6. Because if she opened the right door (Evidence 6) and the car is right-hand drive (Testimony 3), then she was driving, which contradicts Testimony 5. But the user is asking for one evidence and one testimony. So the contradiction is between Evidence 6 (which contains the info about the right door) and Testimony 3 (car is UK model). Or between Evidence 6 and Testimony 5. Because Testimony 5 says she was a passenger, but the article in Evidence 6 implies she was the driver. But how? Because the article says that according to Ini, Mimi was driving. But the physical evidence of which door she exited from (right door in a right-hand car) suggests she was driving. So Ini's claim that she was a passenger (Testimony 5) is contradicted by the fact that she exited through the driver's door (as per Evidence 6). Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 6 and Testimony 5. So the correct answer would be {"evidence": 6, "testimony": 5}.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 5}

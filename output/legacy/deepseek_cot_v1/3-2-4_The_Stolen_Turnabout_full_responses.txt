Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to go through each testimony and check the evidences to see if there's a conflict.

Looking at the testimonies, Testimony 0 to 5 are all from Atmey. Let me check each one against the evidence.

Testimony 0: Atmey says he received the request from Lordly Tailor 20 days ago. The relevant evidence might be the DeMasque's Calling Card (Evidence 5). The card mentions the "Treasures of Kurain" exhibit, so maybe there's a connection. But I don't see a direct contradiction here yet.

Testimony 1: Atmey states the urn was placed in a box and sent to the warehouse. The Sacred Urn (Evidence 4) was found in Atmey's office. Wait, if he sent it to the warehouse, how did it end up in his office? Also, the Urn Box (Evidence 21) has pink paint stains, which Adrian fixed two weeks ago. The box was moved again, maybe. But does this contradict? Maybe. If the urn was sent to the warehouse, but it's found in his office, that could be a contradiction. Let me note that.

Testimony 2: Atmey says he couldn't see the urn until the day of the crime. But according to Evidence 4, the urn was in his office. If he couldn't see it until the day of the crime, but it was in his office earlier, that's a contradiction. Wait, but Evidence 4 says the urn was found in Atmey's office. If he had the urn in his office before the crime, then his testimony about not seeing it until the day of the crime is a lie. That would be a contradiction. Let me check the timeline.

The Sacred Urn (Evidence 4) was broken and repaired by Adrian two weeks ago, then kept out of sight. It was moved again the night of the crime. Atmey's Testimony 2 says he couldn't see the urn until the day of the crime, but if the urn was in his office (as per Evidence 4), then he should have had access to it. So that's a contradiction between Testimony 2 and Evidence 4. 

Wait, but Testimony 1 says the urn was sent to the warehouse. So if Atmey sent it to the warehouse, then how did it end up in his office? Unless he's lying about sending it to the warehouse. But the Sacred Urn (Evidence 4) was found in Atmey's office, covered in pink splotches. The Urn Box (Evidence 21) has paint stains, which came from when Adrian dropped it two weeks ago. The box was in the warehouse, then moved. Wait, but the urn was broken and repaired by Adrian, then replaced in its box. So maybe after the repair, the urn was kept in the box, and the box was in the warehouse. But the urn itself ended up in Atmey's office. So Atmey's Testimony 1 says it was sent to the warehouse, but Evidence 4 shows it's in his office. That would contradict. But Testimony 2 says he didn't see it until the day of the crime. If the urn was in his office, he should have seen it before. Therefore, Testimony 2 and Evidence 4 contradict.

Wait, let me check the exact details. Evidence 4 states: "Found in the office of Luke Atmey. Has pink splotches all over it. Found in Atmey's Office. Covered in pink splotches, but it's the genuine article. Broken and repaired by Adrian 2 weeks ago, then replaced in its box. Kept out of sight." So after repair, it was put back in the box and kept out of sight. But then found in Atmey's office. So when was it moved to Atmey's office? If Atmey sent it to the warehouse (Testimony 1), but it's found in his office, that's a contradiction. But Testimony 1 is from Atmey, so if he claims to have sent it to the warehouse, but it's found in his office, that's a contradiction. But Evidence 4's location is Atmey's office. So perhaps Testimony 1 (sending to warehouse) and Evidence 4 (found in Atmey's office) contradict. Alternatively, Testimony 2 (couldn't see it until the day of the crime) and Evidence 4 (urn in his office) would mean he had access to it, so he could have seen it earlier. But maybe the urn was moved into his office on the day of the crime. Let me check the timeline again.

The Sacred Urn was moved into the basement warehouse the day of the crime, then moved again that night. Wait, no: Evidence 3 (Ami Fey's Golden Statue) says it was moved the night of the crime into the basement warehouse the day of the crime, moved again that night. Wait, that's confusing. But Evidence 4's urn was in Atmey's office. The Urn Box (Evidence 21) has paint stains from when Adrian dropped it two weeks ago. So the urn was repaired and kept out of sight, perhaps in the warehouse. Then, on the day of the crime, it was moved to Atmey's office. If Atmey in Testimony 1 says he sent it to the warehouse, but it's found in his office, that's a contradiction. However, Testimony 3: "I knew it was an extremely valuable treasure, so I sent my card 10 days beforehand." The calling card (Evidence 5) was sent 10 days before, which lines up with Testimony 3. But the key contradiction is Testimony 2: Atmey says he couldn't see the urn until the day of the crime. If the urn was in his office (Evidence 4), then he could have seen it before. Therefore, Testimony 2 and Evidence 4 contradict each other. So the answer would be Evidence 4 and Testimony 2.

====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies given by Luke Atmey. Let me start by reviewing the testimonies and the evidences to spot inconsistencies.

Looking at the testimonies, Atmey claims in Testimony 2 that Kane Bullard wrote the blackmail letter sent to Ron DeLite. The relevant evidence here would be Evidence 10, the Blackmail Letter, which states that it was written by Bullard. But wait, Evidence 10 says the letter was found in Ron's room and was written by Bullard. But how does that contradict Atmey's testimony? Wait, maybe there's another angle here. Let me check other evidences.

Wait, let's see Testimony 2 again: "It was Mr. Bullard who wrote the blackmail letter and sent it to Ron DeLite." The evidence for the blackmail letter (Evidence 10) does say it was written by Bullard, so that seems to support the testimony. Hmm. Then maybe another testimony and evidence pair?

Looking at Testimony 0: Atmey says he had no points of contact with the victim. But if there's evidence linking him to the victim, that would contradict. Let's check the evidences. Evidence 4 is the Sacred Urn found in Atmey's office. The urn was part of the exhibit, and Bullard was the CEO of KB Security. If the urn was in Atmey's office, maybe that connects him to the victim? But how? Also, Evidence 4 says the urn was found in Atmey's office. The victim was Kane Bullard, so if the urn was stolen, and Atmey had it, maybe that shows contact. But Testimony 0 is about contact with the victim, not the stolen items. Maybe not directly.

Testimony 1: Atmey claims that Kane Bullard mistook who Mask DeMasque was. But the blackmail letter (Evidence 10) was sent to Ron, so maybe Bullard knew Ron was DeMasque. But how does that contradict?

Wait, Evidence 16 is a newspaper clipping from Mask DeMasque's first heist, where the guard in the photo is Ron DeLite. If Ron was involved in the first heist as a guard, maybe Bullard found out and blackmailed him. That's possible. But how does that relate to Atmey's testimonies?

Testimony 4: Atmey says Ron truly believes he is Mask DeMasque. But Evidence 20 (Ron's Testimony) states that from the second heist on, Ron was stealing as directed by blackmail letters. So if Ron was being blackmailed, maybe he was forced to commit the heists, but Atmey claims he believes he is the real Mask DeMasque. That could be a contradiction. However, I need to check the exact wording.

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 2 again: Atmey says Bullard wrote the blackmail letter. Evidence 10 says the letter was found in Ron's room and written by Bullard. That matches. So maybe that's not a contradiction.

Wait, maybe Testimony 3: Atmey says Bullard harbored a grudge against Ron for his betrayal. But if Ron was being blackmailed by Bullard, maybe Bullard had some leverage. But how does evidence contradict that?

Let me think again. The key is to find a testimony that is directly contradicted by evidence. For example, if a testimony says X didn't happen, but evidence shows X did happen.

Looking at Testimony 0: Atmey says he had no contact with the victim. If there's evidence that Atmey and the victim had contact, that's a contradiction. Evidence 4 (Sacred Urn in Atmey's office). The urn was part of the exhibit, which was under the security of KB Security (Bullard's company). If the urn was found in Atmey's office, how did he get it? If the urn was stolen, and Atmey has it, that might indicate that he had some interaction with Bullard, perhaps through the theft. But the testimony is about contact with the victim (Bullard). Alternatively, if the urn was in Atmey's possession, and Bullard was involved in the exhibit's security, maybe there was contact. But perhaps the urn was stolen by Mask DeMasque and then placed in Atmey's office. Hmm.

Wait, Evidence 4 says the Sacred Urn was found in Atmey's office. Also, the urn's box (Evidence 21) has pink paint stains. The Paint Marks (Evidence 22) indicate that when Adrian dropped the urn's box two weeks ago, she knocked over some paint. So the box in Atmey's office would have the same pink stains, linking it to the urn. Therefore, Atmey had the Sacred Urn, which was part of the exhibit. But how does that connect him to the victim, Kane Bullard? If Bullard was the CEO of KB Security, which was handling the security, then the presence of the urn in Atmey's office suggests that Atmey might have obtained it through some means related to the theft. But Atmey's Testimony 0 says he had no contact with Bullard. However, if Bullard was involved in the exhibit's security, and the urn was stolen and ended up with Atmey, maybe there was some interaction. But the testimony is about "points of contact" with the victim. If Atmey had the urn, which was part of the exhibit secured by Bullard's company, that might imply some contact, but maybe not directly. Alternatively, perhaps Bullard was the one who wrote the blackmail letter (Evidence 10) to Ron, which Atmey claims. But the blackmail letter is linked to Bullard, so Atmey's Testimony 2 is supported by Evidence 10. So that's not a contradiction.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 0 says Atmey had no contact with the victim. Evidence 18 is Kane's List, found at the crime scene. If the list includes Atmey's name, that would be a contradiction. But the problem doesn't specify the contents of the list. Alternatively, Evidence 4's Sacred Urn in Atmey's office: if the urn was under Bullard's security, and Atmey had it, perhaps Bullard knew about it. If Atmey and Bullard had dealings over the urn, that would contradict Testimony 0. But without more info, this is speculative.

Alternatively, Testimony 5: Atmey claims that Ron killed Bullard because of the grudge. But the autopsy (Evidence 15) says Bullard died from blunt trauma to the head. The Shichishito (Evidence 6) was used by DeMasque to knock out Atmey during the crime. Wait, Evidence 6 says DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head. But the victim, Bullard, died from the same cause. So if Atmey was knocked out by DeMasque (Ron?), but the victim was killed by the same method, perhaps that suggests that the killer used the Shichishito. But how does that contradict Atmey's testimony?

Wait, let's look at Testimony 5: "That is why Mr. DeLite saw it fit to kill Kane Bullard. Truly a tragedy..." So Atmey is saying Ron killed Bullard. But if the Shichishito was used to knock out Atmey, and also used to kill Bullard, then the same weapon might have been used. But Ron (as DeMasque) was the one who used it on Atmey. However, if Ron was the killer, then the weapon used would be the same. But how does that contradict? Maybe the timeline. Let's check the time of death. Evidence 15 says time of death is 1 AM. Evidence 12 (Key Card) shows that Ron's key card was used at 1 AM. So Ron was at the scene. But if Atmey was knocked out by DeMasque (Ron) at the time of the crime, then how could Ron also be killing Bullard? Wait, maybe the timeline here. If the camera data (Evidence 7) shows the warehouse camera went off at around 1 AM. The key card was used at 1 AM. So Ron was in the CEO's office at 1 AM. The buzzer record (Evidence 19) went off at 1:02 AM. So Bullard died at 1 AM. If Ron was in the office at 1 AM, he could be the killer. But Atmey says Ron killed Bullard because of the blackmail. However, if the Shichishito was used to kill Bullard, and DeMasque (Ron) used it to knock out Atmey, then that could be consistent. But perhaps there's a contradiction in the evidence and testimony.

Wait, perhaps Testimony 2: Atmey says Bullard wrote the blackmail letter. Evidence 10 says the blackmail letter was written by Bullard. So that's consistent. So no contradiction there.

Wait, looking back at Testimony 0 again: "I, Luke Atmey, had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever." If the Sacred Urn (Evidence 4) was found in Atmey's office, and the urn is part of the exhibit that Bullard's company was securing, then Atmey having the urn implies that he might have had contact with Bullard. For example, if Bullard's company was responsible for the urn's security, and Atmey somehow obtained it, maybe Bullard was involved in that transaction. However, the urn was moved the night of the crime, carried into the basement warehouse, then moved again. It was found in Atmey's office. So maybe Atmey stole it from the warehouse, which was under Bullard's security. That would imply that Atmey had to bypass Bullard's security, but not necessarily that he had direct contact with Bullard. So this might not directly contradict Testimony 0.

Alternatively, Evidence 4 says the Sacred Urn was broken and repaired by Adrian two weeks ago. Then it was kept out of sight. But it was found in Atmey's office. So how did it get there? If Atmey stole it, that would mean he had to bypass security, but not necessarily have contact with Bullard.

Hmm. Another angle: Evidence 14 is DeMasque's Broach found near the statue. If Atmey was posing as DeMasque, but the broach is part of the costume, perhaps that links him. But how?

Wait, let's check the testimonies again. Testimony 1: Atmey says Bullard mistook who Mask DeMasque was. But Evidence 16 (newspaper clipping) shows that Ron was the guard during the first heist. If Bullard knew that Ron was involved, perhaps he blackmailed him. That would align with Atmey's Testimony 2. So no contradiction there.

Wait, Testimony 4: Atmey claims that Ron truly believes he is Mask DeMasque. But Evidence 20 (Ron's Testimony) says that from the second heist onward, Ron was stealing as directed by blackmail letters. This suggests that Ron was not acting of his own will but under blackmail. Therefore, Ron's actions were coerced, meaning he might not actually believe he is DeMasque. This could contradict Testimony 4. So if Ron was only stealing because he was blackmailed, then he doesn't truly believe he's DeMasque. Thus, Testimony 4 is contradicted by Evidence 20. That seems like a valid contradiction.

But how to present this. Testimony 4 says the defendant (Ron) truly believes he is Mask DeMasque. Evidence 20 says that Ron was stealing as directed by blackmail letters. Therefore, Ron was committing the thefts under duress, not because he believed he was DeMasque. So that would mean Atmey's Testimony 4 is false, contradicted by Ron's own testimony (Evidence 20).

Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 20 and Testimony 4. But in the problem statement, the user says "Which evidence and testimony contradict each other?" So the evidence is from the list, and the testimony is from the testimonies provided. So Evidence 20 is Ron's Testimony, which is part of the evidences. So the testimony is Testimony 4 (Atmey's testimony 4). Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 20 (Ron's Testimony) and Testimony 4 (Atmey's claim). So that's the pair.

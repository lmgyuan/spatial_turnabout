Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to pick one pair where the evidence contradicts the testimony.

Looking at the testimonies, there's Testimony 0 from Lotta Hart. She says, "I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!" So she's claiming she clearly saw Edgeworth on the boat.

Now, looking through the evidences. Evidence 2 is Lotta's Camera, which was set to take a picture automatically when a loud noise is detected, facing the lake. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM on 12/25 shows two people, but the fog is so dense their faces aren't visible. 

So Lotta's testimony claims she saw Edgeworth clearly, but the photo from her own camera shows that the fog was too thick to see faces. That's a contradiction. The camera's photo would not support her claim of seeing him clearly. Therefore, Evidence 4 contradicts Testimony 0. But wait, the camera is Evidence 2, but the photo is Evidence 4. However, the problem is between Lotta's testimony and the photo from her camera. The testimony says she saw clearly, but the photo shows fog obstructing the view. Therefore, the evidence that contradicts her testimony is the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) and her Testimony 0. 

So the pair would be evidence 4 and testimony 0. But need to check the numbers. Testimony 0 is Lotta's, and Evidence 4 is the Lake Photo. Yes, that's the contradiction. The photo shows faces can't be seen, but she says she saw clearly. So the answer is {"evidence": 4, "testimony": 0}.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 0}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all listed here, so I should go through them step by step.

First, looking at the testimonies from Lotta Hart. Testimony 3 says her camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower. The evidence related to her camera is Evidence 2, which is Lotta's Camera. The description says it's set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected, facing the lake. Wait, that's conflicting. If the camera was supposed to be for a meteor shower, then why is it set to trigger on loud noises? Meteor showers are visual, so you'd expect a timer or motion detection based on light, not sound. But the evidence says the camera was set to activate on loud noises, which is more for capturing events like gunshots. That contradicts her testimony about the purpose being a meteor shower. 

So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (camera for meteor shower) and Evidence 2 (camera set to loud noise activation). That's the pair. Let me double-check other possibilities. Testimony 4 mentions using binoculars when she heard a noise, and Evidence 11 is Lotta's deposition saying she heard two gunshots after midnight. The camera took a photo at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4), which matches the time of the shots. But the key contradiction is why the camera was taking photos if it's supposed to be for meteors but set to sound. That's the inconsistency. The other testimonies about mist and binoculars don't directly conflict with evidence. So the answer should be evidence 2 and testimony 3.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair. Let me start by reviewing the provided information.

First, the characters. The relevant ones here might be Lotta Hart since her testimonies are listed. She's the one who took the lake photos. The evidences include her camera and the photos. The testimonies are from Lotta as well.

Looking at the testimonies, Testimony 0 says she's not a research student, which she admits. Then Testimony 1 claims she's an investigative photographer. Her camera (Evidence 2) is set to take pictures automatically when a loud noise is detected. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) was taken on 12/25 at 12:15 AM, showing two people, one shooting. The Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) is from 12/24 at 11:50 PM, showing an empty lake. 

Lotta's Testimony 6 says she watched the boat the whole time after hearing the bang. But Evidence 16's photo at 11:50 PM shows an empty lake. Wait, but the shooting happened at 12:15 AM. However, if she was watching the boat the whole time after the first noise (which was at midnight?), maybe there's a contradiction here. Wait, the Lake Photo is taken at 12:15 AM, and the other one at 11:50 PM. But Lotta's deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard two gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. So midnight would be the transition from 24th to 25th. The Lake Photo is at 12:15 AM on the 25th. The Second Lake Photo is 11:50 PM on the 24th, which is 10 minutes before midnight. 

Testimony 6 says she watched the boat the whole time after hearing the bang. But if the camera took a photo at 11:50 PM showing an empty lake, and then another at 12:15 AM with the boat and the shooting, maybe there's a contradiction. Wait, but Lotta's camera is set to take pictures when a loud noise is detected. So the 12:15 AM photo was triggered by a loud noise (the gunshot), and the 11:50 PM one... why was that taken? There must have been a loud noise at 11:50 PM as well. But Lotta's deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight. So maybe the 12:15 AM is one of them. But the 11:50 PM photo (Evidence 16) shows an empty lake. If she was watching the boat the whole time after the first bang (which would be at 11:50 PM?), but the photo shows the lake empty. Then, if she claims she was watching the boat the whole time after the first noise, but the photo at 11:50 PM shows nothing, that could be a contradiction. Wait, but her testimony 5 says she heard the "bang" and looked straight out at the lake. Testimony 6 says she watched the boat the whole time after that. So the "bang" would be the first noise. But the first photo (Evidence 16) is at 11:50 PM, which is before midnight, and shows an empty lake. But according to Lotta's deposition (Evidence 11), the gunshots were just after midnight. So maybe the first photo (11:50 PM) was triggered by another noise, not a gunshot. But her testimony says she heard the bang (gunshot) after midnight, which is when the 12:15 AM photo was taken. So perhaps she claims she was watching the boat from after midnight onwards, but the 11:50 PM photo shows the lake empty, and the 12:15 AM photo shows the boat. But that might not directly contradict. Wait, maybe her testimony 6 says she watched the boat the whole time after hearing the first bang. But if the first bang was at 12:15 AM, then the photo shows the boat there. But there's another photo at 11:50 PM showing the lake empty. If she was there before midnight, and the camera took a photo at 11:50 PM (empty lake), but she says she started watching after the first bang (which was at midnight or later), then maybe there's no contradiction. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between her Testimony 6 (watched the boat the whole time) and the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) at 11:50 PM showing the lake empty. If she was already there and the camera took a photo at 11:50 PM, but she claims she was watching the boat the whole time after hearing the first bang (which was at midnight), then there's a time discrepancy. Wait, perhaps she wasn't there before midnight. But the problem is that the camera is set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected. So the 11:50 PM photo must have been triggered by a loud noise. If Lotta's deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard two gunshots just after midnight, then the 12:15 AM photo would correspond to one of those. The 11:50 PM noise might be unrelated, but the photo shows the lake empty. So if she was there and heard the first noise at 12:15 AM, then the 11:50 PM photo is before that. But she might not have been there yet. Alternatively, if she was there, and the camera took a photo at 11:50 PM (empty lake), but she claims that after the first bang (midnight), she watched the boat the whole time, then the 12:15 AM photo would be during that time. But the contradiction could be that if the boat wasn't there at 11:50 PM, but in her testimony, she says she saw the boat when the shooting happened. Wait, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) shows two people in a boat. But the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) at 11:50 PM shows an empty lake. So if the murder happened around 12:15 AM, then the boat must have been there then, but wasn't there 25 minutes prior. But Lotta's Testimony 6 says she watched the boat the whole time after the first bang. If the first bang was at 12:15 AM (triggering the camera), then she started watching then. But if the first bang was at 11:50 PM (when the empty lake photo was taken), then she would have been watching from then, but the boat wasn't there. But the Lake Photo at 12:15 AM shows the boat with two people. So how did the boat appear there without her noticing? That's a contradiction. Alternatively, perhaps the camera's two photos show that the boat wasn't present at 11:50 PM but was there at 12:15 AM. Lotta's testimony claims she watched the boat the whole time after the first bang. If the first bang was at 12:15 AM, then she started watching then, which matches the photo. But the 11:50 PM photo would be before that. However, if the first bang was the one at 11:50 PM, leading to the empty lake photo, and she claims she watched the boat from that point on, but then the boat appears at 12:15 AM without her noticing it arriving, that would be a contradiction. So perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 6 (watching the boat the whole time after the first bang) and Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo at 11:50 PM showing the lake empty). If she started watching after the first bang (which was at 11:50 PM), but the lake was empty, then the boat appearing later would mean she should have seen it arrive, but the photo shows it suddenly there. But maybe she didn't mention the boat arriving. Alternatively, maybe the camera's two photos show that the boat wasn't there at 11:50 PM but was there at 12:15 AM. If she claims she was watching the boat the whole time from when she heard the first bang (say, at 12:15 AM), then the boat was there. But if the first bang was at 11:50 PM (triggering the empty photo), and she started watching then, the boat wasn't there. Then at 12:15 AM, the boat is there in the photo. That would mean that between 11:50 PM and 12:15 AM, the boat arrived, but she didn't mention seeing it arrive. So her testimony that she watched the boat the whole time after the first bang (which was at 11:50 PM) would be contradicted by the Second Lake Photo (empty) and the Lake Photo (boat present), implying the boat arrived in that time, but she didn't report that. Therefore, the contradiction is between her Testimony 6 (watched the boat the whole time) and Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo showing empty lake at 11:50 PM). If she was watching from 11:50 PM onward, the boat should have been there, but it wasn't. Alternatively, if the first bang was at 12:15 AM, then the 11:50 PM photo is unrelated, and she started watching after midnight. But Lotta's deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard the shots just after midnight. So the first bang would be at 12:15 AM. Then the Second Lake Photo (11:50 PM) is before that, but that's okay. But how does that contradict her testimony? Maybe the contradiction is that Lotta's Testimony 6 says she watched the boat the whole time after the first bang, implying the boat was there. But the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) shows the lake empty at 11:50 PM. If the murder happened at 12:15 AM, then the boat must have been placed there between 11:50 PM and 12:15 AM. But if she was watching the boat the whole time after the first bang (which was at 12:15 AM), then the boat would already be there. So maybe there's no contradiction here. Wait, but the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) is at 12:15 AM, showing the boat with the two people. The Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) is at 11:50 PM, empty. If the boat wasn't there at 11:50 PM but was there at 12:15 AM, then Lotta's Testimony 6 (watched the boat the whole time after the first bang) would mean she started watching after the first bang (say, at 12:15 AM), which aligns with the boat being there. But if the first bang was at 12:15 AM, then the 11:50 PM photo is irrelevant. So where is the contradiction? Alternatively, maybe Lotta's Testimony 6 says she watched the boat the whole time after the first bang, implying the boat was there continuously. But the Second Lake Photo shows it wasn't there at 11:50 PM, so how did it get there by 12:15 AM without her seeing? Wait, but if the first bang was at 12:15 AM, then the 11:50 PM photo was taken earlier, and she wasn't watching then. She started watching after the first bang at 12:15 AM. So the boat could have arrived between 11:50 PM and 12:15 AM, and she didn't see that. But she's only claiming to have watched it after the first bang. So maybe there's no contradiction here. Hmm. Let me think of another angle. The testimony that's contradictory. Maybe Testimony 7 says she saw a flash and heard another gunshot. But the camera's Lake Photo (Evidence 4) shows the gunshot at 12:15 AM. The camera is supposed to take a photo when a loud noise is detected. So when the gunshot happened (the one in the photo), the camera took the photo. But Lotta's deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard two gunshots just after midnight. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) is one, and maybe another one. But the camera only took two photos: one at 11:50 PM (Evidence 16) and one at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4). So if there were two gunshots after midnight, the camera should have taken two photos. But there's only one photo after midnight (Evidence 4). So maybe that's a contradiction. But according to the evidence list, there are two photos: 16 (11:50 PM) and 4 (12:15 AM). So if Lotta heard two gunshots after midnight (Evidence 11), the camera should have taken two photos, but only one was taken. That could be a contradiction. However, maybe the first gunshot was at 11:50 PM (triggering Evidence 16), but that's before midnight. Then the two after midnight would be at 12:15 AM and another time. But the camera only captured one. So maybe the contradiction is between Lotta's deposition (Evidence 11) saying two gunshots after midnight, but the camera only captured one (Evidence 4). But Evidence 11 is a deposition, not testimony. Wait, the user is asking for a testimony (from Testimony 0-7) and evidence. So perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 7, where Lotta says she saw a flash and heard another gunshot, implying two gunshots. But the camera (Evidence 2) is set to take a photo on loud noises. So two gunshots should result in two photos. However, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) is one, and the other is Evidence 16 at 11:50 PM, which is before midnight. So if the two gunshots she heard were after midnight, there should be two photos after midnight, but there's only one. So that would contradict. But the user wants a pair of evidence and testimony. So which testimony states that she heard two shots? Her deposition (Evidence 11) says that, but that's an evidence, not a testimony. The testimonies are numbered 0-7. Testimony 7 says she saw a flash and heard another gunshot. So if the camera only captured one photo (Evidence 4) after midnight, but she says she heard another gunshot, then that would mean the camera should have taken another photo. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 7 (hearing another gunshot) and the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) being the only one after midnight. But the camera is supposed to take a photo every time there's a loud noise. So if there was another gunshot, there should be another photo. But there isn't. So the evidence would be Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) which is set to take photos automatically when a loud noise is detected. But there's only one photo after midnight. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 7 (another gunshot) and the camera's evidence (only one photo). But the camera's description (Evidence 2) says it takes a photo when a loud noise is detected. So if there were two loud noises (gunshots), there should be two photos. But in the evidence list, only the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) is after midnight. Therefore, the camera's function (Evidence 2) combined with the existence of only one photo (Evidence 4) contradicts Testimony 7 (another gunshot). But the user wants one evidence and one testimony. So Evidence 2 (the camera) and Testimony 7 (hearing another gunshot). But Evidence 2's description states it takes a photo when a loud noise is detected. So if there was another gunshot, why wasn't there another photo? That's the contradiction. Therefore, the answer is Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) and Testimony 7 (another gunshot). But wait, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) is the only one after midnight. The other photo is Evidence 16 (11:50 PM). So if two gunshots occurred after midnight, the camera should have two photos. But there's only one. Thus, the contradiction is that Lotta's Testimony 7 claims there was another gunshot (two in total after midnight), but the camera (Evidence 2) only captured one photo. So the pair would be Evidence 2 (the camera's capability) and Testimony 7 (hearing another gunshot). But the camera's capability is not the evidence that directly shows the number of photos. The actual evidence showing the photos are Evidence 4 and 16. Wait, but the user needs to pick a specific evidence. So maybe the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) and the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) show two different times. But how does that tie into the testimony. Alternatively, Testimony 7 says she heard another gunshot. If the camera should have taken a photo, but there's no corresponding photo for the second gunshot. So the only photo after midnight is Evidence 4. Therefore, the lack of a second photo (which would be missing) isn't listed as evidence, but the camera's function (Evidence 2) requires it. So maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 7 and Evidence 2. But the camera's existence alone doesn't show the absence of a photo. Alternatively, perhaps the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) is the only one after midnight, but Testimony 7 says there was another gunshot. Therefore, the camera should have taken another photo, but there isn't one. Thus, the contradiction is between Testimony 7 and the lack of a second photo. But the user has to choose from the given evidences. The available evidences are 0-21. The camera (Evidence 2) is the one that's supposed to take photos on noise. The two photos are Evidence 4 and 16. So if Lotta's Testimony 7 says she heard another gunshot, but the camera only has two photos (one before midnight and one after), then the camera should have taken a third photo if there was a second gunshot after midnight. But that's not the case. Wait, let me check the times again. Evidence 16: 12/24 at 11:50 PM. Evidence 4: 12/25 at 12:15 AM. So the camera took two photos: one before midnight, one after. Lotta's deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. So two after midnight. But the camera only captured one (Evidence 4). So that's a contradiction. But which testimony aligns with that? Testimony 7 is about hearing another gunshot. So if the camera's set to take a photo per loud noise, then two noises after midnight should result in two photos. But there's only one. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 7 (another gunshot) and the camera's photos (only one after midnight). The evidence here would be Evidence 4 (the Lake Photo at 12:15 AM) and Evidence 16 (the empty lake at 11:50 PM). But the user wants one evidence and one testimony. Alternatively, the testimony that says she heard two gunshots is in her deposition (Evidence 11), but that's not a testimony in the testimonies list. The testimonies are 0-7. Testimony 7 is about another gunshot. So if she heard another gunshot (as per Testimony 7), but the camera only captured one, then Evidence 2 (the camera's function) would require that the camera took a photo, which it didn't. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 7 and Evidence 2. Alternatively, maybe the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) shows the moment of the gunshot, but Testimony 7 says there was another one. So the camera should have another photo. Since there isn't, that's a contradiction. But the evidence would be the camera's capability (Evidence 2), not the photo. Hmm. This is tricky. Another angle: Testimony 6 says she watched the boat the whole time after the first bang. But Evidence 16 (11:50 PM) shows the lake empty, implying the boat wasn't there. If she was watching from the first bang (which was at 11:50 PM), then she should have seen the boat arrive, but the Lake Photo (12:15 AM) shows it there. So the contradiction is between her Testimony 6 (watched the boat the whole time) and Evidence 16 (empty lake at 11:50 PM). Because if she was watching from 11:50 PM, the boat wasn't there, but then it appeared, which she should have noticed. So the pair would be Evidence 16 and Testimony 6. That makes sense. Because she claims to have watched the boat the whole time after the first bang (which if the first bang was at 11:50 PM, leading to Evidence 16), but the boat wasn't there then. Then at 12:15 AM, the boat is there. So she should have seen it arrive, but her testimony doesn't mention that. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 16 (empty lake at 11:50 PM) and Testimony 6 (watching the boat the whole time after the first bang). If the first bang was at 11:50 PM, then she should have seen the boat arrive between 11:50 PM and 12:15 AM, but she didn't report that. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo) and Testimony 6. So the answer would be {"evidence": 16, "testimony": 6}.

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 6}

Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair. Let me go through the testimonies and the evidence step by step.

First, look at the testimonies. Testimony 0 to 5 are all from Gumshoe. Testimony 5 says that before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name. Then, Testimony 2 mentions that the word "Maya" was written in blood on a memo found next to the victim. Testimony 3 confirms the blood was the victim's. So according to Gumshoe, Mia wrote Maya's name as the killer with her own blood before dying.

Now looking at the evidence. Evidence 3 is a receipt with letters written in blood on the back. The receipt is for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder. Also, Evidence 2 is glass shards from a broken glass light stand. The receipt's blood writing and the broken glass might be connected. 

Wait, if the receipt has blood writing, but the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says Mia died instantly from blunt force trauma. But the autopsy report also mentions that she might have lived a few minutes after being hit. But if she wrote the name in blood, she would need to be alive long enough to do that. But if the cause was a single blow leading to instantaneous death, maybe she couldn't have written the name. Hmm. But there's a contradiction here. If the autopsy says death was instantaneous, then Mia couldn't have written the name after being struck. But the receipt's blood writing (Evidence 3) is from the victim's blood (as per Testimony 3), so maybe the blood on the receipt is the victim's. But the receipt's purchase date is the day before, which might be unrelated. Wait, but the memo that Gumshoe found (Testimony 1 and 2) is a separate piece of paper, not the receipt. So the memo with "Maya" is different from the receipt. But Evidence 3's receipt has blood on it, but according to the testimonies, the memo with "Maya" was written in blood. Wait, the receipt is Evidence 3, and the memo is Evidence 4 (Maya's Memo) or maybe not. Wait, Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo, which is a conversation recorded on her cell phone. The memo found by Gumshoe (Testimony 1) is a piece of paper with "Maya" written in blood. But looking at the evidence list, the receipt (Evidence 3) has blood writing, while the memo mentioned in Testimony 1 is a different piece of paper. So maybe the receipt's blood writing contradicts something else. 

Alternatively, the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says death was instantaneous, but if the victim wrote the name in blood, she must have been alive after the attack. So Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name before dying) contradicts Evidence 5's autopsy report which states death was instantaneous. Wait, but the user is asking for a contradiction between evidence and testimony. So the testimony from Gumshoe (Testimony 5) claims the victim wrote the killer's name, but the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says death was instantaneous. Therefore, she couldn't have written anything after being hit. That would be a contradiction. However, the autopsy report in Evidence 5 also says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." So maybe there's a discrepancy within the autopsy report itself. But the testimony says the victim wrote the name before dying, which could be possible if she lived a few minutes. Hmm, maybe not the best contradiction.

Wait another angle: the receipt (Evidence 3) is a department store receipt with blood on the back. The receipt's purchase date is the day before the murder. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a glass light stand, which matches the receipt. So the receipt is for the glass stand. But Testimony 2 says that the word "Maya" was written on a memo in blood. But if the receipt's blood writing is unrelated, maybe the memo mentioned in Testimony 1 is not the receipt. But according to the evidence list, the receipt (Evidence 3) has blood on it, and the memo (Testimony 1) is separate. Wait, the memo that Gumshoe found is written on a piece of paper next to the body. So Evidence 3 is the receipt, which might not be the same as the memo. The memo mentioned in Testimony 1 and 2 is different. But there's no evidence listed that corresponds to that memo except maybe the receipt? Wait, looking at Evidence 0 to 14, the evidence items are:

Evidence 0: Attorney's Badge
1: The Thinker
2: Glass Shards
3: Receipt (blood writing)
4: Maya's Memo (cell phone convo)
5: Autopsy Report
6: Maya's Cell Phone
7: Wiretap
8: Floor Plans
9: May Testimony
10: Photograph A
11: Photograph B
12: Bellboy's Affidavit
13: Newspaper Clipping
14: Mia's Memo (list of names)

So the memo Gumshoe found (Testimony 1) isn't listed as an evidence. Wait, Testimony 1 says "I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!" and Testimony 2 says it has "Maya" in blood. The evidence list includes Evidence 3 (receipt with blood) and Evidence 14 (Mia's memo, a list of names). Maybe the memo Gumshoe found is actually the receipt (Evidence 3), but the receipt's description says the blood is on the back. But the receipt is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. So if the receipt was used to write "Maya" in blood, then the date on the receipt is the day before, which is before the murder. But Mia was killed on 9/5. So the receipt's purchase date is 9/4. If the receipt was present at the crime scene, and Mia wrote "Maya" on it with her blood on 9/5, then the purchase date being the day before is okay. But then, the contradiction would be if the receipt was already there before the murder, but the blood on it is the victim's. Wait, but the receipt's purchase date is the day before, so the receipt was from a purchase made before the murder, but the blood was added during the murder. That's possible.

Alternatively, the contradiction could be between the Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) and Testimony 5. The autopsy report says the cause was a single blunt force trauma with instantaneous death, but also that she may have lived a few minutes. So Testimony 5 says she wrote the name before dying. If death was instantaneous, she couldn't write. But the autopsy report has conflicting info. But maybe the key point is that the initial cause says death was instantaneous, but the details mention she may have lived a few minutes. So Testimony 5 could be possible. Not sure.

Another angle: The receipt (Evidence 3) has blood writing, which is supposed to be the victim's. But the receipt's purchase date is the day before. If Mia wrote on the receipt with her blood during the murder, then the receipt must have been at the scene. But maybe the receipt was already there, and the blood was from the victim. But perhaps the contradiction is that the receipt was purchased the day before, so how did Mia get it to write on it during the murder? Not sure.

Wait, the glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a glass light stand, which was purchased the day before (as per Evidence 3's receipt). The glass light stand was broken, which could be part of the crime. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 4: blood found on the victim's finger. If the victim wrote the name, then her finger would have blood. But the autopsy says death was instantaneous, so maybe she couldn't have moved to write. But again, the autopsy also mentions she may have lived a few minutes. Hmm.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (word "Maya" written in blood on the memo) and Evidence 3 (receipt with blood writing). If the memo is the receipt, then the receipt's back has the blood writing, but the receipt is for a purchase made the day before. If "Maya" was written on the receipt during the murder, then the receipt must have been present. But perhaps the receipt was already in the office, and Mia used it to write the name. But where is the contradiction here?

Alternatively, the receipt's blood writing is not "Maya". Wait, Testimony 2 says the memo has "Maya" written in blood. If Evidence 3 is the receipt, which has blood writing, but the content isn't specified as "Maya", maybe the receipt's blood writing is something else, which contradicts the testimony. But according to the evidence list, Evidence 3's description says "letters written in blood on the back". Testimony 2 says the word "Maya" was written. If the receipt's letters are not "Maya", then there's a contradiction. However, the evidence descriptions don't specify what the letters are. But Testimony 2 claims the word "Maya" was on the memo (which could be the receipt). So if the receipt (Evidence 3) is the memo, then the testimony says it has "Maya", but the receipt's description doesn't mention "Maya", only that it has letters. But maybe the receipt's letters are different. But we don't have that information. Alternatively, the receipt's date is the day before the murder, so if the receipt was used to write "Maya" during the murder, that's possible, but maybe there's another contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand, which was broken into shards (Evidence 2). If the glass stand was broken during the murder, then the receipt's purchase date being the day before makes sense. But how does that relate to the testimony?

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between the autopsy report (Evidence 5) and Testimony 5. The autopsy says death was instantaneous, so Mia couldn't have written anything. But Testimony 5 says she wrote the name before dying. However, the autopsy also says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." So there's conflicting info in the autopsy itself. But maybe the initial part (instantaneous) is the main cause, and the detail (few minutes) is a mistake. But I'm not sure. If the testimony says she wrote the name, but the autopsy says she died instantly, that's a contradiction. So Evidence 5 (autopsy report) and Testimony 5. But let's check the exact wording:

Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report): "Time of death: 9/5 at 9:00PM. Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous. Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit."

Wait, the first line says "Death was instantaneous", but the second line says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." That's contradictory within the evidence itself. So perhaps this is a mistake, but in the context of the question, the contradiction between testimony and evidence would be Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name before dying) and Evidence 5's first part (death was instantaneous). Because if death was instantaneous, she couldn't have written anything. However, the second part of the autopsy says she may have lived a few minutes. So the autopsy is conflicting. But maybe the testimony contradicts the first part of the autopsy. However, the user is looking for an evidence and testimony that contradict. So Testimony 5 states that the victim wrote the name, but the autopsy says death was instantaneous. But the autopsy also says she may have lived a few minutes, which allows for writing. So maybe that's not the contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps I should look elsewhere. Let's consider the Thinker (Evidence 1), the murder weapon. The gears were removed. Maybe that relates to a testimony. The testimony from April May (Testimony 9) says the victim dodged an attack and ran to the right but was caught and struck. If the weapon is a statue clock with gears removed, maybe the gears being missing affects the time of the crime or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at the wiretap (Evidence 7) found in April May's hotel room. If there's a wiretap, maybe her testimony is unreliable because she could have been listening in. But how does that contradict her testimony?

Wait, the key contradiction is likely between the receipt (Evidence 3) and Testimony 2. Because the receipt is for the glass light stand purchased the day before, and the glass shards (Evidence 2) are from that stand. But Testimony 2 says the memo (which could be the receipt) has "Maya" written in blood. However, if the receipt was purchased the day before, and the blood was from the victim (Testimony 3), then how did the receipt get to the crime scene? Unless the receipt was already there. But maybe the receipt was in the office, and the killer used it to frame Maya. But I'm not sure how that contradicts.

Alternatively, the receipt's date is the day before the murder. If the receipt was used to write "Maya" in blood during the murder, then the date is irrelevant. But if the receipt was in the office before the murder, then it's possible. Maybe the contradiction is that the receipt's purchase date is the day before, but the memo was written on the day of the murder. However, that's not necessarily a contradiction.

Wait, maybe the memo found by Gumshoe (Testimony 1) is actually Mia's memo (Evidence 14), which is a list of names. But Testimony 2 says the memo has "Maya" written in blood. Evidence 14 is Mia's memo, a list of names. So if Mia's memo is a list of names, but the memo found at the scene says "Maya", that's a contradiction. But according to the evidence list, Evidence 14 is "a list of people's names in Mia's handwriting." So if Testimony 2 says the memo says "Maya", but Evidence 14 is a list of names, maybe "Maya" is one of them. But that's not necessarily a contradiction. Unless the list doesn't include Maya. But we don't know the contents of the list.

Alternatively, the memo found by Gumshoe (Testimony 1) is not in the evidence list. The evidence list includes Maya's Memo (Evidence 4), which is a conversation on her cell phone. So the memo with "Maya" written in blood isn't listed as evidence. Unless the receipt (Evidence 3) is that memo. If the receipt has blood writing, but the receipt's main purpose is for the glass stand, then maybe the blood writing is unrelated. But Testimony 2 says the memo has "Maya" written in blood. If the receipt is the memo, then the receipt's blood should have "Maya". But if the receipt's blood has different letters, that's a contradiction. However, the evidence description for Evidence 3 doesn't specify what's written, only that there are letters. So maybe the contradiction is that Testimony 2 claims "Maya" was written, but the receipt's letters are something else. But since the evidence doesn't specify, we can't be sure.

Alternatively, the glass shards (Evidence 2) and Testimony 9 (May Testimony) which says the victim dodged an attack and ran to the right. Maybe the glass shards indicate a different scenario. For example, the glass was broken during a struggle, which contradicts the testimony. But not sure.

Wait, the key contradiction is probably between the Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) and Testimony 5. Testimony 5 states that the victim wrote the killer's name before dying. The Autopsy Report says "Death was instantaneous. Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." So there's a contradiction within the autopsy report itself. But in terms of evidence vs testimony, Testimony 5 claims she wrote the name, but the autopsy report's initial statement says death was instantaneous. If death was instantaneous, she couldn't have written anything. But the autopsy also says she may have lived a few minutes, which would allow her to write. So this is conflicting. However, the user asks for a contradiction between evidence and testimony, not within evidence. So perhaps the main contradiction is between Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name) and the first part of Evidence 5 (death was instantaneous). Because if she died instantly, she couldn't write. But the second part of the autopsy allows for her surviving a few minutes. So this is tricky. Maybe the intended answer is Evidence 3 (receipt) and Testimony 2 (Maya written in blood). If the receipt's back has blood writing, but the receipt was purchased the day before, then how did the blood get on it? If the receipt was already in the office and the victim wrote on it during the murder, that's possible. But maybe the receipt's date being the day before and the murder happening the next day is not a contradiction. Alternatively, the receipt's blood writing is not possible because the victim died instantly. But that loops back to the autopsy report.

Alternatively, the memo with "Maya" written in blood (Testimony 2) is supposed to be written by the victim, but if the victim died instantly, she couldn't write. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (she wrote the name) and Evidence 5 (instant death). But Testimony 5 is Gumshoe's testimony, not the specific testimony about the memo. Testimony 5 is Gumshoe's conclusion that the victim wrote the name. So if the autopsy says death was instantaneous, that contradicts Testimony 5. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 5 and Testimony 5. But the problem is that the autopsy report has conflicting information. However, the first line says death was instantaneous, which directly contradicts Testimony 5. The second line might be a mistake, but perhaps the correct contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 5. But how to handle the conflicting parts in the evidence?

Alternatively, maybe the correct contradiction is between the receipt (Evidence 3) and Testimony 2. Because the receipt has blood writing, but the receipt is for a glass stand purchased the day before. If the receipt was in the office, and the victim wrote on it with her blood, then the date is okay. But maybe the receipt's purchase was by someone else, and the blood is the victim's, but the receipt shouldn't be there. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) and Testimony 9 (May's testimony about the victim dodging and running). If the glass was broken during the attack, but May's testimony doesn't mention breaking glass, maybe that's a contradiction. But not sure.

Wait, Testimony 9 is from April May, not the May testimony. Wait, looking back: Testimonies are from Gumshoe (0-5), then Testimony 9 is "May Testimony" which is April May's testimony. Her testimony says the victim dodged an attack and ran to the right but was caught and struck. How does that contradict any evidence? The Floor Plans (Evidence 8) might show the layout. If the victim ran to the right, but the floor plans show that direction leads to a dead end, then that contradicts. But we don't have details on the floor plans.

Alternatively, the Wiretap (Evidence 7) found in April May's hotel room suggests she was spying, so her testimony (Testimony 9) might be false. But that's a contradiction between evidence and testimony reliability, not directly between the testimony and evidence.

After considering all possibilities, the most likely contradiction is between the Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) stating death was instantaneous and Testimony 5 claiming the victim wrote the killer's name before dying. If death was instantaneous, writing would be impossible. Even though the autopsy also mentions she may have lived a few minutes, the main cause states instantaneous death. So the contradiction is Evidence 5 and Testimony 5. Therefore, the answer should be {"evidence": 5, "testimony": 5}.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Let me go through them step by step.

First, looking at the testimonies. All the testimonies here are from April May (Character 4). Her testimonies are Testimony 0 to 4. Let me check what each says.

Testimony 1: The victim (Mia) dodged the first attack and ran to the right. Then the girl in hippie clothes (Maya) chased her and hit her with the weapon. The weapon mentioned in Testimony 4 is "The Thinker," a statue-like clock, which is Evidence 1. 

Now, looking at the evidence. The key ones here would be related to the murder weapon and the timeline. Let me check the autopsy report (Evidence 5). It states that Mia died from a single blunt force trauma, and death was instantaneous. However, another part says she may have lived a few minutes after being hit. Wait, that's a bit conflicting, but maybe that's a red herring.

The Thinker (Evidence 1) is described as a clock made by Larry Butz, and the clock's gears have been removed. The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder. The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are broken remains of a glass light stand.

April's testimony says the murder weapon was The Thinker. But if the glass shards are from a light stand purchased the day before (Evidence 3), perhaps the actual murder weapon was the glass light stand, not The Thinker. But how does that contradict?

Wait, the autopsy report says blunt force trauma. A glass light stand might break upon impact, leaving shards (Evidence 2). If the murder weapon was The Thinker (a heavy statue), that would cause blunt force. But if the receipt shows the glass stand was bought, and the shards are present, maybe the real weapon was the glass stand, but April testifies it was The Thinker. That could be a contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 1 where April says Mia dodged the first attack and ran to the right. But the floor plans (Evidence 8) might show the layout. If the floor plan shows that running to the right wasn't possible, that would contradict. But I don't have details on the floor plan's content. Another angle: The Thinker's gears were removed. If the clock wasn't functional, maybe that's relevant. But how does that tie into the testimony?

Wait, the receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken glass light stand. If the murder weapon was the glass stand, but April says it was The Thinker statue, then that's a contradiction between her testimony (Testimony 4) and Evidence 2 and 3. However, which specific testimony contradicts which evidence.

Testimony 4 from April says the weapon was The Thinker. But if the real weapon was the glass stand (based on receipt and shards), then her testimony is contradicted by Evidence 2 and 3. But the problem asks for one pair: evidence and testimony. So Evidence 3 (Receipt) shows purchase of glass stand, which was broken (Evidence 2). If the murder was committed with the glass stand, then Testimony 4 (saying it was The Thinker) is contradicted. Alternatively, the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says cause was blunt force. The Thinker is a blunt object. Glass stand might be sharp when broken. Hmm. But the autopsy says blunt force. So The Thinker would fit that. But the glass shards being from the stand might indicate that the stand was used. Wait, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Looking at the Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) states that death was instantaneous from a single blow. But April's Testimony 1 says the victim dodged the first attack, ran to the right, then was caught and struck. If the autopsy says death was instantaneous, then Mia couldn't have run after being hit. But the autopsy also has a conflicting line: "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe that's a mistranslation or a typo. If the first part says death was instantaneous, but the second part says may have lived a few minutes, that's a contradiction. But how does that relate to a testimony?

Alternatively, the receipt (Evidence 3) has a date of purchase the day before the murder. If the glass stand was bought the day before, and broken during the murder, that suggests it was present at the scene. But April testifies the murder weapon was The Thinker. If the real weapon was the glass stand, then her testimony is wrong. So Evidence 3 (receipt) and Testimony 4 (The Thinker as weapon) contradict. Or Evidence 2 (glass shards) and Testimony 4.

Wait, the receipt (Evidence 3) is for the glass light stand, purchased the day before. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a glass light stand. So the stand was broken, possibly used as a weapon. But April says the weapon was The Thinker. So the contradiction would be between April's Testimony 4 (weapon is The Thinker) and Evidence 2 (glass shards from a different weapon) and Evidence 3 (purchased the day before). So the evidence that the murder weapon was the glass stand (as per Evidence 2 and 3) contradicts April's testimony that it was The Thinker (Evidence 1). Therefore, the testimony that the weapon was The Thinker (Testimony 4) is contradicted by the evidence of the glass shards (Evidence 2) and receipt (Evidence 3) showing the purchase. But we need to pick one pair. So Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 4 (mentioning The Thinker as the weapon) would be the contradiction. Alternatively, Evidence 1 (The Thinker) itself: since the gears were removed, maybe it was not functional, but that's not directly conflicting. Alternatively, the autopsy report. Wait, the autopsy says the cause was blunt force, which The Thinker would do, but if the glass stand was used, perhaps it's a different kind of injury. But the autopsy still says blunt. So maybe that's not the contradiction. 

Another angle: Testimony 1 says Mia dodged the first attack and ran to the right. The floor plans (Evidence 8) might show that there's no path to the right, but since I don't have details on the floor plan, I can't use that. Alternatively, the memo (Evidence 4) or cell phone (Evidence 6) might have a conversation that contradicts the timeline. But I don't have the details. 

Wait, the wiretap (Evidence 7) found in April's hotel room suggests that maybe her testimony is unreliable because she could have been eavesdropping or something. But that's not a direct contradiction. 

Alternatively, the autopsy report says time of death at 9:00 PM. If there's a testimony or evidence that places someone elsewhere at that time, but that's not in the given data. 

Wait, another thought: The Thinker is described as a clock with gears removed. If the gears were removed, maybe it's lighter, but still a heavy statue. However, the receipt (Evidence 3) shows that the glass stand was bought the day before, which was broken (Evidence 2), implying it was used as a weapon. So April's testimony that the weapon was The Thinker is contradicted by the presence of the glass shards and the receipt. Therefore, the contradiction would be between Testimony 4 (states weapon is The Thinker) and Evidence 2 (Glass Shards from a glass stand) or Evidence 3 (receipt for glass stand). The problem asks for one pair. So perhaps Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) contradicts Testimony 3 (which is Testimony 3: And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!) or Testimony 4. Since Testimony 4 specifically mentions The Thinker, and the evidence shows the glass stand was broken, the contradiction is Testimony 4 vs Evidence 2 and 3. But which one to choose? The user wants one pair. Let's see: Testimony 4 says the weapon was The Thinker. Evidence 2 is the Glass Shards from a glass stand. So if the actual weapon was the stand, then Testimony 4 is false. Thus, Evidence 2 contradicts Testimony 4. So the answer would be {"evidence": 2, "testimony": 4}. 

Wait, but Testimony 4 is "That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? 'The Thinker,' I think?" which directly names The Thinker as the weapon. Evidence 2 is the Glass Shards from the stand. If the murder weapon was the stand, then April's Testimony 4 is incorrect. Therefore, Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) contradicts Testimony 4.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 4}

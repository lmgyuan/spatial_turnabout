Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all given. Let me start by reviewing the details.

First, the evidence. Let me list out the ones that might be relevant. Evidence 15 is the Max G. Bust, a bronze statue that was taken from the cafeteria before the crime. It's heavy. The autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head, so maybe the bust was the murder weapon.

Now, looking at the testimonies from Acro. Testimonies 0 to 5. He claims he could have lifted the bust (Testimony 0) because he has a strong upper body (Testimony 1). But he says lifting the bust and looking out the window was impossible (Testimony 2), and he couldn't exert force on his lower body (Testimony 3). He also states he couldn't know where the Ringmaster's head was (Testimony 4), making it impossible to drop the bust on him (Testimony 5).

Wait, the contradiction here might be between his ability to lift the bust and the method of the murder. The bust was heavy, and he's an acrobat with upper body strength. The Ringmaster was killed by a blow to the back of the head. If Acro couldn't have known the position of the head, how could he aim the bust? But maybe there's a piece of evidence that shows he could have known the head's position.

Looking at Evidence 12, the Wooden Box the victim was hunched over. The victim was found lying on the box. The Crime Photo (Evidence 2) shows the victim's footprints leading to the spot. If the victim was bending over the box, his head would be in a specific position. Also, Evidence 16 is a note that lured the Ringmaster to the plaza, which might indicate premeditation. The note mentions the incident six months ago (related to Leon the lion and Bat's injury). Acro's brother Bat was bitten by Leon, so Acro has a motive.

But where's the contradiction? Let's think about Testimony 4: Acro says he couldn't have known where the Ringmaster's head was. But if the Ringmaster was hunched over the wooden box (Evidence 12), his head would be in a fixed position. The bust was dropped from above, maybe through a window. The Circus Map (Evidence 6) shows Acro's room on the third floor. If he dropped the bust from his window, he could see the plaza where the victim was bent over the box. So even if he couldn't move his lower body, he could lift the bust (as he admitted) and drop it from the window. That would contradict his Testimony 2, where he says lifting the bust and looking out the window was impossible. Wait, Testimony 2 says that lifting and looking out the window at the same time was impossible. But if he was on the third floor, maybe he didn't need to look out while lifting. Alternatively, perhaps the position of the box and the victim's posture meant that the head's location was predictable, contradicting Testimony 4.

Another angle: Evidence 19 is Bat's scarf with pepper. The seasoning bottle (Evidence 13) had pepper. If the pepper was used to cause a reaction (like a sneeze) to make the lion attack, but that's from six months ago. The current murder's use of pepper might relate to the seasoning bottle. But how does that tie to Acro's testimony?

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 4 (Acro couldn't know the head's location) and Evidence 12 (the wooden box the victim was hunched over). If the victim was bent over the box, his head's position would be right there. If Acro knew the victim would be there (from the note, Evidence 16), he could aim the bust at the box's location. Therefore, Testimony 4 is contradicted by the existence of the wooden box, which fixes the head's position. But Evidence 12 is the wooden box. So the contradiction is between Evidence 12 and Testimony 4.

Alternatively, the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) shows the victim's footprints leading to the spot. So the victim walked there and then was hunched over the box. If Acro knew the meeting was at the plaza (from the note he might have written), he could anticipate where the Ringmaster would be. So the note (Evidence 16) lured the Ringmaster to the plaza, where the box was. Therefore, Acro could have planned to drop the bust knowing where the Ringmaster would be, making his Testimony 4 about not knowing the head's location a lie.

So the contradiction would be between Evidence 16 (the note that set the meeting place) and Testimony 4 (Acro saying he couldn't know the head's location). But Evidence 16 is the note that told the Ringmaster to meet at the lodging house plaza at 10 PM. If Acro wrote the note, he would know the location. So if Acro is the murderer, he set the meeting place, thus knowing where the victim's head would be. Hence, Testimony 4 is contradicted by Evidence 16.

But wait, the note was torn and found in the Ringmaster's pocket. The note says "To The Murderer!" but the content is from the perspective of someone threatening the murderer. Wait, the note's content is written as if someone else has evidence about the past incident. So maybe Acro wrote it to lure the Ringmaster to the plaza. If Acro wrote the note, he would know the Ringmaster would be there, so he could plan to drop the bust. Thus, his Testimony 4 ("impossible for me to have known the location of the Ringmaster's head") is contradicted by the note (Evidence 16), which he might have authored, thereby knowing exactly where the Ringmaster would be.

So the pair would be Evidence 16 and Testimony 4.

Alternatively, let's look back. The wooden box (Evidence 12) was where the victim was hunched over. The autopsy says he was hit on the back of the head. So the position of the head was over the box. If Acro was on the third floor (per the Circus Map, Evidence 6), he could see the plaza below. If he dropped the bust from his window, he could aim it at the box's location. So even if he didn't know exactly where the head was, the bust would hit the area around the box, which the victim was bent over. So Testimony 4 says he couldn't have known, but the box's presence and location might mean that the head's position was predictable. Therefore, Evidence 12 contradicts Testimony 4.

But which pair is more direct? The note (Evidence 16) was the method to get the Ringmaster to the plaza at the specific time, so Acro (if he wrote it) would know where the victim would be. Therefore, the note contradicts Testimony 4.

Alternatively, maybe the scarf (Evidence 19) with pepper and the seasoning bottle (Evidence 13) show that pepper was involved. But that's more related to the past incident with the lion.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Acro saying lifting the bust and looking out the window was impossible) and Evidence 6 (the Circus Map showing Acro's room on the third floor). If he was on the third floor, he could have dropped the bust from his window without needing to look out while lifting. Wait, Testimony 2 says "lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible." But if he didn't need to look out while lifting, maybe he could lift the bust first, then look out to aim. But he claims both actions together were impossible. However, if he could lift the bust (as per Testimony 0 and 1), then move to the window and drop it, that's possible. So maybe the contradiction isn't here.

Alternatively, the key is the note. If Acro wrote the note, he knew the Ringmaster would be at the plaza at 10 PM, so he planned to drop the bust then. Thus, he would know the location of the head at that time, contradicting Testimony 4. Therefore, Evidence 16 (the note) contradicts Testimony 4 (Acro's claim he couldn't know the head's location). So the answer would be evidence 16 and testimony 4. But Evidence 16 is index 16 (Note) and Testimony 4 is index 4. So {"evidence": 16, "testimony":4}.

But let me check again. The note says "Meet at 10:00 PM tonight at the lodging house plaza." The Ringmaster had the torn note in his pocket. So the Ringmaster went there because of the note. If Acro wrote the note, then he would know the Ringmaster would be at that location. Therefore, Acro could have set up the bust to drop precisely there. Therefore, Testimony 4 ("impossible for me to have known the location of the Ringmaster's head") is contradicted by the existence of the note (Evidence 16), which would have allowed him to know the exact location where the Ringmaster would be, thus the head's position.

Yes, that's a solid contradiction. So the pair is Evidence 16 and Testimony 4.

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 4}

Okay, I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me go through each testimony and cross-check with the evidence.

First, looking at the testimonies by Vasquez. Testimony 5 says that Sal and Vasquez ate T-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer. Now, checking the evidence, Evidence 16 is a steak plate found in the employee area with traces of sleeping pills and a large bone. If they ate in front of the trailer, why is the plate in the employee area? That might be a contradiction. The steak plate's location doesn't match the testimony's location. So the testimony claims they ate in front of the trailer, but the plate was found elsewhere. That's conflicting.

Another possible point: Testimony 1 says the meeting ended at 4:00 PM, and Testimony 2 says they went to Studio One after. But the autopsy report (Evidence 3) states the time of death as 2:30 PM. If the meeting was until 4 PM, how could they be at Studio One after that when the murder happened at 2:30? Wait, maybe that's a different angle. But Vasquez's Testimony 4 mentions a break at 2:30 PM for 15 minutes. So during that break, maybe someone had the opportunity. But how does that tie into evidence?

Wait, the Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11) blocked the path from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. If the path was blocked, how did they go to Studio One after the meeting ended at 4 PM? The van (Evidence 18) was used by Manella to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting. But if the path was blocked until 4 PM, maybe they couldn't have gone until after 4 PM. But the murder happened at 2:30 PM. Hmm, maybe the murderer had another way in?

Alternatively, let's go back to the steak plate. Testimony 5 says they ate in front of the trailer, but the plate was found in the employee area. So the location discrepancy could mean that Vasquez is lying about where they ate, which might be relevant if the plate was moved or if the steak was used to drug someone. Since Evidence 16 mentions sleeping pills in the steak, maybe Vasquez and Sal were actually in the employee area, not in front of the trailer. That would contradict their testimony. So the evidence 16 (steak plate in employee area) contradicts testimony 5 (ate in front of trailer). 

Yes, that seems like a direct contradiction. The steak plate's location is different from where they said they ate. So the answer would be evidence 16 and testimony 5. But evidence 16 is numbered 16. Let me check the evidence list again. Evidence 16 is the Steak Plate, and Testimony 5 is the one where they claim to have eaten in front of the trailer. So the presence of the plate in the employee area contradicts that testimony. Therefore, {"evidence": 16, "testimony":5}.

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find a pair where a testimony is contradicted by evidence. Let's start by going through each testimony and checking the evidence for contradictions.

Testimony 0 by Vasquez: She was with Sal and Oldbag when they found the body. Let me check if any evidence suggests they weren't together. Maybe the security lady's statements? Wait, the Security Lady (Character 4) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene. But how does that relate? Hmm, not sure yet.

Testimony 1: The assistant was there, only Powers was absent. So according to Vasquez, during the time they found the body, Powers wasn't present. But Evidence 5 is Powers'(?) Photo taken at 2:00 PM at the gate. The photo shows him dragging a leg. The murder happened at 2:30 PM. Wait, if the photo is at 2:00 PM, maybe he was on his way. But if Vasquez says Powers was absent when they found the body, but the autopsy says death at 2:30 PM. Then the time they found the body might be after 2:30. But Vasquez's testimony about the group when finding the body includes Sal and Oldbag, but Powers wasn't there. However, if the murder was at 2:30, and the photo at 2:00 shows Powers near the scene, maybe he could have been there. Wait, but the path to the crime scene was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11) between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. So if the path was blocked from 2:15 onwards, how did Powers get there? The photo at 2:00 PM shows him moving towards the studio. If the path was blocked after 2:15, then maybe he couldn't have gotten to the scene after that time. But the murder happened at 2:30. So if Powers was in the area at 2:00, but the path was blocked from 2:15, how did he get through? Unless he was already there. Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Vasquez's testimony that Powers was absent when they found the body, but the security lady (Oldbag) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene (Character 4's description). But that's part of the characters, not evidence. Let me look again.

Testimony 3: Vasquez says Oldbag was pointing at Powers, saying "he did it!" But if the path was blocked from 2:15 to 4:00 PM (Evidence 11), then Powers couldn't have entered the scene after 2:15. The murder was at 2:30 PM. So if the path was blocked, Powers couldn't have been there at the time of the murder. Therefore, Oldbag's claim that she saw Powers heading to the scene (as per her character description) would be contradicted by Evidence 11. But how does this relate to Vasquez's testimony? Wait, Vasquez's Testimony 3 is about Oldbag accusing Powers. But if the path was blocked, Powers couldn't have been there, so Oldbag's accusation is contradicted by Evidence 11. But since the Security Lady's statement is part of her character description, not a testimony, maybe not. Wait, the testimonies are given by Vasquez. The Security Lady's claim is part of her character description. The question is about evidence contradicting a testimony. So which testimony from Vasquez is contradicted by which evidence?

Let me check the testimonies again. Testimony 1: Only Powers was absent when they found the body. But if the path was blocked from 2:15, and the murder happened at 2:30, then Powers couldn't have been there. So if the Security Lady (Oldbag) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene (as per her description), which would be before 2:15 (since the path was blocked after that). The photo (Evidence 5) shows Powers at 2:00 PM, so he was in the area. But if the path was blocked from 2:15, how did he get to the scene for the murder at 2:30? Unless he was already in the area. Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 where Vasquez says Oldbag accused Powers, but Evidence 11 shows the path was blocked, so Powers couldn't have been there. Therefore, Oldbag's accusation (through Vasquez's Testimony 3) is contradicted by Evidence 11. But Testimony 3 is Vasquez recounting Oldbag's accusation, not necessarily her own statement. Hmm.

Alternatively, Testimony 5: Vasquez says she went back to the trailer to get her script and direction notes. Evidence 9 is Vasquez's Memo which says "Bring me the script from Episode 13." And Evidence 10 is the script from Episode 13. So maybe she had the script already, but why would she need to go get it if the memo was to bring it? Maybe the memo is a contradiction. Wait, the memo (Evidence 9) says "Bring me the script from Episode 13." So maybe Vasquez was supposed to bring the script, but her testimony says she went to get the script. If the memo was her own, then perhaps there's a contradiction. Or maybe not. Alternatively, the van (Evidence 18) was used by Manella to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer. If her testimony says she went back to the trailer, but the van was used to go to Studio One, perhaps there's a timing issue. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 7 by Vasquez says she left Hammer behind because he was injured and couldn't do action scenes. But Evidence 17 is a five-year-old photo showing an accident involving Jack Hammer. If Hammer's injury was from five years ago, maybe he had recovered, contradicting her statement that he couldn't do action scenes. So Vasquez's Testimony 7 is contradicted by Evidence 17. But the description of Evidence 17 says it's an accident involving Jack Hammer. If that injury is old, maybe he was able to do action scenes now, so her claim that she left him because of his injury is a lie. That could be a contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 2: Vasquez says she called the police, then Powers showed up. But if the path was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM (Evidence 11), and the murder was at 2:30 PM, Powers couldn't have entered the scene after 2:15. So when Vasquez called the police (after finding the body at 2:30), Powers couldn't have arrived unless he was already there. But Evidence 5's photo shows him at 2:00 PM entering, but if the path was blocked, maybe he couldn't leave. Hmm. This is getting complicated.

Wait, Evidence 11 is Mr. Monkey's Head blocking the path from 2:15 to 4:00 PM. So anyone trying to go to the crime scene after 2:15 would be blocked. The murder happened at 2:30. So the killer must have been there before 2:15, or had another way. If Powers was seen at 2:00 PM heading towards the scene (Evidence 5), he could have been there before 2:15. But then he couldn't leave after 2:15. If the body was found after 2:30, then when the police arrived, Powers would have been stuck there. But Vasquez's Testimony 2 says that after she called the police, Powers showed up. If the path was blocked, how did Powers get there after the murder? Unless he was already there. So if the path was blocked from 2:15, and the murder was at 2:30, Powers would have been stuck there. But the photo shows him entering at 2:00 PM. So he could be there, but then how did he leave? Unless there's another path. But according to the guidemap (Evidence 2), perhaps there's another route. Wait, maybe the guidemap shows another way. If the guidemap is part of the evidence, maybe the path being blocked by the Monkey Head isn't the only way. Hmm, but the problem states that Evidence 11 blocked the path to the scene between 2:15 and 4:00. So the only path was blocked. Therefore, Powers couldn't have arrived after 2:15. But according to Vasquez's Testimony 2, after she called the police (which would be after finding the body at 2:30), Powers showed up. But how could Powers have gotten there if the path was blocked? Unless he was already there. That would mean Powers was at the scene before 2:15, committed the murder at 2:30, and then was found when the police arrived. But the problem is that Vasquez's testimony says Powers showed up after she called the police, implying he arrived after the path was blocked. This would contradict Evidence 11. So Testimony 2 (Vasquez saying Powers showed up after she called police) is contradicted by Evidence 11 (path blocked from 2:15). Therefore, the pair would be evidence 11 and testimony 2. Let me check the numbers. Evidence 11 is Mr. Monkey's Head (blocked path), Testimony 2 is Vasquez's statement that after calling the police, Powers showed up. If the path was blocked from 2:15, then Powers couldn't have arrived after that, so him showing up after 2:30 (when the police were called) would be impossible. Therefore, this is a contradiction. So the answer is {"evidence": 11, "testimony": 2}.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 2}

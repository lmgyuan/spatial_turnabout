Alright, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. So, from the story, we have Phoenix Wright, who is the defendant, and there's a lot of evidence pointing towards him being involved in the theft of the Sacred Urn. 

First, there's the Maya's Magatama, which reacts to people with secrets. That might indicate Phoenix has something to hide. Then, the Sacred Urn itself is missing, and there are paint marks on the box, suggesting it was moved. The fact that the box fits the Urn perfectly supports the idea that someone intentionally took it.

Looking at testimonies, Dick Gumshoe claims that Mask☆DeMasque is the thief because of his M.O. However, the evidence shows that the Urn was taken in a way that fits DeMasque's pattern, but there's also the Maya's Magatama reacting to Phoenix, suggesting he might be involved. 

So, the contradiction here is between the testimony that points to DeMasque and the evidence that suggests Phoenix might be the one who took the Urn, possibly due to the Magatama's reaction indicating he has secrets. This means the testimony might be ignoring evidence that directly links Phoenix to the crime.

{"evidence": 1, "testimony": 0}

**Explanation:**
The Maya's Magatama (Evidence 1) reacts to Phoenix Wright, indicating he has secrets, while Dick Gumshoe's testimony (Testimony 0) claims that Mask☆DeMasque is the thief based on his M.O. This contradiction arises because the evidence suggests Phoenix's involvement, contradicting Gumshoe's testimony.
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to figure out which evidence or testimony contradicts each other in the given story, characters, evidences, and testimonies. The story involves Phoenix Wright, a young lawyer, and his involvement in a case where a CEO was found dead under mysterious circumstances. The main suspect is a thief named Mask☆DeMasque, who has a pattern of stealing valuable art pieces and leaving calling cards before his heists.

First, I'll list out the key elements:

- **Characters**: Phoenix Wright, Dick Gumshoe, Mask☆DeMasque, and others.
- **Evidences**: Include things like the Maya's Magatama, the Sacred Urn, calling cards, camera data, etc.
- **Testimonies**: From characters like Dick Gumshoe and Luke Atmey.

The goal is to find a pair where one evidence or character's testimony contradicts another piece of evidence or testimony.

Looking at the testimonies, Dick Gumshoe mentions that Mask☆DeMasque is a master thief who sends calling cards before committing crimes. This seems consistent with the evidence of the calling card found at the crime scene. However, Phoenix Wright's Maya's Magatama reacts to him, indicating he has secrets, which might contradict if Phoenix is involved in the crime.

Alternatively, considering the evidence of the calling card and the testimony about Mask☆DeMasque's pattern, they align well. But the user is asking for a contradiction, so perhaps there's a discrepancy between the evidence of the calling card and another piece of testimony that suggests someone else was involved.

Wait, the user provided a specific instruction: "Which evidence/character and testimony contradict each other? You must make two choices: one for an evidence or a character, and one for a testimony." So, I need to find one evidence and one testimony that directly contradict each other.

Re-examining the testimonies, Luke Atmey's testimony mentions that Mask☆DeMasque attacked him around 1 AM, which aligns with the camera data showing the system went off at around that time. However, if the evidence shows something else, that could be a contradiction.

But looking back, the evidence of the calling card fits with the testimony about Mask☆DeMasque's M.O. So, perhaps the contradiction is between the Maya's Magatama (evidence) and Phoenix's testimony, indicating Phoenix's involvement, which contradicts Dick Gumshoe's testimony about Mask☆DeMasque.

So, the evidence (Maya's Magatama) reacting to Phoenix suggests his involvement, while Dick Gumshoe's testimony points to Mask☆DeMasque. This creates a contradiction between the evidence and the testimony.

Therefore, the answer would pair Evidence 1 (Maya's Magatama) with Testimony 0 (Dick Gumshoe's testimony), indicating a contradiction.
</think>

{"evidence": 1, "testimony": 0}

**Explanation:**
The Maya's Magatama (Evidence 1) reacts to Phoenix Wright, suggesting his involvement in the crime, while Dick Gumshoe's testimony (Testimony 0) claims that Mask☆DeMasque is the thief based on his M.O. This contradiction arises because the evidence suggests Phoenix's involvement, contradicting Gumshoe's testimony.
Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'm given a story with characters, evidence, and testimonies, and I need to find a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony, or between a character and a testimony. The final answer should be in JSON format, specifying the evidence and testimony that contradict each other.

First, I'll review the characters, evidence, and testimonies provided.

**Characters:**
- Phoenix Wright: The protagonist, a young lawyer.
- Mia Fey: Phoenix's mentor, who passed away two years ago.
- Maya Fey: Phoenix's assistant and disciple in the Kurain Tradition.
- Pearl Fey: Maya's cousin, a channeling prodigy.
- Adrian Andrews: Head of planning, promotion, and security for the Treasures of Kurain Exhibit.
- Dick Gumshoe: Homicide detective.
- Mask☆DeMasque: A flashy thief who steals art and sends a calling card before heists.
- Luke Atmey: An ace detective.
- Ron DeLite: A young man who turned himself in as Mask☆DeMasque.
- Desirée DeLite: Ron's wife.
- Larry Butz: Phoenix's friend.
- Godot: A mysterious prosecutor who seems to know Phoenix.
- Kane Bullard: CEO of KB Security, whose body was found in his safe.

**Evidences:**
- **Attorney's Badge**: Proof of Phoenix's profession.
- **Maya's Magatama**: Reacts to people with secrets.
- **Treasure Exhibit Poster**: Promotes the Sacred Urn exhibit.
- **Ami Fey's Golden Statue**: Holds the Shichishito.
- **Sacred Urn**: Priceless, plain pot.
- **DeMasque's Calling Card**: Sent before heists.
- **Shichishito**: ceremonial sword, not bent before the crime.
- **Camera Data**: Warehouse camera went off at 1 AM.
- **Desirée's Letter**: To Ron, contains something important.
- **Security Camera Photo**: Click for details.
- **Blackmail Letter**: Found in Ron's room.
- **Ron's Wallet**: Found by Larry at the crime scene.
- **Key Card**: Used for part-time job building.
- **Publicity Photo**: Mask☆DeMasque striking a pose.
- **DeMasque's Broach**: Found near Ami Fey's statue.
- **Kane's Autopsy Report**: Time and cause of death.
- **Newspaper Clipping**: Article on Mask☆DeMasque's first heist.
- **CEO Office Buzzer**: No fingerprints.
- **Kane's List**: Found at the crime scene.
- **Buzzer Record**: Buzzer went off at 1:02 AM.
- **Ron's Testimony**: DeMasque's heists directed by blackmail.
- **Urn Box**: Wooden box with Sacred Urn, pink paint stains.
- **Paint Marks**: Dry, fits the box perfectly.

**Testimonies:**
- **Testimony 0**: Luke Atmey says he looked away briefly.
- **Testimony 1**: Atmey claims he can't be easily discombobulated.
- **Testimony 2**: Atmey says the thief rendered him senseless.
- **Testimony 3**: Atmey claims he fought with his fists but was struck.
- **Testimony 4**: Atmey says the thief's blow landed on his third eye.

Now, I need to find contradictions. Let's start by looking at the testimonies and see if any contradict the evidence.

Starting with **Testimony 0**: Atmey claims he looked away briefly. This could relate to **Camera Data** (Evidence 7), which shows the camera went off at 1 AM. If Atmey was in the warehouse at that time, his testimony might contradict the camera footage showing he was present.

But before jumping to conclusions, let's check other testimonies.

**Testimony 1**: Atmey claims he can't be easily discombobulated. This seems vague, but perhaps it contradicts evidence about his behavior during the incident.

**Testimony 2**: Atmey says the thief rendered him senseless. This might relate to **Blackmail Letter** (Evidence 10) or **DeMasque's Broach** (Evidence 14), which was found near the statue.

**Testimony 3**: Atmey claims he fought with his fists but was struck. This could relate to **Shichishito** (Evidence 6), which wasn't bent, suggesting the fight didn't involve significant force.

**Testimony 4**: Atmey says the thief's blow landed on his third eye. This seems specific and might not directly contradict any evidence, but it's worth noting.

Now, looking for a strong contradiction:

- **Testimony 0**: Atmey looked away briefly.
- **Camera Data**: Camera went off at 1 AM, suggesting Atmey was present.

If Atmey was in the warehouse at 1 AM, his testimony that he looked away briefly might not contradict the camera data. However, if the camera data shows he was present, his testimony might imply he was involved, which could contradict evidence pointing to another thief.

But considering the available testimonies and evidence, the strongest contradiction might be between **Testimony 0** and **Camera Data** (Evidence 7). If the camera shows Atmey was present, his testimony about looking away briefly might be inconsistent.

Alternatively, considering **Testimony 1** and **Evidence 14** (DeMasque's Broach), if Atmey claims he can't be discombobulated, but evidence shows DeMasque was active, this could be a contradiction.

However, the most direct contradiction seems to be between **Testimony 0** and **Camera Data**. If Atmey was present when the camera went off, his testimony about looking away briefly might not align with the camera footage showing his presence.

But to be precise, let's focus on the testimonies and evidence that directly point to the same incident.

**Testimony 0**: Atmey says he looked away briefly.
**Camera Data**: Camera went off at 1 AM, suggesting Atmey was present.

If Atmey was present at 1 AM, his testimony about looking away briefly doesn't contradict the camera data. However, if the camera data shows he was involved in the incident, his testimony might be inconsistent.

But without more details, it's hard to make a definitive statement. Therefore, the best choice is:

- **Testimony 0**: Atmey's claim about looking away briefly.
- **Evidence 7**: Camera data showing activity at 1 AM.

These two pieces of information don't directly contradict each other but could be used to suggest Atmey's presence at the time of the crime, contradicting his testimony about looking away.

However, to strictly follow the instructions, I need to choose one testimony and one evidence that contradict each other.

After careful consideration, the most fitting pair is:

- **Testimony 0**: Atmey's claim of looking away briefly.
- **Evidence 7**: Camera data indicating activity at 1 AM.

This suggests Atmey was present, contradicting his testimony about looking away.
</think>

{"testimony": 0, "evidence": 7}
Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts which testimony in this story. Let's see, the story involves Phoenix Wright, a lawyer, and his assistant Maya Fey. There's a theft at the Treasures of Kurain Exhibit, and Phoenix is involved somehow. The key evidence seems to be the Camera Data (Evidence 7) showing the camera went off around 1 AM, and Ron DeLite's testimony (Testimony 0) claiming he's the thief, Mask☆DeMasque. But Phoenix's Magatama (Evidence 1) reacts to Phoenix, suggesting he's involved. So, Phoenix's presence at the crime scene contradicts Ron's claim. That makes sense because Phoenix is the main character and likely the real thief.

So, the contradiction is between Phoenix's Magatama (Evidence 1) reacting to Phoenix, indicating his involvement, and Ron's testimony (Testimony 0) trying to frame him as the thief, which doesn't fit. Therefore, the evidence contradicts the testimony because the evidence points to Phoenix, not Ron.
</think>

{"evidence": 1, "testimony": 0}

**Explanation:**
The Maya's Magatama (Evidence 1) reacts to Phoenix Wright, indicating his involvement in the crime, while Ron DeLite's testimony (Testimony 0) claims that Mask☆DeMasque is the thief. This contradiction arises because the evidence suggests Phoenix's involvement, contradicting Ron's claim.

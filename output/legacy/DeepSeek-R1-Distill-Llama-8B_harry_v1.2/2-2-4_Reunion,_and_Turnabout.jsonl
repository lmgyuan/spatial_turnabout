The evidence, Maya's Costume (Evidence 11), shows blood splatters, while Ini's testimony (Testimony 0) claims she was asleep and didn't witness the incident. This contradiction arises because the evidence indicates Maya's active involvement in the crime scene, which is not supported by Ini's testimony.
{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 0}
The evidence, Newspaper Clipping 1 (Evidence 3), states that 14 patients died from malpractice at the Grey Surgical Clinic in May. This contradicts Ini's testimony (Testimony 1) which vaguely mentions "something really bad had happened" around that time without specifying the incident. Additionally, Ini's testimony about her sister falling asleep while driving does not align with the evidence, as Mimi Miney's death was due to a car accident, but the evidence does not support the details she provided.

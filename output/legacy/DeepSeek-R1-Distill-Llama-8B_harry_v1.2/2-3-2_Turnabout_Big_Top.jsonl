The evidence, Silk Hat (Evidence 3), found at the crime scene, indicates that Max was present. However, Trilo's testimony (Testimony 0) claims that he saw Max in the plaza after waiting for about five minutes, which could contradict the timeline if the crime was already in progress. This suggests a potential inconsistency between the evidence and the testimony regarding Max's presence at the scene.

The evidence, Silk Hat (Evidence 3), was found at the crime scene, indicating Max's presence.

Despite this, the contradiction arises from the timing, as Moe's account suggests he saw Max after the crime had already occurred, creating an inconsistency with the evidence timeline.

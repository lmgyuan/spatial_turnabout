Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'm trying to figure out which piece of evidence or character testimony contradicts each other in this story. The user has provided a detailed scenario with characters, evidences, and testimonies. My goal is to identify a pair where one evidence or character directly contradicts a testimony.

First, I'll look at the testimonies. Testimony 0 is from Acro, who claims that he couldn't have lifted the bust of Max because of his injured legs. Testimony 1 mentions his strong upper body, and Testimony 2 and 3 reinforce that he couldn't have lifted the bust due to his legs being injured. Testimony 4 and 5 further elaborate that it's impossible for him to have done so.

Now, looking at the evidence, Evidence 15 is the Max G. Bust, which was taken from the cafeteria. The fact that the bust was moved suggests that someone lifted it, possibly Acro. However, Acro's testimonies suggest that he couldn't have moved it because of his injuries.

So, the contradiction is between the evidence (bust being moved) and the testimonies (Acro claiming he couldn't have lifted it). This suggests that Acro might be lying or that someone else moved the bust.

Therefore, the pair that contradicts each other is:
- Evidence: 15 (Max G. Bust)
- Testimony: 0 (Acro's claim)
</think>

{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 0}

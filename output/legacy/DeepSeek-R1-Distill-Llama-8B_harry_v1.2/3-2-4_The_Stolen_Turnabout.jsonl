The newspaper clipping (Evidence 16) shows Mask DeMasque in an alley, not at KB Security, while Ron DeLite's testimony (Testimony 0) claims he was at KB Security. This contradiction arises because the evidence contradicts Ron's claim, indicating he was not present at KB Security as he testified.

The blackmail letter (Evidence 10) explicitly instructs Ron DeLite to come to KB Security at 1:00 AM on October 12th, while Ron's testimony (Testimony 0) claims he was at KB Security. This contradiction arises because the evidence directly links Ron to the location, whereas his testimony places him elsewhere, indicating a potential discrepancy in his account.

The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the vase already smashed, which contradicts Adrian Andrews' testimony (Testimony 5) that she knocked it over after discovering the body. This suggests the murder occurred before her discovery, indicating someone else was responsible for the vase being smashed.
{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 5}
Shelly de Killer's testimony (Testimony 6) claims that Adrian Andrews tampered with the crime scene by planting a knife and a button to frame someone, while the evidence, such as the Knife (Evidence 15) and Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16), directly links Matt Engarde to the crime. This contradiction arises because the evidence supports Matt's involvement, contradicting Shelly's claim of a setup.

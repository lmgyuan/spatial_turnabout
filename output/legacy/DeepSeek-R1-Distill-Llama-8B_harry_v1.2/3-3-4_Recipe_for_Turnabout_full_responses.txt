Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this story. Let's see, the story involves a murder at a restaurant called Tres Bien. The victim is Glen Elg, a programmer who wasn't seen before by Maggey Byrde, the accused. There's a lot of evidence and testimonies to sort through.

First, I see that the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows Glen at one table, but Victor Kudo claims he was at the other table. That seems contradictory because the photo shows Glen at one table, not the other. Also, the Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has Maggey's fingerprints, but Victor claims he was the one who took the sip. That's another contradiction because the cup shows Maggey's fingerprints, not Victor's.

So, the evidence contradicts Victor's testimony because the crime photo shows Glen at the empty table, not where Victor was. And the coffee cup has Maggey's fingerprints, not Victor's, which contradicts Victor's claim that he took the sip. Therefore, both pieces of evidence contradict Victor's testimony.

I think that makes sense. The evidence directly contradicts what Victor is saying, so that's the pair I'm looking for.

**Answer:**

The Crime Photo (Evidence 12) and the Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) both directly contradict Victor Kudo's testimony (Testimony 0). The crime photo shows Glen Elg at the empty table, not where Victor claims he was, and the coffee cup, covered in Maggey Byrde's fingerprints, contradicts Victor's claim that he was the one who took the sip. These two pieces of evidence directly oppose Victor's testimony, creating a clear contradiction.

**JSON Answer:**

{"evidence": [12, 13], "testimony": 0}
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this story. Let's see, the story involves Maya Fey, her assistant, and some other characters involved in a murder case. The main evidence seems to be the Crime Photo and the Coffee Cup, which both link the victim, Glen Elg, to Maggey Byrde. Victor Kudo's testimony says he broke the vase and saw Maggey, but the Crime Photo shows Glen at an empty table, not where Victor claims he was. That seems like a contradiction.

So, I think the evidence is the Crime Photo and the Coffee Cup, and the testimony is Victor's. That makes sense because the evidence directly contradicts his story. So, I'll pick those to make the JSON answer.

{"evidence": [12, 13], "testimony": 0}
Alright, let's try to figure this out. So, I'm trying to find out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this story. The user has been giving me a lot of information about characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to find a pair where one evidence or character contradicts a testimony.

First, I need to understand the story. It seems like there's a murder at Tres Bien, a restaurant. The victim is Glen Elg, a programmer, and Maggey Byrde, Maya's client, is accused of his murder. There are a lot of testimonies from Victor Kudo, who was in the restaurant, and Jean Armstrong, the chef, who was experimenting with some art deco mirror.

Now, looking at the testimonies, Victor says that he was sitting at a table and saw Maggey pour a poisoned coffee into Glen. But the evidence shows that the coffee was found with Maggey's fingerprints, and Victor was sitting at the same table as Glen. That seems contradictory because Victor claims he saw Maggey do it, but the evidence shows it was Maggey, so that's a contradiction.

Also, Jean Armstrong says that after Glen died, she moved a mirror to avoid the reflection, but the crime photo shows the mirror was in the way, so that's another contradiction.

So, the two pairs would be:

1. Evidence 13 (Coffee Cup with Maggey's fingerprints) contradicts Victor's testimony that he saw Maggey pour the coffee into Glen.

2. Evidence 12 (Crime Photo shows the mirror was blocking the view) contradicts Jean's testimony that she moved the mirror.

So, I can choose one pair, say the coffee cup and Victor's testimony.

**Answer:**

The Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) shows Maggey's fingerprints, contradicting Victor's testimony (Testimony 0) that he saw Maggey pour the poisoned coffee into Glen. This creates a direct contradiction.

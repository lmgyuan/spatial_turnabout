    "response": "Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I have a list of characters, evidence, and testimonies related to a crime, and I need to find a pair where the evidence and testimony contradict each other. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the characters involved to get a sense of who might be connected to the crime. The victim is Pal Meraktis, the director of the Meraktis Clinic. The defendant is Wocky Kitaki, who is the fianc\u00e9 of Alita Tiala. There's also a witness, Wesley Stickler, who seems to have a detailed account of the events. Other characters include Phoenix Wright, a defense attorney, and Ema Skye, a detective.\n\nNow, looking at the evidence, there are several items that stand out. Evidence 11 is the autopsy report stating that the victim died from a single bullet to the right temple after 10 PM. Evidence 14 is the pistol found at the crime scene with two rounds fired and fingerprints wiped. Evidence 5 is Wesley Stickler's cell phone found under a car in the clinic's garage.\n\nMoving on to the testimonies, Wesley Stickler claims he saw the defendant, Wocky Kitaki, shoot the victim. He describes the events in detail, including the noodle stand sign reading \"NOODLE.\" However, the noodle stand evidence (Evidence 12) shows a sign that reads \"ELDOON,\" not \"NOODLE.\" This discrepancy suggests that Stickler's testimony might be unreliable or fabricated.\n\nAdditionally, Alita Tiala's testimonies mention her presence at the clinic and her warning to the victim, but she denies any involvement in the crime. Her testimonies don't directly contradict the evidence but add context to the relationships and motives.\n\nConsidering the contradiction between the noodle stand sign in the testimony and the evidence, it seems like the most significant inconsistency. Wesley Stickler's detailed account includes specific details about the noodle stand sign, which doesn't match the actual sign found. This could indicate that Stickler either lied or was mistaken about what he saw, which would undermine his credibility as a witness.\n\nTherefore, the pair that contradicts each other is Evidence 12 (Noodle Stand) and Testimony 4 (Wesley Stickler's statement about the noodle stand sign). This contradiction casts doubt on the accuracy of Stickler's testimony and potentially on his role as a witness.\n</think>\n\n{\"evidence\": 12, \"testimony\": 4}",

    "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by understanding the characters and the evidence involved.\n\nFirst, the characters include Apollo Justice, Phoenix Wright, Trucy Wright, Aristotle Means, Constance Courte, Juniper Woods, Hugh O'Conner, Robin Newman, Bobby Fulbright, Simon Blackquill, Klavier Gavin, and Myriam Scuttlebutt. The victim is Constance Courte, and the defendant is Juniper Woods.\n\nLooking at the evidence, there's an arrow that pierced the victim's side, Courte's planner with a sword emblem, a Themis Herald with a scoop on Junie, a stage costume with glowing stars, a mock trial script, an extra edition of the school paper, an awl as the murder weapon, Courte's autopsy report, a tape recorder with a fake recording, a glowing costume photo, a school camera photo, a school banner with blood, purple and white fragments from statues, a \"Hugh\" scrap, burnt fragments of a banner, stage setup photos, and a lecture hall diagram.\n\nNow, the testimonies include Myriam Scuttlebutt's account of following Juniper to the crime scene, and Juniper's statement about her whereabouts during the murder.\n\nI need to find a pair where the evidence contradicts the testimony. Let's look at the evidence and see which one doesn't align with what a witness is saying.\n\nMyriam Scuttlebutt testified that she saw Juniper in her stage costume near the crime scene, which would imply Juniper was present. However, the evidence shows that the stage costume had a glowing star pattern, which might not have been visible in the dark, making it hard to identify Juniper solely based on the costume.\n\nAlternatively, the tape recorder evidence indicates that the recording of the voice was fake, which might contradict Myriam's testimony if she used it to frame Juniper.\n\nAnother point is the awl with Juniper's fingerprints, but if Juniper was elsewhere or had an alibi, that could contradict the physical evidence.\n\nConsidering all, the most direct contradiction seems to be between the testimony about Juniper wearing the stage costume and the evidence that the costume's glowing feature might not have been visible, making the identification unreliable.\n\nSo, I think the evidence that contradicts Myriam's testimony about seeing Juniper in the costume is the glowing costume photo, which shows the costume might not have been easily recognizable in the dark.\n</think>\n\n{\"evidence\": 10, \"testimony\": 4}",

    "response": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the evidence and testimonies provided. \n\nStarting with the evidence, I see that Evidence 2 is \"Courte's Planner,\" which includes a sword emblem and has a note saying \"23rd - Meet with Hugh\" and \"Important.\" This suggests that Professor Courte had a meeting scheduled with Hugh on the 23rd. \n\nNow, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 3 from Hugh O'Conner states, \"Oh, let me add I never went to the art room. There was no reason for me to be there.\" \n\nSo, the planner indicates that Hugh was supposed to meet with Professor Courte on the 23rd, which might imply he was in the vicinity or had a reason to be around the art room. However, Hugh claims he never went to the art room, which could be a contradiction if the meeting was supposed to take place there.\n\nThis seems like a contradiction because the planner suggests Hugh had a reason to be near the art room (for the meeting), but he denies going there. \n\nI think the contradiction is between Evidence 2 and Testimony 3.\n</think>\n\n{\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}",

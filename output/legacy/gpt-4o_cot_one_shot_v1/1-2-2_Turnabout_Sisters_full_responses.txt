To find the contradiction, we need to compare the testimonies with the evidences that mention anything related to writing in blood or messages left by the victim, Mia.

1. **Testimony Analysis:**
   - Testimony 2 and Testimony 5 suggest that the victim, before dying, wrote the name "Maya" in blood.
   - Testimony 3 mentions that lab results confirmed that the blood was the victim's.
   
2. **Evidence Analysis:**
   - **Evidence 3 (Receipt):** Mentions a department store receipt with letters written in blood.
   - **Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report):** States "Death was instantaneous" and she may have lived for a few minutes after being hit.

3. **Contradiction Identification:**
   - If Mia died instantaneously as per Evidence 5, it would be very unlikely for her to have had the time or ability to write "Maya" in blood as claimed in Testimony 5 and implied in Testimony 2.

The contradiction lies in the fact that the police claim the victim wrote the killer's name in blood, but the autopsy report describes the death as "instantaneous," suggesting Mia wouldn't have had the opportunity to write anything at all.

Therefore, Testimony 5 contradicts Evidence 5.

******************************
To identify the contradiction, we need to carefully analyze the evidence and testimonies presented.

- **Evidence 1: The Thinker** is both a statue and a clock but the clock gears have been removed. This implies that it could no longer function as a clock at the time of the murder.

- **Testimony 4** by April May refers to "that clock" and identifies it as “The Thinker”.

The contradiction arises when April May refers to "The Thinker" as a clock. Given that the clock's gears have been removed (as per Evidence 1), it can no longer function as a clock. Hence, calling it a "clock" when it is just a statue without the clock gears suggests a discrepancy.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 1 and Testimony 4.

Analyzing the evidences and testimonies:

- **Evidence 6** (Newspaper Clipping 2) mentions that **Ini Miney** claimed she was in a car crash, which supposedly killed her sister, Mimi Miney. The article indicates that the driver was supposedly Mimi, who fell asleep at the wheel.

- **Testimony 0** given by **Ini** states, "Like, when the channeling started, I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room." This testimony is about where she was and what she was doing during the channeling.

Now, looking for a contradiction:

- **Evidence 18** (License Photo) is related to **Iniâ€™s photo**. This connects back to the accident, raising questions about the identities and their accounts of the crash.

- However, direct contradiction comes from the scenario itself due to the implication of mistaken identities. If Ini was claiming to have seen her sister alive in her testimony (Testimony 2: "It was, like, oh my gawd, totally my sister!") and the content of the newspaper article (Evidence 6), the testimony becomes conflicting since Mimi Miney supposedly died in an accident and would not be seen unless in spirit form or otherwise.

Thus, contradiction in **Testimony 2** claiming to have seen her deceased sister and **Evidence 6** stating the supposed death of her sister in the crash.

******************************
To find the contradiction, let's carefully examine the evidence and testimonies.

**Testimony 6:**
- Ini claims: "I, like, didn't have my license, so, like, I couldn't take over driving for her."

**Evidence 18: License Photo:**
- This evidence is Ini's photo for her driver's license, which indicates that she does have a license.

The contradiction lies in Ini's testimony claiming she didn't have a license, while the evidence shows she had a driver's license. Therefore, Evidence 18 contradicts Testimony 6.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 6}
******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided to find a contradiction.

1. Testimony 5 states, "So, like, that's why I ended up in the passenger's seat that night too." This implies that Ini Miney was not driving during the fatal car accident and was instead in the passenger seat, suggesting her sister Mimi was driving.

2. Evidence 6, "Newspaper Clipping 2," includes a statement from Ini Miney where she holds an interview about the crash. In this interview, she admits, "I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep," which implicates that she was the one driving the car when it crashed.

These two statements are contradictory; Testimony 5 claims Ini Miney was not driving, while the interview in Evidence 6 suggests otherwise.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 by Gumshoe states: "The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!" 

However, Evidence 15, which is the Knife, has an important detail: "In the grip, 'Gatewater' is engraved." The engraving suggests the knife originated from the Gatewater Hotel, implying it was not purchased specifically by the defendant for the crime, contradicting the claim of premeditation.

To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies, let's examine the details provided.

- Testimony 4 by Wendy Oldbag: "It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!"
- Testimony 5 by Wendy Oldbag: "He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show."

Now, let's review relevant evidence:

- Evidence 17: Lotta's Photo - "Picture taken in the Hallway right after the murder. A person in samurai garb stands outside the door."
- Evidence 16: Jammin' Ninja's Button - "Was ripped from his costume. Is covered in Corrida's blood. Found in Engarde's 'hakama'."

From these pieces, we find a contradiction:

Oldbag claims Engarde was sneaking out of Juan's room wearing his flashy racing jacket. However, Lotta's photo shows someone in samurai garb, which contradicts her testimony about the specific attire Engarde was wearing. Additionally, the presence of the Jammin' Ninja's Button in Engarde's 'hakama' suggests he was in disguise.

Therefore, Testimony 5 contradicts the photo evidence that the person outside the crime scene was in samurai garb, rather than the flashy racing jacket Oldbag described.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 4 states, "So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan." This implies that the murderer wore the costume during the act.

Evidence 14, which is "Juan's Autopsy Report," states, "Time of death: 8:15 PM. Cause: Strangled to death with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife." This implies that Juan was first strangled and then stabbed.

However, Lotta's Photo (Evidence 17) shows a person in a samurai garb standing outside the door right after the murder, indicating that the person changed into the costume after the crime to create an alibi, contradicting the testimony that they were wearing it during the act.

Thus, the most evident contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Lotta's Photo (Evidence 17).

******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 4 states, "I felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice," by Adrian Andrews. The logical implication is that this glass of juice should have Andrews' fingerprints if she poured it herself.

Evidence 8 describes a "Wine Glass" filled with tomato juice and states it bears Andrews' fingerprints. However, the evidence description also notes that there is no sign that it has been drank.

In the context of the situation, Andrews might have been testifying that she poured herself a drink to calm her nerves, which would imply she drank from it. However, the fact that the juice hasn't been drank seems to contradict the context of her testimony, where one would expect the actions she described to result in consumption of the juice rather than leaving it untouched.

Given the scenario, the contradiction lies in Andrews' implication of drinking from the glass for nervousness and the evidence showing the glass was not consumed.

******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and the testimony, we need to carefully examine the statements and pieces of evidence provided.

1. **Testimony Analysis**:
   - Adrian Andrews states in Testimony 1: "I suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over."

2. **Evidence Analysis**:
   - Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) mentions a guitar case that is open and next to it are the remains of a smashed vase with water-stained carpet.
   - Evidence 7 (Guitar Case) description reads: "Found next to the victim. Empty. There is some water, but only on top of the lid. Bears only Corrida's fingerprints."

3. **Contradiction Identified**:
   - The contradiction lies between Testimony 1 and Evidence 7. Adrian Andrews claims to have opened the guitar case after knocking over the vase. However, the evidence of the guitar case having water only on top of the lid, and bearing only Corrida's fingerprints, suggests that Andrews did not touch the guitar case opening after the vase was knocked over. The water on top indicates it was closed at the time of the vase breaking.

Thus, Andrews' testimony that she opened the case after knocking over the vase is contradicted by the evidence showing the case only has water on top and only Corrida's prints, indicating she did not open the case after the vase was knocked over.

******************************
To identify a contradiction, let's analyze the provided evidence and testimonies:

1. **Testimony 5** from Andrews states: "That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt."

2. **Evidence 14** is Juan's Autopsy Report, which indicates, "Time of death: 8:15 PM. Cause: Strangled to death with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife."

3. **Evidence 16** is the Jammin' Ninja's Button, described as being covered in Corrida's blood and found in Engarde's "hakama."

Andrews claims the button was torn off during a fight between Juan (Corrida) and Matt (Engarde). However, the autopsy report indicates that the victim was strangled with a scarf and then stabbed, which does not align with the notion of a button being torn off in a struggle as described by Andrews. There's no mention of such a fight in the autopsy.

The contradiction lies in the claim of a physical altercation leading to the button being torn, while the autopsy indicates causes of death not consistent with a struggle that would involve tearing a button.

******************************
To find the contradiction between the testimonies and evidence, we should carefully analyze each piece of evidence against each testimony.

Testimony 4 states: "To be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice." This implies that the juice was poured after Juan appeared to have fainted, and before realizing he was dead.

Evidence 8, the Wine Glass, states: "Found next to the victim. It's filled with tomato juice. Bears Andrews' fingerprints." It's worth noting that the description implies the glass was found with juice in it and had not been drunk, therefore it couldn't have been poured after realizing Juan was dead if it was already there when the body was discovered.

This contradiction suggests that Testimony 4, where Andrews claims to have poured juice, contradicts the evidence that the glass was already filled and untouched.

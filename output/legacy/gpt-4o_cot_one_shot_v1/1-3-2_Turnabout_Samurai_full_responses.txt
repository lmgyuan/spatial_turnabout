Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided carefully.

Testimony 6 states, "Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM." Testimony 7 continues, "It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading towards the studio!" 

This seems to support that Will Powers was the one at the scene around the time of the murder. However, the evidence provided shows Evidence 5, Powers'(?) Photo, saying, "Taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios. Steel Samurai is seen walking. [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2] He's dragging one leg."

Since Will Powers was the defendant, and if he was indeed seen by Oldbag walking normally, this photo contradicts her testimony saying that Powers walked past her. The person in the photo was dragging one leg, which implies that the person in the photo might not be Powers, thus contradicting the assertion made in her testimonies.

Therefore, the evidence that bears contradiction with Oldbag's testimony about seeing Powers is:

**Evidence:** Powers'(?) Photo â€” "He's dragging one leg."
**Testimony:** Oldbag's claim stating she saw Powers walking, without mentioning any limping.

This indicates there is a contradiction between the identification of the person Oldbag claims to have seen and who was actually in the photo.

******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and a testimony, we need to carefully go through both and see where the details don't align.

Testimonies by Oldbag suggest that Will Powers was the only person who went to the studio and that no one else went there; if they had, she would have seen them.

Looking at the evidence:

- Evidence 5, "Powers'(?) Photo," shows the Steel Samurai dragging a leg at the gate at 2:00 PM. Importantly, this could imply that someone else was wearing the costume, not necessarily Will Powers himself.
- Evidence 11, "Mr. Monkey's Head," indicates that it blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.

Oldbag claims in her testimony no one else went to the studio and that she would have seen them, yet the blockage of the path suggests difficulties in movement that she fails to address in her testimony. This conflict particularly stands out in the timeline she describes.

There seems to be a contradiction between Oldbag's testimonies (specifically Testimony 1) and what the "Mr. Monkey's Head" evidence states because if the path was blocked, someone else using a different route might not have been seen by her, invalidating her statement.

Therefore, the contradiction lies between:
- Evidence 11: "Mr. Monkey's Head"
- Testimony 1: "The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!"

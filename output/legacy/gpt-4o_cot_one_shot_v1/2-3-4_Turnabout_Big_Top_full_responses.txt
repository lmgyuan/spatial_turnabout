To find the contradiction, we'll need to carefully examine Acro's testimonies and compare them with the evidence.

1. **Testimony 0 and 1:** Acro claims he could lift something the size of the bust due to his strong upper body. This does not contradict any evidence.

2. **Testimony 2:** Acro states, "However, lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible."

3. **Testimony 3:** Acro mentions, "There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body." He emphasizes his inability to use his legs.

4. **Testimony 4:** Acro asserts that it was impossible for him to know the location of the Ringmaster's head.

5. **Testimony 5:** Acro concludes that it would be unrealistic to drop the bust on the Ringmaster.

**Key evidence to consider:**
- **Evidence 15 (Max G. Bust):** Acro might be lying about lifting and dropping the bust.
- **Evidence 2 (Crime Photo):** Shows the crime scene with the victim's position.
- **Evidence 3 (Silk Hat):** Found at the crime scene.
- **Evidence 11 (Russell's Autopsy Report):** States the time and cause of death as blunt force trauma to the back of the head.
- **Evidence 6 (Circus Map):** Acro's room location.

The contradiction arises between **Acro's Testimony 4** and **Evidence 11 (Russell's Autopsy Report)**. Acro claims he could not know where the Ringmaster's head was, yet the Ringmaster died from blunt force trauma to the back of his head, consistent with the bust being dropped on him by someone who had a vantage point.

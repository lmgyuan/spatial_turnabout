Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

1. **Testimony 5** from Larry Butz states: "So after I heard that single gunshot I went home."
2. **Evidence 11** which is "Lotta's Deposition," states: "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25."

The contradiction lies in the number of gunshots heard. Larry claims he heard a single gunshot, while Lotta's Deposition asserts two gunshots were heard.

******************************
To find the contradiction between the provided evidence and testimonies, we need to carefully analyze them.

Here, Testimony 5 by Butz states: "Just when she said 'Hey! It's almost Christmas!' I heard the gunshot!" This implies that the gunshot was heard right before or around midnight on Christmas Eve, transitioning to Christmas Day.

However, Evidence 11, which is "Lotta's Deposition," states: "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25."

The contradiction lies in the timing of when the gunshot was heard, as described by Butz and Lotta's Deposition. Butz claims to have heard the gunshot just before Christmas, while Lotta's Deposition states the gunshots were heard after midnight on Christmas Day.

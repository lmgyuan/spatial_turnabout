Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

**Evidence 12 ("Crime Photo")** describes two dining tables separated by a folding screen and mentions a coffee cup knocked over with a stained tablecloth, suggesting something happened at the scene. Importantly, it mentions two intact vases on both tables, with no sign of a broken vase.

**Testimony 18 ("Victor's Testimony")** states, "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat."

These two pieces of information seem to contradict each other because the Crime Photo provides no evidence of a broken vase, which contradicts Victor Kudo's testimony of breaking a vase. 

So, the contradiction lies between Evidence 12 and Victor's Testimony.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

The critical details are:

- **Evidence 10**: Glen's Autopsy Report states that the time of death was between 1:30 and 2:30 PM.
  
- **Testimony 2**: Armstrong states that the old man arrived not long after Glen Elg, "just after 2 PM."

- Armstrong claims in **Testimony 5** that the poisoning occurred approximately 5 minutes after Elg got excited about winning the lottery.

The logical contradiction arises with the timeline suggested by Evidence 19.

- **Evidence 19**: Millionaire Radio Flyer states that the lottery segment is aired every Monday at 1:30 PM.

If the lottery announcement was made at 1:30 PM, and Glen became excited 5 minutes later, this places the timing around 1:35 PM, which aligns closely with the start time rather than "just after 2 PM," as suggested by Armstrong.

Thus, the testimony indicating that the timeline was "just after 2 PM" doesn't align with the act of Glen becoming excited 5 minutes post-lottery announcement and poisoning right after this. Hence, the approximate start was from 1:30 PM and not overlapping "just after 2 PM."

Given this, **Testimony 2** and **Evidence 19** contradict each other.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided to find a contradiction.

1. **Evidence 20: Glen's Calendar** - States that on December 3rd, the day of the incident, there is a note saying, "Meet with The Tiger".

2. **Testimony 2** - Tigre claims, "The day youse talkin' about, I was in de office, too. I never saw that kid before."

The contradiction arises because Evidence 20 clearly states that Glen Elg (the victim) had a meeting with "The Tiger" (Furio Tigre) on December 3rd. However, in Testimony 2, Tigre denies ever seeing Glen Elg ("that kid") by claiming he was in his office and never saw Glen. These two statements directly contradict each other regarding Tigre's interaction with the victim on the day in question.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 2}
******************************
To find the contradiction between evidence and testimonies, we need to carefully examine the details of each.

First, let's summarize the key points from Furio Tigre's testimonies:

- Testimony 0: Furio Tigre claims he never met Glen Elg.
- Testimony 1: He mentions some guy with the name Glen Elg wanted to borrow cash from him.
- Testimony 2: Suggests he set up a meeting with Glen Elg at Tender Lender.
- Testimony 3: States he waited for Glen Elg, but he never showed up.
- Testimony 4: Claims he has never been to Tres Bien.

Now, let's identify any contradictions with the evidence provided:

1. **Glen's Calendar (Evidence 20):** It indicates there was a note on December 3rd, saying "Meet with The Tiger," which refers to Furio Tigre. This suggests Glen Elg had an appointment to meet him.

2. **Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2):** References an article stating the client was found guilty, implying a connection with past interactions.

The most significant contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 20. Furio Tigre claims he never met Glen Elg, yet Glen's calendar notes a meeting with "The Tiger" (Furio Tigre) on the day of the incident. This strongly indicates a contradiction between Furio Tigre's statement and the evidence.

**Conclusion:**

There is a clear contradiction between Furio Tigre’s claim (Testimony 0) that he never met Glen Elg and Glen’s Calendar (Evidence 20), which documents a planned meeting with "The Tiger".

******************************
To solve this, we will analyze the evidence and testimonies to identify a contradiction.

First, look at Evidence 12, "Crime Photo," which states "No one is sitting across from the victim."

Now, examine the testimonies. Testimony 1 by Tigre states, "When I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene." This suggests that Tigre was inside Tres Bien and could have seen the victim, yet given that the Crime Photo indicates the room was empty across from the victim at the time, this raises a contradiction if Tigre claims to have seen the murder scene firsthand from a specific angle.

Let's analyze further to be sure:
- Testimony 1 implies that Tigre claims to have observed the crime scene, but the photo evidence, showing nobody sitting across from the victim, would make it difficult for Tigre to have actually seen the scene in detail unless he was actually inside the café, which could contradict his implied location.

Therefore, Testimony 1 by Tigre, claiming to have seen the crime scene, contradicts Evidence 12, the crime scene photo which shows no one opposite the victim and obscured view.

```json
{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 1}
```
******************************
To determine which piece of evidence and testimony contradict each other, let's analyze the relevant details.

**Key Details:**

1. **Evidence 14: Victim's Lottery Ticket** - A winning ticket for half a million dollars was found during a body search of Maggey, suggesting Glen Elg had a way to pay his debt.

2. **Testimony 2 (from Tigre):** "So anyway, he tells me he's got no way to pay up." Tigre claims that Glen said he couldn't pay the debt.

**Contradiction:**

The contradiction lies in Tigre's testimony claiming that Glen Elg had "no way to pay up," while the evidence of a winning lottery ticket strongly suggests that Glen did indeed have the means to pay his debt.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 14 and Testimony 2.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 2}

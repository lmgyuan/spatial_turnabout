Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So, the task is to go through the given testimonies and evidences and find a pair where one directly contradicts the other. The answer should be in the JSON format at the end.

First, let me list out all the testimonies and the key points they mention. The testimonies are from Edgeworth, specifically Testimonies 0 to 6. 

Looking at Testimony 5: "A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream." Edgeworth is describing events during the DL-6 Incident, I believe. He says there was a single gunshot followed by a scream.

Now, looking at the evidences, let's see which ones relate to the number of gunshots or the murder weapon. 

Evidence 18 is the DL-6 Case File, which states that the murder weapon was fired twice. Then, Evidence 19 is the DL-6 Incident Photo showing a bullet hole in the door. Also, Evidence 21 is the DL-6 Bullet taken from Gregory Edgeworth's heart, which has ballistic markings. 

Wait, Testimony 5 says there was a single gunshot, but Evidence 18 mentions the murder weapon was fired twice. That seems contradictory. If the case file says the gun was fired twice, but Edgeworth's testimony only mentions hearing one gunshot, that's a discrepancy. 

Additionally, Evidence 10 is the Pistol, which was fired three times. But that might be related to the current case (Robert Hammond's murder), not the DL-6 Incident. Let me check. Evidence 10 is the murder weapon for the current case, fired 3 times. The DL-6 case's weapon is mentioned in Evidence 18 and 19. So, Testimony 5 is about the DL-6 Incident, which according to Evidence 18, the gun was fired twice. But Edgeworth's testimony says there was a single gunshot. That's a contradiction.

Therefore, Testimony 5 (single gunshot) contradicts Evidence 18 (murder weapon fired twice). So the pair would be Evidence 18 and Testimony 5.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 5 states, "A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream." This implies only one gunshot occurred during the DL-6 Incident. However, Evidence 18 (DL-6 Case File) explicitly states "the murder weapon was fired twice," directly contradicting the testimony's claim of a single gunshot.
{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 5}

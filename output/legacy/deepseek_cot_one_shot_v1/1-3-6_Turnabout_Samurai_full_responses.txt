Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user has provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The answer must be in the form of a JSON object specifying the evidence and testimony numbers, and it should be the last line with no other text after.

First, I'll start by understanding the given information. The characters include various people involved in the case, such as Maya Fey, Miles Edgeworth, Dick Gumshoe, Will Powers (the defendant), Security Lady, Jack Hammer (victim), and others. The evidences range from autopsy reports, photos, scripts, keys, to items like a steak plate and a camera. The testimonies are from Dee Vasquez, who is a producer at Global Studios.

The goal is to find a contradiction between one piece of evidence and one testimony. Let's go through the testimonies first:

Testimony 0: Vasquez says she entered the trailer a little before noon.
Testimony 1: The meeting started at 12:00 sharp and ended at 4:00.
Testimony 2: After the meeting, they went to Studio One for a rehearsal.
Testimony 3: She was fatigued, so Sal (Manella) took her.
Testimony 4: At 2:30 PM, they took a 15-minute break during the meeting.
Testimony 5: Sal and I ate T-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.

Now, looking at the evidences, I need to check if any of them conflict with these statements. Let's look at Evidence 16: Steak Plate, which was found in the employee area and has traces of sleeping pills and a large bone. The testimony mentions they ate steaks in front of the trailer, but the steak plate with the bone is found in the employee area. However, maybe that's not a direct contradiction. Let's check other evidences.

Evidence 5: Powers'(?) Photo taken at 2:00 PM showing him dragging one leg. The autopsy report (Evidence 3) states the time of death as 2:30 PM. If the Security Lady claims she saw Powers heading to the scene, but the photo at 2:00 PM shows him elsewhere, that might be a contradiction. However, the Security Lady is a different character; her testimony isn't listed here. The testimonies given here are all from Vasquez.

Wait, the testimonies provided are all from Vasquez. So maybe looking for contradictions in her statements against the evidence. Let's see:

Testimony 5: They ate steaks in front of the trailer. But Evidence 16 is the steak plate found in the employee area. If they ate in front of the trailer, why is the plate found in the employee area? That might be a contradiction. But perhaps they moved the plate? Not sure if that's solid enough.

Another angle: Testimony 1 says the meeting was from 12:00 to 4:00 PM. Testimony 4 mentions a 15-minute break at 2:30 PM. The murder time is 2:30 PM (Evidence 3). If Vasquez was in a meeting during that time, but there's evidence that she or someone else was elsewhere.

Looking at Evidence 18: Van used by Manella to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer. Wait, Testimony 2 says after the meeting (which ended at 4 PM), they went to Studio One. But the van is mentioned as used to drive her there after the meeting. However, the murder occurred at 2:30 PM. If during the meeting, there was a break at 2:30 PM (Testimony 4), perhaps that's when the murder happened. But how does that tie in with the evidence?

Wait, Evidence 11: Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. So if the path was blocked during that time, how could someone get to the scene? Unless they used another route. But if Vasquez's testimony says she was in a meeting until 4 PM, but the murder happened at 2:30 PM, and the path was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4 PM, that might mean the killer had to be there before 2:15 PM. But the time of death is 2:30 PM, so that's conflicting. However, I'm not sure which testimony contradicts this.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 5 where Vasquez says she and Sal ate steaks in front of the trailer. The Steak Plate (Evidence 16) is found in the employee area with traces of sleeping pills. If they ate in front of the trailer, the plate should be there, not in the employee area. So that's a contradiction. Vasquez claims they ate in front of the trailer, but the plate is found elsewhere. That would mean either she's lying about the location, or someone moved the plate. This seems like a direct contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 16.

Therefore, the answer should be {"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}.

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. We need to look through all the provided testimonies and evidence to spot inconsistencies.

First, let's review the characters, but maybe they're not as crucial here. The key is the evidence and testimonies. So, looking at the evidences, there's a lot. Let's list them out briefly:

Evidence 3: Autopsy Report says time of death is 10/15 at 2:30 PM, cause by a spear through the chest.
Evidence 5: Powers'(?) Photo taken at the gate on Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2, showing him dragging one leg.
Evidence 11: Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.
Evidence 15: Cody's Camera, a digital camera he carries but is still learning to use.

Testimonies from Vasquez (Testimony 0-7). Let's check each testimony against the evidence.

Looking at Testimony 3: Vasquez says that Oldbag (Security Lady) accused Powers, pointing at him saying "he did it!". But if we look at Evidence 5, the photo shows Powers at the gate at 2:00 PM, which is 30 minutes before the time of death (2:30 PM). However, if the path to the crime scene was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head from 2:15 PM onwards (Evidence 11), then how did Powers get to the scene after 2:15 PM? Because the photo shows him at the gate at 2:00 PM, but the murder happened at 2:30 PM. If the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, Powers would have had to be there before 2:15 PM, but the time of death is 2:30 PM. So maybe there's a contradiction here. Wait, but the photo is at 2:00 PM, and the path was blocked from 2:15 PM. So if Powers was at the gate at 2:00 PM, he could have gone through the path before it was blocked. But then the murder happened at 2:30 PM. So maybe that's possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 1: Vasquez says "The assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent." But Evidence 5 shows a photo of Powers at the gate at 2:00 PM, which would imply he was present on the premises around that time. If the meeting or whatever was happening when others were present, but Powers was absent, but the photo shows him there. Wait, maybe the timeline here. Let's check the testimonies again.

Testimony 0: Vasquez was with Sal and Oldbag when they found the body.
Testimony 1: The assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent.
Testimony 2: Vasquez called the police, then Powers showed up.

So according to Testimony 1, during the time when the body was found (after 2:30 PM, since time of death is 2:30 PM), Powers was absent. But Evidence 5 shows Powers at the gate at 2:00 PM. But maybe the photo is from earlier. If the murder happened at 2:30 PM, and the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, then if Powers was at the gate at 2:00 PM, he could have gone through the path before 2:15 PM. Then, if he was at the scene, he could have committed the murder at 2:30 PM. But according to Testimony 1, when the group (Vasquez, Sal, Oldbag, assistant) were present, Powers was absent. But if the murder happened at 2:30 PM, and they found the body after that, maybe Powers was absent at that time. However, Testimony 2 says that after Vasquez called the police, Powers showed up. So maybe Powers arrived after the body was found. But the photo at 2:00 PM shows him entering, then the path blocked at 2:15 PM. If the path was blocked, how did he get to the scene after 2:15 PM? So perhaps there's a contradiction here. If the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, and the murder happened at 2:30 PM, then the murderer must have been there before 2:15 PM. But if Powers was in the area at 2:00 PM, he could have been there before the path was blocked, and thus have access. However, Testimony 1 states that Powers was absent when the others were present (when they found the body). But if he was already there before the path was blocked, he could have been at the crime scene. Maybe the contradiction is that Vasquez claims Powers was absent, but the photo (Evidence 5) shows he was present at 2:00 PM, which could mean he was on the premises. Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Oldbag accusing Powers) and Evidence 11 (path blocked), making it impossible for Powers to be there. Wait, but if Powers was already inside before the path was blocked, then he could have been present. The key is the timing. Let's outline the timeline:

- 2:00 PM: Photo #2 shows Powers at the gate, dragging leg.
- 2:15 PM: Mr. Monkey's Head blocks the path until 4 PM.
- 2:30 PM: Time of death.

So if the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, and the murder was at 2:30 PM, the killer must have been already past the blocked path. So if Powers was there at 2:00 PM, he could have gone through before the blockage. However, the testimonies from Vasquez indicate that when they found the body (after 2:30 PM), Powers was absent and then showed up after the police were called. But if the path was blocked, how did Powers show up later? Unless he was already inside. But according to Testimony 2, Vasquez called the police, then Powers showed up. If the path was blocked, Powers couldn't have come in after 2:15 PM, unless there's another route. But the Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path. So if the path was blocked, and Powers arrived after 2:15 PM, he couldn't have gotten through. But the photo shows him at 2:00 PM, so he could have been inside before the blockage. Then he could have committed the murder at 2:30 PM and been present. However, Vasquez's testimonies suggest that during the time of the body discovery, Powers was absent and then showed up later, implying he came from outside. But if the path was blocked, he couldn't have come in. Therefore, there's a contradiction between Testimony 2 (Powers showed up after the police were called, implying he arrived after the path was blocked) and Evidence 11 (path blocked from 2:15 PM). So if the path was blocked, how did Powers get there after 2:15 PM? Unless there's another way, but the evidence doesn't mention that. Alternatively, the photo (Evidence 5) shows Powers entering at 2:00 PM, so he was already inside. Then, if he was inside, he could have been present at the crime scene. But Vasquez's testimony says he was absent when they found the body. Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 1 and Evidence 5. Testimony 1 says "Only Powers was absent," but Evidence 5 shows him present at 2:00 PM. If the group (Vasquez, Sal, Oldbag, assistant) were together when the body was found (after 2:30 PM), and Powers was absent during that time, but the photo shows him there at 2:00 PM, which is before the time of death. So maybe the photo is a red herring, but perhaps the contradiction is elsewhere. Another angle: Evidence 3 says death at 2:30 PM. Testimony 0: Vasquez, Sal, Oldbag found the body. Testimony 2: After calling police, Powers showed up. So if the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, and Powers showed up after 2:30 PM (when the body was found and police called), he couldn't have come through the blocked path. Unless there's another way. But Evidence 11 says the path was blocked. Therefore, Testimony 2 (Powers showed up after the police were called) contradicts Evidence 11 (path blocked from 2:15 PM), implying he couldn't have arrived after that time unless he was already there. But if he was already there (per Evidence 5's photo), then Testimony 2 saying he showed up later would be a contradiction, because he was already present. Alternatively, the testimony might be implying he arrived after the body was found, which would be impossible if the path was blocked. So the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Powers showed up after the police were called, implying he came from outside after 2:30 PM) and Evidence 11 (path blocked from 2:15 PM), making it impossible for him to come through. Thus, the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 11. Alternatively, maybe between Testimony 3 (Oldbag accusing Powers) and Evidence 5 (photo showing Powers with a dragged leg), which might indicate he couldn't have physically committed the murder. Wait, the murder weapon is a spear. If Powers had a leg injury, maybe he couldn't have used the spear effectively. But that's more of a logical deduction rather than a direct contradiction. The strongest contradiction seems to be between Testimony 2 (Powers arriving after the path was blocked) and Evidence 11 (path blocked), making it impossible. So the pair would be Evidence 11 and Testimony 2. But the answer must be one pair. Let's check the exact wording. Testimony 2: "I immediately called the police. Then Powers showed up." So after calling the police, Powers arrived. If the path was blocked since 2:15 PM, and the murder was at 2:30 PM, then Vasquez found the body after 2:30 PM, called the police, and then Powers arrived. But if the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, Powers couldn't have arrived after 2:15 PM. But according to Evidence 5, he was at the gate at 2:00 PM. So maybe he was already inside. Therefore, Testimony 2's claim that Powers "showed up" after the police were called (which would be after 2:30 PM) contradicts Evidence 11, because if the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, he couldn't have come through then. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Powers showing up after the police were called) and Evidence 11 (path blocked from 2:15 PM). So the answer should be {"evidence": 11, "testimony": 2}. But wait, the evidence numbers start from 0. Let me recount the evidences to confirm their indices.

Evidences listed are from 0 to 18. Evidence 11 is "Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path...". Testimony 2 is indeed Testimony 2. So the correct pair is Evidence 11 and Testimony 2.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 2 states that after Vasquez called the police, Powers showed up. However, Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head) indicates the path to the crime scene was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. The murder occurred at 2:30 PM (Evidence 3). If Powers "showed up" after the police were called (post-2:30 PM), he could not have traversed the blocked path. This contradicts Testimony 2, implying Powers couldn't have arrived after 2:15 PM unless already present, conflicting with the testimony's claim.
{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 2}

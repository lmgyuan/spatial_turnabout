Okay, let's tackle this. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through each testimony and cross-checking with the evidence.

First, the characters: Phoenix is the defense attorney, Mia is his deceased mentor, Maya is his assistant, Pearl is Maya's cousin, Adrian is involved with the exhibit, Gumshoe is the detective, Mask DeMasque is the thief, Luke Atmey is the detective, Ron DeLite claims to be Mask DeMasque, his wife Desiree, Larry is Phoenix's friend, Godot the prosecutor, and Kane Bullard is the victim found in his safe.

Now, the evidences. Evidence 3 is Ami Fey's Golden Statue, which moved the night of the crime. Evidence 5 is the calling card from Mask DeMasque, which mentions the "speckled urn". Evidence 15 is the autopsy report: Kane died at 1 AM on 10/12 from head trauma. Evidence 16 is a newspaper clipping showing Ron as a guard during the first heist. Evidence 20 says Ron's testimony claims that after the second heist, he was stealing due to blackmail. Evidence 10 is a blackmail letter from Bullard to Ron, telling him to come at 1 AM on 10/12 with $50,000 or give the red diamond. Evidence 12 is a key card found in Ron's wallet that opens the CEO office. Evidence 19 is the buzzer record showing it went off at 1:02 AM in the CEO's office. Evidence 15 says time of death is 1 AM.

Now, the testimonies are all from Atmey (Testimony 0-5). Let's look at each:

Testimony 0: Atmey received the request from Lordly Tailor 20 days ago. The calling card (Evidence 5) is addressed to Lordly Tailor's security, so that aligns.

Testimony 1: The urn was placed in a box and sent to the warehouse. Evidence 21 mentions the Urn Box with paint stains. Evidence 22 says the box has pink paint from when Adrian knocked over paint two weeks ago. So sending it to the warehouse would be before that? Maybe not a contradiction here.

Testimony 2: Atmey couldn't see the urn until the day of the crime. But Evidence 5's calling card mentions the speckled urn, which was part of the exhibit. If he sent the card 10 days before (Testimony 3), he must have known about the urn's presence before the crime. Wait, Testimony 3 says he sent the card 10 days beforehand, which would be October 2nd (since the crime is on the 12th). The calling card refers to the urn, but according to Testimony 2, he didn't see the urn until the day of the crime. But how could he mention the urn in the calling card if he hadn't seen it yet? That's a possible contradiction. The calling card (Evidence 5) specifically mentions the speckled urn, which he couldn't have known about if he hadn't seen it until the crime day. But maybe the urn's existence was public knowledge in the exhibit, so he didn't need to see it. Hmm.

Wait, Evidence 4 is the Sacred Urn, described as one of the treasures, but in the exhibit poster (Evidence 2), maybe it was advertised. So maybe Atmey knew the urn was part of the exhibit without seeing it. So that might not be a contradiction. Let's check other testimonies.

Testimony 4: Atmey handled security himself to ensure his crime would go smoothly. But Evidence 16's newspaper clipping shows that Ron was the guard during the first heist. Also, Evidence 20 says Ron was being blackmailed into stealing. If Atmey was handling security himself, maybe that's conflicting with Ron's involvement. But not directly evidence vs testimony.

Testimony 5: Atmey held the urn at 1 AM on October 12th. But Evidence 15 says the time of death was 1 AM. If Kane was killed at 1 AM, and the urn was moved (Evidence 3), but the Sacred Urn (Evidence 4) was supposed to be in the box. However, the murder weapon was the Shichishito (Evidence 6), which was used to hit Atmey. Wait, Evidence 6 says DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime with a blow to the head. But the autopsy report (Evidence 15) is about Kane Bullard's death. So perhaps Atmey's testimony about holding the urn at 1 AM might conflict with the timing of the murder. If Kane was killed at 1 AM, but Atmey was holding the urn at the same time, maybe that's impossible. But maybe they're in different locations. Alternatively, looking for a direct contradiction between testimony and evidence.

Wait, the key contradiction I see is Testimony 5: Atmey says he held the urn at 1 AM on October 12. However, Evidence 15 states that Kane Bullard's time of death was 1 AM on October 12. If Atmey was holding the urn at the same time, but the CEO (Kane) was killed at the same time, perhaps there's a contradiction in his alibi. But unless there's evidence that links Atmey to the murder, which is not clear here.

Alternatively, maybe the calling card (Evidence 5) mentions the speckled urn, but Evidence 4's Sacred Urn is described as "supposedly priceless, but has no monetary value" and looks like a plain pot. The calling card refers to the "speckled urn," but the actual urn is plain. That might be a contradiction if the calling card refers to a different urn. But Evidence 4 is the Sacred Urn, which is the one in the exhibit. If the calling card mentions the speckled urn, but the real one is plain, perhaps that's a discrepancy. However, maybe "speckled" is a nickname or there's a mistake. Not sure.

Another angle: Testimony 3 says Atmey sent the calling card 10 days before the crime (October 2nd), but the Urn Box (Evidence 21) has pink paint stains from when Adrian dropped it two weeks ago. If two weeks ago is 14 days before October 12, that would be September 28. The box was sent to the warehouse (Testimony 1) after the request from Lordly Tailor (20 days ago, which would be September 22). So the timeline could be: request received 20 days ago (Sept 22), urn box sent to warehouse (Testimony 1) after that, then Adrian dropped the box two weeks before the crime (Sept 28), which would be after it was sent to the warehouse. That seems possible. No contradiction here.

Wait, Testimony 1 says the urn was placed in a box and sent to the warehouse. But Evidence 21's Urn Box has paint stains from two weeks ago. If the box was sent to the warehouse before the paint incident (two weeks ago), then the paint stains would have occurred after it was in the warehouse. But how? Unless the warehouse is where Adrian was when she knocked over the paint. Maybe not a direct contradiction.

Looking back, the main contradiction I can think of is between Testimony 5 (Atmey holding the urn at 1 AM) and the time of death of Kane Bullard at 1 AM. If Atmey was holding the urn in the exhibit at the same time Kane was killed in his office, that's possible if they're separate locations. But maybe there's evidence that links the two events. Let's check Evidence 19: the buzzer in the CEO's office went off at 1:02 AM. The key card (Evidence 12) was used by Ron to access the CEO's office. The blackmail letter (Evidence 10) told Ron to come at 1 AM. So Ron was there around 1 AM. But the murder was at 1 AM. If Atmey was holding the urn at 1 AM, maybe he couldn't be in two places at once. But Atmey is the thief, not necessarily the murderer. The murder victim is Kane Bullard, who was blackmailing Ron. So perhaps Atmey's alibi of being at the exhibit stealing the urn at 1 AM contradicts something else.

Wait, Evidence 7: Camera Data shows the warehouse camera went off at 1 AM. So the theft at the warehouse (where the urn was) happened at 1 AM. Meanwhile, the murder in the CEO's office (Kane) also at 1 AM. If Atmey was at the warehouse stealing the urn at 1 AM, he couldn't be in the CEO's office killing Kane. But the murderer is someone else. However, the key card (Evidence 12) was found in Ron's wallet, implying Ron was there. The blackmail letter (Evidence 10) is from Bullard to Ron. So maybe Ron is the killer, and Atmey's testimony about being at the warehouse at 1 AM is supported by the camera data (Evidence 7). But where's the contradiction?

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is in Testimony 5 where Atmey says he held the urn at 1 AM, but Evidence 3 says the Golden Statue (which holds the Shichishito) moved that night. The Shichishito (Evidence 6) was used to knock out Atmey by DeMasque. If Atmey was holding the urn at 1 AM, but the statue moved, perhaps that's conflicting. But not sure.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 4: Atmey handled security himself. But Evidence 16's newspaper clipping shows Ron was a guard in the first heist. If Atmey handled security alone, but Ron was involved, maybe that's a contradiction. But Testimony 4 is about the current crime's security, not the first heist. So not a direct contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 20: Ron's Testimony says that from the second heist onward, he was stealing due to blackmail. The blackmail letter (Evidence 10) is from Bullard to Ron, dated October 12. So if Ron was being blackmailed into committing the heists, but Atmey is claiming to be the one behind the heists (Testimony 4 and 5), that's a contradiction. Because if Ron is Mask DeMasque (as per his confession), but Atmey is also claiming to be the thief. So perhaps Atmey's testimonies are lies, but where does the evidence contradict?

The key contradiction I think is in Testimony 3 and Evidence 5. Atmey says in Testimony 3: "I knew it was an extremely valuable treasure, so I sent my card 10 days beforehand." The calling card (Evidence 5) mentions the "speckled urn". But Evidence 4 describes the Sacred Urn as "supposedly priceless, but has no monetary value" and "looks like a plain old pot." If the urn isn't actually valuable, then Atmey's claim that he targeted it as a valuable treasure is contradicted by Evidence 4. So Testimony 3's assertion that the urn was extremely valuable contradicts Evidence 4's description that it has no monetary value. Thus, the evidence shows the urn isn't valuable, but the testimony says it is. That's a contradiction.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 3 states Atmey sent the calling card 10 days prior because he believed the urn was "extremely valuable." However, Evidence 4 (Sacred Urn) explicitly states the urn "has no monetary value" and looks like a plain pot, contradicting the premise of targeting it as a high-value treasure. Atmey's claim of valuing it conflicts with the evidence showing it isn't valuable.

Okay, let's try to figure out which testimony contradicts which evidence here. So, first, I need to go through each testimony and check against the evidence provided.

Looking at the testimonies by Atmey. Testimony 2 says that Kane Bullard wrote the blackmail letter sent to Ron DeLite. But let's check the evidence related to the blackmail letter. Evidence 10 is the Blackmail Letter, and its description states that it was written by Bullard. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, Evidence 10's description says "Found in Ron's room. Written by Bullard." So if Testimony 2 says that Bullard wrote the blackmail letter, then that actually matches Evidence 10. So that's not a contradiction. Hmm.

Testimony 1: Atmey claims that Kane Bullard decided to investigate Mask DeMasque and mistook who he was. But maybe there's evidence that contradicts this. Let's see. Evidence 16 is a newspaper clipping about Mask DeMasque's first heist, which mentions that the guard in the photo is Ron DeLite. If Bullard was investigating DeMasque and mistook Ron as the thief, but maybe the evidence shows that Ron actually was involved? Wait, but Evidence 20 says Ron's Testimony mentions that from the second heist, he was stealing due to blackmail letters. So maybe Bullard was blackmailing Ron into being DeMasque? So perhaps Atmey's Testimony 1 is saying that Bullard thought someone else was DeMasque, but actually, Ron is DeMasque. But that might not directly contradict. Hmm.

Wait, Testimony 0 by Atmey: "I, Luke Atmey, had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever." The victim is Kane Bullard. Is there evidence that Atmey had contact with Bullard? Evidence 6: Shichishito description says DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime with a blow to the head. Wait, that's during the crime, but the victim is Bullard. So maybe Atmey was at the crime scene? If Atmey was knocked out by DeMasque (Ron), then he was present during the crime where Bullard was killed. So Testimony 0 says he had no contact with the victim, but if he was present at the crime scene where the victim died, maybe there's a contradiction here. But the testimony says "no points of contact" with the victim. So if Atmey was at the crime scene when Bullard was killed, but Bullard died at 1 AM (Evidence 15: Autopsy Report says time of death 1 AM). If Atmey was knocked out by DeMasque during the crime, which occurred around that time, then Atmey was present where the victim was killed. But does that mean he had contact with the victim? Or just presence at the scene? The testimony says "no points of contact", so if there's evidence he was there, but no direct contact, maybe it's not a contradiction. Hmm.

Another angle: Testimony 5 says Ron killed Bullard. But Evidence 15 says cause of death is blunt trauma to the head. Evidence 6 mentions that DeMasque (who is Ron) knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head using the Shichishito. But the victim's cause of death is cerebral hemorrhaging from blunt trauma. If the Shichishito was used to hit Atmey, but the victim was killed with the same method, perhaps the murder weapon is the Shichishito. But if Ron is the one who attacked Atmey, then he had the Shichishito. So maybe Ron used it to kill Bullard. But how does that contradict a testimony?

Wait, Testimony 2 says Bullard wrote the blackmail letter. Evidence 10 confirms that. So no contradiction there.

Looking at Testimony 4: Atmey says the defendant (Ron) truly believes he is Mask DeMasque. But Evidence 8 (Desirée's Letter) is addressed to Ron. Maybe that's not a contradiction. But Evidence 16's newspaper clipping shows that Ron was the guard in the first heist. If Ron was being blackmailed into being DeMasque, maybe he's not the real one. But the testimonies might not directly contradict here.

Wait, Evidence 20: Ron's Testimony states that from the second heist onwards, he was directed by blackmail letters. So he was acting as DeMasque due to blackmail, implying that he is the one committing the thefts. But Atmey's Testimony 4 says the defendant (Ron) believes he is Mask DeMasque, which aligns with Ron's own testimony. So no contradiction.

Wait, perhaps Testimony 1 by Atmey says that Bullard mistook who DeMasque was. But Evidence 16's newspaper clipping shows that Ron was the guard in the first heist. If Bullard was investigating DeMasque and thought someone else was the thief, but the real DeMasque was Ron, that could mean Bullard's mistake. But how does that contradict evidence? Maybe Evidence 10 (Blackmail Letter) is written by Bullard to Ron, implying Bullard knew Ron's identity. So if Testimony 1 says Bullard mistook who DeMasque was, but Evidence 10 shows Bullard was blackmailing Ron (knowing he's DeMasque), then that's a contradiction. Because if Bullard wrote the blackmail letter to Ron, he must have known that Ron was DeMasque, so he didn't mistake his identity. Therefore, Testimony 1 claims Bullard mistook who DeMasque was, but Evidence 10 (blackmail letter by Bullard to Ron) implies that Bullard knew Ron was involved. So that's a contradiction between Testimony 1 and Evidence 10. Wait, but Evidence 10's blackmail letter says "If you don't want your true identity revealed to the world..." So Bullard was blackmailing Ron because he knew Ron's true identity as DeMasque. Therefore, Testimony 1's claim that Bullard "mistook who he was" (DeMasque's identity) is contradicted by Evidence 10, which shows Bullard knew Ron was DeMasque and was blackmailing him. So that's the contradiction: Testimony 1 says Bullard mistook DeMasque's identity, but Evidence 10 shows he knew it was Ron. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 1 and Evidence 10. Alternatively, maybe another pair.

Wait, another possibility: Testimony 0 by Atmey says he had no contact with the victim. But if he was at the crime scene when the victim was killed, perhaps he had contact. Let's check the evidence. Evidence 6 says that DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime with a blow to the back of the head. So during the crime (the murder of Bullard), DeMasque (Ron) attacked Atmey. So Atmey was present at the crime scene. The victim, Bullard, was killed at the same time (time of death 1 AM). So Atmey was present when Bullard was killed. But does that mean he had contact with the victim? The testimony says "no points of contact with the victim whatsoever". If Atmey was in the same location but didn't interact with Bullard, maybe that's possible. However, if there's evidence that Atmey was in contact with Bullard, then Testimony 0 would be contradicted. But I don't see such evidence. Evidence 6 just mentions Atmey was knocked out by DeMasque, not by Bullard.

So perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (Atmey says Bullard mistook DeMasque's identity) and Evidence 10 (Blackmail letter by Bullard to Ron, indicating he knew Ron's identity as DeMasque). So Testimony 1 is contradicted by Evidence 10.

Let's think step by step:
Atmey's Testimony 1 claims Kane Bullard mistakenly identified Mask DeMasque. However, Evidence 10 (Blackmail Letter) reveals Bullard wrote the letter to Ron DeLite, explicitly threatening to expose his "true identity," indicating Bullard knew Ron was DeMasque. This directly contradicts the claim that Bullard was mistaken about DeMasque's identity.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to find a contradiction between one piece of evidence and one testimony from the given list. I need to carefully go through each testimony and cross-reference them with the evidence to spot any inconsistencies.

First, let me list out all the testimonies and see what each person is claiming. The testimonies are all from Bikini. 

Testimony 0: Bikini says she was helping an acolyte with training in the Inner Temple that night but... (the testimony might be interrupted here).
Testimony 1: She mentions her back acts up violently.
Testimony 2: She left Iris to help the acolyte and returned to Hazakura Temple.
Testimony 3: She states Iris came to the Inner Temple dressed as she was at dinner.
Testimony 4: Bikini needed a long soak because there's no bath at the Inner Temple.
Testimony 5: After finishing her soak, she saw something as she was heading back.

Now, looking at the evidences. Let's see if any of them conflict with these statements.

Evidence 12 is Iris's Testimony, which says she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and stayed in her room until the murder was discovered. Wait, if Iris was in her room, how does that align with Bikini's Testimony 3 where Bikini claims Iris came to the Inner Temple? That seems contradictory. According to Iris's own testimony (Evidence 12), she was in her room, but Bikini says Iris was at the Inner Temple. That's a direct contradiction.

But I need to confirm the timeline. The murder occurred between 10-11 PM (Evidence 11: Elise's Autopsy Report). Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room from 10 PM onwards. If Bikini claims Iris was at the Inner Temple after 10 PM, then that's a contradiction. So Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) contradicts Testimony 3 from Bikini.

Alternatively, maybe another contradiction. Let's check others. 

Evidence 7: Weather Data shows that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. The snow stopped around 10:50 PM. Testimony 5 from Bikini says she saw something after finishing her soak. If the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45, but Bikini's movements might relate to that time. But I don't see a direct contradiction here.

Another possibility: Evidence 16 is the Crystal Sphere found near Dusky Bridge with blood, which came from the victim's staff. The staff (Evidence 9) had no crystal sphere, so the sphere being found elsewhere might indicate movement. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Wait, Testimony 3 from Bikini says Iris came to the Inner Temple dressed as at dinner. But Evidence 6 is Iris's Hood, which she wears at all times. If Iris was in her room (Evidence 12), then Bikini's testimony about seeing her in the Inner Temple would be a lie. So the contradiction is between Bikini's Testimony 3 (saying Iris was at the Inner Temple) and Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) stating she was in her room. However, the user's question specifies that the contradiction should be between evidence and testimony, not between two testimonies. So I need to check if any evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

Wait, Evidence 12 is Iris's Testimony as evidence. So if Bikini's Testimony 3 claims Iris was at the Inner Temple, but Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) says she was in her room, that's a contradiction between Testimony 3 and Evidence 12. So the pair would be Testimony 3 (Bikini) vs Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony). 

Alternatively, maybe another point. Let's check Testimony 2 from Bikini: she left Iris to help the acolyte and returned to Hazakura Temple. If Iris was supposed to help the acolyte, but according to Iris's own testimony, she was in her room, that's another contradiction. But again, this would be between two testimonies unless Iris's testimony is presented as evidence. Since Evidence 12 is Iris's Testimony, which is part of the evidence, that's the key here. 

Therefore, the contradiction is between Bikini's Testimony 3 (claiming Iris was at the Inner Temple) and Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony stating she was in her room all night after 10 PM). That's a direct conflict. So the correct pair is evidence 12 and testimony 3.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 3 from Bikini states that "Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner." However, Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) indicates Iris "was in her room until the murder was discovered." This directly contradicts Bikini's claim that Iris was present at the Inner Temple after 10 PM.
{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The task is to find a contradiction between one piece of evidence and one testimony. Let's start by going through the testimonies and cross-referencing them with the evidence provided.

First, looking at the testimonies. The testimonies are all given by Bikini. Let me list them out:

Testimony 0: Bikini finished her bath around 11 PM and was returning to the Inner Temple.
Testimony 1: While walking back, she heard a noise from the courtyard and looked.
Testimony 2: She claims she saw Iris with the sword (Shichishito), implicating Iris in the murder.
Testimony 3: She mentions that Iris wasn't wearing her hood at the time.
Testimony 4: States that Elise was staying in a corner room facing the courtyard.
Testimony 5: Claims the stabbing happened after Elise was pushed out the window.

Now, let's check the evidence to see if any contradicts these statements.

Evidence 12: Iris's Testimony says she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and stayed in her room until the murder was discovered. If Iris was in her room, how could Bikini have seen her in the courtyard?

But wait, Bikini's Testimony 2 says she saw Iris in the courtyard. If Iris's own testimony (Evidence 12) states she was in her room, that's a direct contradiction. So Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) contradicts Testimony 2 from Bikini.

Wait, but let's verify other possibilities. Another angle: Elise's Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) says the time of death was between 10-11 PM, cause was a stab in the back, and the body fell 10 ft after death. Bikini's Testimony 5 says the stabbing occurred after Elise was pushed out the window. However, the autopsy report says the cause was blood loss from the stab wound, and the body fell after death. So if she was stabbed before falling, that might align unless the testimony is suggesting the stabbing happened post-fall. But the autopsy states the stab caused death, so the stabbing must have occurred before the fall. So Bikini's Testimony 5 might be conflicting here. But the autopsy doesn't explicitly state the order of events, just that the body fell after death. So maybe that's not a direct contradiction.

Another possible contradiction: Evidence 7 (Weather Data) mentions that there was lightning at 10:45 PM. Bikini's Testimony 0 says she finished her bath around 11 PM. But the weather data shows that lightning stopped around 11 PM. If she was outside around 11, maybe there's a timing issue, but the times are approximate. Not sure if that's a direct contradiction.

Looking back at the main contradiction: Bikini claims to have seen Iris in the courtyard (Testimony 2), but Iris's own testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room the entire time after 10 PM. Therefore, these two statements can't both be true. So the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 12.

Wait, but the question says to pick one pair of evidence and testimony. So which evidence contradicts which testimony. In this case, Evidence 12 is Iris's Testimony, which contradicts Bikini's Testimony 2. But the user wants an evidence and a testimony that contradict each other. So the evidence would be 12 (Iris's Testimony) and the testimony would be 2 (Bikini's claim). But wait, Evidence 12 is a written testimony, and Testimony 2 is Bikini's verbal account. The contradiction is between two testimonies, but the user asks for evidence and testimony.

Wait, the evidence includes Iris's Testimony as Evidence 12, which is a written statement. So if Bikini's Testimony 2 says she saw Iris in the courtyard, but Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) says she was in her room, that's a direct contradiction. Therefore, the evidence is 12 and the testimony is 2.

Let's think step by step:
Bikini's Testimony 2 claims she saw Iris with the murder weapon in the courtyard. However, Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) states she was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. These two cannot both be true, directly contradicting each other.
{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 2}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair, so I have to look through all the testimonies and evidences to find a direct contradiction.

First, let's list out the testimonies. The person for all testimonies here is Bikini. Testimony 5 says, "And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!" So Bikini claims she saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise in the back. 

Now, looking at the evidence. Evidence 11 is Elise's Autopsy Report. The cause of death is "loss of blood from stab in back." That seems consistent with Testimony 5. Wait, but maybe another evidence contradicts another testimony. Let me check other parts.

Wait, Testimony 2 says, "I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out." So Bikini saw the blade being pulled out. However, Evidence 10 is the Shichishito, which is described as the apparent murder weapon but then says "Had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but is not the murder weapon." So the actual murder weapon isn't the Shichishito. But how does that contradict a testimony?

Wait, Testimony 5 says the stabbing was through the back, which matches the autopsy report. But maybe another testimony. Let's look at Testimony 0: "When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place." So if the sword was already in place, but the autopsy says the stab was in the back. Wait, the Shichishito is a sword, but the autopsy says the cause was a stab in the back. If the sword was already in place, maybe that's conflicting with the act of stabbing. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me check Evidence 10 again. It's the Shichishito, which is the apparent murder weapon but it's stated that it's not the actual murder weapon. The real murder weapon might be the dagger (Evidence 19) but the blood doesn't match. Alternatively, the victim's staff (Evidence 9) has a hidden sword. The victim's staff has a sword inside, but the Shichishito is the one with fingerprints but not the murder weapon. 

Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the cause was a stab in the back, and the body fell 10 ft after death. The testimony 5 says Bikini saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise through the back. So that's consistent. 

Looking at Testimony 2 again: "the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out." If the blade was drawn out, but the Shichishito (Evidence 10) is not the murder weapon, perhaps the actual murder weapon was the dagger (Evidence 19), but its blood doesn't match. Alternatively, the staff's hidden sword. Wait, Evidence 9: Victim's Staff says it has a sword hidden inside, but no crystal sphere. Also, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) has blood on it and came from the staff. 

Wait, maybe the contradiction is in Testimony 5 claiming that the stabbing was through the back, but the autopsy report (Evidence 11) also says the same. So that's not a contradiction. Let's check other testimonies.

Testimony 1: "Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise." But Testimony 5 says she did see the stabbing. That's a contradiction within Bikini's testimonies, but the question asks for evidence vs testimony, not between testimonies.

Wait, Testimony 0 says "When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place." If the sword (Shichishito) was already in place, but Evidence 10 says that Shichishito is not the murder weapon. So if Bikini saw the sword already in place (Shichishito), but it's not the murder weapon, then the real murder weapon was something else, which could be the dagger or the staff's hidden sword.

But how does that contradict? Maybe if the testimony says the sword was already in place (implying it was the murder weapon), but the evidence says that sword isn't the murder weapon. So Testimony 0 (saying the sword was there) and Evidence 10 (saying it's not the murder weapon) could contradict if the testimony implies that the sword was used. However, Testimony 0 doesn't explicitly state that the sword was the murder weapon, just that it was in place. Maybe there's a better contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says Mystic Ami stabbed Elise through the back. The autopsy report (Evidence 11) confirms the stab was in the back, so no contradiction there. 

Looking at Evidence 7: Weather Data. It mentions lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. The autopsy time is 10-11 PM. Testimony 12 (Iris's Testimony) says she was in her room from 10 PM. Not sure.

Wait, let's check Testimony 5 again. Bikini says she saw Mystic Ami stab Elise through the back. But Evidence 10 (Shichishito) has the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints, but is not the murder weapon. If the Shichishito isn't the murder weapon, then the real weapon must be something else. But Bikini's testimony says the stabbing was done with a sword (since she saw the blade), but the actual murder weapon might be a different one. However, Evidence 9's staff has a hidden sword. If the staff's sword was the murder weapon, but Bikini saw the Shichishito (Evidence 10) being used, which is not the actual weapon, that could be a contradiction. 

Wait, but Testimony 5 says the stabbing was through the back. The autopsy report confirms that. The Shichishito is a sword with blood, but not the murder weapon. So maybe the real weapon is the dagger (Evidence 19), but its blood doesn't match. Alternatively, the staff's hidden sword. If Bikini's testimony says the murder weapon was the Shichishito, but the evidence says it's not, then that's a contradiction. However, Testimony 5 doesn't specify the weapon, just the act of stabbing. The contradiction could be in Testimony 0, where she saw the sword already in place (Shichishito), but Evidence 10 says it's not the murder weapon, implying that the sword wasn't the actual weapon used. So Testimony 0 might conflict with Evidence 10.

Alternatively, Testimony 2 where she saw the blade being drawn out. If the blade was the Shichishito (which is not the murder weapon), but the actual murder was done with another weapon, that could be a contradiction. 

Wait, but the problem is to find a testimony and evidence that directly contradict each other. Let's re-express Evidence 10: "Had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but is not the murder weapon." So the Shichishito was present, had the victim's blood, but the actual cause of death was from another weapon. So if a testimony claims that the Shichishito was used to stab the victim, that would contradict. However, Testimony 5 says the stabbing was through the back with a blade. The autopsy report says stab in the back. The Shichishito has the victim's blood, so perhaps it was used, but the evidence says it's not the murder weapon. So there's a contradiction here. If Bikini's Testimony 5 says that the stabbing was done with the Shichishito (as she saw the blade), but the evidence says it's not the murder weapon, that would contradict. But the testimony doesn't specify the weapon, only the act. 

Alternatively, Testimony 2: "I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out." If this blade is the Shichishito, which is not the murder weapon, but the actual murder weapon was something else, that would contradict. But how do we know it's the Shichishito? Maybe the Shichishito is the sword, but the real murder weapon is the dagger. However, the dagger's blood doesn't match. Then the real murder weapon is the hidden sword in the staff (Evidence 9). If Bikini's testimony 2 refers to the Shichishito being drawn out, but the real murder weapon is the staff's sword, that's a contradiction. But the problem is to find a direct contradiction between a testimony and evidence.

Alternatively, Testimony 0: "When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place." If the sword (Shichishito) was already in place, but the murder was committed with another weapon, which would mean the Shichishito wasn't used, but it has the victim's blood. That might not directly contradict unless the testimony implies that the sword was the murder weapon. But the testimony just says the sword was there, not that it was used.

Wait, Evidence 10 says the Shichishito had the victim's blood but is not the murder weapon. So if the blood is from the victim, but it's not the murder weapon, that suggests the Shichishito was present but didn't cause the fatal wound. However, the autopsy says the fatal wound was a stab in the back. If the Shichishito was used to stab, but the fatal wound was from another weapon, that could be a contradiction. But how does this connect to a testimony?

Wait, Testimony 5 says Bikini saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise through the back. If that was the fatal wound, then the murder weapon should be the one that caused the stab in the back. But the Shichishito (Evidence 10) is not the murder weapon. So if Bikini's Testimony 5 says she saw the stabbing with a sword (Shichishito), but Evidence 10 says it's not the murder weapon, then there's a contradiction. However, the testimony doesn't specify the weapon. Unless the Shichishito is the only sword present, but the real weapon is the staff's hidden sword. Then the testimony might be incorrect about which weapon was used. But how does that directly contradict?

Alternatively, the real murder weapon is the dagger (Evidence 19), but the blood doesn't match. So maybe the murder was with the staff's hidden sword. Then, if Bikini's testimony says she saw a stabbing with a sword (Shichishito), but that's not the murder weapon, that's a contradiction. But how is that reflected in the evidence? The Shichishito isn't the murder weapon, but the testimony says the stabbing was done with a blade (could be Shichishito). So that's a contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 10. Wait, but Evidence 10 says it's not the murder weapon despite having blood. So if the testimony claims the stabbing was with the Shichishito, but evidence says it's not the weapon, that's a contradiction. But Testimony 5 doesn't specify the weapon. Unless Bikini's Testimony 2 or 5 implies the use of Shichishito. Hmm.

Alternatively, look at Testimony 5: "Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!" The autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the cause was a stab in the back, which matches. No contradiction there. 

Wait, Evidence 16: Crystal Sphere from the staff, which has blood. The staff (Evidence 9) had a hidden sword, but no crystal sphere. So the sphere was found near Dusky Bridge with blood. If the sphere was part of the staff, and during the murder the sphere came off, that could be related. But how does that contradict a testimony?

Alternatively, let's check Testimony 12: Iris's Testimony (which is Evidence 12) says she was in her room from 10 PM. But the Weather Data (Evidence 7) says lightning struck the bridge at 10:45. If Iris's alibi is that she was in her room, but maybe someone else was on the bridge. Not directly related to the murder weapon.

Wait, perhaps Testimony 0: Bikini says the sword was already in place. If the murder weapon was the hidden sword in the staff, then the Shichishito (the sword in place) wasn't used. But since Shichishito has the victim's blood, that suggests it was used. But Evidence 10 says it's not the murder weapon. So the blood on Shichishito is from the victim but didn't cause the fatal wound. That could imply that the Shichishito was used to inflict a non-fatal wound, but the fatal one was from another weapon. If Bikini's Testimony 0 says the sword was already in place (Shichishito), but Evidence 10 says it's not the murder weapon, then perhaps the real murder weapon was used after the sword was in place. But how does that contradict?

Alternatively, Testimony 2 says Bikini saw the blade being drawn out. If that blade was the Shichishito, but it's not the murder weapon, then that's a contradiction because the Shichishito wasn't the murder weapon. But if the Shichishito was drawn out after the murder, then perhaps the real murder was committed with another weapon. But how does that directly contradict?

Alternatively, Evidence 11 (autopsy) says the body fell 10 ft after death. If Bikini saw the stabbing in the courtyard (Crime Photo 13), but the body fell 10 ft, maybe that's a contradiction in location. But not sure.

Hmm, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (seeing the stabbing) and Evidence 11's note that the body fell 10 ft after death. If Bikini saw the stabbing happen, but the body fell after death (implying it was moved or fell from a height), then perhaps the stabbing didn't happen where the body was found. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the body fell 10 ft after death. So after Elise was killed, her body fell from a height. If Bikini's Testimony 5 says she saw the stabbing occur, but the body was found in a place that required falling 10 ft, maybe the stabbing happened elsewhere. For example, if the stabbing occurred on the Dusky Bridge (which might be elevated), and the body fell 10 ft into the courtyard. But how does that contradict? Bikini could have witnessed the stabbing on the bridge, and then the body fell into the courtyard. That's possible, but not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says Bikini saw the stabbing, but Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room. If Iris is the one who did it, but that's a character contradiction, not evidence-testimony.

Wait, let's look at Testimony 5 again: Bikini says she saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise. However, if Mystic Ami is someone else, maybe the real killer is someone else. But how does that relate to evidence?

Alternatively, let's check the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16). It has blood on it and came from the victim's staff. The staff (Evidence 9) no longer has the sphere. If the sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, but the murder occurred in the courtyard, perhaps the sphere was part of the murder. But I don't see a direct contradiction with a testimony.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 2 says Bikini saw the blade being drawn out smoothly. If the murder weapon was the Shichishito, which has a jagged seven-branched design (Evidence 10), drawing it out smoothly would be difficult because of the jagged edges. So if the Shichishito is described as a jagged sword, and Bikini says the blade was smoothly drawn out, that would contradict. Because a jagged sword would not come out smoothly. So Testimony 2 (smoothly drawn out) vs Evidence 10 (jagged sword). That's a possible contradiction.

Evidence 10 says the Shichishito is a "seven-branched, jagged sword." If you stab someone with a jagged sword and then try to pull it out smoothly, the jagged edges would cause resistance, making it difficult to pull out smoothly. So Testimony 2's claim of the blade being smoothly drawn out contradicts the nature of the Shichishito as a jagged sword. But Evidence 10 also states that the Shichishito is not the murder weapon, so maybe the actual murder weapon was a smooth blade. But if Bikini's testimony refers to the Shichishito (since it's the one with blood and prints), but the sword's jagged nature makes the smooth withdrawal impossible, that's a contradiction.

So, Testimony 2 (smoothly drawn out) contradicts Evidence 10 (jagged sword not being the murder weapon). Wait, but if the Shichishito isn't the murder weapon, then maybe the murder weapon is a smooth blade (like the staff's hidden sword). So Testimony 2 describes the murder weapon as being smoothly drawn, which would match a smooth blade, but the Shichishito, which is jagged and not the murder weapon, can't be smoothly drawn. However, the testimony doesn't specify which blade. So if the testimony refers to the actual murder weapon (which is smooth), there's no contradiction. But if the testimony is referring to the Shichishito (which is jagged), then the smooth withdrawal contradicts. 

But since the Shichishito isn't the murder weapon, perhaps the testimony refers to the actual murder weapon, which is a smooth blade. Therefore, no contradiction. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, Evidence 10 states that the Shichishito has the suspect's fingerprints, but it's not the murder weapon. So if Bikini's testimony says she saw the suspect (Mystic Ami) using the Shichishito to stab, but the evidence says it's not the murder weapon, that's a contradiction. However, the testimony doesn't mention the Shichishito by name. Unless Mystic Ami is the suspect, and the Shichishito has their fingerprints. But the evidence says it's not the murder weapon. So if the suspect used the Shichishito to stab, but the murder was caused by another weapon, that's a contradiction. But how do we know? The autopsy says the cause was the stab in the back. If the Shichishito was used but didn't cause death, then another weapon did. But that's possible. However, the evidence says the Shichishito is not the murder weapon despite having the victim's blood. So maybe the fatal wound was from a different weapon. But Bikini's testimony claims the stabbing she saw was the fatal one, which would mean the weapon used in her testimony is the murder weapon, but the evidence says otherwise. So Testimony 5 (seeing the stabbing) and Evidence 10 (Shichishito not the murder weapon) could be a contradiction if the stabbing she saw was with the Shichishito.

But the testimony doesn't specify the weapon. If the Shichishito was at the scene (Testimony 0) and had the suspect's prints, but isn't the murder weapon, then the real murder weapon is something else. If Bikini's Testimony 5 says she saw the stabbing, but the real murder weapon is different, perhaps that's a contradiction. But how to link it?

Alternatively, let's consider Testimony 5: Bikini claims she saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise through the back. However, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) states the cause of death was a stab in the back, which matches. But the murder weapon according to the autopsy would be whatever caused that wound. If the Shichishito isn't the murder weapon, but the staff's hidden sword is, then Bikini's testimony is incorrect about the perpetrator. But that's a character contradiction, not evidence vs testimony.

Wait, Evidence 9: Victim's Staff has a hidden sword. The Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was part of the staff and found near the bridge. If the staff's sword was used, and the Shichishito was a decoy, then Bikini's testimony about seeing the stabbing with the Shichishito would be wrong. But the testimony doesn't mention the weapon, just the act. So no direct contradiction.

Hmm, this is challenging. Let's think again. The answer from the previous example was when a testimony said "I never touched the murder weapon" but the evidence had their prints on it. Similarly, maybe here a testimony claims something that's contradicted by evidence.

Testimony 5: "Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!" If Mystic Ami is the suspect, and the Shichishito (Evidence 10) has the suspect's fingerprints, but it's not the murder weapon, then the suspect's prints being on the Shichishito doesn't mean they used it for the murder. But if the testimony says they used it, but the evidence says it's not the murder weapon, that's a contradiction. But the testimony doesn't mention the weapon, just the act. So perhaps another testimony.

Looking back at Testimony 2: "I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out." If the blade is the Shichishito (jagged), then drawing it smoothly is impossible. But if the actual murder weapon is a smooth blade (like the staff's hidden sword), then no contradiction. So if Testimony 2 refers to the Shichishito, which is jagged, then the testimony contradicts the evidence. But the evidence says the Shichishito isn't the murder weapon. So if the testimony is about the Shichishito, but it's not the murder weapon, that's a contradiction. Because the testimony would be describing an action with a weapon that wasn't used. Alternatively, the testimony is about the actual murder weapon (which is smooth), but the evidence about the Shichishito is unrelated. 

This is tricky. Let me consider another angle. Evidence 7 (Weather Data) mentions lightning at 10:45 PM. The murder time is between 10-11 PM. If a testimony places someone outside during the lightning, but the weather data shows lightning, but that's not directly contradicting unless someone's testimony says there was no lightning. 

Alternatively, Testimony 12 (Iris's Testimony, which is Evidence 12) says she was in her room from 10 PM. If the murder occurred in the courtyard and required someone to be outside, but Iris's testimony says she was in her room, that's not directly a contradiction unless there's evidence she was elsewhere. But the user is asking for evidence-testimony contradiction, not testimony-testimony.

Wait, going back to Testimony 2 and Evidence 10. Testimony 2 says the blade was smoothly drawn out. If the blade was the Shichishito (Evidence 10: seven-branched, jagged), then it's impossible to smoothly draw it out. Therefore, Testimony 2's description of the blade being smoothly drawn out contradicts the nature of the Shichishito as a jagged sword. But Evidence 10 says the Shichishito isn't the murder weapon, so the actual murder weapon must be a smooth sword (like the staff's hidden sword). Therefore, Testimony 2's description matches the actual murder weapon (smooth), and the Shichishito is a red herring. So no contradiction.

But if the testimony refers to the Shichishito, then there's a contradiction. However, there's no evidence linking Testimony 2 to the Shichishito. The testimony just mentions a blade.

So perhaps another approach: The murder weapon is the staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9), which is a smooth blade. The Shichishito (jagged) is not the murder weapon but has the suspect's prints. Bikini's Testimony 2 describes a smooth blade being drawn out, which matches the staff's sword. No contradiction here. 

Then maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let me check Testimony 5 again. Bikini says she saw Mystic Ami stab Elise through the back. The autopsy report confirms the stab was in the back. If the murder weapon is the staff's sword, then the testimony is correct. But perhaps another evidence contradicts the testimony's timing.

Evidence 7: Weather data says snow stopped around 10:50 PM, lightning ended around 11 PM. The autopsy time is 10-11 PM. If the murder happened during the lightning, which struck at 10:45 PM, and the testimony says Bikini was present then, but there's a conflict with the weather. Not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 4: Bikini fainted, and when she awoke, she saw the stabbing (Testimony 5). The timing of the lightning (10:45 PM) and the murder time (10-11 PM) could align. Not directly a contradiction.

Hmm. Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 16. Evidence 16 is the Crystal Sphere from the staff, found near Dusky Bridge with blood. If the murder happened in the courtyard (Crime Photo 13), then the sphere being on the bridge suggests something else. But how does that contradict the testimony? Bikini says she saw the stabbing in the courtyard, but the sphere is found on the bridge. Maybe the murder involved the staff's crystal sphere being broken there, implying the murder happened elsewhere. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, let's consider Evidence 10 again: Shichishito has the suspect's fingerprints but isn't the murder weapon. If Testimony 5 claims the suspect used the Shichishito to stab Elise, but Evidence 10 says it's not the murder weapon, then there's a contradiction. However, the testimony doesn't specify the weapon. So unless the testimony implies the Shichishito was used, but it's not, there's no direct contradiction.

Wait, but the Shichishito is described as the apparent murder weapon. If Bikini's testimony makes it appear that the Shichishito was used, but the evidence says it's not, then that's a contradiction. But the testimony doesn't explicitly mention the Shichishito. 

Maybe the key contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 9. Evidence 9 says the victim's staff has a hidden sword, and the crystal sphere (Evidence 16) came from it. If the murder was committed with the staff's sword, then Bikini's Testimony 5 about seeing Mystic Ami stabbing with a different weapon (Shichishito) is contradicted. But since the testimony doesn't specify the weapon, this isn't direct.

Alternatively, if the victim's staff (Evidence 9) has a hidden sword, and the murder weapon was that sword, then the Shichishito (Evidence 10) having the victim's blood is a contradiction because the real murder weapon is the staff's sword. But that's a contradiction between evidences, not evidence and testimony.

I'm struggling a bit here. Let's try to think of the most obvious contradiction. In the previous example, it was a testimony denying touching the murder weapon versus evidence showing prints. Here, the similar case would be if a testimony claims not to have touched the murder weapon, but evidence shows prints. But looking at the testimonies, none of them are from the suspect denying touching the weapon. The testimonies are all from Bikini.

Wait, Bikini's Testimony 5 says she saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise. If Mystic Ami's fingerprints are on the Shichishito (Evidence 10), but the Shichishito isn't the murder weapon, then there's a contradiction if the testimony implies that the Shichishito was used. But since the Shichishito isn't the murder weapon, the real weapon must be another. So if the testimony says the stabbing was done with the Shichishito, but evidence says it's not the murder weapon, that's a contradiction. However, the testimony doesn't specify the weapon. So unless there's another testimony that does.

Wait, Testimony 0: "When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place." The sword here is likely the Shichishito. If the sword was already in place (implying it was used earlier), but the murder weapon is something else (staff's sword), then there's no contradiction. Unless the sword being in place means it was the murder weapon, but evidence says it's not. So Testimony 0's statement that the sword was in place (possibly implying it was used) contradicts Evidence 10's assertion that it's not the murder weapon. That could be the contradiction. For example, if the sword was in place at the scene (Testimony 0), suggesting it was used, but Evidence 10 says it's not the murder weapon. Therefore, the presence of the sword at the scene with victim's blood and suspect's prints implies it was used, but the evidence denies it. So Testimony 0 and Evidence 10 contradict.

Alternatively, Testimony 2's description of the blade being smoothly drawn out contradicts Evidence 10's description of the Shichishito as jagged. If the testimony refers to the Shichishito, then the smooth drawing contradicts its jagged nature. But Evidence 10 says it's not the murder weapon, so maybe the testimony refers to the real murder weapon (smooth), and thus no contradiction. But how do we know which blade the testimony refers to?

Given the options, the most likely contradiction is between Testimony 2 (smoothly drawn blade) and Evidence 10 (jagged sword). Because a jagged sword cannot be smoothly drawn out. Therefore, if the testimony refers to the Shichishito, which is jagged, that's a contradiction. But since Evidence 10 says the Shichishito is not the murder weapon, maybe the real murder weapon is smooth. Hence, the testimony is accurate about the real weapon, and there's no contradiction. 

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 10. If Testimony 5 says Mystic Ami did the stabbing, and the Shichishito has their prints but isn't the murder weapon, implying the real killer used another weapon. But how does that contradict?

Another possibility: Evidence 11 says the body fell 10 ft after death. If the murder happened in a location where a fall is impossible, but the body was found after a fall, that contradicts a testimony placing the murder elsewhere. But Bikini's testimonies don't specify the location beyond the scene.

Given all this, the most plausible contradiction is between Testimony 2 (smoothly drawn blade) and Evidence 10 (Shichishito's jagged design). Since a jagged sword can't be smoothly drawn out, Testimony 2's statement contradicts the nature of the Shichishito, which is the sword in question. However, Evidence 10 states the Shichishito isn't the murder weapon, so maybe the testimony refers to the actual murder weapon, which is smooth. Therefore, no contradiction.

Alternatively, if the testimony is about the Shichishito (which has blood and prints), then the contradiction exists. But the evidence says it's not the murder weapon, so the testimony must be mistaken. But how is that a direct contradiction?

I think I'm going in circles here. The answer likely involves Testimony 2 and Evidence 10. Because Testimony 2 describes a blade being smoothly drawn out, but the Shichishito (Evidence 10) is jagged and thus can't be smoothly drawn. Therefore, if the testimony refers to the Shichishito, that's a contradiction. But the evidence says it's not the murder weapon, so the real weapon could be smooth, making the testimony correct. But the presence of the Shichishito with blood and prints implies it was used. So if the testimony is about the Shichishito, then the contradiction exists. Therefore, the answer is {"evidence": 10, "testimony": 2}.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 2 states that Bikini saw the blade being "smoothly drawn out." Evidence 10 describes the Shichishito as a jagged, seven-branched sword. A jagged blade would resist smooth extraction, contradicting the testimony's claim. However, Evidence 10 clarifies the Shichishito isn't the murder weapon. If Testimony 2 refers to the Shichishito (which has the suspect's prints and victim's blood), the contradiction arises as its jagged nature makes smooth withdrawal implausible. This implies the testimony inaccurately describes the Shichishito's use, conflicting with its physical attributes.
{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 2}
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The previous answer looked at the murder weapon and fingerprints, so maybe a similar approach here.

First, list out the testimonies and evidences. Let's start with the testimonies. Bikini has six testimonies here (0-5). Let's check each one against the evidence.

Testimony 0: Bikini says she saw the murder around 11 PM. Evidence 11 is the autopsy report stating the time of death as between 10-11 PM. But that's a range, so 11 PM is within that. Not a direct contradiction here. Wait, but the weather data (Evidence 7) mentions that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. The murder happened when Elise was stabbed, and the body fell 10 ft after death. The autopsy time is 10-11 PM. If Bikini claims to have seen the murder at 11 PM, but the lightning strike was at 10:45, maybe there's a timeline issue here. Also, the fire from the lightning started and lasted 30 minutes. So if the fire started around 10:45, the fire would be out by 11:15. But if Bikini saw the murder at 11 PM, maybe during the fire? Not sure. Not a direct contradiction yet.

Testimony 1: Bikini went to the Main Gate after reporting. Evidence 14 shows tracks leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If Bikini went to the Main Gate and saw tracks (Testimony 2), that's consistent. Not a contradiction.

Testimony 2: Bikini saw tracks indicating the snowmobile was used. Evidence 14's photo shows tracks from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. Maybe supports that.

Testimony 3: It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, 5 by snowmobile. This is about timing. If someone used a snowmobile, they could get there faster. Not conflicting with evidence directly.

Testimony 4: Bikini speculates the weapon was thrown into the river. Evidence 10 is the Shichishito, which had the victim's blood and suspect's prints but is not the actual murder weapon. The real weapon might be the crystal sphere (Evidence 16) which has blood and came from the victim's staff. If they threw the weapon into the river, but the crystal sphere was found near the bridge, that might be a contradiction. However, Testimony 4 is a speculation, not a direct statement. Maybe not a direct contradiction here.

Testimony 5: Bikini suggests Iris could have done it because she can drive a snowmobile. Evidence 12 is Iris's testimony that she was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. If Iris was in her room, she couldn't have driven the snowmobile. So Testimony 5 (Bikini's claim that Iris could have) contradicts Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12). But wait, Evidence 12 is a separate evidence, not a testimony. The question asks for contradiction between evidence and testimony. So if Bikini's Testimony 5 says Iris could have done it (because she can drive the snowmobile), but Evidence 12 states Iris was in her room from 10 PM, then that's a contradiction. However, the problem specifies to use only one pair. So which one?

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 0 where Bikini says she saw the murder at 11 PM. Let's check the autopsy report (Evidence 11) which says time of death between 10-11 PM. If the murder was at 11 PM, but the body fell 10 ft after death. The lightning struck at 10:45 PM. The fire started then, and lasted 30 minutes. So if the murder was at 11 PM, perhaps the timeline is possible, but maybe the autopsy's time range is up to 11 PM, so 11 PM is the end. Not sure. Alternatively, Evidence 7's weather data says the lightning was at 10:45, and the fire started then and went out after 30 minutes. If the murder happened during the fire, then maybe around 10:45 to 11:15. But Bikini says 11 PM. Maybe possible. Not a direct contradiction here.

Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the time of death was between 10-11 PM, but Bikini claims she saw the murder at 11 PM. If the time of death is up to 11 PM, then the actual death could have been exactly at 11 PM. So that's within the range. Not a contradiction. Hmm.

Looking at Testimony 5 again: Bikini says Iris could have done it because she can drive a snowmobile. But Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) says she was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. So if Iris was in her room, she couldn't have used the snowmobile. So Bikini's Testimony 5 contradicts Evidence 12. But the user wants a pair of evidence and testimony. So if Evidence 12 is "Iris's Testimony" (description: she was in her room from 10 PM), and Bikini's Testimony 5 says Iris could have done it because she can drive the snowmobile, implying she used it. That would be a contradiction. However, the problem asks for evidence and testimony, so the testimony here is Bikini's Testimony 5, and the evidence is Evidence 12. So that's a possible contradiction.

But wait, Evidence 12 is a testimony from Iris, but in the list, Evidence 12 is named "Iris's Testimony". So in the evidences, there is an evidence called Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) which states she was in her room. So Bikini's Testimony 5 (saying Iris could have) contradicts Evidence 12 (Iris's own testimony). So that would be the pair: Evidence 12 vs Testimony 5. But let me check again.

Yes, Evidence 12 is a written testimony from Iris, part of the evidence. So Bikini's testimony (Testimony 5) contradicts Evidence 12. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Bikini's) and Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony). So that's a valid pair.

Alternatively, another angle: Evidence 10 states the Shichishito had the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints but is not the murder weapon. Then Testimony 4 suggests the weapon was thrown into the river, but the real murder weapon might be the crystal sphere (Evidence 16), which was found near the bridge. However, Testimony 4 is a speculation, not a direct contradiction. Maybe not the strongest pair.

Another possibility: Testimony 0 says murder at 11 PM. Evidence 11 says time of death 10-11 PM. If the murder was seen at 11 PM, and time of death is up to 11 PM, that's possible. Unless the exact time is determined. But the autopsy gives a range, so 11 PM is the upper limit. So if the murder was at 11 PM, that's within the range, so no contradiction.

Another angle: Evidence 7's weather data says lightning strikes from 10 to approx. 11 PM, and specifically struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45. The fire started then and lasted 30 minutes. So the fire was from 10:45 to 11:15 PM. If Bikini claims to have seen the murder at 11 PM, which is during the fire. But how does that contradict any evidence? Maybe the visibility? Not sure. The crime photo (13) shows the courtyard, but not sure about timing.

Alternatively, Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo) shows tracks leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. Testimony 2 says Bikini saw tracks indicating snowmobile use. Testimony 3 says it takes 15 minutes to walk, 5 by snowmobile. If the tracks in Evidence 14 are from the snowmobile, that's consistent. No contradiction here.

Looking back, the strongest contradiction seems to be between Bikini's Testimony 5 (suggesting Iris could have done it via snowmobile) and Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony stating she was in her room). So the pair would be Evidence 12 and Testimony 5. Therefore, the answer should be {"evidence": 12, "testimony":5}.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find a contradiction between one piece of evidence and one testimony. Let me start by listing out all the evidence and testimonies provided, then cross-reference them to spot inconsistencies.

First, looking at the characters, there are several involved, but the testimonies are all from Larry Butz (Character 7). The evidences are numbered 0 to 21, and the testimonies are 0 to 6 from Butz. 

Let me start by going through each testimony and see if any of them conflict with the evidence.

Testimony 0: Butz says he went to the shack around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. If he went to the shack at 9 PM, why does he say it would have been about 10:30 PM? Maybe that's a typo or a miscalculation. But perhaps I need to check the timeline against the evidence.

Testimony 1: He was lying under his bedding when a white flash almost blinded him. The white flash could relate to lightning, as mentioned in Evidence 7 (Weather Data), which states there were occasional lightning strikes from 10 PM to 11 PM. The lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. If Butz saw a white flash, maybe that's the lightning. Let me check the timing.

Testimony 2: He looked out the window and saw Dusky Bridge on fire. Testimony 3 says there was still some thunder, so he went to check. Testimony 5 says he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. 

Now, looking at Evidence 7: The weather data shows snow from 7 PM to about 10:50 PM and lightning from 10 PM to 11 PM. The lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. The fire started and went out around 30 minutes between. So the fire would have started at 10:45 PM when the lightning hit, burning until around 11:15 PM? Or maybe the fire started at the lightning strike and lasted 30 minutes. But according to Testimony 2, Butz saw the bridge on fire when he looked out the window after the white flash (lightning). Then he went to check (Testimony 3 and 5). 

But Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo) shows one track leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If Butz went to the bridge after the lightning strike (10:45 PM), perhaps his tracks would be in the snow. But the snow stopped at 10:50 PM. So if he went after 10:50 PM, the tracks might not be visible because the snow had stopped. Wait, but the tracks photo was taken that night. If the snow stopped around 10:50 PM, and the lightning was until 11 PM, then any tracks made after 10:50 PM would not be covered by snow. So if Butz went to the bridge after 10:50 PM, his tracks would be visible. But the Tracks Photo only shows one track. However, Butz's testimony says he went to the bridge after seeing the fire (which started at 10:45 PM). If he went there around 10:45-10:50 PM, maybe his tracks would be covered by the snow that ended at 10:50. Alternatively, if he went after 10:50, his tracks would be visible, but the photo shows only one track. Hmm. Wait, maybe there's a contradiction here. If Butz went to the bridge after the snow stopped, then his tracks should be there, but the photo shows only one track. But if he went during the snow, the tracks would be covered. Wait, but the snow was from 7 PM to 10:50 PM. So if he went at 10:45 PM, during the snow, his tracks would be covered by the snow that continued until 10:50. So the tracks in the photo (Evidence 14) would be from someone who walked after 10:50 PM, when the snow had stopped. But according to Butz's testimony, he went to the bridge after the lightning strike (10:45 PM) and the fire. If he went immediately after seeing the fire (around 10:45 PM), he would have walked there while it was still snowing, so his tracks would be covered. Therefore, the tracks in the photo (Evidence 14) must be from someone else. But if he claims to have gone there, but there's only one track, maybe his testimony about going there contradicts the evidence of only one track. Wait, but the tracks photo shows one track leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If Butz went there, and someone else (like Nick) also went there, there should be two tracks. However, in Testimony 5, Butz says he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. So both of them would have walked to the bridge. If Nick went after the snow stopped (after 10:50 PM), his tracks would be visible. But if Butz went before 10:50 PM (during the snow), his tracks would be covered. Therefore, the tracks photo (Evidence 14) should show only Nick's tracks. But if that's the case, then Butz's claim of going there would not leave tracks, which could be okay. Hmm, maybe that's not the contradiction.

Another angle: The murder weapon. Evidence 10 (Shichishito) is the apparent murder weapon with victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints, but it's stated that it's not the actual murder weapon. The real murder weapon might be the dagger (Evidence 19) or the crystal sphere (Evidence 16). The autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the victim died from a stab in the back leading to blood loss, and the body fell 10 ft after death. The staff (Evidence 9) is missing the crystal sphere, which was found near Dusky Bridge with blood (Evidence 16). Maybe the crystal sphere was the actual murder weapon. If the Shichishito (Evidence 10) is not the murder weapon, but it has the victim's blood, that's a contradiction. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Looking at Testimony 4 and 5: Butz says he ran into Nick (Testimony 4) and that Nick arrived at the bridge less than a minute after him (Testimony 5). But according to the weather data (Evidence 7), the lightning struck at 10:45 PM. The fire lasted about 30 minutes. So the fire started at 10:45 and went out around 11:15 PM. Butz's testimony 2 says he saw the bridge on fire when he looked out the window after the white flash (lightning). Then he went to check. If he went to the bridge immediately, arriving around 10:45-10:50 PM, then Nick would arrive less than a minute later, so around 10:46-10:51 PM. But the snow stopped at 10:50 PM. If Butz left his room after 10:50 PM, his tracks wouldn't be covered by snow. But the tracks photo (Evidence 14) only shows one set of tracks. So if both Butz and Nick went to the bridge after 10:50 PM, their tracks should both be present, but the photo shows only one. That's a contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 5 (Butz saying he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later) would mean both their tracks should be there, but the photo shows only one. Hence, this contradicts Evidence 14. Alternatively, if Butz went during the snow (before 10:50 PM), his tracks would be covered, and only Nick's tracks (after 10:50 PM) would show, making one track. But according to Testimony 5, Nick arrived less than a minute after Butz. If Butz arrived at the bridge at 10:49 PM (during snow), his tracks would be covered, and Nick arrives at 10:50 PM (snow stops at 10:50), so Nick's tracks would be visible. Then the tracks photo would show only Nick's tracks, which is one track. That would align. So maybe that's not a contradiction.

Alternatively, let's check the timings. Testimony 0: Butz says he went to the shack around 9 PM, so it would have been about 10:30 PM. Wait, that's confusing. If he went at 9 PM, why does he say it would have been 10:30 PM? Maybe it's a mistake in time calculation. If he went to the shack at 9 PM and stayed there until 10:30 PM, but that might not directly contradict anything unless there's evidence about his whereabouts. But I don't see evidence directly related to that time.

Another possible contradiction: The victim's autopsy report (Evidence 11) states time of death between 10 PM and 11 PM. Testimony 6 from Butz: "I thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!" This refers to the bridge fire. The bridge was set on fire by the lightning at 10:45 PM. If the victim's time of death is between 10 PM and 11 PM, and the bridge fire started at 10:45 PM, but the murder occurred when the bridge was burning. However, the victim's body fell 10 ft after death. The location of the murder is in the courtyard (Evidence 13). The bridge is a different location. Maybe not directly related.

Looking at Testimony 1: Butz was lying under his bedding when a white flash (lightning) occurred. The lightning was at 10:45 PM. So if the lightning was at 10:45 PM, then Testimony 1's timing would be around then. Then he looked out and saw the bridge on fire (Testimony 2), then went to check (Testimony 3, 5). But according to the weather data (Evidence 7), the lightning was from 10 PM to 11 PM, with a specific strike at 10:45 PM. The snow stopped at 10:50 PM. So if Butz went to the bridge after 10:45 PM, the snow was still falling until 10:50. If he left his room at 10:45 PM and arrived at the bridge by 10:47 PM, his tracks would be covered by snow until 10:50. Then Nick arrives at 10:48 PM, his tracks would be covered until 10:50 as well. But if Nick arrived after 10:50, his tracks would be visible. However, the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) only shows one track. If both went, there should be two tracks. Unless one of them went before 10:50 and the other after. But according to Testimony 5, Butz arrived first, then Nick arrived less than a minute later. So if Butz arrived at 10:49 PM (during snow), his tracks covered, and Nick arrives at 10:50 PM (snow stops), then Nick's track would be the only one visible. That matches Evidence 14. So no contradiction there.

Wait, but the lightning struck at 10:45 PM. The fire started then. The snow stopped at 10:50 PM. So the fire would have been ongoing from 10:45 PM. Butz sees the fire, goes to check, arrives at 10:49 PM (during snow), leaves tracks that get covered. Nick arrives at 10:50 PM (after snow stops), leaving one track. Therefore, the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) showing one track aligns with Nick's track. Butz's track is covered. Therefore, Testimony 5 doesn't contradict Evidence 14. Hmm.

Looking elsewhere, let's check the victim's staff (Evidence 9). It has a sword hidden inside, which only Gumshoe and the protagonist know. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) was thought to be the murder weapon but isn't. The real murder weapon might be the dagger (Evidence 19) or the crystal sphere (Evidence 16). The autopsy report (Evidence 11) says cause of death was a stab in the back. The crystal sphere (Evidence 16) has blood and is from the staff. If the victim was stabbed with the crystal sphere, but the autopsy says a stab wound from a sword, there might be inconsistency. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the dagger (Evidence 19) has blood that doesn't match the victim, so it's not the weapon. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) has the victim's blood but isn't the murder weapon, which is confusing. Maybe the actual murder weapon is the hidden sword in the staff (Evidence 9), which would have the victim's fingerprints. But the Shichishito has the suspect's fingerprints. If the real weapon is the staff's hidden sword, then the Shichishito being present with the suspect's prints is a red herring. However, this doesn't directly relate to the testimonies.

Looking at Testimony 6: Butz says he thought he'd never get another chance to see something so big burning. This refers to the bridge fire. The fire was caused by lightning (Evidence 7), so it's accidental. But if someone set the fire intentionally, that could be a contradiction. However, the evidence says the lightning caused it, so no contradiction here.

Another angle: The crystal sphere (Evidence 16) found near Dusky Bridge has blood and is from the victim's staff. If the victim was killed in the courtyard (Evidence 13), how did the crystal sphere end up near the bridge? Perhaps the murderer took it there. But this might not directly contradict a testimony.

Wait, let's consider Testimony 0: Butz went to the shack around 9 PM, so it would have been about 10:30 PM. Wait, that's a time discrepancy. If he went to the shack at 9 PM, why does he say it would have been about 10:30 PM? Maybe he's referring to the time he left the shack, or there's a miscalculation. If he went to the shack at 9 PM and stayed until 10:30 PM, but that's a long time. Alternatively, maybe he's confused about the time. However, there's no direct evidence that contradicts this timing unless another testimony or evidence places him elsewhere. For example, if there's evidence that someone saw him elsewhere at 10:30 PM. But I don't see such evidence here.

Alternatively, the victim's autopsy (Evidence 11) states the time of death as 10 PM to 11 PM. If Butz was at the shack from 9 PM to 10:30 PM, maybe he has an alibi. But unless there's evidence placing him at the crime scene during that time, this isn't a contradiction.

Wait, looking at Testimony 4 and 5: Butz says he ran into Nick (Phoenix Wright) when he went to check the bridge. However, Character 8 (Phoenix Wright) is described as having fallen from Dusky Bridge and is hospitalized. So if Phoenix is hospitalized, how could Butz have run into him at the bridge? That seems like a contradiction. Let me check the characters again. Character 8: Phoenix Wright, "Fell from Dusky Bridge and is currently hospitalized." So if Phoenix is in the hospital, he couldn't have been at the bridge on the night of the crime. But Testimony 4 and 5 state that Butz ran into Nick (Phoenix) at the bridge. That's a direct contradiction. 

Wait, yes! That's a clear contradiction. Phoenix Wright is hospitalized, so he couldn't have been at the bridge. Therefore, Butz's testimony 4 and 5 claiming he met Nick (Phoenix) there contradict Evidence about Phoenix's condition. But looking at the evidence list, is there any evidence that states Phoenix was hospitalized? Yes, Evidence 0 (Attorney's Badge) when playing as Edgeworth mentions "Received from Wright. He wasn't serious when he gave this to me... was he?" which implies Phoenix is hospitalized. Also, Character 8's description explicitly states he fell from the bridge and is hospitalized. Therefore, Butz's testimonies 4 and 5, where he claims to have met Nick (Phoenix) at the bridge, contradict the fact that Phoenix was hospitalized and couldn't be there. 

So the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (or 5) and Character 8's description. However, the question asks for evidence and testimony contradicting each other. The evidence would be the character's description, but in the problem statement, the evidences are listed from 0 to 21, and the characters are separate. The evidence list doesn't include the character descriptions as evidence. So we need to find a contradiction between an evidence item and a testimony.

Wait, the character descriptions are not part of the evidence. The evidences are numbered 0-21. So Phoenix's hospitalization is part of his character description, not evidence. Therefore, we can't use that as evidence. Therefore, we need to find a contradiction between one of the evidences (0-21) and a testimony (0-6).

Back to the previous thought: Butz's testimony about meeting Phoenix at the bridge contradicts Phoenix's hospitalization, but Phoenix's hospitalization is part of his character description, not evidence. Therefore, this contradiction isn't between evidence and testimony, but between testimony and character info, which might not count per the problem's requirements.

So, need to find another contradiction. Let's revisit.

Evidence 7 (Weather Data) states that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. Testimony 2: Butz looked out the window and saw Dusky Bridge on fire. Testimony 1: He saw a white flash (lightning) while under his bedding. The lightning at 10:45 PM caused the fire. Therefore, the timeline here aligns. No contradiction.

Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) says she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and was in her room until the murder was discovered. If the murder happened between 10 PM and 11 PM, Iris has an alibi. But unless a testimony contradicts that, it's not relevant here.

Evidence 16 (Crystal Sphere) found near Dusky Bridge with blood. If the victim was killed in the courtyard, how did the crystal sphere get there? Maybe the murderer moved it, but that's not a contradiction with testimony.

Evidence 10 (Shichishito) has the victim's blood and suspect's prints but isn't the murder weapon. Maybe the real weapon is the dagger (Evidence 19), which has blood not matching the victim. So the murder weapon is still unknown. This doesn't directly contradict testimonies.

Wait, let's check Testimony 6: Butz says he thought he'd never get another chance to see something so big burning. The bridge fire was caused by lightning, so it's an accident. If Butz implies it was intentional, that's a contradiction, but the evidence says it was lightning. However, Testimony 6 is just his excitement about seeing a big fire, not necessarily implying arson. So no contradiction.

Looking at Evidence 5 (Photo of Elise): She's holding a staff with a crystal sphere. Evidence 9 (Victim's Staff) is missing the crystal sphere, which is found near the bridge (Evidence 16). So the sphere was removed from the staff. If the victim was stabbed with the sphere, but the autopsy says a stab wound from a sword (Shichishito), there's a contradiction. But the autopsy says the cause was a stab in the back with a sword, but the real weapon might be the sphere. Wait, the autopsy says "loss of blood from stab in back." The Shichishito is a sword, but Evidence 10 says it's not the murder weapon. The staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9) could be the real weapon. But the autopsy doesn't specify the weapon type beyond a stab wound. So maybe no contradiction there.

Another angle: The victim's staff (Evidence 9) has her fingerprints, and the Shichishito (Evidence 10) has the suspect's fingerprints. If the real murder weapon is the staff's hidden sword, then the suspect's prints on Shichishito are irrelevant, but that's not a contradiction with testimony.

Wait, Testimony 0: Butz says he went to the shack around 9 PM, so it would have been about 10:30 PM. This is confusing. If he arrived at the shack at 9 PM, he's saying that the time he was there was about 10:30 PM? That doesn't make sense. Perhaps he's miscalculating the time. Let's assume he meant he went to the shack at 9 PM and stayed until 10:30 PM. However, if there's evidence that contradicts his presence there, like tracks or other testimonies. But I don't see evidence directly related.

Wait, Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo) shows one track from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If Butz went to the shack (location not specified), maybe the shack is elsewhere, and his movement doesn't affect the tracks to the bridge. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: The fire on Dusky Bridge was caused by lightning at 10:45 PM, and the fire lasted 30 minutes. So the bridge was burning until around 11:15 PM. Butz's Testimony 6 says he thought he'd never get another chance to see something so big burning. If the fire was put out by the snow or naturally, but the weather data says the snow stopped at 10:50 PM, and the fire went out around 30 minutes after starting, so around 11:15 PM. However, the bridge was made of wood, so maybe it burned longer. But this isn't necessarily a contradiction.

Back to the possible contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 14. Testimony 5 says Butz arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. If both went to the bridge after the snow stopped (after 10:50 PM), their tracks would be visible, leading to two tracks. But Evidence 14 shows only one track. Therefore, this is a contradiction. 

So the contradiction is: Butz's Testimony 5 claims both he and Nick went to the bridge, leaving two sets of tracks, but Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo) shows only one track. Therefore, the testimony contradicts the evidence.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies to find contradictions.

Testimony 5 from Larry Butz states: "I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later." This implies both Butz and Phoenix Wright (Nick) traveled to Dusky Bridge shortly after the lightning strike (10:45 PM). However, Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo) shows **only one set of tracks** leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If both Butz and Nick went to the bridge after the snow stopped at 10:50 PM, their tracks would both be visible, resulting in two tracks. The single track in Evidence 14 directly contradicts Testimony 5, which suggests two people traversed the path. 

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So, we have a bunch of characters, evidence, and testimonies. The goal is to find one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, I'll look through the testimonies. Testimony 2 from Butz says, "I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!" The person testifying is Larry Butz, who is also referred to as Laurice Deauxnim. He claims he saw Iris flying with her white hood. 

Now, looking at the evidence, let's check Evidence 6: Iris's Hood. It's described as a hood that Iris wears at all times, which is supposed to protect from evil spirits. The important part here is that the hood was received before the lights out bell the night of the crime. If Iris was wearing her hood, then Larry seeing her flying with the hood fluttering would make sense. But wait, maybe there's something else. 

Wait, Evidence 12 is Iris's Testimony, which states that she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and was in her room until the murder was discovered. If Iris was in her room, then she couldn't have been flying outside where Larry saw her. That's a contradiction. But Iris's own testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room, so Larry's testimony (Testimony 2) about seeing her flying would be impossible. But the question asks for a contradiction between evidence and testimony, not between two testimonies. So maybe I need to look for evidence that directly contradicts a testimony.

Another angle: Testimony 2 from Butz says he saw Iris flying with her hood. But Evidence 5 is a Photo of Elise, where she's wearing a white robe and hood. Maybe there's confusion between Elise and Iris? Wait, but Elise is the victim. If Elise was wearing the white hood, maybe Larry mistook her for Iris. However, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) has blood and came from the victim's staff. The victim's staff (Evidence 9) doesn't have the crystal sphere, but the Crystal Sphere was found near Dusky Bridge. If Elise was the one wearing the hood, then maybe Larry saw Elise, not Iris. But Iris's Hood (Evidence 6) is separate. Wait, the problem is that Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room, so if Larry saw someone in a white hood, it couldn't have been Iris. But the hood in the photo of Elise (Evidence 5) shows Elise wearing a white hood. So perhaps Larry saw Elise, but she was already dead? The autopsy report (Evidence 11) says Elise died between 10-11 PM. The weather data (Evidence 7) shows lightning at 10:45 PM. If Larry saw someone flying at that time, but Elise was already dead, then maybe the contradiction is that Elise couldn't have been there, and Iris was in her room. Therefore, Larry's testimony about seeing Iris flying with the hood contradicts Iris's own testimony (Evidence 12). But since we need to pair evidence and testimony, not two testimonies, perhaps the contradiction is between Larry's Testimony 2 and Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony). But the user might want evidence and testimony as in one evidence and one testimony. Let me check the requirements again: "Which evidence and testimony contradict each other? You must only answer one pair." So it's evidence vs testimony.

Wait, Evidence 12 is Iris's Testimony, which is a written statement, but in the list, Evidence 12 is called "Iris's Testimony" and is a description. Wait, in the evidences list, Evidence 12 is "Iris's Testimony: Rang lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room until the murder was discovered." So that's evidence, not a testimony. Wait, but the testimonies are given separately. So the Testimonies are Testimony 0 to 4, given by Butz. The Evidences include Iris's Testimony as Evidence 12. So if Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) states she was in her room, and Testimony 2 (Butz's) says he saw her flying, those two contradict. But the question is asking for a pair of evidence and testimony. So Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) contradicts Testimony 2 (Butz's). However, the user might need the testimony number (Testimony 2) and the evidence number (Evidence 12). Let me check the previous example: in the prior answer, the contradiction was between Evidence 1 and Testimony 2. So in this case, Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) and Testimony 2 (Butz's) contradict each other. So the answer would be {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 2}. 

Wait, but in the first example, the evidence was 1 (Deadly Bottle) and testimony 2 (Phoenix's). So in this case, the evidence is 12 (Iris's Testimony) and the testimony is 2 (Butz's). That's a valid pair. Alternatively, maybe another contradiction. Let's check other possibilities.

Testimony 0 from Butz: "I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing?" But Evidence 5 is a Photo of Elise taken by her only pupil, Laurice Deauxnim. But Larry is Laurice Deauxnim. So if he's claiming to be Deauxnim, that's consistent. Not a contradiction.

Testimony 1: "Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art!" Evidence 15 is Larry's Sketch, which is a horrible sketch. Not a contradiction.

Testimony 2: As discussed.

Testimony 3: "The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page!" Not conflicting with any evidence.

Testimony 4: "...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up." The weather data (Evidence 7) mentions that around 30 minutes passed between the fire starting and going out. If Butz is talking about the flames going out, maybe related to the fire mentioned in the weather data. Not sure if contradiction.

Another angle: The murder weapon. Evidence 10 (Shichishito) says it's the apparent murder weapon but had the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints, but it's not the murder weapon. The actual cause of death is a stab in the back (Evidence 11). The real murder weapon might be the dagger (Evidence 19), which has blood not matching the victim. Hmm, perhaps not directly contradicting a testimony.

Alternatively, Evidence 16 (Crystal Sphere) has blood and came from the victim's staff. The victim's staff (Evidence 9) doesn't have the crystal sphere. So the crystal sphere was found near the bridge, which might connect to Larry's Testimony 2 about seeing someone flying there. If the victim's staff lost the crystal sphere, perhaps the victim was there, but she was supposed to be dead by then. But the timing would need to be checked. The autopsy says time of death between 10-11 PM. The lightning struck at 10:45 PM. If the victim was already dead, she couldn't have been there. But Larry's testimony about seeing someone flying (maybe the victim) after she was dead would contradict. However, the crystal sphere being found near the bridge suggests the staff was there, which might mean the victim was there. But the victim's body fell 10 ft after death (Evidence 11). So maybe the body was moved. Not sure.

But the clearest contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Butz seeing Iris flying) and Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony that she was in her room). So the answer is evidence 12 and testimony 2.

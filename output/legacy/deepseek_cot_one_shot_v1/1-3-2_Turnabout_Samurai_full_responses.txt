Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair, and the answer must be in JSON at the end. Let's start by looking at the testimonies and evidences provided.

First, the characters involved. The Security Lady (Oldbag) has several testimonies. Let's check them. Testimony 4 says she was at the main gate from 1:00 PM until 5:00 PM. Testimony 6 mentions that at 2:00 PM, she saw Powers heading toward the studio. Testimony 7 confirms it was Powers she saw at that time.

Now, looking at the evidence. Evidence 5 is Powers'(?) Photo, taken at the gate at 2:00 PM, showing the Steel Samurai dragging one leg. The photo is timestamped 2:00 PM on October 15. However, the Security Lady (Oldbag) claims she saw Powers in person at 2:00 PM. But if the photo shows the Steel Samurai (which is Powers' character) at the same time, that might be conflicting. Wait, but maybe the photo is of someone else in the costume. Alternatively, if the photo shows the Steel Samurai at 2:00 PM, but Oldbag says she saw Powers himself at that time, perhaps that's a contradiction. Because if Powers was in the costume, he couldn't be seen as himself by Oldbag. Alternatively, maybe the photo shows that the Steel Samurai was at the gate at 2:00 PM, implying that the person in the costume was there, but Oldbag claims she saw Powers in person, not in costume. Wait, but the photo is of the Steel Samurai walking, which is Powers' character. So if Powers was in the Steel Samurai costume at 2:00 PM, then Oldbag's testimony that she saw Powers himself (out of costume) walking by would be impossible. Therefore, Evidence 5 contradicts Testimony 7 because if the photo shows the Steel Samurai (Powers in costume) at 2:00 PM, he couldn't be walking by Oldbag as himself at the same time. That's a contradiction. Therefore, the evidence and testimony that conflict are Evidence 5 and Testimony 7.

Let's analyze the testimonies and evidence:
- Testimony 7 by Oldbag states she saw Will Powers (defendant) heading toward the studio at **2:00 PM**.
- Evidence 5 (Powers'(?) Photo) shows the Steel Samurai (Powers' character) **dragging one leg** at the gate at **2:00 PM** on the day of the murder. If Powers was in the Steel Samurai costume at 2:00 PM, he could not simultaneously appear to Oldbag **out of costume** as himself. This creates a contradiction.
{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 7}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has given me a set of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to find which evidence contradicts which testimony. The answer should be in JSON format at the end, specifying the evidence and testimony numbers.

First, I need to look through all the testimonies and see what each person is claiming. Then, cross-reference those claims with the evidence provided to find inconsistencies.

Looking at the testimonies, the first four (Testimony 0 to 3) are all from Oldbag. Testimony 0 confirms the time of death as 2:30 PM, which matches Evidence 3 (Jack's Autopsy Report) stating the time of death is 2:30 PM. So that's consistent.

Testimonies 1, 2, and 3 are all from Oldbag claiming that the only person she saw going to the studio before the time of death was Will Powers, and no one else went there, otherwise she would have seen them. So according to her, Will Powers was the only one who went to the studio before 2:30 PM.

Now, looking at the evidence. Let's check if there's any evidence that someone else was at the studio around that time. Evidence 5 is a photo taken at the gate at 2:00 PM showing the Steel Samurai (which might be Will Powers in costume) dragging one leg. However, Evidence 11 is Mr. Monkey's Head, which blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. If the path was blocked from 2:15 PM onwards, then anyone trying to get to the crime scene after that time would have been blocked. But the murder happened at 2:30 PM. So if the murderer had to be there at 2:30 PM, they would have needed access. However, if the path was blocked starting at 2:15 PM, how did they get through?

Wait, but Oldbag's testimony says she saw Will Powers going there before the time of death. The photo (Evidence 5) shows Steel Samurai (maybe Powers) at 2:00 PM, and the path was blocked at 2:15 PM. The autopsy says death at 2:30 PM. If the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, then the killer must have entered before 2:15 PM. Oldbag claims she saw Powers going there before, so that's possible. But if someone else needed to get in after 2:15 PM, they couldn't because the path was blocked. But Oldbag says she didn't see anyone else. However, perhaps the killer was already inside before 2:15 PM.

Wait, but the murder happened at 2:30 PM. If the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, then the killer must have been at the scene before 2:15 PM and stayed there until committing the murder at 2:30 PM. But Oldbag says she only saw Powers going there before. However, Evidence 5 shows Powers (as Steel Samurai) at 2:00 PM, which would be before the path was blocked. So if he was there, he could have stayed and committed the murder. But maybe there's another angle.

Wait, but what if someone else was there? For example, the Security Lady (Character 4) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene. But maybe there's evidence contradicting that. Wait, the testimonies from Oldbag (Testimonies 1-3) are claiming that only Powers went there. But perhaps there's evidence showing someone else was present. Let me check the evidences again.

Evidence 18 is a van used by Manella to drive Vasquez to Studio One after a meeting. The time isn't specified, but if that happened around the time of the crime, maybe they were there. But without a specific time, it's hard to say. Evidence 15 is Cody's Camera, a digital camera he always carries. Maybe there's a photo from that camera showing someone else, but the evidence listed here is the camera itself, not the photos. Evidence 5 is a photo showing Steel Samurai (Powers) at 2:00 PM. 

Another angle: The murder weapon is the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6), which had a break mended with duct tape. If the spear was part of the Steel Samurai's costume, then Powers would have access. But maybe there's evidence that the spear was broken and fixed, indicating prior knowledge or preparation.

Wait, but the key contradiction here might be regarding Oldbag's testimony that only Powers went there. If there's evidence that someone else could have accessed the scene despite the blocked path, that would contradict her. But the path was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head from 2:15 PM. So unless someone was already there before 2:15, they couldn't enter. So if the murder happened at 2:30 PM, the killer had to be there before 2:15. If Oldbag says she saw only Powers going there before, then maybe the evidence that the path was blocked supports her testimony. But maybe there's another way in. Alternatively, maybe the blocked path means that even if someone else went in before 2:15, they couldn't leave, but the murder could still happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the photo (Evidence 5) shows Powers in the Steel Samurai costume at 2:00 PM, but maybe the real murderer used that costume to frame him. If someone else was wearing the costume, then Oldbag might have mistaken them for Powers. But that's speculation. The question is about direct contradictions between evidence and testimony.

Wait, the Security Lady (Character 4) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene. But if the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, and the murder was at 2:30 PM, then perhaps Powers couldn't have gotten there after 2:15. But according to the photo (Evidence 5), he was there at 2:00 PM, so he was already in the area before the path was blocked. So that's consistent.

Alternatively, if the murder weapon's spear (Evidence 6) has a mended break, maybe someone else had access to it. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Wait, maybe the contradiction is that Oldbag says she saw Powers going to the studio before the murder, but the photo (Evidence 5) shows the Steel Samurai dragging one leg. If Powers had an injury or something that made him drag his leg, but in reality, if someone else was in the costume, that could be a contradiction. However, the photo is labeled as Powers'(?), so it's possibly him. But that's not necessarily a contradiction unless there's evidence that someone else was in the costume.

Alternatively, the autopsy report (Evidence 3) says death at 2:30 PM. If the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, and Oldbag says she saw Powers going there before, then Powers could be the only one with access. But perhaps another person was already there. However, without evidence showing someone else was present, that's not a contradiction.

Wait, let's look again. Testimony 1 and 2 by Oldbag state that the only person she saw going to the studio before the murder was Will Powers, and no one else. However, Evidence 18 mentions a van used by Manella to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting. If the meeting was on the day of the crime, and they arrived after the path was blocked, that might be impossible. But the timing isn't specified. Alternatively, maybe the van was used to bypass the blocked path, but without time stamps, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head blocking the path from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM) means that after 2:15 PM, no one could access the scene. Therefore, the murderer must have been there before 2:15 PM. Oldbag's testimony says she only saw Powers going there before the murder (which was at 2:30 PM). So if the murderer had to be there before 2:15, and she only saw Powers, then that's consistent. But what if there's evidence that someone else was present?

Looking at Evidence 5 again: the photo taken at 2:00 PM shows the Steel Samurai (presumed to be Powers) dragging one leg. If Powers had an injury, maybe he couldn't have committed the murder. But the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) was used with force, so if he was injured, that might be a contradiction. However, that's speculative unless there's direct evidence about his injury.

Alternatively, Evidence 16 is a steak plate with traces of sleeping pills and a large bone. If someone drugged Powers with sleeping pills in his steak, maybe he was unconscious and couldn't have committed the murder. But the testimony from Oldbag says she saw him going to the studio, so that's a contradiction. However, the steak plate is found in the employee area, and it's possible that if Powers was drugged, he couldn't have been the murderer. But this would contradict Oldbag's testimony that he was there. But if the steak was his, and he was drugged, maybe he was asleep during the murder. But the timing would need to align. However, without knowing when he ate the steak, it's hard to say. This might be a possible contradiction, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: Testimony 3 by Oldbag says, "If they had, I would have seen them!" referring to anyone else going to the studio. But Evidence 11 shows that the path was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head from 2:15 PM. So if someone else went to the studio before 2:15 PM, Oldbag should have seen them. However, if someone else was already present before 2:15 PM, then they could have committed the murder at 2:30 PM without being seen by Oldbag after 2:15 PM. But the testimonies 1-3 from Oldbag claim that she saw Powers going there before the murder and no one else. So if there's evidence that someone else was present before 2:15 PM, that would contradict her testimony.

Looking at Evidence 18: the van used by Manella to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting. If the meeting happened before 2:15 PM, and they arrived at Studio One after, then they might have used the van to get there after the path was blocked, which would be impossible. But if the meeting was after 2:15 PM, maybe they couldn't access the studio. However, the evidence doesn't specify the time of the meeting or when they used the van. So this is unclear.

Alternatively, Evidence 4 is a Cardkey for Studio Employees. If someone else had access via the cardkey, maybe they entered through another entrance not monitored by Oldbag. But the testimonies from Oldbag are about seeing people going to the studio. If there's another entrance, her testimony that she would have seen anyone else might be contradicted by evidence of another entrance. However, Evidence 2 is a Guidemap to Global Studios, but the description doesn't mention multiple entrances. The Security Lady is at the gate, so perhaps she only monitors the main entrance. If the Cardkey (Evidence 4) allows access to Studio One through another entrance, then someone could have entered without Oldbag seeing them, contradicting her testimony. But the testimonies say she's the security guard who claims she saw Powers heading to the scene. If there's another entrance, her testimony that she would have seen anyone else going there would be false, but the evidence supporting another entrance would be the Cardkey. However, the Cardkey's description says it's for Studio Employees to access Studio One. If Studio One is the crime scene, and the Cardkey allows access, but the path was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head, then perhaps the Cardkey provides an alternative route. But the path being blocked (Evidence 11) is between the entrance and the scene. If the Cardkey allows access through another route, then someone could have entered even after 2:15 PM. For example, if the main path was blocked, but the Cardkey gives access through a different door, then Oldbag's testimony that she would have seen anyone else is contradicted by the existence of another entrance via the Cardkey. Therefore, Evidence 4 (Cardkey) would contradict Testimony 3 ("If they had, I would have seen them!") because the Cardkey allows access without passing by Oldbag's observation point.

Alternatively, the Guidemap (Evidence 2) might show multiple paths, but the description isn't detailed. But the Cardkey (Evidence 4) explicitly allows access into Studio One. If Studio One is the crime scene, and the Cardkey provides an alternative entrance, then someone with the cardkey could enter without Oldbag seeing them. This would contradict her testimony that she would have seen anyone else going there. Therefore, the existence of the Cardkey (Evidence 4) contradicts Oldbag's Testimony 3 ("If they had, I would have seen them!") because the Cardkey provides an alternative access route that bypasses her observation.

So the contradiction is between Evidence 4 (Cardkey) and Testimony 3. Alternatively, if the path was blocked, but the Cardkey allows entry via another way, then even if the main path was blocked, someone could have used the Cardkey to enter, which Oldbag wouldn't have seen, thus contradicting her testimony that she would have seen anyone else.

Let's think step by step:
Oldbag's Testimony 3 claims that if anyone else went to the studio, she would have seen them. However, Evidence 4 (Cardkey) indicates that employees can access Studio One via the cardkey, potentially through an alternate entrance not monitored by Oldbag. This suggests someone else could have entered without her knowledge, contradicting her assertion.

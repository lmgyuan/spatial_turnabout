Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all provided. Let me go through each testimony and see if any of the evidence directly contradicts them.

First, looking at the testimonies. All of them (Testimony 0 to 4) are from Gumshoe and talk about Mask☆DeMasque's activities. For example, Testimony 3 says Mask☆DeMasque always goes after the most precious art pieces. Then looking at the evidence. Evidence 4 is the Sacred Urn, which is described as one of the treasures of Kurain Village but has no monetary value. Wait, if the Sacred Urn is supposed to be priceless but actually has no monetary value, then it's not a valuable art piece. But according to Testimony 3, Mask☆DeMasque targets only the most precious art. That could be a contradiction because the urn isn't valuable, so why would he steal it?

But let me check other possibilities. Evidence 3 is Ami Fey's Golden Statue, which might be valuable. But the testimony says the thief takes only the most precious, so maybe the urn isn't considered valuable. So if the Sacred Urn (Evidence 4) is part of the heist, but it's not valuable, that contradicts Testimony 3. However, the testimonies mention that Mask☆DeMasque sent a calling card to Lordly Tailor where the urn was displayed. So if he targeted that exhibit, but the urn isn't valuable, then Testimony 3's claim that he only steals precious art is contradicted by Evidence 4 stating the urn has no monetary value. That seems like a solid contradiction.

Let's analyze the testimonies and evidences:
Testimony 3 states that Mask☆DeMasque "always goes after only the most precious art pieces." However, Evidence 4 (Sacred Urn) explicitly states that the urn, despite being a "treasure," has "no monetary value," contradicting the idea that it is a precious art piece worth targeting. This directly opposes Gumshoe's claim about the thief's M.O.
{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's tackle this. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair.

First, I'll go through each testimony and see if any of the evidences directly conflict with them. Let's start with the testimonies.

Testimony 0 by Atmey says the time was approximately 1 AM. Evidence 15 (Kane's Autopsy Report) states the time of death as 10/12 at 1 AM. That seems to align, so no contradiction there.

Testimony 1: Atmey mentions Mask☆DeMasque arriving at around 1 AM. Evidence 7 (Camera Data) says the warehouse camera went off at around 1 AM. Maybe related, but not a direct contradiction. Also, Evidence 19 (Buzzer Record) has the buzzer at 1:02 AM. Hmm.

Testimony 2: Atmey says he was struck on the head. Evidence 6 (Shichishito) mentions DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head. That matches, so no conflict.

Testimony 3: Atmey says he was knocked out and when he awoke, the thief was gone. No direct evidence contradicts this.

Testimony 4: Atmey called police 30 minutes later. If the crime was at 1 AM, then he called at 1:30 AM. But the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) shows the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM. Wait, if the buzzer in the CEO's office was pressed at 1:02 AM, but the crime happened around 1 AM, maybe there's a timing issue here.

Wait, Kane's Autopsy (Evidence 15) says death at 1 AM. The buzzer (Evidence 19) was pressed at 1:02 AM. If Kane was already dead by 1 AM, how could the buzzer be pressed at 1:02 AM? That would imply someone pressed it after his death. But if Atmey was knocked out around 1 AM, he called police 30 minutes later (1:30 AM). But how does the buzzer at 1:02 AM fit in? Maybe the person who pressed the buzzer was the killer, but Kane was already dead at 1 AM. So the buzzer being pressed at 1:02 AM would contradict the time of death being exactly 1 AM. However, autopsy times can be approximate. Maybe the time of death is estimated, so not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 12 (Key Card): It says the key card leaves a record when used. If Ron used the key card to get into the CEO's office, but his wallet (Evidence 11) was found at the building where he worked part-time (the same night). If the key card was used to enter the CEO's office, but Ron's wallet was found elsewhere, maybe there's a contradiction. But that's between evidences, not testimony and evidence.

Wait, Testimony 4 says Atmey called police 30 minutes after the incident (around 1:30 AM). But the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) shows the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM. If Atmey was knocked out at 1 AM, then the buzzer being pressed at 1:02 AM would be during the time he was unconscious. But the buzzer is connected to the basement Security Guard Office (Evidence 17). If the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM, maybe someone else was in the CEO's office after the murder. But how does that contradict testimony?

Wait, let's check Testimony 0 again: Atmey says the incident was at approximately 1 AM. The Camera Data (Evidence 7) says the warehouse camera went off at around 1 AM. Maybe the camera going off is when the crime happened. But the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) is at 1:02 AM. If the buzzer was pressed after the crime, but the killer was already there, maybe this is a contradiction. But I'm not sure yet.

Another angle: Evidence 6 (Shichishito) states that DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head during the crime. But the autopsy (Evidence 15) says Kane died from a blow to the head. Maybe the same weapon? But that's not a contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 2 says Atmey was struck as he began to turn. Evidence 6 says the blow was to the back of the head, which aligns. So no conflict there.

Looking at Evidence 20 (Ron's Testimony): He says from the second heist onward, he was stealing under blackmail. But this isn't directly conflicting with any testimony here.

Wait, Evidence 16 (Newspaper Clipping) mentions that in the first heist, the guard in the photo is Ron DeLite. But Ron turned himself in as Mask☆DeMasque (Character 8). If Ron was the guard during the first heist, maybe he was involved earlier. But how does that contradict testimony? The testimonies here are from Atmey, so perhaps not directly.

Back to the original question: looking for a testimony and evidence that contradict each other.

Testimony 4: Atmey called police 30 minutes after the incident. If the incident was at 1 AM, then he called at 1:30 AM. However, the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) shows the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM. If the buzzer was pressed in the CEO's office, which is where Kane's body was found (Character 12), then pressing the buzzer would require someone to be there. But Kane was already dead by 1 AM (Evidence 15). So how could the buzzer be pressed at 1:02 AM if Kane was dead? Unless the time of death is approximate. The autopsy says "around 1 AM," but the exact time could be a bit off. However, this might be a stretch.

Alternatively, Evidence 12 (Key Card) says that using the key card leaves a record. If Ron's key card was used to enter the CEO's office, but his wallet (Evidence 11) was found at his part-time job's building that night, perhaps implying he wasn't there. But that's between evidences, not testimony and evidence.

Wait, maybe Testimony 0: Atmey says the incident was at approximately 1 AM. Evidence 7 (Camera Data) shows the warehouse camera went off at around 1 AM. But the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) is at 1:02 AM. If the camera going off indicates the crime time, then the buzzer being pressed two minutes later suggests someone was in the CEO's office after the crime. But if the killer was already there, maybe there's a contradiction. But this isn't directly conflicting with a testimony.

Alternatively, Evidence 19 (Buzzer Record) shows the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM, which is after the time of death (1 AM). If the buzzer was pressed by someone in the CEO's office after Kane's death, then that's possible. But Atmey's testimony doesn't mention this, but that's not a contradiction. It's more of an inconsistency in timeline rather than a direct contradiction.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 0 by Atmey says the incident was at approximately 1 AM. Evidence 15 (Autopsy) says Kane died at 1 AM. If Atmey was attacked at the same time Kane was killed, but they're in different locations? Wait, where was Kane's body found? Character 12's description says his body was found inside his safe, which is probably the CEO's office. The crime photo (if there was one) might be relevant, but not listed here. 

If Atmey was in the warehouse (based on camera data), and Kane was in his office, then two different crime scenes. But how does that connect? If Atmey was knocked out at 1 AM, and Kane died at 1 AM, then the buzzer pressed at 1:02 AM in the CEO's office would imply someone else was there after Kane's death. But unless there's a testimony that says no one else was present, this isn't a direct contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 4: Atmey called police 30 minutes later (1:30 AM). But the Buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM. If the police arrived later, but the buzzer was pressed after the murder, maybe the killer pressed it. But how does that contradict a testimony?

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 12 (Key Card) found in Ron's wallet (Evidence 11) which was found at his part-time job's building. If Ron used the key card to enter the CEO's office (as per Evidence 12), but his wallet was found elsewhere that night, implying he wasn't there. But that's between evidences.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's check the testimonies again.

Testimony 1: Atmey says Mask☆DeMasque arrived at around 1 AM. Evidence 16 (Newspaper Clipping) shows that Ron was the guard during the first heist. But Ron is now claiming to be Mask☆DeMasque. If Ron was the guard during the first heist, but now is the thief, that's a contradiction in his role, but that's between evidence and character info, not testimony.

Alternatively, Evidence 14 (DeMasque's Broach) found near the statue. If Atmey's testimony says he was attacked by DeMasque, but the broach being there could support that. No contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 0 says the time was approximately 1 AM. Evidence 15 says time of death 1 AM. If the murder happened at 1 AM, and the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM, then someone else was in the office after Kane died. But unless a testimony claims that no one else was there, no contradiction.

Alternatively, Evidence 3 (Ami Fey's Golden Statue) says it moved the night of the crime. Testimony 1 says DeMasque arrived dancing, maybe implying movement. But not a direct contradiction.

Wait, maybe Testimony 3: Atmey says when he awoke, DeMasque was gone. But Evidence 14 (DeMasque's Broach) was found at the scene, implying that DeMasque left something behind. That's not a contradiction, just additional info.

Another angle: Testimony 4 says Atmey called the police 30 minutes after the incident (1:30 AM). Evidence 19 (Buzzer Record) at 1:02 AM. If the buzzer was pressed after Atmey was knocked out, but he was unconscious until after 1:30 AM, then who pressed it? That might imply someone else was present. But this isn't directly conflicting with testimony unless Atmey testifies that no one else was there, which he doesn't.

Wait, maybe the Key Card (Evidence 12) leaves a record when used. If the key card was used to enter the CEO's office, but Ron's wallet (and thus the key card) was found at another location (Evidence 11), that would mean the key card couldn't have been used unless someone else took it. But Evidence 12 says the key card was found in Ron's wallet. So if the key card was used that night, but the wallet was found elsewhere, that's a contradiction. For example, if the key card was used at 1:02 AM (Buzzer Record), but the wallet was found at Ron's part-time job building, then Ron couldn't have used the key card unless he was in two places at once. That's a contradiction between Evidence 12 and 11. But the question asks for evidence and testimony contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe Ron's Testimony (Evidence 20) says he was acting under blackmail from the second heist onward. But the Newspaper Clipping (Evidence 16) shows he was the guard in the first heist. If Ron was the guard during the first heist, but later became the thief due to blackmail starting from the second, that's consistent, not a contradiction.

Hmm. I'm struggling to find a direct contradiction between testimony and evidence here. Let me check again.

Looking at Testimony 0: Atmey says the incident was around 1 AM. Evidence 15 (Autopsy) says death at 1 AM. Evidence 19 (Buzzer) at 1:02 AM. If the murder was at 1 AM, but the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM in the CEO's office (where the body was), then the killer might have pressed it after killing Kane. But if Atmey was attacked at 1 AM in another location (warehouse?), then the timeline is possible. But no direct contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 3 says the statue moved the night of the crime. Testimony 1 says DeMasque arrived dancing, which might involve moving the statue. But again, not a contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 6 (Shichishito) says DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head. Testimony 2 says Atmey was struck as he began to turn, which would be the back of the head. So that's consistent.

Perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the key elements again.

The user wants one pair where evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's check each testimony against all evidences.

Testimony 0: Time is ~1 AM. Evidence 15 (death at 1 AM), Evidence 7 (camera at 1 AM), Evidence 19 (buzzer 1:02). All times are close, no direct contradiction.

Testimony 1: DeMasque arrived at ~1 AM. Evidence 16 shows Ron as guard in first heist, but that's not a contradiction. Evidence 14's broach supports DeMasque's presence.

Testimony 2: Struck on the head. Evidence 6 supports this.

Testimony 3: Woke up and DeMasque was gone. No evidence contradicts.

Testimony 4: Called police 30 minutes later (1:30 AM). Evidence 19's buzzer at 1:02 AM doesn't contradict.

Wait, Evidence 7 (Camera Data) says the warehouse camera went off at around 1 AM. If the crime happened there, but the body was found in the CEO's office (Character 12), then maybe the camera going off is unrelated. But this is possible.

Wait, another angle: Evidence 21 (Urn Box) has pink paint stains, and Evidence 22 (Paint Marks) says the urn's box was stained when Adrian knocked over paint two weeks ago. If Adrian is the one who stained the box, but someone else moved it, that's not a contradiction.

Alternatively, Evidence 17 (Buzzer) has no fingerprints. If Atmey's testimony said he pressed the buzzer, but there are no prints, that would contradict. But Atmey doesn't mention pressing the buzzer.

Wait, Testimony 4: Atmey says he used an emergency phone to notify police 30 minutes later. If the emergency phone is in a certain location, but the buzzer was pressed in the CEO's office, maybe that's a different location. But no contradiction here.

Hmm. I'm not finding a direct contradiction. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine all evidences and testimonies once more.

Wait, Evidence 12 (Key Card) says it leaves a record when used. If the key card was used to enter the CEO's office, but Ron's wallet (Evidence 11) was found at his part-time job's building, that implies the key card was in the wallet when it was found. So if the key card was used that night, but the wallet was found elsewhere, then the key card couldn't have been used unless someone took it from the wallet, used it, and returned it. But the key card was found in the wallet (Evidence 12), so if it was used, the record would show it. But if the key card was used at 1:02 AM (Buzzer Record), then the key card must have been used to enter the office, but the wallet was found at the part-time job's building. This suggests that the key card was used, but the wallet (with the key card inside) was found elsewhere. That's a contradiction between Evidence 12 and 11. But the question asks for testimony and evidence contradiction.

Alternatively, if Ron's Testimony (Evidence 20) says he was blackmailed from the second heist, but Evidence 16 shows he was the guard in the first, which isn't a contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 0 by Atmey says the time was approximately 1 AM. Evidence 7 (Camera Data) says the warehouse camera went off at around 1 AM. If the camera going off is when the theft occurred, and the murder happened at the same time, but in a different location (CEO's office), then no contradiction. However, if the camera going off indicates the time of the theft, and the murder was at the same time, but the buzzer pressed at 1:02 AM in the CEO's office implies someone was there after the murder. But unless testimony says otherwise, no contradiction.

Perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 0 (incident at ~1 AM) and Evidence 19 (buzzer at 1:02 AM). But how? If the incident (attack on Atmey) was at 1 AM, and the buzzer was pressed two minutes later, that's possible. No contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 3: Ami Fey's statue moved the night of the crime. Testimony 1 says DeMasque arrived dancing, which could relate to moving the statue. Not a contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 6: Shichishito wasn't bent before the crime. DeMasque used it to knock Atmey out. If the sword was used to strike Atmey, maybe it bent, but the evidence says it wasn't bent before. No info on after, so no contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 4: Atmey called police 30 minutes later. If the murder was at 1 AM, and the police were called at 1:30, but the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM, that's possible. No contradiction.

I'm stuck. Maybe the intended answer is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 19. Testimony 4 says Atmey called police 30 minutes after the incident (1:30 AM), but Evidence 19's buzzer at 1:02 AM would mean that someone was in the CEO's office after the murder. But how does that contradict testimony? Atmey doesn't mention the buzzer, so maybe it's not a contradiction.

Wait, another thought: The Key Card (Evidence 12) was used to enter the CEO's office, which leaves a record. If Ron's wallet (Evidence 11) was found at his part-time job's building the night of the crime, implying he was there, then how could his key card be used at the CEO's office unless he was in two places. This suggests Ron couldn't have used the key card himself if his wallet was elsewhere. But this is between evidences 11 and 12, not testimony.

Alternatively, if Testimony 4 says Atmey called police at 1:30 AM, but the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) was at 1:02 AM, perhaps the killer pressed the buzzer after the murder. But Atmey's testimony doesn't mention the buzzer, so no contradiction.

Hmm. Maybe there's a contradiction I'm not seeing. Let me check one more time.

Evidence 15: Kane's death at 1 AM. Testimony 0: incident at 1 AM. Evidence 19: buzzer at 1:02 AM. If Kane was already dead, who pressed the buzzer? The killer could have pressed it after killing him. But that's possible, not a contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 17: Buzzer has no fingerprints. If the killer pressed it without leaving prints, that's possible. No contradiction with testimony.

Maybe the answer is between Testimony 0 (incident at ~1 AM) and Evidence 19 (buzzer at 1:02 AM), implying that the buzzer was pressed after the incident, which could mean someone else was present. But without testimony saying that no one else was there, this isn't a contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 4 says Atmey called the police 30 minutes later (1:30 AM), but the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) at 1:02 AM. If the police arrived after 1:30 AM, the buzzer at 1:02 AM is unrelated. Still no contradiction.

I'm really not sure. Maybe I missed something. Let's look for any other possible contradictions.

Evidence 21: Urn Box has pink paint stains. Evidence 22 says the box was stained when Adrian knocked over paint two weeks ago. So that's consistent. No contradiction.

Evidence 6: Shichishito wasn't bent before the crime. Testimony 2 says Atmey was struck with it. If it's a ceremonial sword, maybe it's not meant for striking. But the evidence says it was used to knock Atmey out, which implies it's sturdy. No contradiction.

Wait, maybe Testimony 0 says the incident was at ~1 AM. Evidence 15 says death at 1 AM. If the murder happened at the same time as the attack on Atmey, but they're in different locations, that's possible. No contradiction.

Alternatively, Evidence 19 (Buzzer at 1:02 AM) and Testimony 0 (incident at ~1 AM). If the buzzer was pressed after the incident, but the incident was the murder, then maybe the killer pressed it. No contradiction.

I'm stuck. Maybe the intended answer is Evidence 12 (Key Card) and Testimony something else. But the testimonies here are only from Atmey. Wait, maybe there's another testimony not considered?

No, the testimonies provided are 0-4 by Atmey.

Wait, looking at the given data again:

Testimony 0: Atmey says the incident was at approximately 1 AM.

Evidence 15: Kane's death at 1 AM.

Evidence 19: Buzzer at 1:02 AM.

If Kane was killed at 1 AM, the buzzer pressed at 1:02 AM implies someone was there after his death. But unless a testimony says no one was there, no contradiction.

Alternatively, the Key Card (Evidence 12) was used to enter the CEO's office, which would leave a record. If the key card was used, but Ron's wallet was found elsewhere (Evidence 11), implying he wasn't there, then the key card couldn't have been used. But this is between Evidence 11 and 12, not testimony.

Wait, unless Ron's Testimony (Evidence 20) says he was directed by blackmail from the second heist, but the Newspaper (Evidence 16) shows he was the guard in the first. This isn't a contradiction, just background.

I think I might have to settle on the buzzer time contradicting the testimony time, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the Key Card evidence and a testimony.

Wait, Ron's Testimony (Evidence 20) says he was blackmailed from the second heist. If he was the guard in the first heist (Evidence 16), that's consistent. No contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 6 says the Shichishito wasn't bent before the crime. If Atmey was hit with it, maybe it's now bent. But the evidence doesn't mention it being bent after, so no contradiction.

I'm really not finding a clear contradiction. Maybe the answer is Evidence 19 (Buzzer at 1:02) and Testimony 0 (incident at ~1 AM). The buzzer was pressed two minutes after the incident, which could mean someone else was present. But since Atmey was knocked out, he wouldn't know about the buzzer. So no contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 4 says Atmey called police 30 minutes later (1:30 AM). Evidence 19 (buzzer at 1:02 AM) and Evidence 15 (death at 1 AM). If the killer pressed the buzzer after killing Kane, but Atmey was unconscious, then no contradiction.

I'm at a loss. Perhaps the intended answer is Evidence 12 (Key Card used) and Testimony from Ron, but the testimonies given are only from Atmey. Wait, the testimonies are from Atmey only. So maybe the answer is between Atmey's testimony and one of the evidences.

Wait, perhaps Testimony 1 says DeMasque arrived dancingly, but Evidence 13 (Publicity Photo) shows DeMasque's pose. Not a contradiction.

Alternatively, Evidence 14 (DeMasque's Broach) found at the scene. Testimony 1 says DeMasque was there, which aligns.

I'm really not sure. Maybe I missed a key point. Let me check one last time.

Evidence 12: Key Card found in Ron's wallet, which was found at his part-time job's building. The Key Card opens the CEO's office and leaves a record. If the key card was used that night (as per Evidence 19's buzzer at 1:02 AM), then there should be a record of it being used. But if the key card was in Ron's wallet which was found at another location, how was it used? This suggests that the key card couldn't have been used unless someone took it from the wallet, used it, and returned it. But the wallet was found at the part-time job's building. So if the key card was used, the wallet must have been there, but the key card's use implies it was at the CEO's office. This is a contradiction between Evidence 11 (wallet's location) and Evidence 12 (key card's use). But the user asked for testimony and evidence contradiction, so this is between two evidences, which isn't what's required.

Given that, and after extensive consideration, I think the intended contradiction is between Testimony 0 (incident at ~1 AM) and Evidence 15 (death at 1 AM). But they align. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps between Testimony 4 (called police at 1:30 AM) and Evidence 7 (camera at 1 AM) and Evidence 19 (buzzer at 1:02), but I don't see a direct contradiction.

Wait, another angle: Evidence 6 states that DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head. Testimony 2 says Atmey was struck as he began to turn, implying the blow was from behind. That's consistent. No contradiction.

I'm truly stuck. Maybe the answer is Evidence 19 (Buzzer at 1:02 AM) and Testimony 0 (incident at ~1 AM). The buzzer being pressed two minutes after the incident suggests activity after the initial crime, but unless testimony claims otherwise, no contradiction. Alternatively, if the murder was at 1 AM and the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM by the killer, which is possible, but not a contradiction.

After reviewing everything, I think the most likely answer is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 19. Testimony 4 says Atmey called police 30 minutes later (1:30 AM). Evidence 19's buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM. If Atmey was unconscious from 1 AM to 1:30 AM, he couldn't have pressed the buzzer at 1:02 AM. But the buzzer was in the CEO's office, which is where Kane's body was, not where Atmey was attacked. So someone else pressed it. But that's not a contradiction with Atmey's testimony, as he doesn't mention the buzzer.

I think I need to conclude that the contradiction is between Evidence 12 (Key Card used) and Testimony from someone, but since the testimonies provided are only from Atmey, and he doesn't mention the key card, perhaps there's no contradiction. 

Wait, perhaps I missed Ron's Testimony (Evidence 20), which is written as an evidence. It says Ron's Testimony: "From DeMasque's 2nd heist on, he was stealing as directed by blackmail letters." If Evidence 16's Newspaper shows Ron as the guard in the first heist, then Ron's Testimony in Evidence 20 says he was blackmailed from the second heist. So that's consistent. No contradiction.

Final attempt: The contradiction is between Testimony 0 (incident at 1 AM) and Evidence 19 (buzzer at 1:02 AM). But unless testimony says the incident ended before 1:02 AM, no contradiction. Alternatively, if the incident's time is exactly 1 AM, and the buzzer was pressed after, but testimony says incident was around 1 AM, which can include 1:02. So no contradiction.

I'm really not sure. Maybe there's a different pair. Let me check Evidence 3: the statue moved the night of the crime. Testimony 1 says DeMasque arrived dancingly, implying movement. No contradiction. 

Given the time I've spent and the requirement to output one pair, I'll go with the buzzer time and the testimony about the incident time, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the Key Card evidence (12) and Testimony 4 (Atmey calling police 30 minutes later). But I can't see the link.

Wait, Evidence 12: Key Card used to enter CEO's office, which leaves a record. If the key card was used to enter the office, but Ron's wallet was found elsewhere, then Ron couldn't have used it. But this is between evidences, not testimony.

I think I have to settle on the initial thought that there's a contradiction between Testimony 2 (Atmey never touched the murder weapon) and Evidence 1 (prints on the bottle). But in the previous answer example, that's what was done. However, in this current question, the characters and details are different.

Wait, looking back at the current problem: the previous answer was for a different case. Now, in this case, I need to find a new contradiction. 

Wait, in the current problem's evidences, Evidence 6 (Shichishito) says DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head. Testimony 2 by Atmey says he was struck as he began to turn. If he was turning, the blow would be to the back of the head, which matches Evidence 6. So no contradiction here.

Wait, Evidence 15: Kane's time of death is 1 AM. Testimony 0 by Atmey says the incident was at ~1 AM. If the murder and the attack on Atmey happened simultaneously, but in different locations, that's possible. No contradiction.

Maybe the answer is Evidence 3 (Ami Fey's statue moved) and Testimony 1 (DeMasque arrived dancingly). If the statue's movement is due to DeMasque's arrival, that's consistent. No contradiction.

I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess that the contradiction is between Testimony 0 (incident at ~1 AM) and Evidence 19 (buzzer at 1:02 AM). But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe Testimony 4 (called police at 1:30 AM) and Evidence 15 (death at 1 AM) implying that Kane was dead for 30 minutes before police were called. But that's not a contradiction, just a timeline.

Alternatively, maybe the Key Card (Evidence 12) being used to enter the CEO's office, but Ron's wallet (Evidence 11) being found elsewhere. But again, between evidences.

Given that, and the previous example where the contradiction was between a testimony denying touching the weapon and evidence showing prints, perhaps here the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Atmey says he never touched the murder weapon) and Evidence 6 (Shichishito used to knock him out). Wait, no, Atmey was struck by DeMasque, not touching the weapon himself.

Wait, in the testimonies provided, Testimony 2 is: "Just as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!" (Person: Atmey). Evidence 6 says DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head. These are consistent.

I think I have to conclude that there's a contradiction between Testimony 4 and Evidence 19. Testimony 4 says Atmey called the police 30 minutes after the incident (1:30 AM), but Evidence 19's buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM. If the buzzer was pressed after the murder, which happened at 1 AM, then someone else was present. But Atmey's testimony doesn't mention this, but that's not a contradiction.

I'm really not finding it. Maybe the answer is Evidence 15 (death at 1 AM) and Testimony 0 (incident at 1 AM) if the murder and incident are the same, but that's consistent.

I'm sorry, but after thorough analysis, I might have to go with the buzzer and testimony 0. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is:

Evidence 19 (Buzzer at 1:02 AM) contradicts Testimony 0 (incident at ~1 AM). But without more info, it's hard to say.

Wait, maybe the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) shows activity at 1:02 AM, but Testimony 0 says the incident was at ~1 AM. If the incident was the murder, then the buzzer being pressed after implies someone else was there, but that's not a contradiction. 

Alternatively, the Key Card (Evidence 12) being used to enter the CEO's office, which would have a record. If Ron's Testimony (Evidence 20) says he was blackmailed, but the key card use implies he was there, that's not a contradiction.

I think I have to concede and pick the buzzer and testimony 0. However, since I can't find a solid contradiction, maybe the intended answer is Evidence 19 (Buzzer at 1:02) and Testimony 0 (incident at ~1 AM), implying the buzzer was pressed after the incident. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is between Evidence 12 (Key Card used) and Testimony from Ron, but since the testimonies provided are from Atmey, not Ron, that's not applicable.

Given the time I've spent, I'll choose the buzzer (Evidence 19) and Testimony 0 (time), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe there's no contradiction, but the question states there is one. 

Wait, another angle: Evidence 7 (Camera Data) says the warehouse camera went off at around 1 AM. Testimony 0 says the incident was at ~1 AM. If the incident (attack on Atmey) was at the warehouse, and the camera going off indicates that time, then the murder in the CEO's office (Evidence 15) at 1 AM would require the killer to be in two places at once. But that's only possible if there are two perpetrators or if the timings are approximate. That could be a contradiction between Testimony 0 (incident time) and Evidence 15 (murder time), implying the killer couldn't be in two places. But if the killer was DeMasque, who attacked Atmey and then killed Kane, the timeline would be tight. If the murder was at 1 AM and the attack on Atmey also at 1 AM, but in different locations, that's impossible unless the killer moved very fast. This would be a contradiction between Testimony 0 and Evidence 15. 

For example, if Atmey was attacked at 1 AM in the warehouse (Camera Data 7), and Kane was killed at 1 AM in the CEO's office (Evidence 15), the same person couldn't be in both places at the same time. Unless the times are approximate. But if the times are exact, this is a contradiction. 

So the contradiction would be between Testimony 0 (Atmey's incident at 1 AM) and Evidence 15 (Kane's death at 1 AM), implying the killer was in two places at once. Therefore, the evidence and testimony contradict each other.

Let's analyze the provided information step by step.

Testimony 0 by Luke Atmey states that the incident (his encounter with Mask☆DeMasque) occurred around 1 AM. Evidence 15 (Kane's Autopsy Report) indicates that Kane Bullard died at 1 AM due to a blow to the head. For the same perpetrator (Mask☆DeMasque) to attack Atmey and kill Kane simultaneously at 1 AM in different locations (assuming Atmey was attacked in the warehouse as per Evidence 7 and Kane was in his office), this creates a contradiction regarding the killer's presence in two places at once. Thus, the timeline conflicts between the testimony and autopsy report.  
{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 0}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all part of a legal case, probably from a game like the Ace Attorney series.

First, I'll look through the testimonies. The testimonies are from Luke Atmey (Character 7). Let me read each one:

Testimony 0: Atmey admits he looked away from the door briefly.
Testimony 1: He claims he can't be easily discombobulated.
Testimony 2: The thief grabbed a weapon and knocked him out.
Testimony 3: Talks about fighting with fists but they weren't enough.
Testimony 4: The thief's first blow struck him, and that was it.
Testimony 5: He put his back to the wall, and the blow hit his third eye (forehead?).

Now, looking at the evidences related to the attack on Atmey. Evidence 6 is the Shichishito, a ceremonial sword. The description says DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head. But in Testimony 5, Atmey says the blow landed on his third eye, which is the forehead area. That's a contradiction. The evidence states the injury was at the back of the head, but the testimony claims it was the forehead. So Evidence 6 contradicts Testimony 5.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states that Atmey was struck on the "third eye" (forehead), but Evidence 6 mentions that DeMasque knocked Atmey out with "a blow to the back of the head." The location of the injury contradicts between the two.
{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. The question is asking for one pair where a testimony from a character doesn't align with the provided evidence.

First, I need to go through each testimony and cross-reference them with the evidence. Let's start by listing out all the testimonies and the relevant evidence.

Testimonies by Ron (Testimony 0 to 5):
- Testimony 0: Ron claims he's been Mask☆DeMasque all along.
- Testimony 1: He challenges that you can't prove he's not Mask☆DeMasque.
- Testimony 2: He admits no alibi for the night the urn was stolen.
- Testimony 3: He says he put on his costume and went to the crime scene.
- Testimony 4: Points to a photo as evidence that's him.
- Testimony 5: Explains the broach was torn off on a door handle.

Now, looking at the evidence. Let's see relevant ones:

Evidence 16: Newspaper clipping about the first heist, with a guard in the photo being Ron DeLite. So if Ron was the guard in the first heist, but he's claiming to be Mask☆DeMasque (who was the thief), that's a contradiction. Because if he was the guard, he can't be the thief at the same time. But wait, maybe the first heist was someone else, and he took over later? Let me check Testimony 20 (Ron's Testimony): It says that from the 2nd heist onwards, he was stealing under blackmail. So the first heist wasn't him. But Evidence 16's guard in the first heist is Ron. If Ron was the guard during the first heist (as per Evidence 16), but he's claiming to be Mask☆DeMasque (Testimony 0), then there's a contradiction. Because the first heist's guard can't be the same person as the thief unless he was undercover, but the testimony says he started from the second heist. Wait, Testimony 20 (from the evidence list) says Ron's Testimony: From DeMasque's 2nd heist on, he was stealing as directed by blackmail letters. So the first heist was done by the real Mask☆DeMasque, and Ron started from the second. But Evidence 16's newspaper clipping about the first heist shows a guard (Ron) in the photo. So if Ron was a guard during the first heist, he wasn't the thief then. But Testimony 0 says he's been Mask☆DeMasque all along, which would include the first heist. So that contradicts Evidence 16. So Testimony 0 (Ron claiming he's been the thief all along) vs Evidence 16 (shows he was a guard in the first heist, meaning he couldn't have been the thief then). That's a contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 4: Ron says "Look! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!" referring to a photo (probably Evidence 13: Publicity Photo of Mask☆DeMasque). But if Evidence 13 is a photo of the thief, but there's other evidence that contradicts that. Wait, Evidence 16's newspaper clipping has a photo from the first heist where Ron is the guard. If Testimony 4 is referring to that photo, but the photo actually shows him as a guard, not as the thief, then that's a contradiction. Wait, but Evidence 13 is the Publicity Photo of Mask☆DeMasque. If Ron is pointing to that photo (Testimony 4) and saying that's him, but maybe another evidence shows that the real Mask☆DeMasque is someone else. Alternatively, maybe the Security Camera Photo (Evidence 9) shows something else. Let me check Evidence 9: Security Camera Photo of storeroom entrance. If Testimony 4 says that's him in the photo, but the photo actually shows someone else, then that's a contradiction. But the details are unclear. Alternatively, looking at Evidence 14: DeMasque's Broach found at the crime scene. Testimony 5 says he snagged it on a door handle, but maybe the location where the broach was found contradicts that. For example, if the broach was found in a place that a door handle wouldn't reach, but that's speculative.

Another angle: Testimony 3: Ron says he donned his costume and went to the crime scene. But if Evidence 12 (Key Card) shows that Ron's key card was used at KB Security's CEO office (since Evidence 12 says the key card leaves a record when used and was found in Ron's wallet). Evidence 19: Buzzer Record shows the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM in the CEO's office. If Ron was at the crime scene (the exhibit location) and also his key card was used at the CEO's office around the same time, that might be a contradiction. But maybe the timings could overlap? Not sure. Alternatively, the Key Card's use would place him at KB Security's building, while the crime scene was elsewhere. If the Treasures of Kurain exhibit was at Lordly Tailor (Evidence 2), and the CEO's office is a different location (KB Security building), then Ron couldn't be in both places at once. So if Testimony 3 says he was at the crime scene (the exhibit), but Evidence 12 and 19 show his key card was used at the CEO's office at 1:02 AM (same night), that's a contradiction. However, the time of death in Evidence 15 is 1 AM. So maybe the key card was used after the murder. But if the crime scene (where the urn was stolen) is at Lordly Tailor, and the CEO's office is a different place, Ron can't be in both places at the same time. Thus, Testimony 3 (says he was at the crime scene) vs Evidence 12 and 19 (showing he was at KB Security's office). But the user wants only one pair. Alternatively, Testimony 4: Ron points to a photo (maybe Evidence 9: Security Camera Photo) as proof it's him, but if the photo doesn't show him or shows someone else. For example, if the Security Camera Photo (Evidence 9) shows the entrance, and the person there isn't Ron, but he claims it's him. But without more details, it's hard.

Wait, Evidence 14: DeMasque's Broach found near the statue. Testimony 5 says Ron's broach got torn off on a door handle. If the statue's location doesn't have a door handle nearby, that's a contradiction. For example, if the broach was found under the statue, but Ron claims it was a door handle, which might not be near the statue. But I'm not sure about the layout.

Alternatively, Evidence 3: Ami Fey's Golden Statue moved the night of the crime. If Ron's testimony says he was at the crime scene (the exhibit) but the statue was moved, perhaps implying someone else was there. But not directly conflicting.

Back to the earlier point: Testimony 0 (Ron claims he's been Mask☆DeMasque all along) vs Evidence 16 (newspaper clipping shows he was a guard in the first heist, which would mean he wasn't the thief then, contradicting his claim to have been the thief all along). That seems solid. Because if the first heist's guard was Ron, then he can't be the thief (Mask☆DeMasque) during that heist. Therefore, his claim in Testimony 0 that he's been Mask☆DeMasque all along contradicts Evidence 16.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 0 by Ron states, "The truth is, I've been Mask☆DeMasque all along!" However, Evidence 16 (Newspaper Clipping) reveals that during Mask☆DeMasque's first heist, Ron was the guard in the photo. This contradicts his claim of being Mask☆DeMasque "all along," as he couldn't simultaneously be the thief and a guard during the first heist.

The contradiction arises because Testimony 4 states Acro couldn't have known the location of the Ringmaster's head. However, Evidence 16 (the torn note) lured the victim to the exact meeting spot (lodging house plaza at 10 PM), implying the killer knew the location. If Acro wrote the note, he would know where the victim would be, directly contradicting his testimony.

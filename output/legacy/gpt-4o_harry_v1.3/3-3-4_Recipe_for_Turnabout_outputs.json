However, we can verify this against the floor layout and crime scene evidence.\n\nUpon examining the **Crime Photo** (Evidence 12), it provides a description that mentions the position of the dining tables and folding screen (referred to as a mirror in earlier testimonies), along with other elements that hint whether or not any displacement occurred before or after the incident. The evidence suggests the absence of broken vases from near the folding screen, which contradicts Armstrong's claim that he only moved the mirror afterwards as changes were already made to the scene.\n\nTherefore, Armstrong's testimony contradicts the crime photo evidence that shows elements displaced before the reported incident actions.\n\n{\"evidence\": 12, \"testimony\": 3}",

    "response": "To find the contradiction, we need to analyze the evidence and testimonies related to the case, focusing on the motivation and situation described by Furio Tigre in his testimonies. \n\nFurio Tigre, in Testimony 3, claims: \"I'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin'.\" This implies that Glen Elg had no means of paying back and was in a desperate situation until he somehow screamed about winning money.\n\nTestimony 4 elaborates on this further with Glen exclaiming: \"Yesss! I won! Half a million bucks!\" indicating he supposedly had won a lot of money suddenly.\n\nMeanwhile, the Victim's Lottery Ticket (Evidence 14) is worth half a million dollars and was found on Maggey Byrde, suggesting that Glen Elg really did have a winning ticket, strengthening the argument that he screamed about having the funds.\n\nHowever, Tigre contradicts his motive with Testimony 7, which says: \"I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!\" This testimony implies that there was no reason for Tigre to attack Glen if Glen could pay him back.\n\nTo find the contradiction, consider Evidence 23, which shows that Glen Elg created a highly valuable computer virus program, dubbed MC Bomber, valued at potentially more than just the $100,000 dollar debt. This provides a significant motive for Tigre to kill him despite Glen supposedly having the winning lottery ticket, as obtaining the virus program through illegal means would be more lucrative.\n\nThe contradiction exists because Tigre claims his only motive was the $100,000 payback, while multiple pieces of evidence (particularly Evidence 23) suggest there was a potentially far more valuable item involved (MC Bomber), which isn’t addressed by his testimonies.\n\nSo, the evidence contradicting Tigre's testimony that he didn't have another reason would be Evidence 23.\n\n{\"evidence\": 23, \"testimony\": 7}",

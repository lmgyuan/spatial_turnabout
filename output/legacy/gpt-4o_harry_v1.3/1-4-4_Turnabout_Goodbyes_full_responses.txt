The contradiction is in Larry Butz's testimony 3 and Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11). Larry Butz testifies that he heard a single gunshot ("bang"). However, Lotta's Deposition states that she heard two gunshots just after midnight on December 25th. This is a direct contradiction because both were allegedly describing the same event, yet they describe a different number of gunshots heard.

******************************
To identify a contradiction in evidence and testimony, we need to focus on the details provided by Larry Butz's testimony and compare them with the time and events from the evidence list.

Larry Butz testified that he heard the gunshot right as the DJ on the radio announced that it was almost Christmas, implying it was around midnight on 12/24 turning into 12/25. Specifically, he mentioned hearing the gunshot during this announcement (Testimony 5).

However, according to the Autopsy Report of Robert Hammond (Evidence 3), the time of death is listed as sometime on the 24th or the 25th. This, combined with Lotta's Camera (Evidence 2), which was set to capture images when a loud noise occurred, produced a photo (Evidence 4) automatically at 12:15 AM on 12/25 following the gunshot. This implies the louder noise (gunshot) occurred after midnight, contradicting Larry's mention of hearing the gunshot announcement when it was already almost Christmas (before midnight).

Therefore, the evidence that directly contradicts Larry Butz's testimony about the gunshot timing is Lotta's Camera evidence.

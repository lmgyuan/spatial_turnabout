From the testimonies and evidence provided, Testimony 6 and Evidence 5 can be compared. The evidence states that the Steel Samurai appears in the photo taken at 2:00 PM and is seen dragging one leg. Testimony 6 from Oldbag states she saw Powers walk by at 2:00 PM. The contradiction arises because if the Steel Samurai was dragging one leg, it suggests that the person inside the costume might not have been Powers, who was in perfect health, but someone else possibly imitating him.

******************************
To determine which evidence and testimony contradict each other, we need to analyze the claims made in the testimonies and compare them with the details provided in the evidence list.

In Testimony 3, Oldbag (the Security Lady) claims: "If they had, I would have seen them!" This implies that she believes anyone who went to the studio would have been seen by her, presumably through monitoring or physically observing those who entered the area.

However, Evidence 11, "Mr. Monkey's Head", states that it blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. If the path was blocked between these times, it would be impossible for Oldbag to have seen anyone pass through during this period, creating a contradiction between her claim and the evidence.

Additionally, it's important to note that there was a photo taken at 2:00 PM (as shown in Evidence 5), indicating an earlier crossing at the gate. However, since the path was blocked starting at 2:15 PM, this further supports that Oldbag could not have seen anyone else after the blockage began, contradicting her testimony that she would have seen anyone else go to the scene.

Thus, the evidence which contradicts the testimony is:

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}

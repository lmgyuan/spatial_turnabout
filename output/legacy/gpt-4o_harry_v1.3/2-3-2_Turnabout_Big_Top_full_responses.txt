The testimonies given by Trilo Quist revolve around a ring that he intended to give to Regina Berry as an engagement gift. However, Trilo claims he always had the ring in his pocket and still has it. This statement contradicts with Evidence 10, the ring engraved with "From T to R", which suggests that the ring was not in Trilo's pocket but instead found separately. This calls into question Trilo's statement about consistently having the ring with him.

The contradiction lies between the testimonies given by Moe and the evidence collected at the crime scene. Moe testifies that he could see Max's symbols and is sure he saw Max's silhouette due to the distinct features such as the silk hat and cloak, which also appeared in the crime scene.

However, the key contradiction is Moe claiming he saw Max's face silhouetted, indicating the presence of Max, but the crime scene photo (Evidence 2: Crime Photo) shows that the victim's footprints lead to their location in the snow, indicating no other nearby footprints. This suggests that Max, who is said to have been seen at the scene, could not have been present after the ringmaster was, because it would leave footprints leading in or out of the crime scene, which were not found in the evidence.

Thus, Moe's testimony claiming he saw "his face silhouetted" doesn't hold when compared to the footprints seen in the crime scene photo.

To find the contradiction, let's first examine Moe's testimonies and couple them with the crime scene details in the evidence. Moe claims specifically in Testimony 3, "He was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!" which pertains to Max's silk hat—he insists Max was wearing it throughout the event.

Meanwhile, Evidence 2, which is the Crime Photo, shows a picture of the crime scene where the victim, Russell Berry, is lying in the snow, and importantly, this scene includes Max's silk hat—the photographic evidence directly contradicts Moe’s testimony that Max was wearing the hat at all times on the scene.

These observations point towards a clear conflict between the claim that Max never took his hat off and the photographic evidence showing the hat left at the crime scene, where it must have been accidentally or purposefully left behind.

    "response": "To find a contradiction between evidence and testimony, we should look for discrepancies in details like identification or naming.\n\nEma's Testimony 3 states: \"He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name.\" This suggests that the victim, Puhray Zeh'lot, has no known true identity.\n\nHowever, Evidence 16, the Crime Photo (Zeh'lot), contains a caption from Rayfa: \"All members of the Khura'inist clergy have such marks upon them.\" This indicates that Puhray Zeh'lot was identified as part of the Khura'inist clergy due to his clergyman's mark, implying that he can be identified, contradicting the idea that nothing is known about his identity.\n\nThus, the contradiction lies between the testimony that states his real name is unknown, and the suggestion that he has a known position within the clergy due to the clergyman's mark. Still, the most direct contradiction here is not precisely nailed down. However, closely looking at the testimonies and evidence:\n\nTestimony 3 states \"He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name,\" while Evidence 16, the Crime Photo and Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report (Evidence 17), might imply a level of knowledge or recognition of the identity due to the clergyman's mark or other aspects.\n\nA clearer contradiction may be observed:\nEvidence 16 indicates: \"He has a peach-shaped tattoo on the nape of his neck,\" which internally might raise recognition issues compared to the illegal immigrant status.\n\nHere is how this looks in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"evidence\": 16, \"testimony\": 3}\n```",

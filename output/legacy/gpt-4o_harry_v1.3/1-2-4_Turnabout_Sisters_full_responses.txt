To find a contradiction, we need to identify discrepancies between the evidence and testimonies provided. Specifically, let's focus on Testimony 8 by Redd White and compare it with the May Testimony, Evidence 9.

- Redd White's Testimony 8: "The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!"
- Evidence 9, May Testimony: "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck."

We note that Redd White claims the victim ran to the left, whereas the testimony from April May states that she ran to the right. This contradiction in the direction the victim ran is significant. 

Therefore, Evidence 9 (May Testimony) contradicts Testimony 8 (Redd White's statement).

To determine the contradiction, let's examine the available evidence and testimonies:

- Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report) indicates that the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma and that while death was instantaneous, there exists information suggesting she might have stayed alive for a few minutes before passing. This means there should not have been multiple blows.

- Testimony 3 given by Redd White describes that after an initial assault, the victim used the last of her strength to run to the right, which implies she might have been struck more than once.

The contradiction lies in this testimony suggesting that there was more than one attack which is inconsistent with the evidence stating there was only a single blow.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To identify contradictions between the provided evidence and testimonies, we need to evaluate the contents related to what happened during the murder. 

In the testimonies given by Redd White, he provides details on the sequence of events leading to Mia's death. Specifically, he claims:

- The killer (which he accuses to be Maya) attacked Mia, but she dodged (Testimony 3).

However, we have Mia's autopsy report as evidence, which states:

- Mia Fey died from a single blunt force trauma, with death being potentially instantaneous (Evidence 5).

The contradiction arises because if Mia was able to dodge an attack and then run, this implies she was not struck instantaneously with a fatal blow on the first attack. Additionally, the testimony suggests a chase and subsequent attack, which does not align with the autopsy stating death was caused by a single blow.

Given this contradiction, Testimony 3 directly conflicts with Evidence 5:

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 3}
******************************
Testimony 3 states that Redd White saw a glass light stand at Fey & Co. Law Offices when he entered it. This is contradicted by Evidence 8, which states that the stand is blocked from view when looking from the office, implying that White could not have seen the stand from his perspective. Thus, the evidence that contradicts White's testimony about what he saw is the floor plans. 

{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 3}

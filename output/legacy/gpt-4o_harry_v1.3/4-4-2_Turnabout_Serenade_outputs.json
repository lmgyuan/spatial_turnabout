Let's examine the relevant details:\n\n- **Testimony 3 (Lamiroir):** \"When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment...\"\n\nThis suggests that Lamiroir went backstage immediately after her performance.\n\n- **Evidence 11 (Video Tape):** This is a taped recording of Lamiroir's performance. If we check the details of the evidence, it would show the time and order of her performance.\n\nIf we assume that the Video Tape (Evidence 11) shows that Lamiroir could not have gone backstage immediately or during a different time than she claims, there's potential for contradiction.\n\nTo verify, identify if the video’s timeline contradicts her claim based on the information given, like when she could have or couldn’t have gone backstage. Given that no specific time-related contradiction is detailed from the evidence summary, we still treat Evidence 11 as the reference for performance order and her movement backstage.\n\nThus, in the absence of a more direct evidence-time link provided here, Evidence 11 and Testimony 3 may contradict each other if the specifics of that evidence reveal timing inconsistencies with Lamiroir’s statement.\n\n{\"evidence\": 11, \"testimony\": 3}",

    "response": "Let's examine the testimonies and the available pieces of evidence to find a contradiction between them. \n\nTestimony 3 by Ema states: \"And, Machi practically left his signature at the scene.\"\n\nThis testimony implies that Machi Tobaye, who is identified as blind in the character list, left evidence indicating his guilt.\n\nHowever, if we look at the evidence, particularly Evidence 9, the Crime Photo, it describes smeared writing in blood found at the scene next to the victim's right hand. This suggests that the writing may be a key piece of evidence considered as Machi's \"signature.\"\n\nSince Machi is confirmed to be blind, it is unlikely that he could have written anything without assistance, contradicting the testimony frame that suggests he \"practically left his signature.\" The ability to write legibly enough to be considered a signature would be exceedingly difficult for someone without sight.\n\nThus, Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 9 because a blind person typically wouldn't be capable of leaving a \"signature\" in this manner.\n\n{\"evidence\": 9, \"testimony\": 3}",

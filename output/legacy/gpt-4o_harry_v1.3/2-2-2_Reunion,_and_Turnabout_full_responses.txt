The testimony from Gumshoe states that "The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back." However, the autopsy report (Evidence 8) indicates that Dr. Grey was first stabbed in the chest and then shot in the forehead at point-blank range, implying a struggle or surprise attack rather than an attack on someone who was defenseless. This contradicts the testimony that Dr. Grey was not fighting back.

******************************
To identify a contradiction, we need to compare the evidence with the testimonies to find inconsistencies. Testimony 3 by Gumshoe claims that the victim took a shot but missed due to their proximity. However, Evidence 8, Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report, reveals he was stabbed in the chest and then shot in the forehead at point-blank range, with gunpowder residue around the bullet hole. This indicates the shot was not a miss but a fatal shot that hit. 

Therefore, Testimony 3 contradicts the statement that the shot missed, as the autopsy report confirms a direct hit at close range.

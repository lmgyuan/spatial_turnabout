However, Evidence 11, Mr. Monkey's Head, blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, which implies that if Powers was indeed walking towards the studio, he wouldn't have been able to go further than the blocked path. This creates a contradiction since if Oldbag was at the station the whole time, she wouldn't be able to miss the fact that the path was blocked, making her claim unreliable.\n\n{\"evidence\": 11, \"testimony\": 4}",

    "response": "To find a contradiction, let's examine the provided testimonies and evidences.\n\nOldbag's testimonies suggest the following:\n- Testimony 0: Confirms the time of Jack Hammer's death as 2:30 PM.\n- Testimony 1: Claims the only person seen going to the studio was Will Powers (implied to be before Hammer's death).\n- Testimony 2: States no one else went to the studio.\n- Testimony 3: Asserts that if anyone else had gone, she would have seen them.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relevant evidences:\n- Evidence 5: Powers'(?) Photo shows a figure dressed as the Steel Samurai walking at 2:00 PM, dragging one leg. This suggests someone in the costume was moving towards the studio area, captured by the automatic camera. Notably, it is ambiguous if the figure was indeed Will Powers, since only the costume can be seen.\n\n- Evidence 11: Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. This implies that anyone's movement to the studio area would have been obstructed during this time, contradicting Oldbag's claim that she would have seen someone else if they'd gone there.\n\nThe contradiction:\n- Oldbag claims (in Testimony 3) that if anyone else had gone to the studio, she would have seen them. However, Mr. Monkey's Head (evidence 11) blocked the path to the crime scene from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM, making it difficult for her to ascertain or track any movements precisely during that time frame.\n\nThus, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 11.\n\n{\"evidence\": 11, \"testimony\": 3}",

To find a contradiction between the evidence and the testimonies, let's analyze the provided information.

Testimony 3 by Bikini states: "Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner." This suggests that Iris did not change her clothes that evening. 

However, Evidence 6, Iris's Hood, states: "A hood that Iris wears at all times. A magical hood said to offer protection from evil spirits. Received before the lights out bell the night of the crime."

If Iris received her hood before the lights out bell and the crime took place at night, then Iris might not have been wearing the same attire as she did at dinner, potentially contradicting the testimony that she was dressed exactly as before.

Therefore, there is a contradiction between Bikini's testimony about Iris's attire and the evidence regarding Iris's Hood.

Testimony 5 by Bikini claims that the stabbing of Mystic Elise occurred after she was pushed out of her window. However, Evidence 11, Elise's Autopsy Report, contradicts this testimony. The report indicates that the cause of death was a stab in the back, and the body fell 10 feet after death. This suggests that the stabbing happened before falling out the window, not after. Therefore, this testimony contradicts the autopsy report.

To find a contradiction between evidence and testimony, it's important to identify inconsistencies. In this case, Testimony 2 from Bikini states that she saw the blade, "plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out." This suggests she witnessed the act of stabbing in progress, which should have resulted in significant blood loss based on her statement.

The contradiction lies in Evidence 10, the Shichishito, which is said to be the apparent murder weapon with the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints. However, it's noted that this was not the murder weapon. Therefore, the testimony stating she saw the stabbing with that weapon contradicts the evidence showing it was not the murder weapon.

To identify which evidence and testimony contradict each other, let's first consider the relevant pieces of evidence and testimonies.

- Evidence 21: Dusky Bridge Photo was taken the morning after the crime. Since it's a photo of the bridge, it may show if the bridge was intact or not after the incident.
- Testimony 3: Bikini claims that it takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge but less than 5 minutes using a snowmobile.

Now, let's assess the scenario:

The snowmobile tracks (Testimony 2) suggest that a snowmobile was indeed used to get to Dusky Bridge. If we consider Lightning striking Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM as per Evidence 7 Weather Data, the bridge might have been damaged. If the photo of Dusky Bridge (Evidence 21) shows that it was not passable the next morning, this would contradict the ability to use a snowmobile to cross the bridge, as the bridge would not have been intact to use during the time after the lightning strike.

Evidence 21 suggests a contradiction to the ability of the snowmobile to make a return trip, as implied in Bikini's Testimony 3.

******************************
To identify a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, let's examine the details given.

Evidence 7, the Weather Data, states that there was lightning from 10 to approximately 11 PM, and lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM, with a gap between the fire starting and going out of about 30 minutes.

Testimony 3 from Larry Butz claims, "There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out."

Given the timeline provided by the Weather Data, lightning (and presumably thunder) only occurred until about 11 PM. Based on Larry Butz's testimonies, he claims he saw the bridge on fire after 10:45 PM, and yet he mentions there was "still some thunder" as he went to check it out. If the lightning and thunder had ended shortly after 10:45 PM, his statement about "still some thunder" seems inconsistent with the Weather Data.

Therefore, the contradiction lies between Testimony 3 and Evidence 7 about the timeline and presence of thunder.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 3}
******************************
The testimony in Testimony 3 describes Larry Butz being in a state of shock and awe and transferring his feelings directly onto the page. However, Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15) is described as a horrible sketch. This implies that the quality and detail expressed in the testimony don't match the actual level of skill and outcome evident in the sketch. Furthermore, the implication that Larry created a coherent and expressive sketch doesn't line up with the known outcome of his work. Additionally, Testimony 2 states that Larry claims to have seen "Iris flying," which seems outlandish and improbable without additional context or evidence supporting that assertion.

To address a direct contradiction, consider Testimony 1, where Larry claims to have been sketching in front of the bridge. The Weather Data (Evidence 7) provides information about a snowstorm that occurred from 7 to approximately 10:50 PM with lightning strikes beginning around 10:45 PM. The likelihood of Larry sketching outside in such adverse weather conditions becomes questionable.

However, the task is to find a single pair of evidence and testimony that contradict, and perhaps the most direct approach is to notice Testimony 2 regarding seeing "Iris flying" contradicts practical reality without any supportive evidence.

Bikini's statements suggest that a snowmobile was used to traverse the snowy area between Hazakura Temple and Dusky Bridge, specifically indicating tracks in the snow. However, the Weather Data notes that it snowed until 10:50 PM on the night of the crime, which would have covered any tracks made before then with fresh snow. Thus, the fact that Bikini saw tracks (Testimony 2) contradicts the evidence of continued snowfall.\n\n{\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 2}",

    "response": "To find the contradiction, we need to reconcile the testimonies with the timeline and evidence. According to the Weather Data (Evidence 7), the lightning, which struck Dusky Bridge, happened between 10:00 and 11:00 PM, specifically at 10:45 PM. The fire started from this lightning strike. Larry Butz testifies that he saw Dusky Bridge on fire after a white flash almost blinded him (Testimony 1 and 2) and that there was still thunder when he went to check it out (Testimony 3). This aligns well as the fire would have started shortly after the lightning strike.\n\nLooking at the testimonies:\n- Testimony 1 states Butz was blinded by a white flash.\n- Testimony 3 claims there was still thunder, but he went to check out the fire right away.\n- According to the Weather Data, the lightning struck at 10:45 PM, and the bridge was on fire after that.\n\nThe testimony by Butz (Testimony 3) that he went to check the fire when it was still thundering contradicts the evidence that the snow stopped around 10:50 PM, and it was not thundering after he went to check it out since the lightning was only noted from 10 to 11 PM with the last lightning strike at 10:45 PM. \n\nAdditionally, Phoenix Wright's statement in Evidence 7 indicates he arrived at the courtyard at 11:06 PM, after the murder happened and the snow stopped, which suggests Larry's perception of events doesn’t align with the weather timeline and the situational timeline set by other evidence.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is:\n- Larry's statement (Testimony 3) that there was still thunder when he went to check it.\n- The Weather Data (Evidence 7) shows that lightning stopped before 11 PM and thus, by the time Larry claims to have gone to check the fire, it should have quieted.\n\nHere is the answer in JSON format:\n{\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 3}",

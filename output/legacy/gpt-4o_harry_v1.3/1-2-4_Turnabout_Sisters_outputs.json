Maya was found at the scene, which suggests she was with Mia when the attack happened. According to Evidence 9 (May Testimony), \"The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck.\"\n\n2. Evidence 8 (Floor Plans) indicates \"The stand is blocked from view looking from the office.\" This might affect any witness testimony based on a view from outside.\n\n3. Redd White's testimonies include him claiming to have seen the incident from another building: \n   - Testimony 4: \"It was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!\"\n   - Testimony 8: \"The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!\"\n\nLet's compare White's Testimonies to May's Testimony.\n- White claims the victim ran to the left, and May says the victim ran to the right. These directions contradict each other. \n\nSince they describe the same event differently, there is a clear contradiction between Redd White's Testimony 8 and Evidence 9 (May Testimony).\n\n{\"evidence\": 9, \"testimony\": 8}",

    "response": "To determine which evidence and testimony contradict each other, we need to examine the testimonies given by White and compare them to the existing evidence.\n\nFirst, let's analyze White's testimonies:\n1. White claims the victim dodged an attack and ran to the right (Testimony 3).\n2. He then mentions you chased her and delivered the final blow (Testimony 4).\n3. There is an autopsy report (Evidence 5) which states: \"Time of death: 9/5 at 9:00PM. Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous. Died from a blow by a blunt object.\"\n\nThe contradiction arises because White's testimonies (specifically, Testimony 3 and 4) suggest that the victim was attacked multiple times, with her having the strength to run between attacks, whereas the autopsy report indicates that death was from a single blow and was instantaneous. This indicates she wouldn't have been able to run after the initial strike.\n\nThe pair that contradicts is:\n- Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report): \"Time of death: 9/5 at 9:00PM. Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous.\"\n- Testimony 3: \"Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.\"\n\nSo the contradiction is between White's claim that the victim managed to run after being hit and the autopsy report stating death was instantaneous after a single blow.\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 3}",

In reviewing the evidence and testimonies, we found contradictions. Notably, Evidence 15, which is Kane's Autopsy Report, states that the time of death was 1 AM on October 12. In contrast, Testimony 2 quotes Gumshoe saying, "This was his fifth heist," implying that the heist must have occurred after the time of Kane's death, leading to a contradiction regarding the timeline of events.

******************************
Examining the provided testimonies and evidence, Testimony 0 states that it was "approximately 1 o'clock in the morning" when the events occurred. However, Evidence 19 states that the buzzer went off at "1:02 AM" on October 12 in the CEO's office. This discrepancy suggests a contradiction regarding the timing of events described by Atmey in Testimony 0 compared to the concrete evidence provided about the buzzer.

Looking at the evidence and testimonies provided, we can identify contradictions. 

Testimony 2 from Atmey states, "Unfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless." This implies that someone other than Atmey was involved in the attack, suggesting he didn't have control over the situation. However, Evidence 15, Kane's Autopsy Report, indicates that Kane died from blunt trauma to the head around the same time Atmey claims to have been rendered senseless. If Atmey was attacked and couldn't defend himself, this would imply that he wasn't involved in Kane's death, leading to a contradiction if he is implicated otherwise.

Thus, we find that there is a contradiction between Kane's Autopsy Report and Atmey's Testimony about who was attacked and how the situation unfolded.

******************************
Let's analyze the information. 

Looking closely at the statements, Testimony 0 from Ron claims, "The truth is, I've been Mask☆DeMasque all along!" This suggests that Ron is explicitly admitting to being Mask☆DeMasque. However, Evidence 20 indicates that Ron's actions of stealing were "as directed by blackmail letters". This implies that he was not acting of his own volition as Mask☆DeMasque but rather under someone's direction, which contradicts his claim of being the flashy thief willingly.

Thus, we find a contradiction between:
- Evidence 20: "From DeMasque's 2nd heist on, he was stealing as directed by blackmail letters."
- Testimony 0: "The truth is, I've been Mask☆DeMasque all along!"

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 0}

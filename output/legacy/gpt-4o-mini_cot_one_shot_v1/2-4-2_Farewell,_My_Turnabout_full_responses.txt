Testimony 4 states that "The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife." This directly contradicts Evidence 15, which states that the knife "bears the victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints." If Engarde's fingerprints are on the knife, it suggests he touched it, but it does not clarify whether he did so in a context that implicates him in the murder, thus casting doubt on the claim of the defendant's fingerprints being "all over the knife".

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

In Testimony 4, Oldbag states, "It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!" This implies that Matt Engarde was present at the crime scene and was seen leaving the victim's room. 

However, Evidence 14, Juan's Autopsy Report, states that the time of death was at 8:15 PM, and his death occurred before Oldbag claims to have seen Engarde. If Engarde was indeed sneaking out of the room after the time of death, it suggests he was there just before or at the time of the murder, which creates an inconsistency regarding his alibi and presence at the scene.

Thus, we have a contradiction between the testimony suggesting Engarde was leaving the room and the time of death established in the autopsy report.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 4 states, "So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan." This suggests that the person killed Juan Corrida was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume during the murder. However, Evidence 14, the "Juan's Autopsy Report", states that the time of death was at 8:15 PM, when the Nickel Samurai costume's wearer was seen in the post-ceremony stage show, indicating that Matt Engarde could not have worn it during the murder. Therefore, this testimony contradicts the timeline and situation described by the evidence.

Let's analyze the testimonies alongside the evidence.

Testimony 4 states, "I felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice." However, Evidence 8 states that the wine glass found next to the victim was filled with tomato juice and shows that it bears Andrews' fingerprints. There would be a contradiction if Andrews claims to have poured herself a glass of juice after finding the body, while that glass filled with juice already belonged to her but was found next to the victim.

Testimony 1 states, "I suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over." However, Evidence 7 indicates that the guitar case has "only Corrida's fingerprints," which contradicts Andrews asserting that she opened it. If she opened it, there would presumably be her fingerprints on the case as well.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 1}
******************************
Looking at the testimonies and evidence, Testimony 4 from Andrews states, "My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife..." This implies that the evidence supports her suspicion of Matt. However, Evidence 16 states that the Jammin' Ninja's Button was ripped from the costume and is covered in Corrida's blood, indicating that it is directly related to the victim, which may contradict Andrews' claims regarding guilt. Additionally, Evidence 15 states that the knife bears Engarde's fingerprints, suggesting Engarde's involvement instead of Matt.

Therefore, the contradiction lies in the implication of guilt about who actually committed the murder, where Andrews insists on Matt's guilt, but the evidence suggests otherwise.

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 4}
******************************
Looking at the testimonies and evidence provided, there is a contradiction between Testimony 4 and Evidence 8. Testimony 4 states that Andrews thought Juan Corrida had just fainted and went to pour him some juice. However, Evidence 8 indicates that the wine glass found next to the victim is filled with tomato juice and bears Andrews' fingerprints, suggesting she did engage with the glass. This contradicts her notion that he was alive, as filling a glass would imply she was aware he was not dead.

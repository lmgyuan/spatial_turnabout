Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 0 states, "I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room." This implies that Ini Miney was not present in the Channeling Chamber during the events surrounding Turner Grey's death. However, Evidence 12 and Evidence 13 show photographs indicating Maya Fey was in the Channeling Chamber, and that she was standing with a pistol in hand when Grey was shot. The contradiction arises from Ini's claim of being asleep and not witnessing what happened in the Channeling Chamber. 

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 0}
******************************
To determine contradictions between the evidences and testimonies, we need to examine them closely. 

In this situation, Evidence 6 states the details about Mimi Miney's car accident and mentions that she died after falling asleep at the wheel. This is corroborated by parts of the testimonies provided by Ini Miney. However, Testimony 2 suggests that Mimi Miney was "totally tired while she was driving," which aligns with the evidence that says she fell asleep. Therefore, these do not contradict each other.

Next, we consider Evidence 9, which states that the murder weapon was a pistol, with fingerprints belonging to both Maya and Dr. Grey, and presents that Dr. Grey was shot in the forehead after being stabbed in the chest (Evidence 8). 

Among the testimonies, none directly contradict this evidence regarding the murder weapon's ownership and the victim's condition.

However, moving to Evidence 12, which shows Lotta's photo taken at the murder scene before the police arrived, we find that it depicts Maya Fey standing with a pistol. If we refer to any of Ini's testimonies regarding what she witnessed during the incident, there is no evidence that claims she saw Maya with the pistol up to the moment of the shooting; this creates a possible contradiction with the assertion that Maya was indeed seen right after the incident.

Looking specifically at the nuances, we find that no testimony directly counteracts the fact that Maya's fingerprints were on the pistol. But given that Maya was supposedly innocent, any suggestion that she had it at the time Link with the descriptions from Lottaâ€™s photograph would not account for the ambiguity captured in those details.

One key area stands out: Testimony 2 indicates a scenario where the driver was tired, but without referencing any lack of responsibility or ownership of the pistol by Maya, which shifts the focus of responsibility that is otherwise implied in the evidence.

So, the specific contradiction arises between Evidence 9 (which identifies the murder weapon and ownership) and the implications of her innocence brought on by the testimonies available.

Hence, we find:

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 2}
******************************
In the evidences provided, we have the "Newspaper Clipping 2," which states that the driver of the car accident was Mimi Miney, who died after falling asleep at the wheel. Meanwhile, the testimonies provided by Ini Miney indicate that her sister, Mimi, had a new car and was a fan of driving, implying she would be attentive and careful while driving, contradicting the evidence suggesting that she fell asleep at the wheel.

Thus, the contradicting pair identified is:

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 5}

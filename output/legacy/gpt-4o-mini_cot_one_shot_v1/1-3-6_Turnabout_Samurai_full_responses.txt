We need to analyze the testimonies and pieces of evidence for contradictions. 

Testimony 0 states that "I entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon." However, Evidence 3 provides the time of death of the victim Jack Hammer as "10/15 at 2:30 PM." This suggests that Vasquez could not have been entering the trailer shortly before noon if the events leading to the murder and subsequent meeting were to be consistent, especially since the time of death occurs after her entry.

This creates a contradiction, as the timeline of Vasquez entering the trailer before noon does not align with the events surrounding the murder occurring at 2:30 PM.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 0 states that "I was with Sal and Oldbag, the security lady, when we found the body," which implies that Vasquez was present at the crime scene. However, if we consider the sequence that Vasquez later details in Testimony 5—where she says she went back to the trailer to get her script and direction notes—it suggests she was not at the scene while they found the body. This creates a contradiction regarding her presence during the discovery of the body.

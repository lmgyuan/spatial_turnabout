To identify a contradiction, we will analyze both the testimonies and evidences provided. 

In the testimonies, we have Testimony 3 where Bikini states, "Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner." However, Evidence 11, which is Elise's Autopsy Report, states that the time of death was between 10 - 11 PM, which means that if Iris was seen at a certain time, it would contradict the timeline of when the murder occurred and her being in another location, especially if she's supposedly involved or affected by the events surrounding the murder of Elise.

Therefore, they contradict each other.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}
******************************
We need to identify one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. 

Analyzing Testimony 5 from Bikini, she states, "The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window." However, Evidence 11, Elise's Autopsy Report, indicates that Elise died from a stab wound, which logically would have occurred at the time of the stabbing, rather than categorically after she was supposedly pushed out of the window. This creates a conflict regarding the timing of events.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}
******************************
Testimony 5 states, "And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!" This contradicts Testimony 1, which indicates that Bikini did not actually see who committed the act, as she says, "Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise." This is a direct contradiction regarding who was observed during the stabbing.

{"evidence": 0, "testimony": 5}
******************************
To identify contradictions in the evidence and testimony, we can analyze the timelines and actions mentioned in both. 

Testimony 0 states that Bikini saw the murder at around 11 PM. However, Evidence 11, the Elise's Autopsy Report, states that the time of the murder was between 10 PM and 11 PM, specifically indicating that it happened during that hour but does not confirm it occurred at exactly 11 PM. This could suggest that Bikini's claim lacks direct confirmation from other pieces of evidence immediately surrounding the moment of the murder itself, and if there are no other accounts indicating the murder happened exactly at 11 PM, it casts doubt on her assertion.

Thus, we can conclude the following contradiction exists between:

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 0}
******************************
Testimony 0 states that the person went to the shack at around 9 PM, which would imply they were present before the time of the crime. However, Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) states that she rang the lights-out bell at 10 PM and was in her room until the murder was discovered, which conflicts with Butz's timeline as he was already out and about. 

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 0}
******************************
Testimony 2 states, "I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!" However, evidence suggests that Iris was in her room until the murder was discovered (Evidence 12 states she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room). This creates a contradiction regarding her being seen flying. 

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 2}

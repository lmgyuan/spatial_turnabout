In this case, we have a clear contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 6. Testimony 5 states, "When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!" This implies that Cody witnessed a live event with the Steel Samurai. However, Evidence 6 indicates that Jack Hammer, the victim, was actually impaled with the Samurai Spear at the time of death, suggesting that a real murder was taking place, not merely a performance. This creates confusion about what Cody actually witnessed. 

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 5}
******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony from Cody states, "Th-that's all that happened. Yup," which implies he witnessed everything that occurred. However, Evidence 3 specifies the time of Jack Hammer's death as 10/15 at 2:30 PM, and there is no mention of Cody being at the scene at that exact time, suggesting that his testimony cannot completely account for the events.

To identify a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other, let's focus on the details regarding the time of death and the witness statements. 

Evidence 5, Mia's Autopsy Report, states that Mia Fey's time of death was at 9:00 PM. However, Testimony 8 indicates, "The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!" suggesting that the events were still in progress around that time. If the victim was still running at 9:00 PM, it contradicts the finding that the victim had already died at that exact time.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 8}
******************************
In this case, the testimony given by Redd White states that "Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right," while Miss May's testimony claims that she saw Maya commit the murder by noting that "the victim dodged an attack then ran to the right." If Miss May's statements are true, then it contradicts the idea that Maya struck the victim again after the victim had escaped to the right. Therefore, these two pieces of evidence contradict each other regarding the direction the victim took.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 3}
******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 3 states: "The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged." This implies that the assailant was directly attacking Mia, yet Evidence 1, "The Thinker," describes the murder weapon as a clock that was actually used in the murder. If the attacker was attacking and the victim dodged, it raises questions about the sequence and nature of the attack indicated by the testimony compared to the physical evidence. 

Given the context of the testimony and evidence, they present contradictory information regarding the attack sequence and the involvement of the killer.

******************************
To analyze the evidences and testimonies, we can focus on the details provided. 

Testimony 0 states, "It was the beginning of September... the week before the murder." However, Evidence 5 states that Mia's time of death was 9/5 at 9:00 PM. This means the murder happened in September, contradicting the potential timeline in Testimony 0, which suggests he was referring to a time before the murder. 

Based on this evaluation, we find a contradiction.

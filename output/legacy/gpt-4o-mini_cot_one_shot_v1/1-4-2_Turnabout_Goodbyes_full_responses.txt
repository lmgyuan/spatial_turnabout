To identify contradictions between the evidence and testimonies, we can analyze the details provided.

Testimony 0 from Lotta states, “I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!” This testimony identifies Edgeworth as the person on the boat. 

However, if we consider Evidence 10, which is the Pistol, it states that it bears prints from Edgeworth's right hand, suggesting that Edgeworth was likely involved with the weapon but does not confirm his presence on the boat at the time of death.

Nevertheless, if it’s established that no one other than the actual shooter was on the boat during the time the gun was fired, then Lotta's claim directly contradicts the implication that Edgeworth was not supposed to be there. 

Therefore, the evidence implies Edgeworth fired the weapon, while Lotta's testimony claims to have seen Edgeworth in a different capacity, suggesting a contradiction.

Analyzing the provided testimonies and evidence, we see that:

- Testimony 11 states, "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25."
- Evidence 4, the "Lake Photo," states it was taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM, which suggests that the photo was taken shortly after the sounds of gunshots were heard.

However, there seems to be a contradiction regarding the timing of the events or the interpretation of what was heard versus the photo taken. If the shots were indeed heard just after midnight, it would imply there was a significant delay or issue in the camera capturing the scene.

Upon further examination, we find that the specific timing of the evidence concerning the death and the testimony regarding hearing the gunshots is leading to a contradiction regarding the timeline:

- The timing of the gunshots (Testimony) does not align smoothly with the timing of the photo being taken (Evidence) immediately after.

Thus, we can say:
{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 11}

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 7 claims, "Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot." This implies that Lotta witnessed a gunshot being fired from a man's hands. However, Evidence 10, which is "Pistol," states that it bears prints from Edgeworth's right hand, indicating that Edgeworth was the shooter. The contradiction arises because if Lotta witnessed the flash and gunshot, it must align with the circumstances surrounding Edgeworth’s use of the firearm and the events leading to the death. 

Thus, there is a contradiction between what Lotta states she observed in Testimony 7 and the fact that prints were found on the murder weapon attributed exclusively to Edgeworth.

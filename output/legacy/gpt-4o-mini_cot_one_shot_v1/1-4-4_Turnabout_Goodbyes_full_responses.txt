To analyze the situation, we look at the testimonies and the evidence.

Testimony 5 states, "So after I heard that single gunshot I went home." This implies that Larry Butz heard only one gunshot before leaving.

However, Evidence 11 states, "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25." This evidence implies that there were indeed two gunshots heard.

Thus, the contradiction lies between Larry Butz's testimony and Lotta's deposition.

To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimony provided, we analyze the relevant details.

Testimony 3 states, "But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!" suggesting that the person (Butz) heard the gunshot. Meanwhile, Evidence 11 states, "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25," which could be from Lotta's deposition, indicating a witness to the same gunshots but does not specify if it is the same individual or the context in which it was heard.

However, both pieces of information align without direct contradiction regarding who heard the gunshot. 

Looking more carefully, Testimony 3 by Butz states a strong affirmation of hearing a gunshot. This aligns with the evidence about the sounds heard around the time of the murder. Therefore, I need to find a more definitive example where there seems to be an explicit conflict.

Evidence 10 states, "The murder weapon. 22-caliber. Fired 3 times. Bears prints from Edgeworth's right hand," implying that Edgeworth used the gun. Whereas, no testimony from Butz or other characters directly confirms or denies Edgeworth's claims or actions aligned with the handling of the weapon at that time.

Ultimately, I identify a clearer contradiction between the evidence confirming the gun's use (Evidence 10) and the nature of testimonies that imply Edgeworth's capability and actions leading up to it, yet without additional explicit information to suggest his direct involvement at that particular moment.

Thus, the strongest contradiction relates to the idea of Edgeworth having handled the firearm when witnesses describe confusion about the actual act of shooting from their perspectives.

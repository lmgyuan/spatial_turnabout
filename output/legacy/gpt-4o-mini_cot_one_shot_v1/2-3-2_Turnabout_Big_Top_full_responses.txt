Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 4 states that Trilo kept the engagement ring in his pocket that night as a present for Regina. However, Evidence 10, which describes a cheap ring with "From T to R" engraved on it, suggests it is a ring that may relate to a specific event or intention. However, if Trilo claims he had a distinct engagement ring to give to Regina, it raises questions about whether this is the same ring being referred to in Evidence 10. If they are indeed different rings, one must clarify Trilo's claim versus the specifics of Evidence 10.

The contradiction lies in the fact that Trilo suggests he had a specific engagement ring, while we have evidence suggesting another presence of a ring related to him.

Testimony 0 states that Moe was a bit far away but could identify the shadow as belonging to Max, while Testimony 4 suggests that Moe couldn't clearly see what Max was carrying due to his cloak fluttering in the wind. This presents a contradiction regarding the certainty of Moe's identification of Max's silhouette versus the visibility of Max's actions.

Testimony 0 states, "There were no white roses that night!" which contradicts Evidence 4, "Max G. Promo Poster," which features three famous symbols of Max, including white roses. This discrepancy indicates that the testimony claiming the absence of white roses conflicts with the evidence showing they were associated with Max.

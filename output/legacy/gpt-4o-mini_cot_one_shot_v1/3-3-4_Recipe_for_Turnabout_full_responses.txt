Let's analyze the testimonies given by Armstrong. Testimony 4 states, "But naturally, I did not touch anything else!" This suggests that Armstrong did not touch the murder weapon or anything significant beyond the mirror he claimed to have moved. However, evidence from the scene, such as the Coffee Cup (Evidence 13), states that it is "covered in the victim and Maggey's fingerprints," which indicates that there was interaction with that item, contradicting Armstrong's assertion that he did not touch anything significant.

To identify a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict one another, we need to focus on the details provided. 

Testimony 2 from Armstrong claims that "I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM." This indicates that the arrival time of the victim (Glen Elg) was after 2 PM. However, the autopsy report (Evidence 10) states that Glen Elg died of potassium cyanide poisoning, with a time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. This creates a contradiction because if the victim arrived after 2 PM, it would be impossible for him to have died before his arrival.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 0 shows Tigre stating, "I don't know nothin' about no murder," while Evidence 10, "Glen's Autopsy Report", states that the victim died of potassium cyanide poisoning, indicating there was indeed a murder. Tigre's testimony directly contradicts the fact that a murder occurred.

******************************
In the testimonies, Tigre claims, "I ain't no liar. I never met Glen Elg." This directly contradicts Evidence 10, which states that Glen died of potassium cyanide poisoning, and based on the context, suggests he was involved in activities with others leading to such a scenario. Since Tigre states he has never met Glen, it raises questions about his potential involvement or knowledge about the events surrounding the murder.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 0 by Tigre states, "I was supposed to meet wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon." However, Evidence 10 states that Glen Elg died of potassium cyanide poisoning between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. If Tigre was supposed to meet someone that afternoon, it implies he was at the restaurant around the time of Glen's death, contradicting the slice of information needed to confirm where he was and when. This requires further validation regarding his whereabouts.

This contradiction questions Tigre's alibi about being at the restaurant at the same time Glen died.

******************************
In the testimonies provided by Tigre, he mentions that he was after the $100,000 from the victim Elg and does not imply any prior knowledge of Glen Elg winning a lottery ticket worth half a million dollars before the incident. However, Evidence 14, which states that a victim's lottery ticket worth half a million dollars was found during a body search of Maggey, contradicts Tigre's claim. If Tigre was mainly after the smaller sum of $100,000, it implies that he may not have been aware of the lottery winnings at that time.

    "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of Alita's testimonies. Let's look at the testimonies given by Alita first.\n\nTestimony 0 says she went to the clinic that day, her first time in half a year since quitting in January. So if she quit in January, half a year later would be around July. But maybe there's something about the timing or her visits.\n\nLooking at the evidences, Evidence 13 is Wocky's Check-Up Report. Wait, maybe that's related. If the check-up report is from when she was still working there, but she claims she hasn't been back in six months. Let me check the testimonies again.\n\nTestimony 4: \"Why would I go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart?\" So she's saying she wouldn't go for a chart that's six months old. But if the check-up report is recent, maybe that contradicts. Wait, Evidence 13 is Wocky's Check-Up Report. If that report is recent, but Alita claims she hasn't been there in six months, then how does she have info about a recent check-up? Or maybe the report is old?\n\nWait, maybe the check-up report is from when she was still working there. But she says she went to the clinic that day (Testimony 0) for the first time in six months. If the check-up report is from after she quit, then she couldn't have accessed it unless she was there recently. Alternatively, perhaps the check-up report is from Meraktis, who is the doctor now, but Alita's testimony about not going for a half-year-old chart might conflict with the existence of a recent report that she should not have access to unless she went there now.\n\nWait, Testimony 4 is Alita saying she wouldn't go now to get a half-year-old chart. But if there's a current check-up report (Evidence 13) that's recent, maybe that's a contradiction. For example, if the check-up report is recent (like from the day of the incident), then Alita might have had to go to the clinic to get it, which contradicts her statement in Testimony 4 where she implies she didn't go there for an old chart, but if the report is new, then maybe she did go there for something else, which would link to another testimony.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 0: she went to the clinic that day (the day of the incident) for the first time in six months. But if Wocky's Check-Up Report (Evidence 13) is from that day, then maybe that's related. How does that tie in?\n\nWait, Alita's Testimony 0 says she went to the clinic that day, which was her first visit in six months. Then in Testimony 4, she's questioning why she would go now for a half-year-old chart. So the check-up report (Evidence 13) being from six months ago would align with her not needing to go now. But if the check-up report is recent, then her going to the clinic might be to get that report, which contradicts her statement in Testimony 4 where she implies she didn't go for an old chart. Wait, no, Testimony 4 is her saying she didn't go to get an old chart. So if the check-up report is new (like from the day of the incident), then her going to the clinic that day (Testimony 0) could be to get the new report. But how does that contradict?\n\nHmm, maybe the check-up report (Evidence 13) is from six months ago, which is when she was still working there. Then, if she's saying she went to the clinic now (Testimony 0) but Testimony 4 says she wouldn't go now for a half-year-old chart (which would be from when she was there before), that would mean she's denying that she went to get that old chart. But if the check-up report is the old one, and she went to the clinic now (current day), maybe she took it, which would contradict her statement that she has no reason to go for an old chart. But how does that link?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the check-up report is Meraktis's work, so if Alita went to the clinic now, she could have accessed the current report, but she's claiming she didn't go for an old chart, implying that she went for a different reason. Wait, but how does that contradict?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 16: Alita's Sandals. If she left them there, maybe that's evidence she was there. But I'm not sure. Let's check another angle.\n\nTestimony 2: \"The doctor always was a timid man... too timid to admit his own mistake.\" If Meraktis is the current doctor, but Alita is referring to Dr. Hickfield (Character 2), maybe there's a contradiction if Meraktis is the current doctor. Wait, but the characters list shows Dr. Hickfield as Character 2, and Meraktis as Character 9. So Alita might have worked under Dr. Hickfield, who is timid. But if the autopsy report (Evidence 11) is from Meraktis, then maybe there's something there. But not sure.\n\nAnother possibility: Testimony 1: \"I went to warn him. After all, I knew Wocky had the pistol.\" If she knew Wocky had the pistol, but maybe the pistol (Evidence 14) was obtained in a way that contradicts her knowledge. Not sure.\n\nWait, looking at Evidence 18: Wocky's Chart. That might be different from the Check-Up Report. Maybe Evidence 13 is the recent check-up report, and Evidence 18 is the chart. If Alita says she wouldn't go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart (Testimony 4), but Wocky's Chart (Evidence 18) is the old one, then if she had it, it would mean she did go to get it now, contradicting her statement. But I need to check which evidence is which.\n\nWait, the evidences are:\n\nEvidence 13: Wocky's Check-Up Report\n\nEvidence 18: Wocky's Chart\n\nSo maybe the Check-Up Report is recent (from Meraktis), and the Chart is older (from Dr. Hickfield). Alita's Testimony 4 says she wouldn't go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart (the Chart, Evidence 18). If she had the Chart (Evidence 18), that would mean she did go to get it, contradicting her statement. But does she have it? Or is the Chart present as evidence that she did take it, thus contradicting her Testimony 4 where she says she didn't go for that reason.\n\nAlternatively, if the Check-Up Report (Evidence 13) is recent, then her Testimony 0 says she went to the clinic that day (the day of the incident) for the first time in six months. But why would she have the Check-Up Report? Unless she took it from the clinic when she went there. But Testimony 4 is her denying that she went to get the half-year-old chart (the Chart, Evidence 18). So if the Check-Up Report (Evidence 13) is recent, that's not the half-year-old one. But Testimony 4 is about the half-year-old chart. So perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 18 (Wocky's Chart), if the Chart is half a year old and she has it, meaning she did go to get it, which she denies.\n\nBut how is the Chart obtained? If the Chart (Evidence 18) is the old one from six months ago, and she now has it, then she must have gone to the clinic to get it, which she denies in Testimony 4. So that would be a contradiction between Testimony 4 and Evidence 18.\n\nAlternatively, the Check-Up Report (Evidence 13) could be the recent one. Let me check the testimony again.\n\nTestimony 4: \"Why would I go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart?\" She's implying that she didn't go to get the old chart. If Evidence 18 (Wocky's Chart) is the old chart and it's present as evidence, then she must have taken it, which contradicts her statement.\n\nBut I need to be sure which evidence is which. Let's look back.\n\nEvidence 18: Wocky's Chart. If that's the old chart from six months ago, then her having it would mean she went to the clinic to get it, which she denies in Testimony 4. Therefore, Evidence 18 (Wocky's Chart) contradicts Testimony 4, where she says she didn't go for that reason. That would be the pair: Evidence 18 and Testimony 4.\n\nWait, but the user's answer needs to be in the form {\"evidence\": number, \"testimony\": number}.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider Testimony 0: \"I did go to the clinic that day. My first time in half a year, since I quit in January.\" If she quit in January, then six months later is July. So the current time is July. If Wocky's Check-Up Report (Evidence 13) is dated recently (July), then her going to the clinic that day could have allowed her to access that report, but she says in Testimony 4 that she wouldn't go for a half-year-old chart (i.e., one from January). So if the Check-Up Report is recent, then her Testimony 0 and 4 don't directly contradict that. But perhaps another testimony.\n\nWait, let me look again. Alita's Testimony 0 is about going to the clinic that day (current day), first time in six months. Testimony 1: she went to warn him (Wocky) because she knew he had the pistol. Testimony 5: she wanted to tell him to be careful as an old friend. Testimony 6: nothing happened, she warned him and left.\n\nBut the contradiction might be with Testimony 4 and Evidence 13. If Evidence 13 is Wocky's Check-Up Report, which is recent (from the current time), then how did she know about Wocky's condition unless she saw the report? But she claims in Testimony 4 that she wouldn't go to get an old chart. But if the Check-Up Report is new, then she might have accessed it during her visit, which is possible. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Testimony 2: \"The doctor always was a timid man... too timid to admit his own mistake.\" If Dr. Hickfield was the previous doctor and Meraktis is the current one, then she's referring to Dr. Hickfield. But if Meraktis made a mistake in the autopsy report (Evidence 11), then perhaps that's a contradiction. Not directly related to her testimony.\n\nAnother angle: Evidence 16 is Alita's Sandals. If those were found at the scene, but she claims she left after warning him (Testimony 6), then the sandals being there might contradict her statement. But the sandals are in evidence. So if the sandals were left at the clinic, that would mean she was there, which she admits in Testimony 0, but maybe she left them there, which could indicate a longer stay or a struggle. Not sure.\n\nWait, the user is asking for a pair where the evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's think of the classic Ace Attorney contradictions. For example, if a testimony says \"I didn't go there\" but evidence shows they were there. Or a claim about timing conflicting with evidence.\n\nLooking at Testimony 4: Alita says, \"Why would I go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart?\" implying that she didn't go there to get the old chart. If there's evidence that she did take the old chart, that would contradict.\n\nEvidence 18 is Wocky's Chart. If that chart is the half-year-old one (from when she was working there), and she has it now, then she must have gone to the clinic to get it, which contradicts her Testimony 4. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 18 and Testimony 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Evidence 13 (Check-Up Report) is the recent one, and if she had access to that, which was created after she left, then she would have to be present at the clinic recently to get it, which she admits in Testimony 0. But that doesn't contradict anything.\n\nWait, Testimony 0 says she went to the clinic that day (current day), which is her first time in six months. So she was there, but she's saying she didn't go there to get the old chart (Testimony 4). If the Chart (Evidence 18) is the old one, then her having it would mean she took it during her visit, which contradicts her Testimony 4. So the contradiction is between Evidence 18 and Testimony 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Check-Up Report (Evidence 13) is from six months ago, and she took it during her visit, but she claims she didn't go for that. Hmm.\n\nBut the user might be looking for the Check-Up Report (Evidence 13) as the contradiction. Wait, in the game, this is likely referencing the case where Alita's testimony about not needing to get the old chart is contradicted by the existence of the Check-Up Report, which is recent. Wait, but the Check-Up Report might be from Meraktis, the current doctor, indicating that Wocky had a recent check-up. If Alita knew about Wocky's condition (like his illness), which she might reference in her testimonies, but the Check-Up Report would show that the information is recent, meaning she had to have accessed it during her visit, which she claims was just to warn him. But how does that contradict?\n\nAlternatively, in Testimony 1, she says she went to warn Wocky because she knew he had the pistol. But if the Check-Up Report shows that Wocky's condition was critical, and she knew about it, which required her to have seen the report, which is recent. But she couldn't have seen it unless she was at the clinic recently. But she did go to the clinic that day (Testimony 0), so maybe that's how she knew. Not a contradiction.\n\nHmm. I think the most likely answer is Evidence 18 (Wocky's Chart) and Testimony 4. Because she says she wouldn't go to get the half-year-old chart, but if the Chart is present as evidence, that suggests she did take it. Alternatively, maybe Evidence 13 (Check-Up Report) is recent, but she wouldn't have a reason to access it unless she was there for that purpose. Wait, but she was there to warn Wocky. Maybe the Check-Up Report shows that Wocky's condition was known to her, but she couldn't have known unless she saw the report, which she could have done during her visit. But that doesn't directly contradict her testimony.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider Evidence 16: Alita's Sandals. If those were found at the scene, maybe indicating she was there longer than she claims. But she admits being there. Not sure.\n\nAnother possibility: Testimony 2, where she says Dr. Hickfield was timid and didn't admit his mistake. If the autopsy report (Evidence 11) by Meraktis shows a mistake, but that's Dr. Meraktis, not Hickfield. So maybe not.\n\nWait, in Testimony 0: Alita went to the clinic that day, first time in six months. Testimony 4: she questions why she would go for a half-year-old chart. If the chart (Evidence 18) is from six months ago, and she has it now, that implies she took it during her visit, contradicting Testimony 4. Therefore, Evidence 18 contradicts Testimony 4.\n\nBut I need to confirm the numbering. Testimony 4 is \"Why would I go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart?\" Evidence 18 is Wocky's Chart. So if the Chart is the half-year-old one, then having it as evidence means she did go to get it, contradicting her statement. So the pair would be {\"evidence\": 18, \"testimony\": 4}.\n\nBut wait, in the game this is from (Turnabout Corner), the contradiction is between Alita's statement about not needing to get the old chart and the fact that the chart was indeed taken, which is evidence. But I think in the game, the specific evidence is the chart (Wocky's Chart) and her testimony about not needing to go for it. So the answer should be Evidence 18 and Testimony 4.\n\n{\"evidence\": 18, \"testimony\": 4}",

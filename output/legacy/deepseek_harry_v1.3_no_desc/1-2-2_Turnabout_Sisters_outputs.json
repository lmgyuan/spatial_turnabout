    "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are given. Let me start by going through each testimony and see if any of them clash with the available evidence.\n\nLooking at Testimony 0: Gumshoe says he examined the crime scene after securing the suspect. Not sure about contradictions here. Testimony 1: He found a memo next to the victim's body. The evidence list has Maya's Memo (4) and Mia's Memo (14). So maybe the memo mentioned is one of these. \n\nTestimony 2: The memo had \"Maya\" written in blood. Testimony 3 says the blood was the victim's. Testimony 4 mentions blood on the victim's finger, and Testimony 5 concludes the victim wrote the killer's name before dying. \n\nNow, looking at the evidence. Mia's Autopsy Report (5) might have details about her cause of death. The memo found (Maya's Memo or Mia's Memo) could be relevant. Also, there's Evidence 14: Mia's Memo. If the memo was written in the victim's blood (Mia's blood, since she's the victim), but Mia's Memo is separate. Wait, Testimony 2 says the memo had \"Maya\" in blood, which is the victim's (Mia's) blood. But if Mia wrote it, why would she write \"Maya\"? Unless she was pointing to someone else. But maybe the contradiction is that Mia couldn't have written it. For example, if the autopsy report shows that Mia's injuries would have made it impossible for her to write the memo. \n\nLooking at Evidence 5: Mia's Autopsy Report. If the autopsy report indicates that Mia died instantly or couldn't have written the note, then Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name before dying) would be contradicted. So if the autopsy shows she couldn't have physically written the memo with her finger in blood, then Testimony 5 is contradicted by Evidence 5. \n\nSo the contradiction would be between Mia's Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) and Testimony 5 (victim wrote the killer's name). That seems possible. Let me check again. If the autopsy report states that Mia's injuries were such that she couldn't have written the note, then Testimony 5's claim that she wrote the name would be impossible. So Evidence 5 contradicts Testimony 5. That's the pair. Alternatively, maybe another pair. \n\nAlternatively, Testimony 2 says the word \"Maya\" was written in blood, but if Maya's Memo (Evidence 4) is something else, perhaps that's conflicting. But I'm not sure. Let me think. Testimony 1 says the memo was found next to the body. If the memo is Maya's Memo (4), but Maya is alive, then maybe the memo was written by Maya, not the victim. But Testimony 2 claims it was written in the victim's blood. So if the memo is Maya's, then the blood being the victim's (Mia's) would suggest that Mia wrote it, but if Maya's memo is unrelated, that might be a contradiction. But perhaps the real contradiction is with the autopsy report. \n\nAlternatively, the receipt (Evidence 3) or other evidence. Maybe the receipt shows that someone else was there, contradicting a testimony. But the most straightforward contradiction seems to be between the autopsy report and the testimony that the victim wrote the name. So Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report) contradicts Testimony 5. Therefore, the answer should be {\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\":5}.\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 5}",

    "response": "Okay, let's see here. I need to figure out which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies provided. Let's start by looking through the testimonies given by April May. She has Testimonies 0 to 4. \n\nTestimony 3 says: \"And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!\" The weapon in question here is probably The Thinker statue, as mentioned in Testimony 4. Now, looking at the evidence list, Evidence 1 is The Thinker. But wait, Evidence 5 is Mia's Autopsy Report. If the autopsy report states that the cause of death was something that doesn't align with being hit by a statue, that could be a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, there's the Glass Shards (Evidence 2). If the testimony claims the weapon was The Thinker, but the glass shards suggest a different weapon or that the Thinker wasn't broken, maybe that's a contradiction. Wait, but Testimony 3 says she hit her with \"that weapon,\" which April identifies as The Thinker. But if there's evidence like glass shards, maybe the actual murder weapon was something made of glass, not the statue. Or perhaps the Thinker statue isn't broken, so using it would leave different evidence. \n\nWait, Mia's Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) might mention the cause of death as blunt force trauma, which would align with the statue. Hmm. Then maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let me check other evidence. \n\nTestimony 2 says the girl in hippie clothes (probably Maya) chased her. But maybe there's evidence like a photograph or a memo that shows Maya wasn't there. Wait, Evidence 10 and 11 are photographs. If a photograph shows Maya somewhere else, that could contradict Testimony 2. But the user's answer needs to pick one pair. \n\nWait, looking at Testimony 3 again. April claims Maya hit Mia with The Thinker. But Evidence 1 is The Thinker. However, if there's evidence that The Thinker wasn't the murder weapon. For example, the autopsy report might indicate a different weapon. Alternatively, the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) could be from a different object. Wait, if the Thinker is a statue, maybe it's made of metal or stone, so hitting someone would not produce glass shards. If the Glass Shards are present as evidence, that suggests the weapon was something glass, which contradicts April's testimony that it was The Thinker statue. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 3 (using The Thinker as the weapon) and Evidence 2 (Glass Shards), implying the weapon was glass, not the statue. That seems like a solid contradiction. So the pair would be Evidence 2 and Testimony 3.\n\n{\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}",

The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the given testimonies. Let me start by going through the testimonies and the evidences provided.\n\nThe testimonies are all from Armstrong (Character 5). Let's look at each testimony one by one.\n\nTestimony 0 says that there was a mirror in the middle of the restaurant dividing the two halves. So the mirror's position is important here.\n\nTestimony 1 states that there's only one seat from which you could have seen an image of the victim. Then Testimony 2 specifies that seat was next to the victim's table where an old man was sitting. Testimony 3 mentions that after the incident, Armstrong moved the mirror so it wasn't in the way. Testimony 4 claims he didn't touch anything else.\n\nNow, looking at the evidences, I need to find which one would contradict these statements. Let's check the evidence list. Evidence 11 is Tres Bien Floor Plans. Floor plans might show the layout of the restaurant, including where the mirror was placed. If the floor plans show that the mirror wasn't in the middle as Armstrong claimed in Testimony 0, that would be a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe another evidence like the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) could show the mirror's position after the incident, conflicting with Testimony 3 where he says he moved it. But Testimony 3 says he moved the mirror after the incident, so if the crime photo shows the mirror already moved, that might contradict his statement. Wait, but the crime photo is taken before he moved it, right? Because the incident happened, then he moved the mirror. If the crime photo was taken after he moved it, then there's a problem. But I need to check if there's evidence that contradicts the moving of the mirror.\n\nWait, Evidence 11: Tres Bien Floor Plans. If the original floor plans (before any changes) show that the mirror was not in the middle, but Armstrong claims it was in the middle (Testimony 0), then that's a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the Floor Plans show that the mirror's position was different, so Testimony 0 is lying.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about Testimony 3 where Armstrong says he moved the mirror after the incident. If there's evidence that the mirror was not moved, that would contradict. But which evidence would show that? The crime photo (Evidence 12) might show the crime scene as it was after the incident. If the mirror was still in the middle in the crime photo, but Armstrong says he moved it, then that's a contradiction. But how do we know when the photo was taken? If the crime photo was taken before he moved the mirror, then no contradiction. If the photo was taken after, but the mirror is still in the original position, that would mean he didn't move it, contradicting Testimony 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Tres Bien Floor Plans (Evidence 11) show that the mirror's original position was not in the middle, which would contradict Testimony 0 where he says the mirror was in the middle.\n\nWait, Testimony 0: \"La mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.\" If the floor plans (Evidence 11) show that the mirror is not in the middle, but in a different position, then that would directly contradict Testimony 0. So Evidence 11 (Floor Plans) vs Testimony 0. But wait, the problem is that the user is asking for a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. Let me check again.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident. If there's evidence that the mirror was already moved before the incident, or that it couldn't have been moved as he said. For example, maybe the Floor Plans show that the mirror is fixed in a certain position and can't be moved easily. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows the mirror in a different position than where Armstrong claims he moved it. For instance, if he says he moved it, but the photo shows it still in the original place. But how do we know when the photo was taken? If the crime photo was taken after the incident and after he moved the mirror, then it should show the moved mirror. If he moved it, but the photo shows it in the original position, that's a contradiction. But without knowing the timing of the photo, this might be uncertain.\n\nWait, looking at the evidence list again: Evidence 12 is Crime Photo. If the crime photo was taken at the time of the crime, then the mirror's position in the photo would be as it was during the crime. But according to Testimony 3, Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident. So the crime photo (taken during the crime) would show the mirror in the original middle position. Then after the crime, he moved it. So that's not a contradiction. So Testimony 3 says he moved it after, which the crime photo doesn't contradict.\n\nAlternatively, the Floor Plans (Evidence 11) might show that there was no mirror in the middle. If the floor plans are the original layout, and Armstrong claims the mirror was in the middle (Testimony 0), then Evidence 11 contradicts Testimony 0. That would be the case. For example, if the floor plans show the mirror is not in the middle, but he says it was. So Evidence 11 contradicts Testimony 0.\n\nAnother possible contradiction: Testimony 2 says the seat next to the victim's table was where the old man was sitting. If some evidence indicates that seat was not next to the victim's table. But I don't see an evidence that directly relates to seating arrangement except maybe the floor plans. But maybe the floor plans show the seating arrangement differently.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 says he moved the mirror, and Testimony 4 says he didn't touch anything else. If there's evidence that something else was moved, like an object, then Testimony 4 is contradicted. But which evidence? For example, if the Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) was moved, but Armstrong says he didn't touch anything else. But unless there's evidence that he did touch something else, this is not directly shown.\n\nWait, the Lunch Special (Evidence 5) or other items. Maybe not. Let me focus on the possible contradiction between Floor Plans (Evidence 11) and Testimony 0.\n\nSo, if the Floor Plans (Evidence 11) show that the mirror is not in the middle, but Armstrong's Testimony 0 says it was, then that's a direct contradiction. That seems plausible. Therefore, the answer would be Evidence 11 (Tres Bien Floor Plans) contradicting Testimony 0.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 says he moved the mirror after the incident. If the Floor Plans show that the mirror is fixed in place and cannot be moved, then Testimony 3 is contradicted. But unless the Floor Plans specify that the mirror is fixed, which might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the Floor Plans show the mirror in a different position, meaning he couldn't have moved it as he claims. But that's a stretch.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is in Testimony 1 and 2. Testimony 1 says only one seat could see the victim's image via the mirror. If the Floor Plans show that multiple seats could see the image, that contradicts Testimony 1. But how would the Floor Plans indicate that? The Floor Plans would show the layout, so if the mirror's position and angles allow multiple seats to see the reflection, then Testimony 1 is contradicted. But I need to think if there's evidence that shows that.\n\nAlternatively, the Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2) or something else. Hmm. Alternatively, the Tres Bien Floor Plans (Evidence 11) would show the actual layout, which might contradict Armstrong's testimony about the mirror's position. So if the floor plans show the mirror wasn't in the middle, Testimony 0 is false. That would be a solid contradiction.\n\nI think the correct answer here is Evidence 11 (Tres Bien Floor Plans) contradicting Testimony 0. Because if the floor plans show the mirror was not in the middle, but Armstrong says it was, that's a direct contradiction.\n\n{\"evidence\": 11, \"testimony\": 0}",

    "response": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find which evidence contradicts which testimony. The user provided a list of characters, evidence, and testimonies. Let's go through them carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each testimony and see if any of the evidence directly contradicts it. Let's start by listing out the testimonies given by Armstrong (Testimony 0 to 6). The key here is to check the content of each testimony against the evidence.\n\nLooking at Testimony 3: \"Z'ere were no other customers.\" The person is Armstrong, so he's stating that there were no other customers in the restaurant when Monsieur Elg was there. Now, let's look at the evidence list. Evidence 3 is the Sports Paper. Wait, maybe another evidence? Let me check again. \n\nWait, Evidence 12 is the Crime Photo. Maybe that shows something about the restaurant? Or perhaps Evidence 11: Tres Bien Floor Plans. If the floor plans show that there's a specific layout that might contradict the testimony, but not sure. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe Evidence 24: Tres Bien Matches. If matches from Tres Bien were found, maybe indicating someone else was there. But how does that contradict the testimony?\n\nWait, Testimony 3 says no other customers. So any evidence indicating that there was another customer present would contradict this. Let's check the evidence list again. Evidence 19: Millionaire Radio Flyer. Not sure. Evidence 14: Victim's Lottery Ticket. That's related to the victim's winning, which is mentioned in Testimony 4. Evidence 9: Victor's Note. Maybe a note from Victor Kudo? Evidence 7: Scooter. Maybe someone arrived on a scooter, but how does that link?\n\nWait, looking at the characters: Victor Kudo is Character 7. Testimony 1 and 2 from Armstrong mention an old man arriving after Elg. The old man could be Victor Kudo. Testimony 2 says the old man arrived just after 2 PM. But Testimony 3 says there were no other customers. However, if the old man (Victor) arrived, then he would be another customer. Wait, but maybe the old man isn't considered a customer? Or perhaps Armstrong is lying here. Alternatively, maybe the floor plans (Evidence 11) show that there's a way for someone else to be present without being a customer. Wait, but Testimony 3 says \"no other customers,\" so if Victor was a customer, that would contradict. But the old man arriving might be Victor. But according to Armstrong's testimonies 1 and 2, the old man arrived after Elg. So if Testimony 3 says no other customers, but the old man (Victor) was there, then that's a contradiction. But the problem is, Testimony 3 is Testimony 3, and Testimony 1 and 2 are from the same person. Wait, but how does that tie into evidence? Maybe the evidence that shows Victor was present?\n\nLooking at Evidence 9: Victor's Note. If Victor left a note, that suggests he was there. Alternatively, Evidence 18: Victor's Testimony. Wait, but that's a testimony, not evidence. Wait, the evidences are numbered up to 27. Let me check again. Evidence 9: Victor's Note. If Victor's Note indicates he was present at the restaurant, that would contradict Armstrong's Testimony 3 (no other customers). Alternatively, Evidence 7: Scooter. If Victor arrived on a scooter, but that's not directly evidence of being a customer. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe Evidence 19: Millionaire Radio Flyer. Not sure. Alternatively, Evidence 14: Victim's Lottery Ticket. If the victim had a lottery ticket that was won, as per Testimony 4, but not directly related. Let's think again. Testimony 3 says no other customers. If there's evidence that another person was present as a customer, that's the contradiction. For example, if the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows another person, but maybe not. Alternatively, the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) or the Job Listings (4) might not relate. \n\nWait, let's look at Testimony 2: Armstrong says the old man arrived just after 2 PM. Then Testimony 3 says there were no other customers. But if the old man arrived, he's a customer. So this could be a contradiction in Armstrong's own testimonies. However, the user is asking for a contradiction between evidence and testimony, not between two testimonies. So we need evidence that shows there was another customer, which contradicts Testimony 3.\n\nLooking at Evidence 7: Scooter. Maybe the scooter belongs to someone else. For example, if the scooter was used by Victor to come to the restaurant, but if he's the old man, then he was a customer. But Armstrong says no other customers. So if the scooter is evidence that Victor was there, that's a contradiction. But Evidence 7 is labeled as \"Scooter\". If the scooter is Victor's, then that might indicate he was there. But how do we know? Alternatively, Evidence 24: Tres Bien Matches. If matches from the restaurant were found elsewhere, but not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps Evidence 11: Tres Bien Floor Plans. The floor plans might show that there's a back entrance or another area where someone could be without being a customer. But Testimony 3 says \"no other customers,\" not \"no other people.\" If the old man was a customer, then Testimony 3 is false. But if the old man wasn't a customer (maybe he was staff?), then it's not a contradiction. Armstrong's Testimony 0 says the victim came alone. Then Testimony 1 and 2 say the old man arrived after him. So according to Armstrong, the old man came after Elg arrived, but he's considered a customer? Or is he part of the staff?\n\nWait, the characters: Victor Kudo is Character 7, an old man perhaps. If he arrived after Elg, and was a customer, then Testimony 3 (no other customers) is contradicted. But how does the evidence tie in? If there's evidence that Victor was present as a customer, like Victor's Note (Evidence 9) found at the scene, that would imply he was there. Alternatively, Evidence 25: Repair Bill. Not sure. Wait, Evidence 9 is Victor's Note. If that note was written at the restaurant or indicates he was there, then that would contradict Testimony 3. Alternatively, maybe the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) has a time that conflicts with the arrival time. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 14: Victim's Lottery Ticket. If the lottery ticket's time of being claimed requires someone else to be present, but that's a stretch. Let's think differently. \n\nTestimony 5: It was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred. If the poisoning occurred quickly, maybe the evidence related to the poison's administration time contradicts this. For example, Evidence 16: Potassium Cyanide, which acts quickly, so that might support Testimony 5. Not a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 4: When 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited. Evidence 14 is the Victim's Lottery Ticket. If the ticket shows a different time or something, but not sure.\n\nWait, the key contradiction I'm thinking of is between Testimony 3 (no other customers) and evidence showing someone else was present. If Armstrong says no other customers, but the floor plans (Evidence 11) show that there's a seating area that could have accommodated others, but that's not direct. Alternatively, the Crime Photo (12) might show another person, which would be direct. But if the user hasn't provided the content of the evidence, how do I know? Since the assistant is supposed to have knowledge from the game, maybe referencing the actual game's content.\n\nWait, this is likely from the game \"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations,\" specifically the case where Jean Armstrong is the chef. In that case, Armstrong testifies that there were no other customers, but the floor plans (Evidence 11) show that there was a back room where someone could have hidden, thus contradicting the testimony. Alternatively, the presence of another customer's item, like the scooter (Evidence 7) which belongs to Victor Kudo, who was present, but Armstrong claims no other customers.\n\nIn the actual case, Jean Armstrong claims that Glen Elg was alone except for the old man (Victor Kudo) arriving later. However, he later says there were no other customers. The contradiction is that if Victor arrived, he was a customer, but Armstrong says no others. But according to the game, the key contradiction is that the floor plans (Evidence 11: Tres Bien Floor Plans) show that there was a back door through which someone could have entered without being seen, allowing for another person (Furio Tigre) to be present, thus contradicting Testimony 3 about no other customers. Wait, but Furio Tigre is a different character. Alternatively, the actual contradiction in the game is that Armstrong says no other customers, but the lunch special (Evidence 5) is only served to customers, and the victim had ordered it, but someone else (the killer) also had it, implying another customer. So Evidence 5 (Lunch Special) contradicts Testimony 3.\n\nAlternatively, in the game, the Lunch Special was only served that day, and the killer also had one, so if the victim and the killer both had it, there must have been two customers. But Armstrong says no other customers, hence contradiction. So the Lunch Special (Evidence 5) contradicts Testimony 3. That's the classic contradiction from the case. So the answer would be Evidence 5 (Lunch Special) contradicting Testimony 3. \n\nBut let me verify again. Testimony 3: \"Z'ere were no other customers.\" If the Lunch Special was served to customers, and there's evidence that two lunch specials were ordered, that would imply two customers. But Evidence 5 is named \"Lunch Special\" \u2014 maybe it's a menu or receipt showing two orders. Alternatively, the actual content in the game is that the lunch special was a promotion only available that day, and the killer ordered one as well. So the presence of two lunch specials (the victim's and the killer's) would mean two customers, contradicting Armstrong's testimony. Therefore, Evidence 5 (Lunch Special) contradicts Testimony 3.\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 3}",

    "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies provided by Furio Tigre. The characters and evidence are from a game, probably Ace Attorney. Let me start by looking through each testimony and see if any evidence directly contradicts what Tigre is saying.\n\nFirst, looking at the testimonies from Tigre:\n\nTestimony 0: He says he knows nothing about the murder. Not sure which evidence would contradict that yet.\n\nTestimony 1: Claims he was in his office all of December last year. So any evidence showing he was elsewhere in December would contradict this.\n\nTestimony 2: On a specific day, he was in the office and didn't see \"that kid.\" Maybe a photo or someone's testimony places him elsewhere.\n\nTestimony 3: Talks about whales (big clients) borrowing from Tender Lender daily. Maybe evidence shows financial troubles, like loan contracts or debts.\n\nTestimony 4: Suggests Violetta (Viola Cadaverini) can confirm his alibi. If there's evidence that she couldn't have done that, or if she's lying, that might be a contradiction.\n\nNow, look at the evidence list. Let's check each one for possible contradictions.\n\nEvidence 8: Jean's Loan Contract. If Tigre's Testimony 3 says he has lots of clients, but maybe Jean's contract shows he's a client, but if Jean is a whale, that's not a contradiction. Not sure.\n\nEvidence 9: Victor's Note. Maybe Victor's note mentions something about Tigre's whereabouts.\n\nEvidence 10: Glen's Autopsy Report. Maybe time of death contradicts alibi.\n\nEvidence 12: Crime Photo. If the photo shows Tigre at the scene, contradicts Testimony 0 or 2.\n\nEvidence 14: Victim's Lottery Ticket. Date? If the date is in December and shows the victim was somewhere Tigre claims to be, maybe.\n\nEvidence 18: Victor's Testimony. If Victor says he saw Tigre elsewhere.\n\nEvidence 21: Losing Horse Racing Tickets. If Tigre was gambling instead of working, contradicts Testimony 1 or 3.\n\nEvidence 24: Tres Bien Matches. If the location is where the crime happened, and Tigre was supposed to be in his office.\n\nWait, Testimony 1 says he was in his office all December. Let's check evidence that places him elsewhere. Evidence 19: Millionaire Radio Flyer. Not sure. Evidence 25: Repair Bill. Maybe for a scooter? Evidence 7 is a scooter. If the repair bill is for a scooter that was used to go somewhere, but not sure.\n\nWait, Evidence 25: Repair Bill. If the bill is for repairing something in December, and Tigre was supposed to be in his office, maybe that's a contradiction. Alternatively, Evidence 7: Scooter. If he used a scooter to go somewhere when he claims to be in the office.\n\nWait, Testimony 1: \"Spent all'a my time in my office.\" If there's evidence that he was somewhere else in December, like a repair bill for his scooter dated December, that would contradict. Let me check Evidence 25: Repair Bill. What's the Repair Bill's description? If it's for the scooter (Evidence 7) and the date is December, then that would mean he had to take the scooter to get repaired, so he wasn't in the office all the time. So the Repair Bill (25) would contradict Testimony 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Lunch Special (Evidence 5) is from Tres Bien, and the matches (24) are from Tres Bien. If he was at Tres Bien in December, that contradicts his alibi of being in the office. But how do the testimonies and evidence line up?\n\nWait, Testimony 4 says to ask Violetta to confirm his alibi. If Viola's Medical Papers (27) show she was unavailable, that could contradict. But maybe not directly. Alternatively, the MC Bomber (23) is a vehicle? Not sure.\n\nWait, the key is Testimony 1: He was in his office all of December. If there's evidence that he was somewhere else in December, like a Repair Bill for his scooter that had to be fixed in December. So Evidence 25 (Repair Bill) would show that he had to take the scooter to a repair shop, thus not in the office all time. So Repair Bill (25) contradicts Testimony 1.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 7: Scooter. If the scooter was used to go to the repair shop, but without a date, maybe not. So the Repair Bill (25) would have a date. Let's assume that's the case. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 25 and Testimony 1.\n\nBut I need to confirm. Let me check other possibilities. Testimony 2 says he was in the office on a specific day. If the Crime Photo (12) shows him elsewhere that day. But we don't know the date of the photo. Alternatively, the Autopsy Report (10) gives the time of death, and if Tigre's alibi is that he was in the office then, but another evidence places him at the scene.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 19: Millionaire Radio Flyer. Not sure. Evidence 24: Tres Bien Matches. If the crime happened at Tres Bien and he had matches from there, but maybe that's not directly contradicting.\n\nWait, another angle: Testimony 3 says he has whales (big clients) every day. If there's evidence that the Tender Lender isn't doing well, like Jean's Loan Contract (8) showing Jean borrowed money, but if Jean is a small client, maybe that contradicts. But Testimony 3 is about having big clients, not small ones. Unless the evidence shows that there are no big clients. For example, if the Loan Contract is for a large amount, that could support his claim. Not sure.\n\nBack to Testimony 1. If the Repair Bill is dated December, then that contradicts his claim of being in the office all December. So the Repair Bill (25) would be the evidence contradicting Testimony 1. Therefore, the answer would be {\"evidence\": 25, \"testimony\":1}.\n\nBut let me check the actual game's context. In the game \"Recipe for Turnabout,\" Furio Tigre's alibi is that he was in his office all December, but the Repair Bill for his scooter shows that he had to get it repaired in December, meaning he left the office. So that's the contradiction. So the correct pair is Repair Bill (25) against Testimony 1.\n\n{\"evidence\": 25, \"testimony\": 1}",

But how does that connect?\n\nWait, in the game (I remember from playing Ace Attorney), Tres Bien is a restaurant. If Furio Tigre has matches from there, it implies he was there. But in his testimony, he denies ever going there. So the presence of the Tres Bien Matches (Evidence 24) would contradict Testimony 4. That would be the contradiction. Let me check if there's another possible evidence, but looking through the list, the matches seem like the direct link.

    "response": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So, I need to look through the testimonies and see which one doesn't align with the evidence provided.\n\nFirst, let's look at the testimonies given by Furio Tigre (Character 10). His testimonies are from Testimony 0 to Testimony 4. \n\nTestimony 0 says he was supposed to meet \"the kid\" at the restaurant that afternoon. Not sure who the kid is yet. Testimony 1: He opened the door and saw an ugly scene. Testimony 2: The guy was laid out on the table, stiff. So the victim was already dead. Testimony 3: He thought the place would be hot (maybe meaning police would come), so he left. Testimony 4: He heard sirens on his way out and went back to his office.\n\nNow, looking at the evidence, let's see if any of these testimonies clash with a piece of evidence. \n\nEvidence 26 is the Paper Badge. I recall that in the game, Furio Tigre uses a fake attorney's badge made of paper, which is the Paper Badge (Evidence 26). If he claimed he went back to his office (Testimony 4), but the Paper Badge might indicate he was impersonating someone else, perhaps related to the crime scene. Wait, maybe there's a contradiction in his alibi.\n\nWait, another angle: In Testimony 4, he says he heard the cop's sirens on his way out and went straight to his office. But if there's evidence that places him at the scene later or that the timeline doesn't add up. Let's check Evidence 24: Tres Bien Matches. Maybe the matches are from the restaurant, and if he was there, but his testimony says he left before the police arrived. Wait, perhaps the Repair Bill (Evidence 25) or the Scooter (Evidence 7). Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think again. In the game \"Trials and Tribulations,\" Furio Tigre's testimonies are contradicted by the fact that he used the Paper Badge (Evidence 26) to impersonate Phoenix Wright. So, if he claimed he went back to his office, but the Paper Badge was found, perhaps indicating he was at the scene later. Alternatively, maybe his Testimony 3 says he left before the place got hot, but the evidence shows he was still there when the police arrived, which would contradict that.\n\nWait, another key point: The Repair Bill (Evidence 25) might be linked to his scooter. If the scooter was being repaired at a certain time, but he claimed to have driven it back to his office, that could be a contradiction. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the Paper Badge (26) is fake, which could mean he was there posing as someone else, so his testimony about leaving before the police came might be contradicted by evidence that he was present when the police arrived, perhaps. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 3: He split because he thought the place would be hot. But if the evidence shows that he was the one who called the police, that would contradict. Wait, in the game, Furio actually called the police himself using the fake badge. So if he says he left to avoid the police, but the Paper Badge (26) is evidence that he posed as a lawyer, perhaps to be at the scene when the police arrived. Therefore, Testimony 3 (he left to avoid the police) contradicts the fact that he used the Paper Badge to be present when police arrived. Hmm. Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 26 (Paper Badge). Because if he split before the police came, how did the Paper Badge end up there? Unless he left it earlier. But I think the Paper Badge is part of his disguise, so if he used it to be present when the police arrived, but his testimony says he left before the police came, that would be a contradiction. So the testimony 3 (he split because the place would be hot) and the Paper Badge (26) would show he was there when the police arrived. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be evidence 26 and testimony 3.\n\n{\"evidence\": 26, \"testimony\": 3}",

    "response": "Okay, let's see here. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies provided. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all listed. Let's start by going through each testimony and see if any of the evidence directly contradicts what's being said.\n\nLooking at the testimonies from Tigre (Testimony 0 to 7). Testimony 0 says he loaned Elg $100,000. Then Testimony 4 mentions Elg winning half a million, which would have covered the debt. But in Testimony 5, Tigre says that if the waitress hadn't done what she did, everything would have been over. Then Testimony 6 says thanks to her, his business with the kid was over. So he's implying that because of her action, he didn't need to collect the debt anymore. But wait, if Elg won the lottery, he could have paid back the $100k, right? So maybe the evidence related to the lottery ticket would be important here.\n\nCheck the evidences. Evidence 14 is the Victim's Lottery Ticket. If the lottery ticket is a fake or a losing ticket, that would contradict Tigre's claim that Elg won. Alternatively, maybe the autopsy report (Evidence 10) shows something different. Wait, let me think. Tigre says Elg won half a million, so he could pay back. But if the lottery ticket is actually a losing one, then Elg didn't win, which would mean Tigre's testimony about Elg winning is a lie. That would contradict. So Evidence 14 (Victim's Lottery Ticket) might show that it's a losing ticket, thus contradicting Testimony 4 where Tigre says Elg won. \n\nLooking at the evidences again: Evidence 14 is the Victim's Lottery Ticket. Also, there's Evidence 21: Losing Horse Racing Tickets. Wait, maybe the lottery ticket is a losing one. If the actual evidence shows the ticket is a loser, then Tigre's claim that Elg won is false. Therefore, Evidence 14 (assuming it's a losing ticket) contradicts Testimony 4. Alternatively, maybe Evidence 21 (Losing tickets) could be related, but Tigre is talking about a lottery, not horse racing. So perhaps Evidence 14 is the key here. But I need to confirm. If the Victim's Lottery Ticket is evidence, and it's a losing ticket, that directly contradicts Tigre's statement in Testimony 4 where he says Elg won half a million. So the pair would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 4. But I need to check the numbers. Let's see: Testimony 4 is \"He got lucky, you know. Real lucky.\" So that's Testimony 4. The evidence would be 14. So the contradiction is between Tigre's claim that Elg won, and the actual lottery ticket being a losing one. Thus, Evidence 14 contradicts Testimony 4. But wait, what if the lottery ticket is actually a winner? Then there's no contradiction. So I need to check the evidence description. The user didn't provide descriptions, just names. Hmm. So maybe the names are enough. The Victim's Lottery Ticket (14) could be a key evidence. Alternatively, there's Evidence 19: Millionaire Radio Flyer, which might be a promotional item. Maybe the lottery ticket was part of a radio contest. But without more info, I have to assume based on the names. If the Victim's Lottery Ticket is presented as evidence, and Tigre claims he won, but the ticket is a fake or losing, that's the contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the autopsy report (Evidence 10) shows that the victim was killed before he could claim the lottery, but that's less direct. Alternatively, Evidence 14 (lottery ticket) and Testimony 4. I think that's the pair. So the answer would be {\"evidence\": 14, \"testimony\":4}.\n\n{\"evidence\": 14, \"testimony\": 4}",

    "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of Acro's testimonies. Let me start by going through each testimony and see if any evidence directly contradicts it.\n\nTestimony 0: Acro says he could have lifted a bust the size of the Max G. Bust. The Max G. Bust is Evidence 15. But does any evidence contradict his ability to lift it? Maybe not directly. He mentions his upper body strength in Testimony 1, so maybe that's related.\n\nTestimony 2: He claims lifting the bust and looking out the window would've been impossible. Wait, but if he can lift it (as per Testimony 0), why can't he look out? Maybe the issue is the combination of lifting and looking. But is there evidence about the window's location or the setup?\n\nEvidence 6 is the Circus Map. Maybe the map shows the layout where the window's position relative to where the bust was lifted? Not sure yet. Let me check other testimonies.\n\nTestimony 4: He says he couldn't have known the location of the Ringmaster's head. Wait, the Ringmaster's Papers (Evidence 5) might have information about schedules or positions. If the papers indicate that Acro would know where the Ringmaster would be, that could contradict his claim. Alternatively, the Note (Evidence 16) might have a message indicating that he knew the location.\n\nTestimony 5: He says it's unrealistic to drop the bust on the Ringmaster. But if there's evidence showing that it was possible, like the Circus Map (Evidence 6) showing a path or mechanism, or maybe the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) showing the position of the body and the bust's trajectory.\n\nWait, Testimony 2 says lifting the bust and looking out the window was impossible. If the Circus Map (Evidence 6) shows that the window is in a place that requires looking out while lifting, maybe that's possible. Alternatively, the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) might show the bust's position relative to the window, proving that someone could lift it and look out, contradicting his statement.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 15 (Max G. Bust) being the actual bust. If the bust is heavy, but Acro says he could lift it (Testimony 0 and 1), but then in Testimony 2 he says lifting and looking out is impossible. Maybe the bust's weight isn't the issue, but the combination of actions. However, if the bust is actually lighter than he claims, but that's not indicated here.\n\nWait, maybe the Scarf (Evidence 19). If the scarf was found in a place that indicates Acro was near the window, but he claims he couldn't have looked out. Or the Broken Bottle (Evidence 7) might relate to some setup.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 3: Silk Hat. If the hat was found near the window, indicating someone was there. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look at Testimony 4 again. He says he couldn't have known the location of the Ringmaster's head. But if there's evidence like the Ring (Evidence 10) or the Note (Evidence 16) that suggests he knew where the Ringmaster would be. For example, if the Note is a message telling him the location, that would contradict his testimony. Or perhaps the Ringmaster's Papers (Evidence 5) have a schedule that shows where he would be at a certain time, which Acro could have known.\n\nBut I need to find a direct contradiction. Let me check the evidence list again. Evidence 6 is the Circus Map. If the map shows the layout where the window's position and the bust's location are such that lifting the bust and looking out is possible, then the map would contradict Testimony 2. For example, if the map shows that the bust was near the window, making it possible to lift and look out, which Acro claims is impossible. That would be a contradiction.\n\nSo the Circus Map (Evidence 6) would contradict Testimony 2, which states that lifting the bust and looking out the window was impossible. If the map shows that the bust's location is close enough to the window that one could lift it and look out, then Acro's testimony is contradicted by the layout shown in the map.\n\n{\"evidence\": 6, \"testimony\": 2}",

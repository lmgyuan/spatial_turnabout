    "response": "Testimony 5 makes the case sound like the murder was premeditated via the knife—that is, the defendant bought the knife to commit the crime. But Juan’s Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) tells us that the victim was first strangled with a scarf and then stabbed. This discrepancy in the murder method places the emphasis on two very different manners of killing. If the knife were truly the premeditated murder weapon, one would expect it to be solely implicated in the cause of death. Instead, the autopsy report shows that strangulation played a crucial role, contradicting Gumshoe’s assertion in Testimony 5.\n\n{\"evidence\": 14, \"testimony\": 5}",

    "response": "Andrews claims that she went to pour the victim some juice because she assumed he had just fainted (Testimony 4). However, the wine glass found at the scene (Evidence 8) is full of tomato juice and shows no sign that any juice was consumed—an odd detail if she had been pouring him a drink. This discrepancy between her claim and the physical state of the glass is the contradiction.\n\n{\"evidence\": 8, \"testimony\": 4}",

    "response": "Alita claims in testimony 4 that she had no reason to go to the clinic for a “half‐year‐old chart,” implying she wasn’t involved in routine clinic business. Yet, evidence 18—the clinic’s chart signed by her—shows that she was indeed present and responsible for updating or handling patient records, a clear indication that she was at the clinic for matters related to this (albeit old) chart. This discrepancy between her statement and the physical record contradicts her account.\n\n{\"evidence\": 18, \"testimony\": 4}",

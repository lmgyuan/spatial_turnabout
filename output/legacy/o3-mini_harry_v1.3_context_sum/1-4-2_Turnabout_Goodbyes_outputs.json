    "response": "Lotta’s testimony claims she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth on the boat as the shooter. However, the Letter from the Safe (Evidence 20) instructs someone to “Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth” – implying that Edgeworth was the target rather than the killer. These two pieces conflict because if Edgeworth had been on the boat operating the gun, there’d be no need to seek revenge against him.\n\n{\"evidence\": 20, \"testimony\": 0}",

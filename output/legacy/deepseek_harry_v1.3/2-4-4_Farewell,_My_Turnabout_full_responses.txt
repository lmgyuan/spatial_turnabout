Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the task is to find which evidence contradicts which testimony. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. I need to look through them and find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts a statement in the testimony.

Looking at the testimonies first. Testimony 0 to 5 are all from Will Powers. The key ones here are Testimonies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 where he talks about seeing a bellboy come out of Juan Corrida's room. Specifically, Testimony 4 says he thought it was strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed. 

Now, looking at the evidences, there's Evidence 30: Bellboy's Uniform. The description mentions that it was worn by De Killer on the night of the murder and that one of its special buttons is missing. Also, Evidence 30's details would show that De Killer was disguised as a bellboy. 

Wait, if De Killer was wearing the bellboy uniform, but in Testimony 4, Powers says the bellboy came out empty-handed. But the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) was found next to the victim. The case is empty but has Corrida's fingerprints. Maybe the bellboy (De Killer) would have carried the case, but Powers says he was empty-handed. That's a contradiction. Or perhaps the Bellboy's Uniform (Evidence 30) mentions a missing button, which could relate to another evidence. Wait, there's the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) found in Engarde's hakama, but that's covered in blood. Hmm.

Alternatively, the Security Lady (Character 3) is Wendy Oldbag. The Autograph (Evidence 10) is to Wendy from Corrida. Maybe that's a red herring. 

Wait, the main contradiction here is that Powers saw a bellboy leaving the room empty-handed, but the Guitar Case was found in the room. If the bellboy (De Killer) was the killer, perhaps he should have taken the guitar case or had something with him. But according to the testimony, he was empty-handed. However, the Guitar Case is empty, so maybe he took something from it. But the case was already there, so maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Wait, looking at Evidence 30's detailed description: the Bellboy's Uniform worn by De Killer has a missing button. If the Jammin' Ninja's button (Evidence 16) is found in Engarde's clothing, that might link. But how does that relate to the testimony? 

Alternatively, Evidence 17 is Lotta's Photo showing a person in samurai garb outside the door. But the testimonies are about a bellboy. Maybe the person in the photo is actually the bellboy in disguise, but that's not directly contradicting.

Wait, the key point is Testimony 4: Powers says the bellboy came out empty-handed. But if De Killer was disguised as a bellboy, he might have had to carry something. Wait, the Guitar Case is empty. If the murder involved moving something, maybe the killer took the contents. But the case was already empty. Alternatively, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set in the stuffed bear. The Credit Card Receipt (Evidence 24) shows Engarde bought the same bear. But the spy camera was transmitting, so maybe the bellboy (De Killer) was involved in placing that. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Wait, perhaps the Bellboy's Uniform (Evidence 30) has a missing button, and the Jammin' Ninja's button (Evidence 16) is found elsewhere. If the button from the uniform is missing, and the button found in Engarde's hakama is from the Jammin' Ninja costume, that's a different issue. Maybe not directly related to the testimony.

Let me think again. Testimony 4: Powers says the bellboy came out empty-handed. But if the bellboy was De Killer, he would have had to carry the murder weapon or something. However, the murder weapon (Knife, Evidence 15) was left at the scene. The cause of death was strangulation and stabbing. The knife has Engarde's fingerprints. So perhaps De Killer didn't need to carry anything out. But why would Powers say the bellboy was empty-handed? If the bellboy was carrying something, that would be a contradiction. But according to the testimony, he wasn't.

Wait, but in the crime scene, there's a Guitar Case (Evidence 7) which is empty. If the bellboy was supposed to take the guitar case, but it's still there, then maybe Powers' testimony that he was empty-handed is correct. Hmm. Maybe that's not a contradiction.

Alternatively, the Bellboy's Uniform (Evidence 30) has a missing button. If the button was found somewhere else, like in the victim's room, then that would link De Killer to the scene. But Testimony 4 is about the bellboy coming out empty-handed, which would be consistent if De Killer didn't take anything. But where's the contradiction?

Wait, looking back at the Guitar Case (Evidence 7), it's empty and has Corrida's fingerprints. If the bellboy was supposed to take the guitar case but didn't, then why is it empty? Maybe the contents were taken earlier. But according to the testimony, the bellboy left empty-handed. If the case was already empty, then there's no contradiction. 

Alternatively, maybe the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set up by Engarde, and the bellboy (De Killer) placed it. But again, how does that contradict the testimony?

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that Powers saw the bellboy leave empty-handed, but the Bellboy's Uniform (Evidence 30) has a missing button, which could have been left at the crime scene. But the testimonies don't mention the bellboy's appearance, only that he was empty-handed. So maybe that's not the contradiction.

Another angle: the testimonies from Powers (Testimony 1-5) mention the bellboy leaving the room. But according to the Spy Camera (Evidence 21), which was recording the room from 8 PM for an hour (time of death 8:15 PM), maybe the footage would show the killer. However, the Video Tape (Evidence 29) from De Killer's hideout might have the footage, but the user hasn't mentioned that yet. However, the Spy Camera's existence (Evidence 21) and the Transmitter (Evidence 22) would mean that the murder was recorded. If the footage shows the bellboy (De Killer) leaving with something, but Powers says he was empty-handed, that's a contradiction. But since the Spy Camera is in the stuffed bear (Evidence 23), which was bought by Engarde (Evidence 24), maybe the footage was altered or something. However, the user hasn't presented the video as evidence here, so maybe that's not the direct contradiction.

Wait, the key contradiction could be between Testimony 4 (Powers says the bellboy was empty-handed) and Evidence 30 (Bellboy's Uniform missing a button). If the bellboy's uniform had a missing button that was found at the scene, then the bellboy wasn't actually empty-handed but lost a button. But the testimony is about carrying items, not appearance. Hmm.

Wait, Evidence 30's detailed description says the uniform is missing a special button. If the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) is the missing one, but that button is from Corrida's costume. So perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the button from the bellboy's uniform was found elsewhere, but that's not listed in the evidences.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (bellboy empty-handed) and the fact that the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) was found empty. If the bellboy took the contents, then he wouldn't be empty-handed. But the Guitar Case was already empty when found. So maybe the bellboy didn't take anything, hence no contradiction. 

Alternatively, maybe the bellboy (De Killer) was carrying the knife (Evidence 15) which was left at the scene. So he didn't take it out, hence empty-handed. That doesn't contradict. 

Wait, perhaps the real contradiction is elsewhere. Let me check other testimonies. Testimony 5: Powers says the bellboy had to be the assassin. But the real assassin is Shelly de Killer (Character 13), who uses a Shelly card (Evidence 18) left at the scene. The Picture Card (Evidence 18) was placed next to the victim, which is De Killer's calling card. So that matches. So Testimony 5 is correct. 

Wait, maybe the contradiction is in Testimony 3: Powers says the bellboy seemed out of place. But if the Bellboy's Uniform (Evidence 30) is from the hotel, then he should blend in. Unless the uniform was fake or missing parts. The missing button might make him look out of place, but that's speculative. But the testimony is about the bellboy seeming out of place, which could be due to the missing button. But the evidence about the uniform's missing button is in Evidence 30. So Testimony 3 says the bellboy seemed out of place, which is explained by Evidence 30 (missing button). That's not a contradiction; it's supporting. 

Wait, maybe Testimony 4 says the bellboy was empty-handed, but the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows a guitar case on the floor. If the bellboy was supposed to carry the guitar case but didn't, but the case was already there, then there's no contradiction. 

Alternatively, the Radio Transceiver (Evidence 4) is from De Killer, used to communicate. If the bellboy had that, but Powers didn't mention him carrying anything, that's a contradiction. But the transceiver's origin is from Maya's kidnapper (De Killer), and the bellboy (De Killer) would have it. But Powers didn't see him carrying anything, so if the transceiver was on his person, maybe Powers didn't notice. But that's a stretch. 

Hmm. Let me think again. The key is to find a direct contradiction between a testimony and evidence. 

Testimony 4: "I thought it was kinda strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed!"

Evidence 30: Bellboy's Uniform (detailed: missing a button). But maybe the uniform's missing button indicates that the bellboy wasn't in proper uniform, hence looking out of place (Testimony 3). But that's supporting, not contradicting.

Wait, looking at Evidence 7: Guitar Case found next to the victim, empty. If the bellboy took the guitar, but the case is empty, then Powers should have seen him carrying the guitar. But according to Testimony 4, he was empty-handed. So that's a contradiction. Because if the case was empty, the bellboy might have taken the guitar, but Powers didn't see him carrying anything. Therefore, the presence of the empty Guitar Case (Evidence 7) contradicts Testimony 4 where Powers says the bellboy was empty-handed. Because if the case was empty, the bellboy might have taken the guitar, but he wasn't seen carrying it. Alternatively, maybe the bellboy didn't take anything, hence the case being empty, which would align with the testimony. Wait, that's not a contradiction. 

Alternatively, if the Guitar Case was supposed to have something, but it's empty, and the bellboy left empty-handed, that's consistent. So no contradiction there. 

Wait, maybe the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording during the murder. The Video Tape (Evidence 29) might show the real killer, but since the user hasn't presented the video's contents, maybe that's not usable. 

Alternatively, the Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but the killer is De Killer. That's a setup, but how does that relate to the testimonies?

Wait, let's look at the testimonies again. Testimonies 1-5 from Powers: he saw a bellboy come out of Corrida's room, thought it was strange because he was empty-handed, and concludes the bellboy is the assassin.

But according to Evidence 30, the Bellboy's Uniform was worn by De Killer. So Powers' identification of the bellboy as the assassin is correct. But the contradiction must be elsewhere.

Wait, Evidence 4: Radio Transceiver from De Killer. If the bellboy (De Killer) had the transceiver, then he was carrying something, which contradicts Testimony 4 saying he was empty-handed. But the transceiver is small and maybe not noticeable. Powers might not have seen it, so maybe not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, the Transmitter (Evidence 22) and Spy Camera (Evidence 21) were used to transmit footage. If the bellboy was involved in setting that up, he would have carried equipment, but Testimony 4 says he was empty-handed. But the Spy Camera was already in the stuffed bear (Evidence 23), which was bought by Engarde (Evidence 24). So De Killer might not have needed to carry anything related to that.

Hmm. Maybe the answer is Testimony 4 (empty-handed) and Evidence 30 (Bellboy's Uniform missing a button). But the missing button doesn't directly contradict being empty-handed. 

Wait, another angle: The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows a smashed vase with water on the carpet. The Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has water only on the lid. The vase's water might have gotten on the case. But how does that relate to the testimony?

Alternatively, Lotta's Photo (Evidence 17) shows a person in samurai garb outside the door. If the bellboy was in samurai garb, that contradicts. But the testimonies say it was a bellboy, not someone in samurai costume. So maybe the person in the photo is the real killer, and the bellboy is a different person. But Powers' testimony says the bellboy came out, but the photo shows a samurai. That would be a contradiction. Because if the photo was taken right after the murder, and shows a samurai outside, but Powers saw a bellboy, then they can't both be true. 

So Evidence 17 (Lotta's Photo) shows a samurai outside the door, but Testimonies 1-5 say it was a bellboy. That's a contradiction. So the pair would be Evidence 17 and Testimony 1 or 2. But let me check the numbers. Testimony 1 says "that bellboy I saw earlier came out of the room!" Evidence 17 is a photo of a samurai outside the door. So if the photo shows a samurai, but the testimony says it's a bellboy, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the evidence 17 contradicts testimony 1 or 2. But which testimony exactly?

Testimony 1: "And that's when that bellboy I saw earlier came out of the room!" 

Evidence 17: Photo shows a person in samurai garb outside the door. So if the photo was taken right after the murder, the person leaving is in samurai garb, but Powers claims it was a bellboy. Therefore, the photo contradicts the testimony. Hence, the answer should be {"evidence": 17, "testimony": 1} or 2. Wait, Testimony 2 says "Of course, when I say 'room', I mean Juan Corrida's room!" That's just specifying which room. Testimony 1 is the actual claim about seeing the bellboy. So Evidence 17 (showing a samurai) contradicts Testimony 1 (says it was a bellboy). Therefore, the correct pair is evidence 17 and testimony 1.

{"evidence": 17, "testimony": 1}
Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the given testimonies from Shelly de Killer. Let's start by reviewing the testimonies and the evidence provided.

First, looking at the testimonies. Testimony 5 from de Killer says that the creation and planting of the "knife" and "button" are appalling. Testimony 6 adds that this act is what broke the rules. So de Killer is claiming that the client (Adrian Andrews) planted the knife and button to frame someone else.

Now, checking the evidences related to the knife and button. Evidence 15 is the Knife with Engarde's fingerprints and the victim's blood. Evidence 16 is the Jammin' Ninja's Button found in Engarde's hakama. If de Killer's testimony says Andrews planted these, we need to see if there's evidence that contradicts this.

Looking at Evidence 8: the Wine Glass with Andrews' fingerprints. She says she poured the juice for Corrida, not herself. But the glass has her fingerprints, which could support that she was present. However, the key contradiction might be elsewhere.

Wait, let's look at the Spy Camera (Evidence 21). The camera was set to record the victim's room from 8 PM for 1 hour, which covers the time of death at 8:15 PM. If the camera was recording, maybe it shows who planted the evidence. However, if the camera was in the stuffed bear (Evidence 23), and Engarde bought an identical bear (Evidence 24), perhaps the footage would show the real planter. But if Andrews was the one planting the knife and button, the camera might have captured that, contradicting de Killer's claim that she did it. Alternatively, maybe the footage shows someone else, like Engarde, planting the evidence, which would mean de Killer's testimony about Andrews is false.

Wait, the spy camera was in the victim's room. If the camera was running, then the actual murder and planting of evidence should be on tape. If the knife and button were planted by Andrews, as de Killer claims in Testimony 5, but the video shows someone else (like Engarde or de Killer himself) doing it, that would contradict the testimony. Alternatively, maybe the video shows that the knife was already there, which contradicts the planting.

But the problem is that the contents of the video are unknown (Evidence 29 is the video tape, but its contents are unknown unless viewed). However, the Spy Camera's existence (Evidence 21) and the fact that it was running during the murder is known. If the camera was present and operational, then any planting of evidence after the murder would be recorded. But de Killer's testimony says that Andrews planted the knife and button. If the camera was in the room, then unless Andrews was there after the murder, the footage would show whether she did it. But according to the Crime Photo (Evidence 9), the knife is present at the scene. The Autopsy Report (14) says cause was strangulation and stabbing. The knife has Engarde's prints. If the Spy Camera was recording, and the footage shows Engarde or someone else planting the knife, that would contradict de Killer's testimony that Andrews did it. But since the video's contents aren't specified in the evidence, maybe we need another angle.

Wait, looking at Evidence 8 again: Adrian's testimony about the glass. She says she poured juice for Corrida, but the glass has her fingerprints. But de Killer's Testimony 3 and 4 claim that Andrews knew Corrida was dead when she entered, implying she faked discovering the body. If she poured the juice for him, but he was already dead, that's a contradiction. However, the glass having her fingerprints aligns with her statement—she did pour the juice. But if the Spy Camera shows that she was in the room before the murder, that would contradict her story. But again, the video's content isn't known.

Alternatively, let's consider the Knife (Evidence 15) with Engarde's fingerprints. If de Killer claims Andrews planted the knife, but the knife has Engarde's prints, that could be a contradiction. Unless Andrews somehow planted a knife with Engarde's prints, which is possible. But maybe there's a different angle.

Wait, the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has Corrida's fingerprints and water on top. The Crime Photo (9) shows the smashed vase with water on the carpet. If the water on the guitar case is from the vase, then maybe the case was placed after the vase was broken. But how does this relate to the testimonies?

Looking back at the testimonies, Testimony 5 and 6 are about planting the knife and button. If the Spy Camera (21) was recording during the time of the murder, and if the footage exists (but maybe wasn't reviewed?), perhaps the real planter is someone else. But without the video's content, maybe another evidence contradicts.

Alternatively, the Magazine Clipping (11) talks about Corrida's affair with A.A. (Adrian Andrews). If Andrews had a motive, but de Killer's testimony says she framed someone else. But the button found in Engarde's hakama (16) is covered in Corrida's blood. If the button was planted, but the Spy Camera would have shown who did it, that's a contradiction. However, since the camera's footage is in Evidence 29 (Video Tape), which is retrieved from de Killer's hideout. If the Video Tape shows the real culprit, but de Killer claims it was Andrews, then that's a contradiction. But the problem is that the contents of the Video Tape are unknown unless specified. However, the Spy Camera (21) was set up by Engarde (since he bought the bear, Evidence 24), so maybe Engarde is the one who set up the camera. If the camera was in the room during the murder, then the footage would show the actual events. If de Killer is lying about Andrews planting the evidence, the real footage (if available) would contradict that. But since the Video Tape is in evidence 29, perhaps the existence of the camera (21) and the tape (29) contradicts de Killer's testimony that Andrews planted the evidence, because the tape would show the truth. But the user may not have access to the tape's content yet.

Wait, but the user might have the Spy Camera (21) as evidence. If the camera was recording during the murder, then the actual killer and planter would be on tape. If de Killer's testimony says Andrews planted the knife and button, but the Spy Camera's footage (which is in the Video Tape, 29) would show otherwise, then the existence of the Spy Camera (21) and the Video Tape (29) as evidence would contradict Testimony 5 and 6. However, since the contents of the Video Tape are unknown, unless presented, maybe that's not the angle.

Alternatively, looking at the Figurine (25) and Celeste's Suicide Note (27). The note inside the figurine tells of Engarde's misdeeds. If Engarde is implicated, but de Killer's testimony says Andrews planted evidence to frame another (presumably Engarde), but the suicide note (27) shows that Engarde had a motive, which could mean that the evidence against Engarde is legitimate, contradicting de Killer's claim that it was planted. However, the note was found in the figurine that only Corrida and Andrews knew how to open. So if Andrews had access to it, she could have placed the note there, supporting the idea that she framed Engarde. But de Killer's testimony says she planted the knife and button. The knife has Engarde's prints, which could be planted. But how does that contradiction happen?

Wait, the Knife (15) has Engarde's fingerprints. If Andrews planted the knife, she would need to get Engarde's prints on it. Unless she had access to something he touched. Alternatively, the Spy Camera's footage might show Engarde handling the knife, which would mean his prints are legitimate, contradicting de Killer's claim that Andrews planted it. But again, without the footage's content, maybe this isn't the case.

Hmm. Let's think of another approach. The testimonies in question are Testimony 5 and 6, where de Killer claims that Andrews planted the knife and button. The evidence that contradicts this would be something showing that she couldn't have done that, or that someone else did.

Looking at the Security Lady (Character 3) and the Hotel Guidemap (6). The path to the viola hall: Engarde's room is north, Corrida's south. If the murder happened in Corrida's room, then access to the room is key. The Spy Camera (21) was in the room. If the camera was running, and the footage shows someone else planting the evidence, that would contradict. But without the footage, maybe another angle.

Wait, the Autopsy Report (14) says the cause was strangulation first, then stabbing. The knife was used post-mortem? If so, then the stabbing with the knife (which has Engarde's prints) was after death. If the killer strangled Corrida, then stabbed him with the knife to implicate Engarde. If de Killer's testimony says Andrews planted the knife, but the killer (maybe Engarde or de Killer) actually did the stabbing, then the presence of Engarde's prints on the knife could be legitimate, which would mean that the knife wasn't planted by Andrews, contradicting de Killer's testimony. But how does that connect?

Alternatively, the fact that the knife has Engarde's prints and was used in the crime suggests that he was involved. But if Andrews planted it, his prints would have to be there because she framed him. But if there's evidence that Engarde had access to the knife before the murder, that might support that he's the killer, not that the evidence was planted.

Wait, the Knife (15) has "Gatewater" engraved on the grip. The murder happened at the Gatewater Hotel. Maybe the knife is a hotel item. If so, many people could have accessed it. But Engarde's prints are on it. If Andrews planted the knife, how would she get Engarde's prints? Unless she took a knife he had previously handled. Alternatively, if the Spy Camera shows Engarde handling the knife, that supports his guilt, contradicting de Killer's claim.

But perhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 5 (about planting the knife) and the Spy Camera's existence. If the camera was recording, then the act of planting would be recorded. If the Spy Camera was set up by Engarde (as per Evidence 24, he bought the bear with the camera), then Engarde might have recorded the murder. If the footage shows that Andrews did not plant the knife, but someone else (like Engarde), that contradicts de Killer's testimony. However, the problem is that the Video Tape (29) is in evidence, but its contents are unknown unless presented. But the Spy Camera (21) is listed as evidence, and it was running at the time of the murder. The existence of the camera's footage (even if not viewed yet) implies that the truth is recorded. Therefore, de Killer's testimony that Andrews planted the evidence is contradicted by the possibility that the camera recorded the real planter, which would be someone else. Thus, the existence of the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) contradicts Testimony 5, because if the camera was operational, then the planting would be on tape, which could prove de Killer's testimony wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the Spy Camera (21) and the Video Tape (29) being in De Killer's hideout suggests that he had the footage, which he tried to recover (as per Evidence 29's details). If the Video Tape shows that Andrews didn't plant the evidence, then De Killer's testimony is a lie. But since the user has the Spy Camera as evidence (21), which was running, and the Video Tape (29) is retrieved, this suggests that the camera's existence and the tape's retrieval contradict De Killer's claim that Andrews planted the evidence. However, without knowing the tape's contents, the user might not have that information. But perhaps the Spy Camera's existence itself is enough to contradict the testimony, as it would have recorded the truth.

Wait, but the question asks which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The Spy Camera (21) was operational. If the testimony says Andrews planted the knife and button, but the camera was recording, then the evidence (Spy Camera) shows that the act would have been recorded, thus contradicting the possibility that Andrews could have done it without being recorded. But unless the footage shows her absence, which we don't know. Alternatively, maybe another piece of evidence.

Looking at the Transmitter (22) which sends the camera's footage. If the Transmitter was used, then someone could have received the footage. But how does that tie in?

Alternatively, the fact that the Knife (15) has Engarde's fingerprints and the button (16) in his hakama is the planted evidence. But if the Spy Camera was in the room, then the footage would show who placed those items. If the camera was there, then the existence of the camera (Evidence 21) contradicts Testimony 5 (that Andrews planted them), because the camera would have recorded the real planter. Therefore, the Spy Camera (21) contradicts Testimony 5.

But the user needs to choose one pair. So the correct answer would be Evidence 21 (Spy Camera) contradicting Testimony 5, because the camera was recording during the murder, which would show whether Andrews planted the evidence. If the camera was running, then her actions would be recorded, making it impossible for her to plant without being caught, thus contradicting de Killer's claim that she did. Alternatively, the Video Tape (29) is the actual evidence, but its details are unknown. But according to the evidence list, Evidence 21 is the Spy Camera set to record at the time, which directly relates to the possibility of capturing the planting.

Another angle: the Crime Photo (9) shows the knife at the scene. If the Spy Camera was recording, then the time of the knife's placement is known. If the murder occurred at 8:15 PM (Autopsy Report 14), and the camera was recording from 8 PM, then the footage would show the killer stabbing the victim. If the killer is Engarde, then his fingerprints on the knife are legitimate, meaning Andrews didn't plant it, contradicting de Killer's testimony. But again, without the footage, this is speculative. However, the existence of the camera as evidence suggests that the truth is recorded, thus contradicting the testimony.

Alternatively, looking at the Wine Glass (8) with Andrews' fingerprints. She claims she poured juice for Corrida when she found him, thinking he was alive. But the Autopsy Report says death was at 8:15 PM. If she entered after that, but the victim was already dead, then pouring juice for a dead person suggests she knew he was dead, which would align with de Killer's Testimony 4. But that doesn't directly relate to the planting of the knife and button.

Wait, de Killer's Testimony 3 and 4 say that Andrews pretended to be the first to discover the body but knew Corrida was dead. The Wine Glass with her fingerprints and her statement that she poured juice for him could support that she was there after the murder, but if the Spy Camera shows her entering after the murder, then she might have had the opportunity to plant the evidence. But the contradiction would be between her statement and the camera footage, but that's not directly related to the knife and button.

Back to the main point: Testimony 5 says Andrews planted the knife and button. The Spy Camera (21) was recording during the murder. If the camera was operational, then it would have recorded who planted the evidence. Therefore, the existence of the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) contradicts Testimony 5, because it implies that the planting would be on tape, thus proving or disproving the claim. If the camera was there, but de Killer claims Andrews planted the evidence, the camera's footage would contradict that, hence the evidence and testimony contradict each other.

Therefore, the pair is Evidence 21 (Spy Camera) and Testimony 5.

{"evidence": 21, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to go through each testimony and check if any of the evidences directly contradict what's being said.

First, let's look at the testimonies from de Killer. Testimony 3 says that one of the small tasks was to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews. Now, looking at the evidence related to the bear figurine, Evidence 25 is a wooden bear-shaped figurine covered in thin cuts. The description mentions that only Corrida and Andrews know how to open it. Additionally, Evidence 27 is Celeste's Suicide Note found inside the figurine, and Adrian Andrews says she was going to burn it for Celeste's sake.

Wait, if de Killer was supposed to find the figurine and give it to Adrian, but Adrian already had the figurine and was planning to destroy it, that seems conflicting. But how does this connect? Let me check the testimonies again. Testimony 3 states de Killer's client asked him to find the figurine and give it to Andrews. But according to Evidence 25 and 27, Adrian already possesses the figurine and knows how to open it. That suggests that the figurine was already in Adrian's possession, so why would de Killer need to find it and give it to her? That's a contradiction because the task assigned to de Killer implies that the figurine wasn't already with Andrews, but the evidence shows she already had it and intended to destroy it. Therefore, Testimony 3 (about de Killer's task) contradicts Evidence 25 (which shows Andrews already had the figurine).

{"evidence": 25, "testimony": 3}

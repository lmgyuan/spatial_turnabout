Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by looking through the testimonies and evidences provided.

First, the testimonies are all from Lamiroir. Let's go through each one. Testimony 3 says: "When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment..." But Testimony 2 states: "I did not return backstage after the second set." Wait, that seems conflicting. If in Testimony 2 she says she didn't return after the second set, but in Testimony 3 she mentions going backstage after her performance, which might have been part of the second set. Hmm, need to check the timing.

Looking at the evidence, maybe the crime photo (Evidence 9) shows the body's position. But maybe the key evidence here is Evidence 3: Investigation Request, which mentions restricting info to police and related parties. Not sure. Wait, perhaps the Postcard (Evidence 1) or the Brooch (Evidence 4) which belongs to Lamiroir found at the scene. But how does that tie to her testimony?

Wait, the main contradiction might be in her statements. Testimony 2 says she didn't return backstage after the second set, but Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance. If her performance was part of the second set, then these two testimonies contradict each other. But the user is asking for an evidence and a testimony that contradict. So I need to find an evidence that shows she was backstage, conflicting with her testimony.

Looking at Evidence 4: Brooch found at the crime scene, which belongs to Lamiroir. If her brooch was found there, that suggests she was present, which contradicts her Testimony 2 where she claims not to have returned backstage after the second set. Alternatively, Evidence 6: Key Ring in the victim's hand, which has keys to a guitar case and motorcycle. But how does that tie to her testimony?

Alternatively, Evidence 10: Diagram shows the crime scene was her dressing room, and the body was blocked from sight. If she claims she didn't return backstage, but her dressing room was the crime scene, maybe she had to be there. But the testimonies are about her movements. Let me check the exact wording.

Testimony 2: "I did not return backstage after the second set." Testimony 3: "When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment..." So if her performance was part of the second set, then Testimony 3 contradicts Testimony 2. But the user is asking for evidence that contradicts a testimony. So maybe Evidence 4 (Brooch found at the scene) which belongs to her, suggests she was there, contradicting her statement in Testimony 2. Or perhaps another evidence.

Wait, looking at Testimony 6: She was led to Gavin's dressing room. The crime scene was her own dressing room (Evidence 10: Diagram). If she didn't return backstage after the second set, how did her brooch end up there? So Evidence 4 (Brooch) contradicts Testimony 2. But let me check Testimony 2 again. She says she didn't return backstage after the second set. But if the brooch was found in her own dressing room (the crime scene), then she must have been there, which would contradict her Testimony 2. Therefore, Evidence 4 (Brooch) and Testimony 2 would be the contradiction.

Wait, but the problem says "the answer must be one pair". Alternatively, maybe another pair. Let me check the timing of the crime. The autopsy report (Evidence 8) says time of death 9-9:30 PM. The crime photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim in her room. If she claims she didn't return backstage after the second set, but her room was the crime scene, and her brooch was found there, then that's a contradiction. So Evidence 4 (Brooch) and Testimony 2 (she didn't return) would be conflicting. Alternatively, maybe Testimony 3 where she says she went backstage for a moment after her performance. Wait, Testimony 3 is part of her statements. If Testimony 3 and Testimony 2 are conflicting, but the question is about evidence contradicting testimony, not testimony vs testimony.

So the key is, she says she didn't return backstage after the second set (Testimony 2), but the Brooch (Evidence 4) was found at the crime scene (her dressing room). Therefore, the presence of her Brooch there contradicts her statement that she didn't return. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 4 and Testimony 2.

But let me check other possibilities. For example, the Revolver (Evidence 5) is LeTouse's, but maybe that's not directly contradicting a testimony. Or the Key Ring (Evidence 6) has keys to a guitar case and motorcycle. If Daryan Crescend is a detective and guitarist, maybe that's related, but not directly contradicting Lamiroir's testimony.

Another angle: Testimony 4 says she saw nothing because the body was behind a wall, but maybe the Diagram (Evidence 10) shows that the body was visible from the door. Wait, Evidence 10's caption says that from the door, the victim was blocked by items. So maybe she couldn't see the body, which aligns with her Testimony 4. So that's not a contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says she saw bullet holes and knew LeTouse was shot. But the Revolver (Evidence 5) was LeTouse's own gun. If she knew he was shot, maybe that's not a contradiction. Not sure.

Back to the Brooch. If she didn't return to backstage (Testimony 2), how did her Brooch end up there? Unless someone else took it. But the evidence says the Brooch was found at the crime scene and belongs to her. So that's a contradiction between her statement and the evidence. So the correct pair is Evidence 4 (Brooch) and Testimony 2 (did not return backstage after second set).

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 2}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So, the task is to find one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony. Let's start by going through the testimonies and the evidences one by one.

Looking at the testimonies from Ema, especially Testimony 3: "And, Machi practically left his signature at the scene." She's saying that Machi Tobaye left some kind of signature. Now, Machi is blind, according to Character 5. So, if the crime scene had something that a blind person couldn't have done, that would contradict the testimony.

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 9 is the Crime Photo, which mentions smeared writing in blood next to the victim's right hand. If the victim wrote something, but Machi is blind, he wouldn't be able to write legibly. But wait, Testimony 3 says Machi left his signature, but being blind, writing would be difficult. Alternatively, maybe the smeared writing is the signature? But if Machi is blind, he can't write, so that's a contradiction. However, maybe the signature is something else, like a physical object.

Wait, also Testimony 5 says "From the state of the crime scene, I conclude the shooter was blind." That might tie into something. But how does that interact with evidence?

Alternatively, let's think about Testimony 3 again. If Ema claims Machi left his signature, which would imply he left some evidence pointing to himself. But Evidence 5 is the Revolver, which belongs to LeTouse. Wait, maybe the Revolver is the murder weapon, but if Machi is the killer, why would he use LeTouse's gun? That might not directly contradict though.

Alternatively, Evidence 18 is the Replica of the Borginia Cocoon, which was held by LeTouse as part of his investigation. If LeTouse had that, maybe the motive is connected to Borginia, but Testimony 2 says "No one in this country had a motive to kill the victim." But if LeTouse was involved in something related to Borginia (since Lamiroir is from Borginia), maybe the motive comes from there, contradicting Testimony 2. But how does that tie in with evidence?

Wait, Evidence 16 is the Borginian Newspaper which doesn't mention the lyrics of Lamiroir's ballad. The lyrics sheet is Evidence 2. If the motive is connected to the lyrics, but the newspaper doesn't mention them, perhaps that's a point. But Testimony 0 and 1 talk about the lyrics being a reason for Machi stealing the body. If the newspaper doesn't mention the lyrics, maybe there's a contradiction. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's go back to Testimony 3: Machi left his signature. But Machi is blind. If the signature was written, like the smeared blood writing in Evidence 9, then a blind person couldn't write that. So the presence of written evidence (smeared writing) contradicts the testimony that a blind person left their signature. Because if the signature is the writing, then Machi couldn't have done it. Therefore, Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) contradicts Testimony 3. But wait, the Crime Photo's smeared writing is next to the victim's right hand. Maybe the victim wrote it, not the killer. So maybe that's not the contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says the shooter was blind. If the shooter was blind, they might not have aimed properly. But Evidence 10 (Diagram) mentions two bullet holes on the wall where the door was. If the shooter was blind, perhaps the bullet holes' placement would indicate poor aim, supporting Testimony 5. But that's not a contradiction. Wait, but maybe the Revolver (Evidence 5) is the murder weapon, which is high-caliber. A blind person using a revolver might have difficulty aiming. But how does that tie into a contradiction with a testimony?

Wait, Testimony 3 says Machi left his signature. If the signature is something like the Brooch (Evidence 4) which belongs to Lamiroir, then maybe that's not Machi's. But the Brooch is found at the scene, belonging to Lamiroir. So if the signature is the Brooch, but it's hers, that doesn't point to Machi.

Alternatively, perhaps the Key Ring (Evidence 6) found in the victim's hand has keys to a guitar case and motorcycle. If Machi had those keys, but he's associated with Lamiroir and maybe not with a motorcycle, but Daryan is a guitarist and detective. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Machi left his signature) and Evidence 5 (Revolver belongs to LeTouse). If the murder weapon is LeTouse's own gun, then the killer would have to take it from him, but if Machi is the killer, why would he use LeTouse's gun? But maybe that's possible. Not necessarily a contradiction.

Alternatively, let's think about Testimony 5: the shooter was blind. If the shooter was blind, how could they aim? But the Diagram (Evidence 10) shows the victim was shot in the shoulder in Lamiroir's room. If the shooter was blind, maybe the bullet holes in the wall (two) indicate missed shots, but the actual hit was a lucky shot. However, that's not a contradiction with the testimony; in fact, it might support it.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 5 says the shooter was blind, which would be Machi. But Evidence 15 (Igniter) is triggered by a Remote Trigger (Evidence 13) with a 30-foot range. If the igniter was used in the crime, perhaps the shooter needed to trigger it remotely, but a blind person wouldn't be able to see where to aim the trigger. But maybe that's not directly related.

Alternatively, Evidence 2 is the Lyrics Sheet. If the motive was related to the lyrics, as per Testimony 0 and 1, but the Borginian Newspaper (Evidence 16) doesn't mention the lyrics, perhaps there's a contradiction. For example, if the lyrics were a secret, then Machi's motive (stealing the body because of lyrics) would make sense, but the newspaper not mentioning them supports that. Not sure.

Wait, Testimony 2: "No one in this country had a motive to kill the victim." But LeTouse was investigating something related to Borginia (Evidence 18: Replica of Borginian Cocoon for a remedy). If the motive is connected to Borginia, then the killer could be from Borginia, which would contradict Testimony 2. So Evidence 18 (Replica) suggests a Borginian connection, which would mean someone from Borginia (like Lamiroir or Machi) had a motive. But Testimony 2 says no one in this country (assuming the country where the crime happened is not Borginia) had a motive. So Evidence 18 contradicts Testimony 2. That could be a pair.

But the answer needs one pair. So Evidence 18 (Replica) and Testimony 2 (No motive in the country). That could be the contradiction. Because the Replica is related to Borginia, implying a motive from Borginia, hence someone from Borginia (like Lamiroir or Machi) had a motive, contradicting Ema's Testimony 2 that no one in the country had a motive. Since the country in question is where the crime took place (probably not Borginia, since Lamiroir is from there), then if the killer's motive is Borginia-related, the testimony is wrong.

Alternatively, the answer might be Evidence 18 and Testimony 2.

Alternatively, another possibility: Testimony 3 says Machi left his signature, which could be referring to something like the Brooch (Evidence 4) which belongs to Lamiroir. But that's not necessarily Machi's. But perhaps the signature is the method of the crime that only Machi could do. For example, the Revolver (Evidence 5) belongs to LeTouse, so if the killer used his own gun, but the murder weapon is LeTouse's, that might not be Machi's signature. Not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says Machi left his signature. If the signature is being blind, then Evidence 5 (Revolver) being used by a blind person would be possible? But I'm not sure.

Wait, the key contradiction could be between Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) and Evidence 10 (Diagram) which shows two bullet holes on the wall by the door. If the shooter was blind, firing randomly, but the actual shot hit the victim's shoulder, which might be possible. But how does that contradict?

Alternatively, maybe the Revolver (Evidence 5) is a high-caliber weapon, which would have significant recoil. A blind person might not handle it as effectively, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, looking back at Testimony 3: "Machi practically left his signature at the scene." If the signature is something only a blind person would do, but the evidence shows something that a blind person couldn't have done. For example, if the crime required precise visual alignment, like the Igniter and Remote Trigger (Evidence 13 and 15), which have a 30-foot range. If the igniter had to be placed precisely, a blind person might not be able to position it correctly. But that's not directly an evidence-testimony pair.

Wait, the problem says "which evidence and testimony contradict each other?" So one piece of evidence that directly contradicts a specific testimony.

Let me think again. Let's check each testimony against possible evidences.

Testimony 3: Machi left his signature. If the signature is the Brooch (Evidence 4), but the Brooch belongs to Lamiroir, not Machi. So the Brooch being there would not be Machi's signature. But the Brooch is found at the scene, and if Ema claims it's Machi's signature, but it's actually Lamiroir's, that would contradict. So Evidence 4 (Brooch belongs to Lamiroir) contradicts Testimony 3 (Machi's signature). So that pair would be Evidence 4 and Testimony 3. Because if the Brooch is Lamiroir's, then it's her signature, not Machi's. So Ema's claim that Machi left his signature (the Brooch) is contradicted by the evidence that the Brooch is Lamiroir's.

But wait, the Brooch is found at the crime scene, and it's Lamiroir's. So if the prosecution is saying Machi left his signature (the Brooch), but it's actually hers, that's a contradiction. So Evidence 4 (Brooch) contradicts Testimony 3 (Machi's signature), because the Brooch belongs to Lamiroir, not Machi. Therefore, the pair is Evidence 4 and Testimony 3.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says Machi left his signature, but if the Brooch is Lamiroir's, then that's not his signature. Hence, the evidence (4) contradicts testimony (3).

But wait, the testimony says "practically left his signature", which might not be the Brooch. Maybe the signature is something else, like the method. For example, if the crime required sight, but Machi is blind, that would be a contradiction. For instance, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows smeared writing in blood. If the killer wrote that, but Machi is blind, he couldn't have written it. So Evidence 9 (smeared writing) contradicts Testimony 3 (Machi left his signature via writing). Therefore, Evidence 9 and Testimony 3.

But the smeared writing is next to the victim's right hand. Perhaps the victim wrote it, not the killer. So if the victim wrote it, then it's not the killer's signature. But Ema's Testimony 3 claims it's Machi's signature. If the writing was done by the victim, then that contradicts. But how do we know who wrote it?

Alternatively, if the writing was done by the killer, and the killer is Machi (who's blind), then he couldn't have written it. So the presence of the writing (Evidence 9) contradicts Testimony 3, which says Machi left his signature (the writing). Therefore, Evidence 9 and Testimony 3 would contradict.

So which is the correct pair? Let me check the details again.

Testimony 3: "And, Machi practically left his signature at the scene."

If the signature is the smeared writing in blood (Evidence 9), but Machi is blind, then he can't write. So the existence of the writing would mean that the signature can't be his. Therefore, Evidence 9 contradicts Testimony 3.

Alternatively, if the signature is something else, like the Brooch, but the Brooch is Lamiroir's. Then Evidence 4 contradicts Testimony 3.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says the shooter was blind. Evidence 9's Crime Photo shows the victim was shot in the shoulder. If the shooter was blind, maybe the shot placement is different. But I don't think there's direct contradiction here.

Alternatively, the Key Ring (Evidence 6) in the victim's hand has keys to a guitar case and motorcycle. If the killer needed those keys, maybe Daryan (the guitarist detective) is involved. But Testimony 3 says it's Machi's signature. But this isn't directly a contradiction.

Hmm, I think the most direct contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Machi's signature) and Evidence 9's smeared writing. Because Machi is blind, he couldn't have written that. So the presence of the writing as his signature is impossible. Therefore, Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) contradicts Testimony 3.

But wait, the Crime Photo's description says the smeared writing is next to the victim's right hand. So maybe the victim wrote it, not the killer. If that's the case, then the writing isn't Machi's signature. So Ema's Testimony 3 is claiming that Machi left his signature (maybe the writing), but if the victim wrote it, then that's incorrect. But how do we know who wrote it?

Alternatively, the writing could be the victim's dying message, which would not be the killer's signature. So if Ema is saying the signature is Machi's, but the writing is the victim's, that's a contradiction. But without more info, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, let's check other possibilities. Evidence 5 (Revolver) belongs to LeTouse, the victim. If the killer used his own gun, that suggests the killer had access to it. If the killer was Machi, how would he get the victim's gun? Maybe that's possible, but not a direct contradiction.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 4 says "All of the evidence clearly points to the defendant." The defendant is likely Machi. But if there's evidence that points away from him, like the Revolver belonging to someone else, that could contradict. But the question asks for one pair.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) and Evidence 10 (two bullet holes on the wall). If the shooter was blind, firing multiple shots, that could explain the bullet holes. So that supports the testimony. No contradiction.

Hmm. Given the options, the most plausible contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Machi left his signature) and Evidence 9 (smeared writing). Since Machi is blind, he couldn't have written the message, so the presence of the writing contradicts the claim that he left his signature. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 9 and Testimony 3. But wait, the testimony doesn't explicitly say the signature is the writing. So maybe another angle.

Wait, another possible contradiction: Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) and Evidence 10 (Diagram showing two bullet holes in the door's wall). If the shooter was blind, they might have fired randomly, leading to multiple misses (the two bullet holes) and a hit. That would align with the testimony. So no contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 2: "No one in this country had a motive to kill the victim." Evidence 18 (Replica) shows that LeTouse was investigating the Borginian Cocoon, which is related to incuritis. The newspaper article (Evidence 19) talks about the Chief Justice's son having incuritis. So the motive might be connected to this, implying that someone from Borginia (like Lamiroir or Machi) had a motive. Since Lamiroir and Machi are from Borginia, if the murder was related to the replica, then the motive is from Borginia, not the country where the crime happened. Hence, Testimony 2 (no motive in the country) is contradicted by Evidence 18 (Borginian connection). So Evidence 18 and Testimony 2.

That makes sense. Because Evidence 18 shows the victim was involved with Borginia-related matters, which could mean the killer had a motive related to Borginia, thus someone from Borginia (not the country where the crime occurred) had a motive. Hence, Testimony 2's claim that no one in the country had a motive is contradicted by Evidence 18, which suggests a Borginian motive, implying that the killer is from Borginia and the motive is external. Therefore, the pair is Evidence 18 and Testimony 2.

Yes, this seems like a solid contradiction. Because the replica is part of the victim's investigation, which is related to Borginia, and the motive for the murder could be linked to Borginia. Thus, Ema's claim that no one in the country (the local country, not Borginia) had a motive is contradicted by the evidence showing a Borginian connection, implying the motive was from Borginia, hence someone from Borginia (like Machi or Lamiroir) had a motive. Therefore, Evidence 18 contradicts Testimony 2.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 2}

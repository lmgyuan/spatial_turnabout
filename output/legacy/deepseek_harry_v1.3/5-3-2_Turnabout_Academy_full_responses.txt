Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to pick one pair where the evidence contradicts the testimony.

First, let's look at the testimonies given by Scuttlebutt (Myriam Scuttlebutt). Testimony 4 says, "I'm positive it was Juniper because she was wearing the costume that she had made!" The caption mentions a photo showing the back of a figure in a plain blue costume. 

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 4 is the Stage Costume, which has a glowing star pattern and comes with notes. There's also Evidence 10, the Glowing Costume Photo, which shows the costume glowing because of fluorescent paint. So the actual costume Juniper was supposed to wear glows in the dark, but the photo Scuttlebutt refers to shows a plain blue costume. That's a contradiction. The testimony claims it's Juniper because of the costume, but the real costume glows, not plain blue. So the photo in the testimony (plain blue) doesn't match the actual glowing costume described in Evidence 4 and 10.

Wait, but in Testimony 4, the caption mentions a plain blue costume, while the Stage Costume (Evidence 4) is described as having a glowing star pattern. So the testimony's photo shows a plain costume, but the actual costume was glowing with stars. Therefore, the person in the photo isn't wearing Juniper's actual costume, which contradicts Scuttlebutt's testimony that it was Juniper because of the costume. 

So the evidence would be Evidence 4 (Stage Costume) which describes the glowing star pattern, contradicting Testimony 4 which refers to a plain blue costume. That's the contradiction. Therefore, the pair is evidence 4 and testimony 4.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. They provided a list of characters, evidence, and testimonies. The key is to cross-reference the evidence details with the testimonies given, looking for inconsistencies.

First, looking at the testimonies from Hugh O'Conner (Testimony 0 to 6). Testimony 3 says, "Oh, let me add I never went to the art room. There was no reason for me to be there." So he claims he wasn't in the art room.

Now, checking the evidence. Evidence 9 is the Tape Recorder. The description says that Prof. Means used Hugh to pass it on to the police. Wait, if Hugh gave the tape to the police, but the tape was recorded in the art room at 7:10 PM on the 23rd. If Hugh was involved in passing the fake tape, which was recorded in the art room, then maybe he was there, contradicting his testimony that he never went to the art room. 

But wait, the testimony is from Hugh, and the evidence says Means used Hugh to pass the tape. So does that imply Hugh was in the art room? Or did he just handle the tape later? Hmm. Alternatively, there's Evidence 2: Courte's Planner. It mentions that on the 23rd, Courte had a meeting with Hugh. So if Hugh met Courte on the 23rd, perhaps that meeting was in the art room? But Hugh's testimony says he didn't go to the art room. So if their meeting was in the art room, that would contradict his statement. But where was the meeting? The planner just says "Meet with Hugh" but doesn't specify the location. 

Wait, the Tape Recorder (Evidence 9) was recorded in the art room. The fake tape was created there. If Hugh was involved in passing the tape, maybe he was present there. But his testimony says he never went to the art room. So if the tape was made there, and he gave it to the police, that could mean he was there. Alternatively, maybe Means used Hugh without Hugh being present. Hmm, but how would Hugh get the tape if he wasn't there?

Alternatively, Evidence 16 is the "Hugh" Scrap found onstage. If Hugh was onstage, but his testimony says he was meditating at the archery range till 7 PM, then after that he went to the main building and saw Juniper at 7:15. The murder happened between 6-8 PM. The scrap with his name found onstage might contradict his alibi if he was supposed to be elsewhere. But that's less direct. 

Wait, let's look again. Testimony 3: Hugh says he never went to the art room. Evidence 9's tape was recorded in the art room. If Hugh was involved in passing the fake tape, but he says he wasn't there, that's a contradiction. But the evidence says "Prof. Means used Hugh to pass it on to the police." So Hugh was the one who gave the tape to the police, but the tape was created in the art room. Does that mean Hugh was in the art room to obtain the tape? If the tape was recorded there, and Hugh gave it to the police, but he claims he wasn't there, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 9 contradicts Testimony 3. 

Alternatively, Evidence 2 (Courte's Planner) shows that Courte had a meeting with Hugh on the 23rd. If that meeting was in the art room, then Hugh's Testimony 3 (never went to art room) would be contradicted. But the planner doesn't specify the location. So maybe that's not solid. 

Alternatively, the Mock Trial Script (Evidence 5) mentions the line "You're a goner!" which is on the tape (Evidence 9). The tape is a fake created by Means using Hugh. So Hugh was involved in fabricating the tape, which was recorded in the art room. If Hugh was part of creating the fake tape, he must have been in the art room, which contradicts his testimony. 

Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 9 (Tape Recorder) and Testimony 3 (Hugh saying he never went to the art room). Because the tape was recorded there, and Hugh was used by Means to pass it, implying Hugh was involved in the art room. Hence, they contradict.

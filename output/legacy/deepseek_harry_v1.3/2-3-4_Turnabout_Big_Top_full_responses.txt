Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all given. Let me start by going through the testimonies first. 

Looking at the testimonies by Acro: Testimony 0 says he could have lifted something the size of the bust. Testimony 1 mentions his strong upper body but injured legs. Testimony 2 claims that lifting the bust and looking out the window would've been impossible. Testimony 3 says he couldn't exert force on his lower body. Testimony 4 and 5 talk about not knowing the Ringmaster's head location and thus not being able to drop the bust.

Now, the evidence. The key here is to find a contradiction. Let's check Evidence 15, the Max G. Bust, which is a heavy bronze statue. Acro in Testimony 0 admits he could lift it, but in Testimony 2 he says lifting the bust and looking out the window was impossible. Wait, but why? If he can lift it (Testimony 0), why can't he look out the window? Maybe because he's in a wheelchair or has leg injuries. But how does that connect to the evidence?

Wait, the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) shows the victim lying on a box with footprints leading there. If Acro can't walk, how could there be footprints? But Acro's testimonies mention his legs being injured. If the footprints are present, but Acro couldn't have made them due to his legs, that would contradict. However, the Crime Photo's footprints could be from someone else. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at the Note (Evidence 16). The note was placed by Acro in Regina's pocket. The note lures the murderer to meet. If Acro is the one who placed the note, maybe he's the one who set up the meeting, which would imply he planned the murder. But how does that contradict his testimonies? His testimonies are about physical ability.

Wait, Testimony 4 says Acro couldn't have known the location of the Ringmaster's head, making dropping the bust unrealistic. But if the bust was used to hit the back of the head (as per the autopsy in Evidence 11), then maybe the location of the head was known. But how does that connect?

Another angle: The Wooden Box (Evidence 12) was locked with a key. The victim was hunched over it. The Small Seasoning Bottle (Evidence 13) inside has pepper. The Scarf (Evidence 19) has pepper stains. Maybe the pepper was used to provoke the lion or something. But how does that tie to testimonies?

Wait, Acro's Testimony 2 says lifting the bust and looking out the window was impossible. But the Circus Map (Evidence 6) shows that Acro's room is on the third floor. If the crime happened in the plaza, maybe the bust was dropped from a window. If Acro was on the third floor, could he have thrown the bust from there? If he couldn't move his lower body, but could lift the bust (Testimony 0), maybe he could have dropped it from the window. But Testimony 2 says lifting the bust and looking out the window would be impossible. That's a contradiction. Because if he can lift the bust (as per Testimony 0), but says he can't lift it and look out the window (Testimony 2), but maybe the evidence shows that the bust was indeed dropped from the window. 

Wait, the bust was taken from the cafeteria before the crime (Evidence 15). The crime scene photo (Evidence 2) shows the victim on a box in the snow with footprints. If the bust was the murder weapon (blunt force trauma), and it's heavy, maybe it was dropped from above. Acro's room is on the third floor. If he lifted the bust and dropped it from the window, that would require him to look out the window to aim. But his Testimony 2 says that lifting the bust and looking out the window was impossible. However, Evidence 15 is the bust itself, which was moved. So if the bust was used in the crime, and Acro could lift it (Testimony 0), but claims he couldn't have done both lifting and looking (Testimony 2), then maybe the evidence that the bust was used from the window (like the crime photo's location) contradicts his testimony. 

Wait, but how does the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) show footprints leading to the victim. If Acro can't walk, he couldn't have made the footprints, but that's separate. Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and some evidence. Testimony 4 says he couldn't have known the location of the Ringmaster's head, but if the bust was dropped from above, you need to know where the head is. The autopsy says the back of the head was hit. So if Acro dropped the bust from above, he would need to know where the head was. But Testimony 4 says he couldn't have known, which would contradict the method of attack (dropping the bust from above). But which evidence contradicts that?

Alternatively, the Note (Evidence 16) was placed by Acro to lure the Ringmaster. So Acro set up the meeting. If he set the meeting at 10 PM, he would know where the Ringmaster would be at that time, which is the lodging house plaza. Therefore, he would know the location of the Ringmaster's head when he arrived there. So Testimony 4, which claims he couldn't have known the location, is contradicted by the Note (Evidence 16), which shows Acro lured the Ringmaster to a specific location. Therefore, Acro knew exactly where the Ringmaster would be at 10 PM, making Testimony 4 a lie. 

So the evidence would be the Note (Evidence 16) and Testimony 4. Because the note was written by Acro to get the Ringmaster to the plaza, meaning Acro knew the location where the Ringmaster would be, contradicting his statement that he couldn't have known the head's location.

Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair. Let me go through the testimonies and evidences step by step.

First, the testimonies are all from Ema. Let me look at each one.

Testimony 0: The victim planned revenge on Troupe Gramarye during Trucy's show. That connects to the Gramarye notebook maybe, which is Evidence 5. But I need contradictions.

Testimony 1: Reus was going to steal the Gramarye notebook from the defendant (Trucy, I assume). Then Testimony 3 says Reus did steal the notebook, but the defendant murdered him before he could reveal secrets.

Now looking at the evidences. Evidence 3 is the fingerprinting results. It says Betty's fingerprints are on the top, along with victim and Bonny. No Trucy's prints. But Testimony 5 says the defendant's (Trucy) prints were on the tape, implying she moved it. But Evidence 3 shows no Trucy's fingerprints. So that's a contradiction. The testimony claims Trucy's prints were there, but the evidence says they weren't found. So Testimony 5 (index 5) contradicts Evidence 3 (index 3). That's the pair. Let me check others to be sure.

Another possibility: The contract (Evidence 8) and the Trucy's Note (Evidence 16) both have her signature. The note's signature is exactly the same as the contract, which might suggest forgery. If the testimony says Trucy signed something, but the note's signature is a perfect match (beyond human), maybe implying it's forged. But which testimony would that contradict? Maybe Testimony 5 isn't about the note but about fingerprints. 

Wait, Testimony 5 is about the defendant's (Trucy) prints being on the tape. But Evidence 3 says there are no Trucy's fingerprints, but Betty's are present. So if Ema says Trucy's prints are on the tape (the tape from the crime?), but the evidence shows her prints aren't there, that's a direct contradiction. So yes, Evidence 3 and Testimony 5. So {"evidence": 3, "testimony": 5}.

{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. There are multiple pieces of evidence and testimonies provided. I need to go through each testimony and see if any of the evidence directly contradicts it.

First, let's look at the testimonies. Testimony 3 is from Bonny, who says, "It was in the script... and I really wanted to see it... but I couldn't because of the accident." The key point here is that the fire trick was in the script. 

Now, looking at the evidence. Evidence 7 is the Show Script, which is Bonny's script. The description says that the fire trick was canceled due to the incident. So the script mentions the fire trick, but it was canceled. However, Bonny's testimony says that the fire trick was in the script and she wanted to see it but couldn't because of the accident. Wait, but if the script itself had the fire trick canceled, that would mean the script no longer includes it. But the testimony says "it was in the script," which would contradict if the script actually shows it was canceled. But let me check the exact wording of Evidence 7 again.

Evidence 7's description states: "Bonny's script. The fire trick was canceled due to the incident. The script has this to say about the fire trick: 'This will be dangerous. Make sure the fire bucket is ready!'" Wait, that's a bit confusing. The script originally had the fire trick, but it was canceled after the incident. But Bonny's testimony says the fire trick was in the script and she couldn't see it because of the accident. If the script was modified to cancel the trick, maybe the original script included it, but after the incident, it was canceled. But the testimony is referring to the script before the accident. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is that the script mentions the fire trick, but the fire bucket (Evidence 4) was empty and dusty, implying it wasn't prepared as the script instructed. But that's a different angle. Wait, the main point is Bonny's testimony about the script including the fire trick versus evidence showing it was canceled. Wait, no. The script (Evidence 7) says the fire trick was canceled due to the incident. So if the fire trick was canceled, then it wasn't part of the actual performance. But Bonny is saying that the fire trick was in the script and she wanted to see it but couldn't because of the accident. If the script had the fire trick planned, but the accident (the incident) led to its cancellation, then Bonny's testimony is accurate. Wait, but Evidence 7 says the fire trick was canceled due to the incident. So maybe the script originally had the fire trick, which is why Bonny refers to it, but after the incident (the murder?), it was canceled. That might not be a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is that the script mentions preparing the fire bucket, but the fire bucket (Evidence 4) was empty and dusty, showing it wasn't prepared, which would contradict the script's instruction. But that's between Evidence 4 and the script, not necessarily a testimony.

Wait, the problem is to find a testimony that contradicts evidence. Let's see. Testimony 3 is Bonny saying the fire trick was in the script. The script (Evidence 7) is Bonny's script, which does mention the fire trick (as per the repeated note in all evidence descriptions). The evidence's main description says the fire trick was canceled due to the incident, but the script's own note (repeated) says "This will be dangerous. Make sure the fire bucket is ready!" So the script does mention the fire trick, but it was canceled. So Bonny's testimony that "it was in the script" is correct. Therefore, maybe there's no contradiction here.

Looking at other testimonies. Testimony 4 from Betty says "Shut up! You're gonna give it away! ...Anyway, I was real busy." Then Testimony 5 from Bonny: "Yeah... Way too busy to have the chance to kill Mr. Reus..." But the evidence might show that Betty's fingerprints were on the coffin (Evidence 3: Betty's fingerprints on the top of the coffin). If Betty claimed she was too busy, but her fingerprints were found on the murder weapon or the scene, that could contradict. However, the testimonies 4 and 5 are about being busy, but the evidence with fingerprints is Evidence 3. So perhaps Betty's testimony about being busy contradicts the evidence that her fingerprints are on the coffin, implying she was there. But the problem is to pick one pair. Let me check again.

Alternatively, Testimony 0 from Betty: "It's true. I had business in the understage passage because of the upcoming trick." Then Evidence 9: Trucy's Statement says she moved the stage lifts to cover for Bonny's mistake, which was Stage Lift #2 (Evidence 11). Maybe if Betty was supposed to be in the understage passage, but Trucy had to move the lift, there's a contradiction? Not sure. Or maybe the clipboard (Evidence 13) relates to the contract and the dishonest dealings, which could connect to Retinz. But I'm not seeing the direct contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 3 is Bonny saying the fire trick was in the script and she wanted to see it but couldn't due to the accident. But the script (Evidence 7) mentions that the fire trick was canceled due to the incident. Wait, if the script was written before the incident, then the fire trick was part of the plan. The cancellation would be after the incident. So the script still had the fire trick in it, but it was canceled after. Therefore, Bonny's statement that "it was in the script" is correct. So maybe that's not the contradiction.

Looking at Evidence 16: Trucy's Note, which is a note with her signature telling Bonny to get the video camera after Mr. Reus comes out. But Trucy's Statement (Evidence 9) says she told no one about moving the stage lifts. However, the note might be a forgery, as the signature is exactly the same as on the contract, implying it was forged (since signatures normally have variations). So maybe the note is fake, which contradicts Bonny's testimony if she received it. But I'm not sure which testimony that would contradict.

Alternatively, let's consider Testimony 2 from Betty: "That's right. It's a very dangerous trick, so I had to make sure we were prepared for it." But Evidence 4 (Fire Bucket) is empty and dusty, showing they weren't prepared. So Betty's testimony about being prepared for the dangerous fire trick (which would require the fire bucket) contradicts the empty fire bucket. But the problem is to match evidence and testimony. So if Betty says they prepared for the fire trick, but the fire bucket was empty, that's a contradiction. Evidence 4 vs Testimony 2. But the user wants only one pair. Let me check Testimony 2 and Evidence 4. Testimony 2: Betty says they were prepared. Evidence 4: Fire Bucket was empty. That's a contradiction. However, Testimony 2's person is Betty, and she's talking about preparing for the fire trick. The script (Evidence 7) says "make sure the fire bucket is ready", but Evidence 4 shows it wasn't. So the contradiction is between Betty's Testimony 2 and Evidence 4. But according to the problem's instructions, the user wants one pair. Let me check the numbers again. Testimony 2 is Betty's statement about being prepared, and Evidence 4 is the empty fire bucket. That seems like a contradiction. Alternatively, Testimony 3 from Bonny: she wanted to see the fire trick which was in the script but couldn't because of the accident. However, Evidence 7's description says the fire trick was canceled due to the incident. If the fire trick was canceled, then it wasn't performed, so Bonny's testimony that it was in the script (which it was) isn't a contradiction. Unless the script no longer included it. Wait, the description of Evidence 7 says "The fire trick was canceled due to the incident." But the script's content (the actual script) still has the fire trick instructions, as per the repeated note. So the script had the fire trick, but it was canceled after the incident. Therefore, Bonny's testimony that the fire trick was in the script is correct. So no contradiction here.

Another angle: Evidence 3 (Fingerprinting Results) shows Betty's fingerprints on the coffin's top, but she claims she was too busy (Testimony 5). However, Testimony 5 is from Bonny, not Betty. Testimony 4 and 5: Betty says she was busy, Bonny agrees. Evidence 3 shows Betty's prints on the coffin, which might imply she had time to touch it, contradicting her being too busy. But Testimony 4 is Betty's, Testimony 5 is Bonny's. So if Betty's fingerprints are on the coffin (Evidence 3), but she said she was busy (Testimony 4), that could be a contradiction. But the user wants one pair, so maybe Evidence 3 and Testimony 4. However, in Testimony 4, Betty says "I was real busy," but her fingerprints being on the coffin would mean she had time to touch it, thus contradicting her alibi. So that's a possible contradiction. 

But let me confirm. If Betty's fingerprints are on the coffin's top (Evidence 3), and she claims she was too busy (Testimony 4), then the presence of her fingerprints suggests she was there, contradicting her claim of being too busy. So Evidence 3 contradicts Testimony 4. But according to the evidence list, Evidence 3's description says that Betty's fingerprints were found on the top of the coffin. So yes, if Betty was supposed to be busy but her prints are on the murder scene, that's a contradiction. So that could be the pair: Evidence 3 and Testimony 4.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 0: Betty says she had business in the understage passage because of the upcoming trick. But the understage passage is part of the stage diagram (Evidence 1). If there's evidence that she wasn't there, but I don't think there's direct evidence contradicting that. 

Wait, let's recap. The user wants a single pair where the evidence contradicts the testimony. The strongest contradiction seems to be between Betty's testimony (Testimony 4) where she claims to be busy, but her fingerprints (Evidence 3) are on the coffin. Or between Betty's Testimony 2 (saying they prepared for the fire trick) and Evidence 4 (fire bucket empty). 

Testimony 2 from Betty: "That's right. It's a very dangerous trick, so I had to make sure we were prepared for it." If being prepared includes having the fire bucket ready, but Evidence 4 shows the fire bucket was empty and dusty, that directly contradicts her statement. So Evidence 4 contradicts Testimony 2. That's a solid contradiction. 

Alternatively, Testimony 3 from Bonny: "It was in the script... but I couldn't because of the accident." If the script (Evidence 7) says the fire trick was canceled, but the script's own note still mentions the fire trick. Wait, the script's main description says "The fire trick was canceled due to the incident." But the script's content (the actual lines in the script) still include the fire trick's instruction to prepare the fire bucket. So the fire trick was part of the original script, then canceled after the incident. Therefore, Bonny's statement that it was in the script is correct. So no contradiction here.

So between Testimony 2 and Evidence 4: Betty says they prepared for the fire trick (which would require the fire bucket to be ready), but the fire bucket is empty. That's a direct contradiction. So that would be the pair: Evidence 4 and Testimony 2.

But wait, the user instructions say to output the evidence and testimony numbers. Testimony 2 is Betty's testimony: "That's right. It's a very dangerous trick, so I had to make sure we were prepared for it." Evidence 4 is the empty fire bucket. Therefore, this directly contradicts. So the answer should be {"evidence": 4, "testimony": 2}.

But let me check again. Evidence 4's description: "A bucket to be used in case of fire. Not only was it empty, but dust lines the inside of the pail." If the fire trick required the bucket to be ready (as per the script's note), but it's empty and dusty, then they weren't prepared. Betty's Testimony 2 says they prepared. Contradiction. So yes, this pair is correct.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 2}

Okay, let's tackle this. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair. Let me start by going through the testimonies and evidences provided.

First, let's look at the testimonies from Ponco. Testimony 3 says, "Mommy Metis fell down near the round window on the workbench side of the room!" So, according to Ponco, the location where Metis fell was near the round window on the workbench side. 

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 9 is the Seven-Year-Old Photos, which includes two photos of the body and crime scene. The caption mentions that the victim (Metis) is lying on the operating table, and on the other side of the room is a workbench. The victim's clothes are drenched in blood. 

Wait, the testimony says Metis fell near the round window on the workbench side. But the photo from Evidence 9 shows the body on the operating table, which is across the room from the workbench. The workbench is on the other side. So if the workbench is on the other side of the room from the operating table, then the round window near the workbench side would be opposite where the body was found in the photo. That's a contradiction because the photo places the body on the operating table, not near the workbench's window. 

So Testimony 3 by Ponco claims the body was near the workbench window, but Evidence 9's photo shows the body on the operating table, which is across the room. Therefore, they contradict each other. That must be the pair.

Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies. Let's start by looking at the testimonies provided. Most of them are from Fulbright. Testimony 3 says that the lighter has Athena's prints, and Testimony 4 mentions the prints are from the right hand's thumb, index, and middle fingers. 

Now, checking the evidence list. Evidence 18 is the Lighter, which has Athena's prints in the victim's blood. But wait, the description of Evidence 18 says it has Clay Terran's (the victim's) fingerprints and blood on it. Wait, that's conflicting. If Fulbright's testimony says the lighter has Athena's prints, but the evidence actually lists the victim's fingerprints, that's a contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 18's description: "It has Athena's prints on it in the victim's blood. A lighter that can transform into a handgun. It has Clay Terran's fingerprints and blood on it." Wait, this seems conflicting. The evidence says both Athena's prints and Clay's prints? Or is there a mistake here? Let me re-read. The description says "Athena's prints on it in the victim's blood" and "Clay Terran's fingerprints and blood on it." So perhaps both sets of prints? But Fulbright's testimony (Testimony 3) claims that the lighter has Athena's prints as proof she's the culprit. However, the evidence shows that the lighter also has the victim's fingerprints. That could imply that the victim handled it, which might contradict Athena being the culprit. Alternatively, maybe the victim's fingerprints being present would suggest he was holding it, which might conflict with Fulbright's assertion that Athena used it. But the testimony is specifically about Athena's prints being on it. If the evidence does mention Athena's prints, then maybe there's another angle.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 5 says the prints are positioned as if someone was holding it lit. But if the lighter was used as a handgun (as per Evidence 18's description), then the grip might be different. Holding a lighter to light it versus holding it as a gun. The positioning of the prints might not match the act of lighting. Alternatively, since the lighter can transform into a handgun, the way someone holds it as a gun might require a different grip, which could contradict the testimony about the prints matching a lighting grip.

But maybe a clearer contradiction is between Testimony 3, which says the lighter has Athena's prints, but Evidence 18 also lists Clay's fingerprints. If the lighter has both, then maybe Athena's prints could have been placed there innocently, but the victim's presence complicates the scenario. However, the main contradiction could be that Fulbright claims the prints are Athena's, but the evidence might show that the victim's prints are also present, which could suggest he was the one holding it. Wait, but the evidence says "has Athena's prints on it in the victim's blood. It has Clay Terran's fingerprints and blood on it." So maybe the blood is the victim's, and the fingerprints are both Athena's and Clay's. If Athena's prints are in the victim's blood, that would mean she handled the lighter after the victim was bleeding. But if the victim's own fingerprints are on the lighter, that might suggest he was holding it before his death. If the testimony claims that Athena's prints are the proof, but the evidence shows that the victim also handled it, that could indicate that the presence of Athena's prints could be explained in another way (like she picked it up after the victim was attacked). But maybe the key contradiction is elsewhere.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 4 and Evidence 17. Testimony 4 says the prints are right hand's thumb, index, and middle fingers. Evidence 17 is Aura's statement that the perp held a lighter with the left hand and a knife in the right. If the perp was holding the lighter in the left hand, then the prints should be from the left hand. But Testimony 4 says the prints are from the right hand. That would contradict each other. Because if the lighter was held in the left hand (as per Aura's statement), then the fingerprints should be left-handed. But Fulbright's testimony says the prints are right-handed. That's a direct contradiction. So Evidence 17 (Aura's Statement) says the perp held the lighter in the left hand, but the testimony says the prints are from the right hand. Therefore, the prints on the lighter (right hand) don't match the way the perp was holding it (left hand), implying someone else (like Athena) held it with the right, but the actual perp used the left. Therefore, this contradiction shows that Athena's prints might not be from the crime, but perhaps she handled it later. So this would mean the evidence (Aura's Statement, 17) contradicts Testimony 4 (which is about the right-hand prints), but Testimony 3 is about the lighter having Athena's prints. Wait, but Testimony 3 is about the existence of the prints, not the hand. The contradiction would be between the hand used (left in Evidence 17) vs. the hand that left the prints (right in Testimony 4). Therefore, the fact that the prints are right-handed contradicts Aura's statement that the perp used the left hand for the lighter. Therefore, the evidence that is Aura's Statement (17) and Testimony 4 (prints on the lighter from right hand) contradict each other. Alternatively, Testimony 3 is the one claiming the prints are Athena's, but Evidence 17's statement about the perp holding it in the left hand would mean that if the prints are from the right hand, then the perp couldn't have left them. Therefore, Athena's prints being right-handed would suggest she wasn't the perp, because the perp used the left hand. So the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (right hand prints) and Evidence 17 (perp's left hand). Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 17 and Testimony 4. But looking at the indices: Evidence 17 is Aura's Statement, Testimony 4 is Fulbright's about the three right-hand prints. So that's a valid contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be {"evidence": 17, "testimony": 4}. Alternatively, maybe the lighter (Evidence 18) is involved. Wait, but the testimony is about the prints being on the lighter. Let me check the exact details. Evidence 18 says the lighter has Athena's prints in the victim's blood and also Clay's fingerprints. Testimony 3 says the lighter has Athena's prints as proof she's the culprit. But the presence of the victim's prints complicates that. However, the main contradiction here is between the perp's handedness according to Aura's statement (left hand) and the prints being right-handed. So the contradiction is between Evidence 17 (Aura's statement that the perp held the lighter in the left hand) and Testimony 4 (prints from right hand). Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 17 and Testimony 4. That would be {"evidence":17, "testimony":4}.

{"evidence": 17, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by looking at the testimonies given by Fulbright. There are four of them, Testimony 0 to 4.

Testimony 3 says, "So the very fact that I'm afraid of the moon rock means I'm not him!" Here, Fulbright is arguing that his fear of the moon rock proves he's not the phantom. The phantom, according to the evidence, might have a certain profile. Let's check the evidences related to the moon rock and the phantom's profile.

Looking at Evidence 13: Phantom's Psych Profile states that the subject's emotions rarely fluctuate and doesn't experience feelings like normal people. So if the phantom can't feel fear normally, then Fulbright's fear of the moon rock would indicate he's not the phantom. But wait, there's also Evidence 12: Moon Rock Earring, which is connected to Athena's mother. However, more importantly, Evidence 2 mentions that Fulbright himself says the phantom stole the moon rock and killed Dr. Cykes. Also, the Psych Profile (Evidence 13) says the phantom doesn't experience normal emotions. Therefore, if Fulbright is the phantom, he shouldn't feel fear, especially about the moon rock. But he claims fear (Testimony 0, 3), which contradicts Evidence 13. So the contradiction is between Fulbright's Testimony 3 (his fear proving he's not the phantom) and the Phantom's Psych Profile (Evidence 13) which states the phantom doesn't have such emotions. Hence, Testimony 3 is contradicted by Evidence 13.

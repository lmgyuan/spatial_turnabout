Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find a contradiction between one of the evidences and one of the testimonies provided. Let me start by going through the testimonies and the evidences to see where there might be a mismatch.

First, the testimonies are all from Cody Hackins. Let me list them out again. Testimony 0 to 8, all by Cody. His testimonies mention that he went to the studio to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, took a path through the woods to avoid the security lady, got lost for 30 minutes, and then saw the Steel Samurai fighting the bad guy. He mentions that he didn't have his camera at the time for a photo, which is testimony 8.

Looking at the evidences, there's Evidence 15: Cody's Camera. The description says it's a new digital camera that Cody always carries, though he's still learning to use it. Wait, in testimony 8, Cody says "If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot..." But according to Evidence 15, he always carries the camera. That's a contradiction. So, the testimony says he didn't have the camera, but the evidence says he does. Therefore, Evidence 15 contradicts Testimony 8.

But wait, let me double-check. The testimony is Cody saying he didn't have the camera then, but the evidence states he always carries it. Unless there's a time discrepancy, but the testimonies mention the day of the crime. So if the camera was always with him on that day, then his statement that he didn't have it would be a lie. So that's a clear contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at other possibilities. Let's check other evidences and testimonies. For example, Evidence 5 is Powers'(?) Photo taken at the gate at 2:00 PM showing someone dragging a leg. If any testimony mentions someone's movement conflicting with that time, but Cody's testimonies don't directly address that. Another angle: Testimony 3 says Cody was going to the studio, but maybe the guidemap (Evidence 2) shows a different path. Wait, the guidemap is a map of the studios, but Cody's testimony 2 says he went through the woods off the path to avoid the security lady. But maybe the map shows that the path through the woods isn't a valid route? Not sure. Alternatively, the Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11) blocked the path between 2:15 and 4:00 PM. If Cody was moving around during that time, but he claims to have gone through a path that was blocked. Wait, Cody's testimony 2 says he went through the woods off the path to avoid the old lady (Security Lady). The blocked path (by Mr. Monkey's Head) was from 2:15 to 4:00. The murder was at 2:30 PM. If Cody was moving around during that time, maybe he couldn't have gone through the main path because of the block. But he took the woods instead. So that might not be a contradiction. 

Wait, let me focus again. The main contradiction I found earlier between Evidence 15 and Testimony 8 seems solid. Because Cody says he didn't have the camera, but the evidence says he always carries it. That's a direct contradiction. That seems like the most straightforward one. 

Another possible contradiction: Evidence 5 is the photo showing someone (maybe Powers) dragging a leg at 2:00 PM. The Security Lady (Character 4) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene. If the photo shows Powers at 2:00 PM, but the autopsy report (Evidence 3) says death at 2:30 PM. But Powers is the defendant. If the Security Lady's testimony is that she saw Powers going to the scene, but the photo shows him at the gate at 2:00 PM, maybe. But that's not directly a contradiction with Cody's testimonies. The question asks for a pair between evidence and testimony from the given list. The testimonies here are all from Cody. So only Cody's testimonies are considered for contradiction with any evidence. So the other testimonies (from other characters) aren't part of the testimonies provided here. The given testimonies are all by Cody. Therefore, looking back, the strongest contradiction is Evidence 15 (Cody's Camera) with Testimony 8 (Cody saying he didn't have his camera). Therefore, the answer should be evidence 15 and testimony 8. But wait, the evidence index is 15, and testimony index 8. Let me confirm the indices. 

Evidences are numbered 0 to 18. Evidence 15 is "Cody's Camera". Testimonies are numbered 0 to 8. Testimony 8 is the one where he says "If I had my camera with me...". So the correct pair is evidence 15 and testimony 8. Yes.

{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 8}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So, the task is to find one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony. Let's go through the testimonies and see which ones might clash with the evidence provided.

First, looking at the testimonies from Cody. Testimony 5 says he took a few shots but erased them because it was too late. But Evidence 15 is Cody's Camera, a digital camera that he always carries. Wait, if he erased the photos, but maybe there's evidence that he actually had a photo taken. Let me check the evidences again.

Looking at Evidence 5: Powers'(?) Photo. The description says it was taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios on Oct 15 at 2:00 PM, Photo #2. The photo shows someone dragging a leg. Now, if Cody's testimony says he erased the photos because they were too late, but there's a photo existing (Evidence 5) that's timestamped during the time he was there, that could be a contradiction. Because if he erased all the photos, how does this photo exist?

Wait, but the testimony in question is Testimony 5 where he says he erased them. But Evidence 5 is a photo that's still present. That suggests that even though Cody claims he erased the photos, there's a photo (possibly his) that exists. However, the owner of the photo isn't explicitly stated. Wait, the photo in Evidence 5 is from the gate's camera, maybe? Or was it taken by Cody's camera?

Looking back at Evidence 5's description: "Taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios. [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]". Hmm, if the photo was taken at the gate's security camera, then Cody's testimony about erasing his own photos wouldn't affect that. But if the photo in Evidence 5 was taken by Cody's camera, then his testimony about erasing them would contradict the existence of the photo.

But the problem is, Evidence 5's source isn't specified. However, Cody's camera (Evidence 15) is a digital camera he always carries. Maybe the photo in Evidence 5 was taken by Cody's camera. If so, then his Testimony 5, where he says he erased the photos, contradicts the existence of the photo in Evidence 5. Because if he erased them, the photo shouldn't exist. Unless he erased some but not all. Let's check the testimonies again.

Testimony 5: "I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em." So he erased all the shots he took. But Evidence 5 is a photo taken at 2:00 PM. If Cody took that photo, then Testimony 5 is a lie because the photo still exists. Therefore, Evidence 5 contradicts Testimony 5. However, Evidence 5's name is "Powers'(?) Photo", which might imply it's a photo of Powers, possibly taken by the security camera. But the security lady's testimony isn't listed here. Alternatively, maybe the photo is from Cody's camera. Since he had the camera (Evidence 15) and took photos, but claims to have erased them. However, the evidence list includes Evidence 5 as a photo taken at that time, which could be from his camera. So if the photo exists as evidence, but Cody says he erased them, that's a contradiction.

Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 5 and Testimony 5. Wait, but the question specifies to choose one pair. Let me confirm. The evidence list has Evidence 5 as Powers'(?) Photo, and the testimony is Testimony 5 where Cody says he erased the photos. If that photo was taken by Cody's camera, then his testimony that he erased them would be contradicted by the existence of the photo. But the evidence doesn't explicitly state that the photo is from Cody's camera. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's look at another angle. Testimony 3 says the lens wouldn't open in time, so he missed it. But maybe there's evidence that a photo was taken. Wait, Evidence 15 is Cody's camera. If he tried to take a photo but the lens didn't open (Testimony 3), then the camera should have no photos. But if there's a photo in evidence (like Evidence 5) that was taken by him, that would contradict. But the evidence doesn't state that the photo is from his camera. Alternatively, the camera's existence (Evidence 15) might have data that shows photos were taken and not erased, but the problem is that the testimonies and evidence need to directly contradict.

Alternatively, let's consider Testimony 5 where Cody says he erased the photos. If the camera (Evidence 15) is part of the evidence, maybe the camera would have some stored photos that weren't erased. But without explicit info on the camera's contents, maybe that's not the case. So perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (lens wouldn't open) and Evidence 15 (camera's existence). Wait, no. Because Testimony 3 says he tried to take a picture but the lens didn't open, so he missed it. But if he had the camera (Evidence 15) and there's a photo taken (like Evidence 5), that would mean the lens did open. But again, unless Evidence 5 is from his camera.

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 1 and some evidence. Testimony 1: "The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain." But maybe the script (Evidence 10) from Episode 13 has a different plot point. Wait, the memo (Evidence 9) says "Bring me the script from Episode 13", and the script is Evidence 10. Maybe the script shows that in Episode 13, the Steel Samurai doesn't escape, which would contradict Cody's testimony. But that's a stretch unless the script specifically says otherwise.

Alternatively, the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) has a break mended with duct tape. If the spear was broken but repaired, maybe the attack would require the spear to be intact, but that's not directly contradicting a testimony.

Looking back, the most direct contradiction is between Cody's Testimony 5 where he claims to have erased all the photos he took, and Evidence 5 (the photo of Powers at 2:00 PM). If that photo was taken by Cody's camera, then Testimony 5 is a lie. However, the evidence doesn't explicitly state the photo's source. But considering that Cody had the camera (Evidence 15) and was present, it's plausible. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 5 and Testimony 5.

But wait, Evidence 5 is called "Powers'(?) Photo", which might mean it's a photo of Powers, possibly taken by someone else. But the timestamp is 2:00 PM, and Cody was present. If Cody tried to take photos but erased them, but the security camera or another source took that photo, then there's no contradiction. But the problem is that the photo's origin isn't clear. However, in the context of the game, such photos are often taken by the security cameras, but in this case, the Security Lady (Character 4) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene, which might be supported by the photo. But the Security Lady's testimony isn't in the list here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (lens wouldn't open) and the existence of the camera (Evidence 15). But that's not a direct contradiction. The camera's existence doesn't prove the lens opened. 

Alternatively, maybe the photo in Evidence 5 shows Powers dragging his leg, which contradicts someone else's statement. For example, if someone testified Powers was walking normally, but that's not in the testimonies provided. 

Wait, looking at Testimony 0: Cody says "Yeah, you're right, pops." Not sure what that's in response to. 

Alternatively, consider the timeline. The murder was at 2:30 PM (Evidence 3). The path was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11) between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. So if someone needed to get to the scene, they had to be there before 2:15. The photo (Evidence 5) is at 2:00 PM showing Powers dragging his leg. If the path was blocked from 2:15, then maybe Powers couldn't have been there after 2:15, but the murder happened at 2:30. But how does that relate to testimonies?

Hmm. Maybe another angle. The Empty Bottle (Evidence 7) has Jack's fingerprints, which is a sleeping pill bottle. The Steak Plate (Evidence 16) has traces of sleeping pills and a bone. If someone testified about Jack not taking pills, but that's not in the given testimonies. 

Alternatively, let's look at the testimonies again. Cody's testimonies:

Testimony 0: Yeah, you're right, pops. (Probably agreeing to something.)

Testimony 1: The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.

Testimony 2: So I held up my camera to take a picture!

Testimony 3: But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.

Testimony 4: Th-that's all that happened. Yup.

Testimony 5: I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.

So in Testimony 2 and 3, he tried to take a picture but the lens didn't open. Then in Testimony 5, he says he took a few shots but erased them. Wait, this seems contradictory within his own testimonies. But the user is asking for a contradiction between a testimony and evidence, not internal contradictions.

But according to Testimony 5, he took shots but erased them. But Evidence 15 is his camera. If the camera has no photos, that's consistent. But if there's another photo (like Evidence 5) that was taken by him, then that's a contradiction. However, Evidence 5's origin isn't clear. 

Alternatively, maybe the camera (Evidence 15) is a digital camera, and even if he erased the photos, there might be a way to recover them. But the problem states that the evidence and testimony must contradict each other directly. 

Alternatively, the testimony says he erased the photos, but the camera's existence as evidence might imply that the photos could still be retrieved, but that's not a direct contradiction unless the evidence includes the photo.

Wait, but the user provided a list of evidences. Evidence 5 is a photo taken at 2:00 PM. If that photo was taken by Cody's camera (Evidence 15), then Testimony 5 (he erased them) contradicts the existence of the photo. So the pair would be Evidence 5 and Testimony 5.

But how do we know the photo is from Cody's camera? The evidence's name is "Powers'(?) Photo", which might suggest it's a photo of Powers, possibly from a security camera. But the Security Lady (Character 4) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene. The photo could be from the security camera at the gate, which would not be affected by Cody's actions. So if that's the case, there's no contradiction. 

Alternatively, if the photo in Evidence 5 is from Cody's camera, then Testimony 5 is a lie. But unless specified, we can't be sure. However, in the context of Ace Attorney games, such contradictions often involve the camera the witness used. Since Cody has the camera (Evidence 15) and claims he erased the photos, but a photo exists (Evidence 5) that he must have taken, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 5 (the photo) and Testimony 5 (erased the shots). 

So I think that's the intended contradiction here.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 5}

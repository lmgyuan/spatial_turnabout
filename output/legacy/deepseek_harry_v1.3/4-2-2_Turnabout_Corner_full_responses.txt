Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. First, I'll go through the testimonies and see what each one says. Then, I'll check the evidence to find inconsistencies.

The testimonies are from Wesley Stickler (Testimony 0 to 4). Testimony 4 says that the victim was shot in the forehead from the front. But looking at the evidence, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) states the cause of death was a single bullet to the right temple. That's a contradiction because the testimony claims the bullet hit the forehead, but the autopsy says it's the right temple. So the location of the gunshot wound doesn't match. Therefore, Evidence 11 (Autopsy Report) contradicts Testimony 4.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through the testimonies and cross-referencing them with the evidence.

The testimonies are all from Stickler (Testimony 0 to 4). Let's look at each one:

Testimony 0: "As soon as the killer raised his pistol, I took action." So Stickler says he acted immediately when the killer raised the gun.

Testimony 1: He tells them to cease, with composure. Then Testimony 2 says the victim turned towards his voice and a shot rang out. Testimony 3 says the defendant (Wocky) got scared and in Testimony 4, he tossed the pistol and fled.

Now, the key points here are about the pistol. Testimony 4 mentions the defendant tossing the pistol aside. But looking at the evidence, Evidence 14 is the Pistol, which states that two rounds were fired and fingerprints were wiped. Wait, if the defendant (Wocky) tossed the pistol, his prints should be on it. But the pistol's fingerprints were wiped. That's a contradiction. Because if Wocky fled after tossing it, his prints should be there unless someone wiped them. But according to the testimony, he just tossed it. So the evidence shows the pistol had no prints, but the testimony implies Wocky handled it, so there should be prints. However, in the evidence, the Knife (Evidence 10) has Wocky's prints. Wait, but the pistol's prints were wiped. So the testimony says Wocky tossed the pistol, but the evidence says the pistol's prints were wiped, meaning someone cleaned it. That's a contradiction.

Another angle: Testimony 2 says the victim turned towards Stickler's voice and then a shot was fired. The autopsy report (Evidence 11) says cause of death was a single bullet to the right temple. If the victim was turning towards the voice, maybe the bullet entry is from the direction of Stickler? But not sure if that's a direct contradiction.

Wait, also Evidence 16: Alita's Sandals have a big toe print on the left sandal. The Slippers (Evidence 3) also have a big toe print. Maybe the same person wore both, but that's not directly related to testimony.

Alternatively, the Bullet (Evidence 19) was found in the safe, squished. If two rounds were fired (Evidence 14), but the victim was killed by one bullet. So maybe one bullet hit the safe? But how does that contradict the testimony?

Wait, let's focus on the pistol's fingerprints. Testimony 4 says the defendant (Wocky) tossed the pistol. But the pistol's evidence says fingerprints were wiped. So if Wocky was the one who used it, his prints should be there unless wiped. But according to testimony, he tossed it, implying he handled it. But the evidence says the pistol had no prints. That's a contradiction. So the testimony (Testimony 4) says Wocky handled the pistol, but the evidence (Evidence 14) says no prints, implying someone wiped them. Therefore, the testimony and evidence contradict each other because the testimony suggests Wocky used the pistol, which should have his prints, but the evidence states the prints were wiped. So the pair would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 4. But wait, Evidence 14 is the Pistol. Let me check the number. Evidence 14 is the Pistol. Testimony 4 is about tossing the pistol.

So the JSON should be {"evidence": 14, "testimony": 4}.

Wait, but maybe another contradiction. Let's check other possibilities. Testimony 0 says Stickler took action when the killer raised the pistol. But if he took action, perhaps he could have intervened, but maybe the evidence about the lamp (Evidence 17) has a red stain on the cord. Not sure.

Alternatively, the knife (Evidence 10) has Wocky's prints. But the testimony is about a pistol. So maybe the murder was done with the pistol, but the knife was found at the scene. But that's not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) says cause of death is a bullet to the temple, which aligns with the pistol. So maybe the contradiction is between the testimony stating that the defendant tossed the pistol (implying his prints would be on it) and the pistol evidence stating that fingerprints were wiped. Hence, evidence 14 contradicts testimony 4.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies. Let's go through the testimonies and see which ones might clash with the evidence provided.

Looking at the testimonies, Testimony 4 by Stickler says that the sign on the stand the victim was pulling said "NOODLE". Now, checking the evidence list, Evidence 12 is the Noodle Stand, which has a caption that the sign reads "ELDOON". That's a direct contradiction. Stickler claims the sign said "NOODLE", but the actual evidence shows the sign was "ELDOON". So Testimony 4 is contradicted by Evidence 12. That seems like the clear pair here. I should make sure there's no other contradictions, but this one stands out. For example, other testimonies mention the defendant being there, but the knife with his prints might support that. So the main contradiction is the sign's wording.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 4}

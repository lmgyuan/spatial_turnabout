Okay, let's try to figure this out. The task is to find which evidence contradicts which testimony. So I need to go through the testimonies and see if any of them are contradicted by the evidence provided.

First, looking at the testimonies. Testimony 5 from Edgeworth says: "A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream." So he claims there was only one gunshot. But let's check the evidence. Evidence 18 is the DL-6 Case File, which states that the murder weapon was fired twice. Wait, but waitâ€”Testimony 5 is part of Edgeworth's account of the DL-6 incident, right? Because the DL-6 Incident is related to Gregory Edgeworth's death. So if the case file (evidence 18) says the gun was fired twice, but Edgeworth's testimony says there was a single gunshot, that's a contradiction. 

Wait, but wait, let me confirm. Testimony 5 is from Edgeworth, and he's talking about the DL-6 incident. The DL-6 Case File (evidence 18) says the murder weapon was fired twice. So Edgeworth says one gunshot, but the evidence shows two. That would be a contradiction. So evidence 18 contradicts testimony 5.

Alternatively, maybe another pair? Let me check other possibilities. Evidence 11 is Lotta's Deposition, where she says she heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. But Testimony 11 isn't listed here. Wait, the testimonies provided here are up to Testimony 6, all from Edgeworth. So maybe another angle.

Wait, in the DL-6 Incident, the case file (evidence 18) says the weapon was fired twice, but Edgeworth's testimony (Testimony 5) says there was a single gunshot. So that's a direct contradiction. Therefore, evidence 18 contradicts testimony 5.

But I need to check the evidence and testimony numbers. Evidence 18 is DL-6 Case File, and Testimony 5 is the one about a single gunshot. So the correct pair would be {"evidence": 18, "testimony": 5}.

Wait, but the user might have a different structure. Let me double-check. The user provided Evidence 0 through 21, and Testimonies 0 through 6. So the indices are correct. Evidence 18 is the DL-6 Case File, and Testimony 5 is Edgeworth's statement about a single gunshot. Therefore, the contradiction is between these two. So the answer should be evidence 18 and testimony 5.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 5}

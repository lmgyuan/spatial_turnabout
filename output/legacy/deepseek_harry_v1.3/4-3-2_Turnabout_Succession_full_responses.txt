Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair, so I have to go through each testimony and check against the evidences.

First, let's look at the testimonies. The testimonies are all from Brushel (Testimony 0 to 7). Let's go through them one by one.

Testimony 0: Brushel says he visited the studio around 9:00 PM. The autopsy report (Evidence 13) says Misham died between 9:00-9:30 PM. So if Brushel was there at 9, maybe the timing is relevant. But not sure yet.

Testimony 2: Brushel mentions that the daughter (Vera?) brought coffee right after they started. The coffee mug (Evidence 7) has poison on the rim. The autopsy says death by poison. But Brushel says he also drank the coffee and isn't dead (Testimony 5). So why is he alive if the coffee was poisoned? Maybe the poison was only on the rim, so if he sipped normally, he might not have ingested it. But Evidence 7 says the poison is on the rim, so if the victim drank from it, he might have gotten it. But the daughter brought the coffee. Wait, Vera is the defendant here. So maybe Vera poisoned the coffee. But Brushel drank it too. But he's alive. So maybe the poison was only in the victim's cup? Or the poison was applied after Brushel drank? Wait, the coffee mug in Evidence 7 is the victim's, with poison on the rim. So if Brushel had a different cup, but Testimony 5 says he drank the same coffee. Hmm. Wait, Testimony 6 says the victim had one sip and then collapsed. If the poison was atroquinine, which is slow-acting, then maybe the timing is off. Wait, but the autopsy says death was 9:00-9:30 PM, and the poison is slow-acting. So maybe the poison was administered earlier. But Brushel says they were there starting around 9 PM, and the victim drank the coffee then. That might not align with the poison's effect time. Wait, Evidence 7 says the poison is slow-acting. So if the victim drank it at 9 PM, maybe the actual death would be later. But the autopsy says time of death is 9-9:30 PM. So that contradicts, because if the poison is slow, the death should be later. Wait, but the autopsy report (Evidence 13) says the cause is atroquinine poisoning, and time of death 9-9:30. But if the poison is slow-acting, then the actual ingestion would have to be earlier. So maybe the coffee wasn't the source of the poison. But the coffee mug has traces on the rim. So perhaps the poison was applied after the coffee was served. Alternatively, the contradiction here is that Brushel says he drank the same coffee but didn't die. So maybe the poison was only in the victim's cup, but Testimony 2 says the daughter brought the coffee, implying they all had cups. But Evidence 7 is the victim's mug. Wait, perhaps the poison was on the rim of the victim's specific mug. So Brushel's testimony that he drank the same coffee but didn't die would contradict if the poison was in the coffee itself, but if it's on the rim, then only the victim's lips touched the poisoned part. So maybe Brushel didn't drink from the same mug, but from a different one. But the testimony says "the coffee" as in the same one? Hmm. Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Brushel drank coffee and survived) and Evidence 7 (coffee mug has poison on the rim). If the poison was on the rim, maybe only the victim ingested it by sipping, while Brushel didn't. But that's possible. So maybe not a contradiction here.

Looking at Testimony 7: Brushel says no one else entered the room besides her (Vera) the whole time. But Evidence 31 is the letter from Misham posted just before dying, with poison on the stamp. If Misham sent a letter, maybe someone else was involved. Or perhaps the letter was sent earlier. But how does that contradict the testimony? The testimony is about people entering the room during the time Brushel was there. If the letter was sent by Misham just before dying, maybe someone else delivered it, but Brushel claims no one else entered. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the letter was sent by Misham, but if he was poisoned, maybe the poison was on the stamp, which could imply that the sender (Kristoph Gavin?) poisoned the stamp. But how does that relate to Brushel's testimony?

Wait, another angle. Let's check Evidence 31: Letter from Misham posted just before dying. Poison traces on the stamp. If Misham sent a letter after being poisoned, but Brushel says no one else entered the room besides Vera. If the letter was posted by Misham just before he died, then he must have put it in the mailbox. But Evidence 10 (Letter Box) is empty. So if the letter was sent, maybe someone else took it, but Brushel's testimony says no one else entered. So perhaps the contradiction is that Brushel claims no one else entered, but the letter was sent, implying someone (like the killer) might have entered to take the letter, or Misham himself did it before dying. But Misham was the victim; if he was dying, he might have managed to send the letter before collapsing. But if Brushel was there until the victim died, then the victim couldn't have sent the letter after Brushel left. Hmm. The timing is tricky. Alternatively, the testimony says "no one else entered the room besides her the whole time". "Her" being Vera. So if the letter was sent, maybe Vera took it out, but Brushel didn't see her do it. Or maybe the letter was sent earlier. Not sure.

Another angle: Testimony 7 (no one else entered) vs. Evidence 31 (letter sent just before death). If the letter was sent, then Misham must have put it in the mailbox. But if Brushel was present the whole time and no one else entered, then Misham would have had to put the letter in the mailbox himself. But if he was dying from poison, could he have done that? The time of death is 9-9:30 PM. If Brushel was there at 9 PM, and Misham died during that time, maybe he managed to send the letter just before collapsing. But that's possible. So maybe no contradiction here.

Looking at Evidence 11: Tiny Frame with poison traces. If the poison was delivered via the frame, then perhaps someone handled it. But how does that contradict the testimonies?

Wait, Testimony 6 says the victim had one sip and collapsed. But if the poison is slow-acting (atroquinine is slow), then the victim shouldn't collapse immediately. That's a possible contradiction. Because if the poison is slow, the symptoms would appear later, but Testimony 6 says the victim collapsed right after sipping the coffee. That contradicts the nature of the poison. So Evidence 7 (coffee mug with atroquinine) and Testimony 6. Because the poison is slow, but the victim died immediately. So that's a contradiction. But Evidence 13's autopsy says death by atroquinine, so the cause is correct. So the contradiction is that the poison is slow-acting, but the victim died quickly after drinking. Therefore, the coffee couldn't be the source of the poison. Hence, the real poison was administered earlier, and the coffee was a red herring. Therefore, the testimony that he collapsed after drinking the coffee contradicts the evidence that the poison is slow-acting. So the pair would be Testimony 6 and Evidence 7. But wait, Evidence 7 says the poison is on the rim. If the victim sipped the coffee, the poison on the rim would enter his system, but if it's slow-acting, then why did he collapse immediately? So that's a contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 6 (victim collapsed immediately after sipping) contradicts Evidence 7 (poison is slow-acting). That's the pair. So the answer should be evidence 7 and testimony 6.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 6}
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all provided. Let me start by going through each testimony and see which evidence might contradict them.

Looking at the testimonies first. Testimony 0 to 4 are all from Brushel. He says he arrived at the studio and saw Mr. Misham writing a letter, quickly sealing a yellow envelope. Then he mentions that the yellow envelope was left at the crime scene. Later, he speculates it might have been a suicide note. 

Now, the evidences. Let me check the descriptions. Evidence 31 is the Letter from Misham, which was posted by Drew Misham just before dying, and poison traces were found on the stamp. Evidence 2 is the Gramarye Envelope, an envelope from Mr. Wright that says not to open until the time is right. Evidence 9 is the Red Envelope found in the victim's desk, opened and resealed with two sheets of paper. Evidence 31 is a letter posted by Misham, so it's a different envelope than the one Brushel saw. 

Wait, Brushel's testimony says the envelope he saw was yellow. But the Red Envelope (Evidence 9) is red. So if Brushel saw a yellow envelope, but the Red Envelope in the evidence is red, that's a contradiction. Because Brushel's Testimony 2 claims it was a yellow envelope left at the crime scene, but the Red Envelope (Evidence 9) is red. Alternatively, maybe the Letter from Misham (Evidence 31) is the one with the poison on the stamp, which was mailed, not left at the scene. 

Wait, but Testimony 2 says the yellow envelope was left at the crime scene. If the Red Envelope (Evidence 9) was found there, but it's red, that contradicts Brushel's statement about the envelope being yellow. Therefore, Evidence 9 (Red Envelope) being red conflicts with Testimony 2 (Brushel says yellow). But in the testimonies, Testimony 2 says "It was a yellow envelope... left at the crime scene." But Evidence 9 is a Red Envelope found in the victim's desk. So that's a contradiction. 

So the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (yellow envelope) and Evidence 9 (Red Envelope). But wait, let me check the evidence list again. Evidence 9: Red Envelope. Found in the victim's desk drawer, opened and resealed. Brushel's testimony says he saw Misham seal a yellow envelope, which was left at the crime scene. If the envelope found in the desk is red, then that contradicts Brushel's testimony about the color. Therefore, the evidence is 9 and testimony is 2. Alternatively, maybe another evidence? Let me check other evidences. Evidence 31 is the Letter from Misham, which was posted, so that's a different envelope. Evidence 2 is the Gramarye Envelope from Mr. Wright. Not sure. Wait, the Gramarye Envelope (Evidence 2) is from Mr. Wright, not Misham. So the one Brushel saw Misham writing would be a different envelope. The Red Envelope (Evidence 9) is in the desk, but if Brushel saw a yellow envelope, then that's a contradiction. So the correct pair would be Evidence 9 (Red Envelope) vs Testimony 2 (yellow envelope). Therefore, {"evidence": 9, "testimony": 2}. But wait, let me check again. The testimony says "It was a yellow envelope. ... I heard it was left at the crime scene." But the Red Envelope (9) is red, found in the desk. So the color discrepancy is the contradiction. That's the answer.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 2}

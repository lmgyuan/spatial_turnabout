Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So first, I need to look through the testimonies and the evidences to see where there's a conflict.

Looking at the testimonies given by Gumshoe (Testimony 0 to 4). Testimony 3 says that Mask☆DeMasque always goes after the most precious art pieces. Then, Evidence 4 is the Sacred Urn, which is described as one of the treasures of Kurain Village but has no monetary value and looks like a plain pot. If Mask☆DeMasque only steals the most precious pieces, then stealing the Sacred Urn doesn't fit because it's not valuable. That's a contradiction. So the testimony 3 (which states the thief's M.O. is targeting precious art) is contradicted by evidence 4 showing the urn isn't valuable. But wait, the evidence in question here would be the one that shows the urn is not valuable. Let me check the evidence numbers again.

Evidence 4 is the Sacred Urn, which mentions it's "supposedly priceless, but has no monetary value." Testimony 3 claims Mask☆DeMasque only steals the most precious (which would imply high monetary value). Therefore, the existence of the urn being stolen despite its lack of value contradicts the testimony. So the pair should be Evidence 4 and Testimony 3. But wait, the evidence number for Sacred Urn is 4, and testimony 3 is Gumshoe's third testimony. So the JSON should be {"evidence":4, "testimony":3}.

Wait, but there's also Evidence 2: Treasure Exhibit Poster, which lists the Sacred Urn as being displayed. But maybe that's not directly contradicting. The main contradiction is the urn's lack of value against the testimony. So yes, evidence 4 vs testimony 3.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to go through each testimony and check if any of the evidences provided directly contradict what's being said.

Looking at the testimonies first. Testimony 0 from Atmey says the incident happened around 1 AM. Testimony 1 mentions Mask☆DeMasque attacking him. Testimony 2 says he was struck on the head when he turned. Testimony 3 says he was knocked out, and when he woke up, the thief was gone. Testimony 4 states he called the police 30 minutes later.

Now, looking at the evidence. Let's see if any of these conflict. The Camera Data (Evidence 7) says the warehouse camera went off at around 1 AM. The Key Card (Evidence 12) was used at 1 AM on the night of the crime. The Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) went off at 1:02 AM. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 15) says Kane died at 1 AM from a head injury.

Wait, Testimony 0 says the incident was at 1 AM. But Testimony 4 says Atmey called the police 30 minutes later. If the crime happened at 1 AM and he was knocked out, when did he call? Let's see. If he was unconscious for some time, then called 30 minutes after the incident, that would be around 1:30 AM. But maybe there's a contradiction with the Buzzer Record at 1:02 AM. However, the Buzzer is connected to the CEO's office. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. The Sacred Urn (Evidence 4) was found in Atmey's office with pink splotches. The Urn Box (Evidence 21) has pink paint stains, and the Paint Marks (Evidence 22) mention that the box was stained when Adrian dropped it two weeks prior. If the urn was in Atmey's office, maybe he had it after the crime. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Looking at Testimony 3: Atmey says when he awoke, the thief was gone. But if the camera data (Evidence 7) shows the warehouse camera went off at 1 AM, which could be when the thief was moving the statue. Wait, the Ami Fey's Golden Statue (Evidence 3) was moved that night. The camera data might show the movement. But Atmey was knocked out at 1 AM, according to his testimony. If the camera went off at 1 AM, maybe that's when the thief was there. But Atmey's Testimony 0 says the incident was at 1 AM, so that's consistent.

Wait, the Key Card (Evidence 12) was used at 1 AM. So Ron used the key card to enter the CEO's office at 1 AM. The Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) went off at 1:02 AM. But Kane's Autopsy says he died at 1 AM from a head injury. So if Ron was in the office at 1 AM, maybe he's the killer. But how does that relate to Atmey's testimony?

Alternatively, the contradiction might be between Atmey's Testimony 0 (incident at 1 AM) and the Buzzer Record (1:02 AM). If Atmey was knocked out at 1 AM, how could the buzzer in the CEO's office go off at 1:02 AM? Unless he's lying about the time. But maybe the real contradiction is between the time of the incident and the time of death. Wait, Kane died at 1 AM. If Atmey was attacked at 1 AM, but the killer was in the CEO's office at 1 AM, how can both happen? Unless Atmey's testimony about the time is wrong.

Alternatively, looking at the Shichishito (Evidence 6). It wasn't bent before the crime. DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the head. The Shichishito is a sword; maybe it's the murder weapon. But Kane died from a head injury. If the Shichishito was used, but the sword wasn't bent before, maybe after the crime it's bent. But I don't see that in the evidence. Hmm.

Wait, Testimony 2 says Atmey was hit on the back of the head when he turned. The murder weapon for Kane was a blow to the head causing cerebral hemorrhage. If the same weapon was used, but Atmey's testimony about being attacked by DeMasque might conflict if the real killer was someone else. But how does that tie into evidence?

Wait, looking at Evidence 15: Kane's time of death is 1 AM. Evidence 12: Ron's Key Card was used at 1 AM. So if Ron was at the CEO's office at 1 AM, he could be the killer. But Atmey claims he was attacked by DeMasque at 1 AM. So there's a contradiction here. If Atmey was being attacked at 1 AM, how could Ron be using the key card at the same time in the CEO's office? Unless Atmey is lying about the time. But according to his testimony, he was attacked at 1 AM, called the police 30 minutes later. But the Key Card being used at 1 AM by Ron suggests that Ron was there, which conflicts with Atmey's claim that DeMasque (Ron) was attacking him at the same time. Therefore, the testimony that the attack happened at 1 AM (Testimony 0) contradicts the Key Card evidence (12) showing Ron was in the CEO's office at 1 AM. So the time of the attack can't be the same as when Ron was using the key card. Therefore, Atmey's Testimony 0 is contradicted by Evidence 12.

Wait, but the Key Card's use was at 1 AM, and the Buzzer went off at 1:02. The CEO's office is where Kane's body was found. So if Ron used the Key Card at 1 AM to enter, that's when he killed Kane. But Atmey claims he was attacked by DeMasque (Ron) at 1 AM. So Ron can't be in two places at once. Thus, the contradiction is between Testimony 0 (Atmey says incident at 1 AM) and Evidence 12 (Ron was using the key card at 1 AM). Therefore, Atmey's testimony about the time is impossible if Ron was elsewhere. So the pair would be Evidence 12 and Testimony 0.

Alternatively, let me check Evidence 19: Buzzer Record went off at 1:02 AM. If Atmey was attacked at 1 AM and called the police at 1:30, then the Buzzer at 1:02 would be after the attack. But how does that relate?

Wait, maybe the Camera Data (Evidence 7) says the warehouse camera went off at around 1 AM. The Ami Fey statue was moved that night (Evidence 3), so maybe the camera captured that. If the camera was triggered at 1 AM, that's when the statue was moved. But according to Atmey's Testimony 0, the attack happened at 1 AM. So if the camera was triggered at the same time, then the thief (DeMasque) was moving the statue then. But Atmey was being attacked at the same time. How could DeMasque be in two places? Unless Atmey is lying. So the contradiction here is that the camera data shows movement at 1 AM (Evidence 7) and Atmey's Testimony 0 says he was attacked at 1 AM. But if the thief was moving the statue at 1 AM, how could he be attacking Atmey at the same time? Unless there's two people involved. Alternatively, the contradiction is between the camera data and the testimony about the time. So Evidence 7 (Camera Data at 1 AM) and Testimony 0 (Atmey's incident at 1 AM). Wait, but maybe the thief could have triggered the camera and then attacked Atmey. But the timing might be tight. Alternatively, perhaps the key evidence is the Key Card (12) showing Ron was in the CEO's office at 1 AM, which contradicts Atmey's testimony that he was attacked by DeMasque (Ron) at the same time. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 12 and Testimony 0.

Yes, that makes sense. Because if Ron was using the key card at 1 AM to enter the CEO's office (where Kane was killed), he couldn't be attacking Atmey at the same time. Thus, Atmey's testimony that the attack happened at 1 AM is contradicted by Evidence 12 showing Ron was elsewhere.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 0}
Alright, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through the testimonies and evidences one by one.

First, looking at the testimonies from Atmey (Testimonies 0 to 5). Testimony 2 says, "the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless." The weapon here is probably the Shichishito, which is Evidence 6. The Shichishito is a ceremonial sword from the statue. But according to Evidence 6, it's noted that "DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime w/ a blow to the back of the head." Wait, the Shichishito is a sword, but the cause of Atmey's knockout was a blow to the back of the head. However, Testimony 2 says the thief used a weapon from the side. But the autopsy report (Evidence 15) says Kane Bullard died from a blow to the head too. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up here. Let me check again.

Atmey's Testimony 2 says the thief used a weapon from the side to knock him out. But Evidence 6 states that DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head. If the blow was to the back, that contradicts Testimony 2 where Atmey claims the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and hit him. Wait, but Testimony 5 says Atmey put his back to the wall and the thief's blow landed on his third eye (forehead?), so maybe the location of the injury is conflicting with the weapon's use. Alternatively, the Shichishito is a sword, but the injury was a blunt trauma. Hmm, the Shichishito is a ceremonial sword; maybe it's not sharp. But Evidence 6 also mentions that the Shichishito wasn't bent before the crime. If the thief used it to hit Atmey, maybe that's possible. But if Atmey was hit on the back of the head (per Evidence 6's description), but in his testimony, he says the thief grabbed a weapon from the side, perhaps implying the direction of the attack. Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between the weapon used and the injury. Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 15) is about Kane Bullard's death, not Atmey's injury. So Evidence 6's description about DeMasque knocking Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head would be the relevant part. 

So, Atmey's Testimony 2 says the thief grabbed a weapon from the side, which would be the Shichishito (Evidence 6). However, Evidence 6 states that the blow was to the back of the head, which contradicts Testimony 2's claim of a weapon grabbed from the side. Alternatively, Testimony 5 says he put his back to the wall and the blow landed on his third eye (forehead), which would be a frontal hit, not from behind. So, if Evidence 6 says the blow was to the back of the head, but Atmey's testimony says he was hit on the forehead (third eye) when his back was to the wall, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the testimony that he was hit on the third eye (Testimony 5) would contradict Evidence 6's statement that the blow was to the back of the head. 

Wait, Evidence 6's description says "DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime w/ a blow to the back of the head." So the evidence states the blow was to the back, but Testimony 5 says Atmey was hit on the third eye (forehead) when his back was to the wall. That's a direct contradiction between the location of the injury. Therefore, Evidence 6 and Testimony 5 contradict each other. That must be the pair.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair. Let me start by going through the testimonies and see which ones might have contradictions with the evidence provided.

Looking at the testimonies by Ron (Testimony 0 to 5). Testimony 4 says "Look! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!" referring to the Security Camera Photo (Evidence 9). The photo shows the storeroom entrance, maybe capturing someone. But if Ron claims he's in the photo, but maybe the evidence shows something conflicting.

Wait, Evidence 9 is the Security Camera Photo. Let me check what Evidence 9's details are. The description says "Photo of storeroom entrance taken by the camera. Click here for details." Also, Evidence 13 is a Publicity Photo of Mask☆DeMasque. Maybe the photo in Evidence 9 doesn't actually show Ron, but someone else? Or perhaps the time doesn't align. Wait, other evidence might be related.

Looking at Evidence 7: Camera Data. The warehouse camera went off around 1 AM. Evidence 12: Key Card used on October 12th at 1 AM. So the Key Card was used at the same time the camera went off. If Ron was using the Key Card at 1 AM, then maybe the camera photo (taken at 1 AM) would show him. But maybe there's a contradiction here.

Wait, Testimony 4 is Ron pointing to the Security Camera Photo (Evidence 9) as proof that it's him. But perhaps the photo actually shows someone else, or there's another piece of evidence that contradicts this. Let me check the other evidence.

Evidence 12: Key Card used at 1 AM, which is the same time as the camera data (Evidence 7). The Key Card was found in Ron's wallet. But if Ron used the Key Card at 1 AM to enter the CEO's office (since Evidence 12 says it opens the KB Security CEO's office), then he would be there at that time. The Security Camera Photo (Evidence 9) is of the storeroom entrance. So maybe he couldn't be in two places at once? Wait, if the Key Card was used at 1 AM in the CEO's office, and the Security Camera Photo (Evidence 9) is at the storeroom entrance at 1 AM, maybe he can't be both places. But that depends on the layout. Alternatively, maybe the photo doesn't show him but someone else, like Mask☆DeMasque (who could be someone else).

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 5: Ron says his broach got torn off on the door handle. Evidence 14 is DeMasque's Broach found near the statue. If the broach was found there, but Ron claims he snagged it on the door handle, that might be a contradiction. But I need to check the locations. The broach was found in the shadow of Ami Fey's statue (Evidence 14), which was in the basement warehouse (Evidence 3). The door handle he's referring to might be somewhere else. So if the broach was found at the statue's location, but he says it was snagged on a door handle elsewhere, that's a contradiction.

Wait, but Testimony 5's person is Ron. He says he snagged the broach on the door handle, but the broach was found near the statue. So that's a contradiction. The door handle and the statue's location might be different. So Evidence 14 (broach found at statue) vs Testimony 5 (Ron says it was torn off on a door handle). That seems like a contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 3: Ron says he donned his costume and was at the scene of the crime. But Evidence 12 (Key Card used at 1 AM in CEO's office) and Evidence 15 (Kane's death at 1 AM). If the CEO was killed at 1 AM in his office, and Ron used the Key Card there at 1 AM, then maybe Ron was in the CEO's office at the time of the murder. But the crime scene (CEO's office) is where Kane's body was found. If Ron was there, he might be the killer. But his testimony about being at the storeroom (as per the photo) might conflict with being in the CEO's office. But how does that tie into the testimonies?

Wait, the Key Card (Evidence 12) leaves a record when used. So using it at 1 AM in the CEO's office would mean Ron was there. But the camera data (Evidence 7) shows the warehouse camera went off at 1 AM, which might be where the storeroom is. If the CEO's office and the warehouse are different locations, then Ron couldn't be in both places at the same time. So if he claims to be at the storeroom (as per Testimony 4 pointing to the photo), but the Key Card usage shows he was in the CEO's office at the same time, that's a contradiction.

Testimony 4: Ron says the photo (Evidence 9) shows him. But if the photo is of the storeroom entrance taken at 1 AM (per Evidence 7), and Evidence 12's Key Card shows he was in the CEO's office at 1 AM, then he can't be in two places at once. Therefore, the Key Card evidence (12) contradicts Testimony 4.

So the contradiction would be between Evidence 12 (Key Card used at 1 AM in CEO's office) and Testimony 4 (Ron says he's in the Security Camera Photo at 1 AM in the storeroom entrance). If both events happened at the same time, he can't be in both places. Therefore, Evidence 12 and Testimony 4 contradict each other.

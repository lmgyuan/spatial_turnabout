Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair. Let me start by going through the testimonies and the evidences.

First, looking at the testimonies from Dhurke. He says in Testimony 3 that when he came to, Inga was dead in front of him. But he also mentions he doesn't remember what happened (Testimony 4) and that he didn't kill Inga (Testimony 6). Now, the evidence. Let's check the autopsy reports. Evidence 15 is Inga's Autopsy Report: he was stabbed from behind, time of death around 3 PM. 

Wait, Dhurke's testimony says he found Inga dead when he regained consciousness. But if the time of death is around 3 PM, what's the timeline here? Also, there's Evidence 19, the Pink Butterfly Pendant, which is stained with the victim's blood and actually belongs to Amara. But Dhurke's testimony might not mention that. Hmm. 

Wait, looking at Testimony 2: Dhurke claims there's no third party in the tomb. But Evidence 25 is Ahlbi's Statement saying that around 2 PM, Shah'do (the dog?) spooked Nayna and stole her hat. Wait, does that relate to the tomb? Maybe not directly. Let me think again.

Wait, the murder happened in the tomb. Inga's death at 3 PM. Dhurke was there, but he claims he didn't do it. The contradiction could be in the blood evidence. Evidence 20 is a Mysterious Bloodstain from the tomb, which is Dhurke's blood, and it's wiped up. But Dhurke's testimony says he was there, maybe implying he was present but doesn't remember attacking. Alternatively, the fact that he was shot (Evidence 29: Dhurke's Corpse Photo shows he was shot three times in the chest, but that's his own death, maybe not related to Inga's murder. Wait, Inga was stabbed, Dhurke was shot. Different causes of death. 

Wait, the key here might be the time of death. Dhurke's testimony suggests he was present when Inga died (at 3 PM), but maybe there's evidence that contradicts his presence or the possibility. Wait, Testimony 2 says "The possibility of a third party being there in the tomb is probably nonexistent." But if the evidence shows that someone else was there, that could contradict. For example, Evidence 25 (Ahlbi's Statement) mentions events around 2 PM, but the murder is at 3 PM. Maybe that's not directly linked. 

Alternatively, Evidence 24 is the Channeling Photo taken at around 2 PM. If the channeling was happening at 2 PM and Inga died at 3 PM, maybe that's alibis. But Dhurke was in the tomb when he blacked out. Wait, perhaps the Mysterious Bloodstain (Evidence 20) is Dhurke's blood, which he might not account for. But his testimony says he doesn't remember. 

Wait, the contradiction might be between Testimony 2 (no third party) and Evidence 19 (the pendant, which belongs to Amara, found at the scene). If the pendant is Amara's, but she's supposed to be dead, maybe someone else (like Ga'ran) channeled her? But that's more complex. Alternatively, if the pendant is there, it indicates someone else was present, contradicting Dhurke's claim that there's no third party. 

So, Evidence 19 is the Pink Butterfly Pendant, which is Amara's. If Amara's pendant is at the scene, and Dhurke says no third party was there, that's a contradiction. Because the pendant's presence suggests someone else (Amara or someone with her pendant) was present. Therefore, the testimony that there's no third party (Testimony 2) is contradicted by Evidence 19. 

But wait, the pendant is stained with the victim's blood. If Dhurke had it, maybe he was the one who had it. But the pendant actually belongs to Amara. If Amara was there, then there's a third party. Therefore, Testimony 2 (Dhurke says no third party) contradicts Evidence 19 (Amara's pendant found at the scene, implying her presence or someone else's).

{"evidence": 19, "testimony": 2}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all listed here. Let me start by going through the testimonies first.

Testimony 0: Rayfa says she was gazing at the courtyard from her second-floor veranda on the day of the murder. Testimony 1: Around 2:30 PM, she saw her father (Inga) heading to Amara's Tomb. Testimony 2: Her father screamed and ran out of his room, pale. Testimony 3: Rafya (probably a typo for Rayfa) says she had been gazing since about 2 PM and only saw her father. Testimony 4: At about 2:45, she saw Barbed Head and others enter the courtyard. Testimony 5: She saw no one enter or exit the tomb after her father entered at 2:30.

Now looking at the evidences. Let's see which ones relate to the timing or presence of people. Evidence 25 is Ahlbi's statement, which mentions that around 2 PM, Shah'do (the dog?) was startled by a firecracker, ran into the courtyard, spooked Nayna and stole her hat. This suggests some activity in the courtyard around 2 PM. But Testimony 3 (from Rayfa) says she was watching since 2 PM and only saw her father. However, Evidence 25 indicates that there was activity involving Shah'do and Nayna in the courtyard at around 2 PM. That would contradict Rayfa's testimony that she didn't see anyone else except her father during that time. So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (which says she only saw her father) and Evidence 25 (which shows there were others in the courtyard at 2 PM). But wait, Rayfa's testimony 3 is Testimony 3, which says she had been gazing since about 2, but only saw her father. But according to Ahlbi's statement (Evidence 25), Shah'do ran into the courtyard around 2 PM, which should have been visible to Rayfa. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 25. But wait, let me check the numbering again. Testimony 3 is listed under person "Rafya" which is likely a typo for Rayfa. So Testimony 3 is Rayfa's. The evidence is Ahlbi's Statement (25). So if Rayfa says she didn't see anyone else except her father from 2 PM onwards, but Ahlbi's statement says that Shah'do and Nayna were in the courtyard around 2 PM, then that's a contradiction. Therefore, the evidence 25 (Ahlbi's Statement) contradicts testimony 3 (Rayfa's claim that she saw only her father). But wait, the time in Testimony 3: Rayfa says she was watching since about 2 PM, and only saw her father. But Ahlbi's statement says that at around 2 PM, Shah'do ran into the courtyard, spooking Nayna. So Rayfa should have seen Shah'do and Nayna, but she didn't mention them. That's a contradiction. So the evidence is 25 and testimony is 3. But looking at the evidence numbers: Evidence 25 is Ahlbi's Statement. Testimony 3 is the one where she says she only saw her father. So the answer should be {"evidence": 25, "testimony": 3}. Wait, but let me double-check other possibilities. Are there other contradictions? Let's check other testimonies. Testimony 4: Rayfa saw Barbed Head (Datz?) and others enter the courtyard at 2:45. But Inga's Autopsy Report (Evidence 15) says time of death is around 3 PM. If Inga was killed at 3 PM, but Rayfa saw him enter the tomb at 2:30 and no one else entered or left after (Testimony 5), then maybe someone else was already inside. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, Evidence 25 (Ahlbi's statement) about Shah'do and Nayna at 2 PM contradicts Testimony 3 where Rayfa claims she saw only her father from 2 PM. So that's the contradiction.

{"evidence": 25, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's try to figure this out. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's look through the testimonies and the evidence provided.

First, the testimonies. Testimony 3 from Nayna says, "After Queen Amara's passing, Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran is the only spirit medium left." So according to this, Ga'ran is the only one who can channel spirits now because Amara is dead. But wait, looking at the evidence, there's Evidence 19: Pink Butterfly Pendant. The description mentions it's a locket found at the crime scene that actually belongs to Amara. Also, Evidence 26 is Amara's Assassination File, which talks about her assassination. However, if Amara was assassinated, then according to Nayna's testimony, Ga'ran is the only medium. But wait, Evidence 23 is a photo showing Dhurke and Amara about 23 years ago, with Amara holding a baby. The caption says the Defiant Dragons were formed after Amara's assassination. But if the photo is from 23 years ago and shows Amara alive, that implies that Amara was alive after the Defiant Dragons were formed, which contradicts the testimony that Amara's assassination led to the formation of the Defiant Dragons. Wait, but the caption on Evidence 23 says: "The Defiant Dragons was formed after Amara's assassination." But the photo shows Amara alive with Dhurke, which would be after the assassination? That can't be. Unless the assassination was faked. Hmm, maybe the contradiction is that the testimony says Amara is dead, but the photo shows her alive, implying she wasn't assassinated. But wait, according to the testimony, after Amara's passing, Ga'ran is the only medium. But if the Defiant Dragons were formed after her assassination, but in the photo, Amara is alive and the Defiant Dragons' logo is on a book. So the photo suggests that the Defiant Dragons existed while Amara was alive, which contradicts the caption in Evidence 23. Wait, the caption in Evidence 23 says the Defiant Dragons was formed after Amara's assassination. But the photo shows a book with the Defiant Dragons logo from 23 years ago, which would be when Amara was still alive (since she's in the photo). Therefore, the existence of the Defiant Dragons' logo in the photo contradicts the caption's statement that they formed after her assassination. But how does this relate to the testimonies? The testimony in question is Testimony 3, which states that Ga'ran is the only medium left after Amara's passing. However, if Amara was actually alive (as the photo suggests, since she's holding a baby 23 years ago, and the assassination was supposed to have happened before that), then there's a contradiction. Wait, maybe the key here is that Amara wasn't actually assassinated. The photo might show that she survived, which would mean that Ga'ran isn't the only medium. But according to the testimony, Ga'ran is the only one. So Evidence 23 (the photo) shows Amara alive after her supposed assassination, which contradicts Testimony 3's assertion that she's dead and Ga'ran is the only medium. That would be the contradiction. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 23 and Testimony 3. Let me check the numbers. Evidence 23 is "Woman's Photo" with the caption about the Defiant Dragons forming after Amara's assassination. But the photo shows Amara alive with a baby and the Defiant Dragons logo present. So the photo's content contradicts the formation timeline, implying the Defiant Dragons existed before her assassination, which would mean Amara's assassination happened later. But the testimony says after Amara's passing, Ga'ran is the only medium. If the photo shows Amara alive after the Defiant Dragons were formed (which according to the caption were formed after her assassination), that would mean the assassination happened before the photo was taken. But the photo is from 23 years ago, which would mean Amara was alive 23 years ago, but the Defiant Dragons were formed after her assassination. So the timeline is conflicting. Therefore, the testimony that Ga'ran is the only medium after Amara's death is contradicted by the photo if Amara was still alive after the assassination. Wait, maybe the key is that the caption in Evidence 23 says the Defiant Dragons were formed after Amara's assassination, but the photo shows Amara alive with a book that has the Defiant Dragons logo. Therefore, the Defiant Dragons must have existed before her assassination, which contradicts the caption. But how does this tie into the testimony? The testimony (Testimony 3) says after Amara's passing, only Ga'ran is left. If Amara was actually alive (as per the photo taken 23 years ago, which would be after her supposed assassination), then she wasn't dead, so the testimony is false. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 23 (showing Amara alive when she was supposed to be dead, leading to the Defiant Dragons' formation) and Testimony 3 (which claims she's dead and Ga'ran is the only medium). So the answer would be Evidence 23 and Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 23, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by looking through the testimonies and the evidences.

The testimonies are all from Amara. Let's go through each one:

Testimony 0: "Now I shall destroy your utterly absurd and barbarous theory." Not sure yet, maybe a general statement.

Testimony 1: "I was not anywhere near the tomb following the murder." So she claims she wasn't at the tomb after the murder.

Testimony 2: "Were your theory correct, I would have been in the tomb once I had stopped channeling." Hmm, this might relate to her being present during channeling.

Testimony 3: "Minister Inga was the sole victim. There was no other spirit to channel until he was dead." So she's saying that Inga was the only one dead, so no other spirits were available to channel before his death.

Testimony 4: "My husband Dhurke is the killer, but he has fled from this sacred hall." Accusing Dhurke.

Testimony 5: A curse on Dhurke.

Now, looking at the evidences. Let's see which ones could contradict these testimonies. 

Looking at Testimony 3: She says Inga was the sole victim, no other spirit until he died. But in the evidence list, there's Evidence 20: Mysterious Bloodstain from Amara's Tomb, which is Dhurke's blood. Also, Evidence 19: Pink Butterfly Pendant, which is a locket found at the scene, belongs to Amara but is stained with victim's blood. Wait, but the main point is Testimony 3 claims Inga was the only victim. However, if Dhurke's blood is found at the scene (Evidence 20), that suggests Dhurke was injured or killed there. But Evidence 29 is Dhurke's Corpse Photo, which states he was shot three times and died more than three days prior. Wait, but Inga's death is in the Autopsy Report (Evidence 15) with time of death around 3 PM. If Dhurke was already dead (Corpse Photo), then how could Amara claim Dhurke is the killer (Testimony 4)? Because if Dhurke died more than three days ago, he couldn't have killed Inga who died on the day of the trial. So this would contradict Testimony 4. But looking for contradictions with Testimony 3. Wait, Testimony 3 says Inga was the sole victim. But if Dhurke's blood is at the scene (Evidence 20), that might indicate he was there and possibly dead. But Evidence 29 shows Dhurke's corpse photo, which died more than three days prior. So if Dhurke was already dead before Inga's murder, then Amara's Testimony 4 that Dhurke is the killer is impossible. Therefore, the contradiction would be between Testimony 4 and Evidence 29. But the user asked for one pair. Wait, the user wants a pair where the evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's check Testimony 4 again: Amara says Dhurke is the killer. But Evidence 29 says Dhurke's corpse was dead for more than three days, while Inga's death was at 3 PM on the current day. Therefore, Dhurke couldn't have killed Inga if he was already dead. So the contradiction is Testimony 4 and Evidence 29. But in the list of testimonies, Testimony 4 is the one where Amara says Dhurke is the killer. So the evidence that contradicts this is Evidence 29 (Dhurke's Corpse Photo showing he died days before). Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 29 and Testimony 4. 

Wait, but let me check the times again. Inga's time of death is approximately 3 PM (Evidence 15). Dhurke's time of death is more than three days prior (Evidence 29). So if Dhurke was dead before Inga's death, he couldn't have killed him. Thus, Amara's Testimony 4 that Dhurke is the killer is contradicted by Evidence 29. So the answer should be {"evidence": 29, "testimony": 4}.

{"evidence": 29, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. The testimonies are all from Amara, right? And there are a bunch of evidences listed.

Looking at Amara's testimonies. Testimony 3 says there's nothing to prove she was at the crime scene. But maybe one of the evidences places her there. Let me check the evidences.

Evidence 19 is the Pink Butterfly Pendant. It says it's a pendant found at the crime scene, and it actually belongs to Amara. So if the pendant was found there, that suggests Amara was present. But her testimony claims she wasn't there. That would contradict each other.

Another possibility: Testimony 4 says Dhurke could have been channeled by Maya Fey. But if there's evidence that Dhurke was already dead, like Evidence 29, his corpse photo showing he died more than three days prior. If the murder happened at a time when Dhurke was already dead, then channeling him wouldn't be possible. But wait, the murder of Inga was at 3 PM (Evidence 15). If Dhurke was dead for three days, then he couldn't have been channeled during the murder. So Testimony 4 would be contradicted by Evidence 29. But the user asked for only one pair. 

Alternatively, Evidence 23 is the Woman's Photo. It shows Amara holding a baby, and a book with the Defiant Dragons logo. Not sure if that links her to the crime scene.

Wait, Testimony 3 is about her presence at the scene. Evidence 19 is her pendant found there. So the pendant being hers (even if it's a locket) would mean she was there. So that's a direct contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 19 and Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 19, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a bunch of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Let's start by looking at the testimonies given by Nahyuta.

Testimony 5 says: "I was reunited with my mother, Queen Amara, fifteen years ago when Dhurke abducted her." So Nahyuta is claiming that Dhurke abducted Amara 15 years ago, leading to their reunion. Now, looking at the evidence, Evidence 23 is a Woman's Photo. The description mentions a photo showing Dhurke and Amara's life on the run about 23 years ago. The caption says Amara is holding a baby, sitting on a chair, with a book that has the Defiant Dragons logo. 

Wait, if the photo is from 23 years ago and shows Amara with Dhurke, that contradicts Nahyuta's testimony that they were reunited 15 years ago. Because if Amara was with Dhurke 23 years ago, that's 8 years earlier than Nahyuta's claim. Also, the photo shows Amara holding a baby. If that's the case, maybe that baby is Nahyuta? But according to the testimony, they were reunited 15 years ago, but the photo shows them together 23 years ago. That's a direct contradiction. So the testimony says Dhurke abducted Amara 15 years ago, but the photo shows they were together 23 years prior. Hence, Evidence 23 and Testimony 5 contradict each other.

{"evidence": 23, "testimony": 5}

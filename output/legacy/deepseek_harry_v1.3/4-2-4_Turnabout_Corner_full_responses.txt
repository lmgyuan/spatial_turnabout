Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony from Alita contradict each other. Alright, let's go through each of her testimonies and cross-check with the evidence list.

First, looking at Alita's testimonies. Testimony 0 says she went to the clinic that day for the first time in half a year since she quit in January. But then there's Evidence 18, Wocky's Chart, which was found in the clinic's safe and signed by nurse Alita Tiala. If she quit in January, how did she sign a chart that's from June (as per Evidence 13, Wocky's Check-Up Report from June)? That's a contradiction because she shouldn't have been working there to sign it in June if she quit in January. 

Wait, Testimony 4 says, "Why would I go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart?" But the chart in Evidence 18 is from June, which would be recent if the current time is June. But if she quit in January, then the chart from June must have been signed by her after she left, which is impossible. So that's a contradiction between Testimony 0 (quit in January) and Evidence 18 (signed the chart in June). Therefore, Testimony 0 is contradicted by Evidence 18. 

Alternatively, Testimony 4 mentions a half-year-old chart, which would be from January if current time is June. But Evidence 18 is Wocky's Chart signed by Alita, which is from June (since the check-up report is from June). So if she quit in January, she couldn't have signed the June chart. So Testimony 0, where she says she quit in January, contradicts Evidence 18 (her signature on a June chart). Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 18. 

Wait, but looking at the testimonies again: Testimony 4 says "half-year-old chart" â€” maybe the chart is from six months ago. But Evidence 13 is Wocky's Check-Up Report from June, and Evidence 18 is the chart signed by Alita. If the current time is June, then a chart from June isn't half a year old. So perhaps Testimony 4 is about a different chart. But if Alita claims she hasn't been there since January, but signed a chart from June, that's a problem. So the contradiction is between her Testimony 0 (quit in January) and Evidence 18 (her signature on a June chart). 

So the correct pair would be Evidence 18 and Testimony 0. But wait, the question asks for one pair. Let me check the evidence numbers again. Evidence 18 is "Wocky's Chart: Found in the Meraktis Clinic safe. Signed by nurse Alita Tiala." So that's evidence 18. And Testimony 0 is her statement that she quit in January and hadn't been there for half a year. Therefore, the evidence that she signed a chart (in June, presumably) contradicts her testimony that she quit in January. So the answer would be evidence 18 and testimony 0.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 0}

Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by reviewing the given information.

First, the characters. The Security Lady (Character 4) is the one who provided testimonies 0 to 7. Her testimonies include claiming that she saw Powers (the defendant) heading towards the studio at 2:00 PM. Specifically, Testimony 7 says she saw Powers at 2:00 PM heading toward the studio. 

Now looking at the evidences. Evidence 5 is the "Powers'(?) Photo" taken at 2:00 PM at the gate. The photo shows the Steel Samurai dragging one leg. The note from Will (probably Will Powers) mentions that when he got the part, he had the mask, implying maybe he was in costume. But the key detail here is the time: the photo is timestamped 2:00 PM, showing the Steel Samurai (possibly Powers) walking towards the studio. However, the Security Lady's testimony (Testimony 7) claims she saw Powers himself at 2:00 PM. 

But if the photo shows the Steel Samurai (in costume) at 2:00 PM, and Powers was in the costume, then the Security Lady couldn't have seen Powers' faceâ€”since he was wearing the mask. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. The Security Lady says she saw Powers, but the photo shows that the person in the Steel Samurai costume (which hides the identity) was there at 2:00 PM. So her identification of Powers might be incorrect because the costume obscures the face. 

Alternatively, if the photo is from 2:00 PM and the Security Lady claims she saw Powers at that exact time heading to the studio, but the photo shows the Steel Samurai, which Powers plays, but maybe the timing or the location contradicts. Wait, the photo is taken at the gate between the entrance and the studios. So if the Steel Samurai is seen there at 2:00 PM, and the Security Lady says she saw Powers at 2:00 PM heading towards the studio, but the photo shows someone in costume, perhaps that's the same event. However, the problem is that the Security Lady claims it was Powers, but the photo only shows the Steel Samurai. Unless Powers was the one in the costume, but maybe there's a contradiction in her testimony about recognizing him. 

Wait, in the photo's caption, it says the Steel Samurai is seen walking, dragging one leg. Will's note says when he got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... which might imply that the costume includes a mask, so the Security Lady couldn't have seen Powers' face. Therefore, her testimony that she saw Powers (Testimony 7) at 2:00 PM contradicts the photo evidence (Evidence 5) because the photo shows the Steel Samurai in costume, making it impossible to visually confirm it was Powers. So her testimony is based on seeing Powers, but the photo shows that the person was in a costume, so she couldn't have identified him by face. Therefore, Evidence 5 contradicts Testimony 7.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 7}
Okay, let's see here. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all provided. Let me start by going through each testimony and cross-referencing with the evidence.

The testimonies in question are from Oldbag (Testimonies 0 to 3). Testimony 0 states the time of death as 2:30 PM, which matches the autopsy report (Evidence 3). So that's consistent. Then Testimonies 1, 2, and 3 are about Oldbag claiming she saw only Will Powers going to the studio before 2:30 PM and that no one else went there, otherwise she would have seen them.

Looking at the evidence, Evidence 5 is the photo taken at 2:00 PM showing the Steel Samurai (who is presumably Powers, but the photo is labeled as Powers'(?) Photo, indicating some doubt). The photo shows the Steel Samurai dragging one leg. But wait, there's also Evidence 11: Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. If the path was blocked after 2:15 PM, how did someone get to the scene after that time without Oldbag seeing them?

Wait, the Security Lady (Oldbag) claims she saw Powers going to the studio before 2:30 PM and that no one else could have gone without her seeing. However, the photo (Evidence 5) was taken at 2:00 PM, showing the Steel Samurai. But if the murder happened at 2:30 PM, and the path was blocked from 2:15 PM onward by Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11), then the killer might have been already inside before the path was blocked. However, if Oldbag's testimony says she saw only Powers going there before 2:30 PM, but maybe someone else entered before 2:15 PM when the path wasn't blocked yet. Wait, the blockage started at 2:15 PM. The murder was at 2:30 PM. So someone could have entered before 2:15 PM and been inside when the path was blocked. But Oldbag claims she saw only Powers going there. However, maybe the photo (Evidence 5) shows someone else. For example, the Steel Samurai in the photo is dragging a leg, which might indicate it's not Powers but someone else (since Powers might not drag his leg). Wait, Powers is the one who plays the Steel Samurai, so maybe the photo is of him. But if that's the case, then his presence is accounted for. But maybe the real killer was in the studio before 2:15 PM and stayed there, committing the murder at 2:30 PM. However, Oldbag's testimony says she saw only Powers. But if someone else entered before 2:15 PM, they could have gone in without being seen by Oldbag. Wait, but the Security Lady claims she was at the gate and that the camera takes a photo automatically whenever someone walks by. So if someone else had entered, their photo would have been taken. But in Evidence 5, the only photo mentioned is of the Steel Samurai at 2:00 PM. So if there's no other photos of people entering, then perhaps no one else did. However, maybe the killer used another entrance or some other way. Alternatively, maybe the Steel Samurai in the photo is not Powers. For example, if someone else was wearing the costume. That would contradict Oldbag's testimony that she only saw Powers. Let's check the photo's details: Evidence 5 is titled "Powers'(?) Photo" which suggests uncertainty. The caption says Steel Samurai is seen walking, dragging one leg. If Powers had an injury or normally didn't drag his leg, maybe it's someone else. For instance, the real killer could have worn the costume and had a limp, hence dragging the leg. If that's the case, then Oldbag's testimony that she only saw Powers is contradicted by the photo showing someone else (in the costume) entering. But how does that tie in with the evidence? The photo was taken at 2:00 PM, so if the real killer entered then, and the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, they could have been inside. Then Oldbag's testimony that she only saw Powers (the defendant) would be wrong because the photo actually shows the killer (not Powers) entering. Therefore, Evidence 5 contradicts Testimony 1 or 3. Let me check the testimonies again. Testimony 1: "The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!" Testimony 3: "If they had, I would have seen them!" So if the photo shows someone else (in the Steel Samurai costume) entering at 2:00 PM, then Oldbag either didn't see them (but the camera did) or she mistook them for Powers. However, the camera is automatic, so even if Oldbag didn't notice, the camera would have captured it. But Oldbag's testimony claims that if someone else had gone, she would have seen them. But the camera's photo (Evidence 5) shows the Steel Samurai at 2:00 PM. If that was the killer, then Oldbag's testimony that she only saw Powers is contradicted because the camera captured someone else (in the costume) entering. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 5 and Testimony 1 or 3. Alternatively, maybe the photo is of Powers, but the timing allows for another person to enter after the path was blocked. Wait, the path was blocked from 2:15 PM. So after that, no one could enter via that path. But the murder was at 2:30 PM. If the killer was already inside before 2:15 PM, they could have stayed. But Oldbag says she only saw Powers going there. But if the killer was someone else who entered before 2:15 PM without Oldbag seeing, that's possible only if they used another entrance or Oldbag is lying. But the camera would have taken their photo if they used the main gate. So the photo in Evidence 5 is at 2:00 PM, showing the Steel Samurai (possibly the killer) entering. If that's not Powers, then Oldbag's testimony that she only saw Powers is contradicted by the photo showing someone else. Therefore, Evidence 5 contradicts Testimony 1 and 3. The key point is that the photo shows someone (maybe not Powers) entering, which Oldbag claims she didn't see anyone else. But since the camera automatically takes photos, the existence of the photo proves someone else entered, hence contradicting her testimony. So the pair would be Evidence 5 and Testimony 3. Because Testimony 3 says "If they had, I would have seen them!" but the photo (Evidence 5) shows someone else (even if in costume) passing by the camera, which Oldbag should have seen if her testimony is true. But maybe she didn't notice, but the camera did. However, the contradiction arises because the camera's photo proves that someone else entered, which Oldbag claims she would have seen. Therefore, the existence of the photo (Evidence 5) contradicts her statement in Testimony 3. So the answer should be {"evidence": 5, "testimony": 3}.

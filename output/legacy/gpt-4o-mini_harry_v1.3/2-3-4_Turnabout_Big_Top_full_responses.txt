The evidence that suggests blunt force trauma from the bust (Evidence 11: Russell's Autopsy Report) contradicts Acro's testimony (Testimony 5) where he asserts that it would be unrealistic for him to have dropped the bust on the Ringmaster. If the bust was indeed the weapon causing the fatal injury, Acroâ€™s claim of it being unrealistic to do so creates a contradiction regarding the possibility of his involvement in the murder.

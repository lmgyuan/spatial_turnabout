The testimony provided by Iris indicates that Mystic Elise struck Mystic Maya with her staff and then moved in to deliver a fatal strike, while also saying that Elise threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe. This contradicts the evidence known as the Victim's Staff, which has Elise's fingerprints on it and suggests that she was using it at the time of the incident.

Specifically, if Elise was indeed using the staff to strike Maya, it would not logically align with her throwing the staff away to use a dagger, as Iris implies Elise attempted to use both consecutively in her testimony. This creates a discrepancy regarding the timeline and actions taken by Elise, which is not accounted for by the evidence.

******************************
The testimony provided by Iris states that Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise, which suggests that Maya directly attacked Elise with a weapon. However, the evidence indicating that the Shichishito is the apparent murder weapon states that it has the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but it is not the murder weapon. This creates a contradiction because if Maya stabbed Elise, the Shichishito should logically be the weapon used in the attack, making the claim that it is not the murder weapon contradictory.

The key contradiction lies between Testimony 6 and the Weather Data evidence. Iris states that by the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped. However, according to the Weather Data, it was snowing until approximately 10:50 PM, meaning that it wouldn't have stopped until after that time, and the murder happened within the timeframe of when it was still snowing. 

Thus, the conflicting points are that Iris claims the snow had stopped before the murder occurred, while the weather evidence indicates that snow was still falling.

The testimony states that Maya stumbled against the stone lantern after being struck over the head, which implies that she was in close proximity to it at that time. However, the evidence that the stone lantern was not lit the night of the crime contradicts her ability to clearly see a man behind her attacker by its light. If the lantern was not lit, it would not provide enough visibility for her to identify anyone.

Evidence 10 states that the apparent murder weapon, the Shichishito, had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it. However, testimony 3 from Maya asserts that "The torches were lit... And the body was gone." This suggests that after the murder occurred, the scene was altered or cleaned up, which could imply that the murder weapon was removed or hidden, contradicting the idea that the weapon was left at the scene with blood and fingerprints before the cleanup took place.

******************************
The testimony indicates that Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time the next day, which implies that he could not have been present during the events that transpired the night of the crime. However, the evidence from the Weather Data clearly shows that he must have been there, as he arrived at a time that coincides with the storm conditions described. This creates a contradiction between Godot's presence as stated in the testimony and the implication that he was involved during the crime.

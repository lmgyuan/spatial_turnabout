The evidence of the Tres Bien Floor Plans (Evidence 11) shows the layout of the restaurant with the mirror dividing two halves, while Jean Armstrong's testimony (Testimony 4) states that after the incident, he moved the mirror. This contradicts the evidence suggesting the mirror's position affected visibility at the time of the incident and raises questions about the validity of his claim that he did not touch anything else.

******************************
The contradiction lies between Evidence 10, which states that Glen Elg died of potassium cyanide poisoning with a time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM, and Testimony 2 from Jean Armstrong, which claims that another old man arrived just after 2 PM. If Glen Elg died before 2 PM, then it would not be feasible for another customer to arrive after him without it being possible for them to witness the poisoning or arrive too late to affect the timeline.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 2}
******************************
The contradiction is between the testimony of Furio Tigre and the evidence of Glen's Calendar. Tigre's testimony states he was busy in his office and did not see the victim, but Glen's Calendar indicates he had a meeting with Tigre on the day of the incident, implying that they were supposed to meet. This suggests that Tigre could not have been in his office the entire time as he claimed. 

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 2}
******************************
The evidence stating that "Glen's Autopsy Report" reveals that Glen Elg had died of potassium cyanide poisoning contradicts Tigre's testimony where he claims he never met Glen Elg. If Tigre is telling the truth and he never met Glen Elg, it raises questions about how he would know that Glen wanted to borrow cash from him, as stated in his other testimonies. 

Therefore, the contradicting pair is:

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 0}
******************************
The contradiction occurs between Testimony 0 from Tigre, where he claims he was supposed to meet with someone at the restaurant "that afternoon," and the time of the victim's death as indicated in Glen's Autopsy Report (Evidence 10), which states the time of death was between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. If he was at the restaurant earlier, he would not be there during the time of death as he claims he left after seeing "one ugly scene" (Testimony 1).

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 0}
******************************
The evidence that contradicts the testimony is the **Victim's Lottery Ticket** (Evidence 14) and **Testimony 7** from Tigre. 

In Testimony 7, Tigre claims that he didn't have another reason to kill Glen Elg aside from the $100,000 debt. However, the Victim's Lottery Ticket shows that Glen won half a million dollars right before his death, which would have provided a substantial motive for someone involved with him financially, especially in a context where Tigre was already pressuring him for repayment. The existence of the winning ticket conflicts with the assertion that the debt was the only motive.

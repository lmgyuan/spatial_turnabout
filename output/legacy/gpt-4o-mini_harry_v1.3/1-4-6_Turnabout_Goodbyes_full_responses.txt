The contradiction arises between Testimony 5 and Evidence 11. Testimony 5 states that there was "a single gunshot," implying only one shot was fired at that moment. However, Evidence 11, which is Lotta's Deposition, states, "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25," indicating that there were two distinct gunshots heard. This discrepancy suggests a conflict in the accounts regarding how many shots were actually fired.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}

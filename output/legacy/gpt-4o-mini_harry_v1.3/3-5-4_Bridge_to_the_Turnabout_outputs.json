    "response": "The testimony provided by Maya states, \"The torches were lit... And the body was gone.\" This implies that she believes the body of the victim was removed after the crime, suggesting some form of tampering with the scene. However, evidence shows that a clean-up occurred because Maya later mentions, \"And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too,\" which further supports that the crime scene was manipulated after the murder.\n\nHowever, there is a contradiction when considering the crime scene's condition post-cleanup related to the presence of Elise's body and the lighting of torches. The implication that the torches were lit yet the body was gone suggests that someone may have orchestrated the scene to mislead, but the cleaning aspect specifically points to someone trying to hide the truth.\n\nGiven this subtlety, focusing on Maya's observations that the body was gone would contradict with the specific details surrounding any believable account of events leading up to that, reinforcing the confusion about whether a body could be moved without torch-lighting. \n\nIn summary, the evidence causing the contradiction lies within the observations that assert differences between what should have been seen immediately after the incident, with what Maya states in her testimony.\n\n{\"evidence\": 13, \"testimony\": 3}",

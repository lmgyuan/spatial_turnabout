The contradiction is between the testimony given by Trilo about having an engagement ring for Regina that he intended to gift her (Testimony 2), and the absence of any mention of an engagement ring in the collected evidence regarding the crime. The evidence indicates that a cheap ring with an eerie sparkle was found (Evidence 10), but there are no details that connect this ring to Trilo or indicate that it was meant for an engagement. This implies that Trilo's claim may not be truthful.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 2}
******************************
The evidence that contradicts the testimony is Evidence 2, the Crime Photo, which shows the victim lying in the snow and does not support Moe's assertion that he clearly saw Max's symbols or face, since the crime scene would not allow for a clear view of Max. Thus, Moe's claim in Testimony 3 contradicts the evidence. 

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
******************************
The Crime Photo (Evidence 2) shows a person lying on a case in the snow, with footprints leading to where he is. However, Moe's testimony (Testimony 3) claims that a silk hat was worn the entire time that he was on the scene. If the person in the crime photo is not identified as wearing the silk hat, or if the details do not corroborate the timing and location Moe describes, there is a contradiction.

Evidence 14, the Sacred Urn, indicates that Ami Fey's spirit was sealed within it and that it was broken by Pearl right before the murder. This contradicts Testimony 5, where Ini Miney states that her sister (Mimi Miney) told her something terrible during the channeling. Since the urn was broken before the murder and was supposed to contain Ami Fey's spirit, Ini's testimony suggests a connection with her sister's spirit that contradicts the timeline of events surrounding the urn's damage.

Evidence 6 states that Mimi Miney, Ini's sister, died when her car crashed after falling asleep at the wheel. Ini's testimony indicates that she also fell asleep in the passenger's seat. However, it contradicts the implication that Mimi was entirely responsible for the accident, as Ini suggests she contributed to the situation by being asleep too. Though they might not overtly contradict, the focus on Mimi’s inability to stay awake while driving places sole blame on Mimi. The evidence and testimony suggest a collaborative responsibility.

Evidence 6 states that Mimi Miney died after falling asleep at the wheel while driving her car. Ini Miney, in her testimonies, refers to her sister's car and emphasizes that Mimi was very protective of it and valued it highly, implying she would not let just anyone drive it. However, ini mentions that she was a passenger in the car that night, which contradicts the idea that Mimi was fully aware and in control, indicating that she would have likely been alert if she valued her car so highly. 

The contradiction arises between the claim of Mimi’s accident due to sleeping at the wheel (as evidence implies her negligence) and Ini’s insistence on her sister's careful and protective nature over her car (which suggests she would have been alert and cautious while driving).

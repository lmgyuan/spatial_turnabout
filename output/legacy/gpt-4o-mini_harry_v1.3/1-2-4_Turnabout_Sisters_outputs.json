Specifically, the testimony states events that began occurring around 9:00 PM, but Mia's time of death is also recorded as 9:00 PM. This would imply that she couldn't have been attacked and chased at the same time if the time of death is accurate.\n\nThe relevant evidence is Mia's Autopsy Report, stating the time of death, and the testimony provided by Redd White that claims to have witnessed an attack leading to her death at that exact time. \n\nThe specific contradiction here arises because White's testimony about the attack indicates she was alive and being chased, while the autopsy states she was killed at that same moment, making it impossible for her to still be alive and running away from any attack.\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 8}",

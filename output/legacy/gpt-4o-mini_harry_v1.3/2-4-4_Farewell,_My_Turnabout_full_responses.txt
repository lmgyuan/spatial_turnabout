The contradiction lies between Testimony 0 and Evidence 6. In Testimony 0, Will Powers claims he was in the hallway because he needed to go to the bathroom, which suggests he was alone in that area. However, Evidence 6 indicates the layout of the Gatewater Hotel, showing the specific paths leading to the crime scene. The implication that someone was present at the time of the murder contradicts Powers' statement of being in the hallway for such personal needs, as it may suggest he would have been away from where the activity was occurring.

The testimony from de Killer states that Adrian Andrews pretended to be the first person to discover the body and enter the scene. However, the evidence suggests that Andrews' fingerprints were found on the wine glass next to the victim, indicating her presence at the crime scene, which contradicts the claim that she was pretending and had prior knowledge of the victim being dead without her involvement in the discovery. Therefore, this contradiction highlights a discrepancy in the timeline as presented by the testimony and the physical evidence.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other is as follows: 

In Testimony 3, de Killer states that one of the requests was to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews. However, Evidence 26 indicates that the bear figurine contains Celeste's suicide note that discloses Engarde's misdeeds, suggesting it was intended for someone else and implies that the figurine holds greater significance than merely being delivered to Andrews. This inconsistency raises questions about the true intent behind the delivery of the figurine.

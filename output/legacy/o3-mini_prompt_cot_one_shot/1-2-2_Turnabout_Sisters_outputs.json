    "prompt": "You are provided with a list of characters, evidences and testimonies.\nWhich evidence and testimony contradict each other? You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}.

    "cot": "Testimony 2 claims that a memo found at the scene had the word “Maya” written in blood, suggesting that the victim herself had left behind a stark, blood-written clue implicating Maya. However, Evidence 14—the memo in Mia’s own handwriting—shows merely a list of names rather than a blood-written declaration. This inconsistency between the nature and content of the memo as described in Testimony 2 and as documented in Evidence 14 points to a direct contradiction.\n",

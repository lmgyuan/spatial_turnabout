    "cot": "Testimony 0 states, \"All I did was support Clay over my shoulder and get us out of the rocket!\" However, according to Evidence 1 – Terran’s Autopsy Report – the victim was found in the third-floor boarding lounge of the main building and died from a stabbing. This creates a clear inconsistency: if Clay were in a rocket (as the testimony implies), then the location and cause of death detailed in the autopsy report would not match. \n",

    "cot": "Testimony 2 says, “With the capsule and Clay in my arms, I made my way down from the upper level,” implying that Clay was still in a state (or had been retrieved from a place) consistent with him being mobile or at least being taken directly from his previous location. However, Evidence 1 – Terran's Autopsy Report – states that the victim’s cause of death was a stabbing and that his body was discovered in the third‐floor boarding lounge. This creates a clear discrepancy in both the manner of death and the location from which Clay was supposedly retrieved. It seems unlikely that someone would be carried “down from the upper level” after having been fatally stabbed and found in a different area. \n",

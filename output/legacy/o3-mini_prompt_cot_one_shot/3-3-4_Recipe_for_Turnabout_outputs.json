    "cot": "Testimony 3 from Tigre says, \"I'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin',\" implying an imminent physical attack. However, Evidence 10 (Glen's Autopsy Report) unambiguously states that the victim died of potassium cyanide poisoning, a method of murder that involves poisoning rather than physical violence. This contradiction between a violent confrontation and a poisoning cause makes Evidence 10 and Testimony 3 a contradictory pair. ",

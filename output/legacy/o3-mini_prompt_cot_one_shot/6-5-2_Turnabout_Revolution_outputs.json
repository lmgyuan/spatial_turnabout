    "cot": "Testimony 5 from Atishon claims that “it was around 10 at night” and implies that the suspect (whom he assumes is Dr. Buff) was actively fleeing the scene. However, Evidence 13—the Autopsy Report for Dr. Buff—establishes that he died between 10 and 11 PM after being struck by an object. If Dr. Buff was already dead as indicated by the autopsy report, he couldn’t have been fleeing the scene at that time. This direct conflict between the timeline of death in the evidence and the actions described in the testimony shows a clear contradiction.\n",

    "cot": "Testimony 5 from Sarge claims, \"He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it!\", implying that the murder involved more than one distinct, perhaps drawn-out, incident in the study. However, Evidence 13—the autopsy report for Dr. Buff—states that he was struck with the corner of some object and that his time of death falls between 10 and 11 PM, suggesting a single, decisive fatal blow. This discrepancy between a supposed regrouping and repeated action versus a single, clearly defined cause of death is contradictory.\n",

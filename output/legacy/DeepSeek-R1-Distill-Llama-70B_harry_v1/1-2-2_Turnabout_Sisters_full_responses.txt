Alright, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So, we have a list of evidences and testimonies, and I need to find one pair where they contradict each other. 

First, I'll go through the evidence list to understand what each piece is about. 

Evidence 0 is an Attorney's Badge. It seems like it's just for identification, so maybe not directly relevant to the crime details.

Evidence 1 is "The Thinker," which is described as the murder weapon. It's a statue that's actually a clock made by Larry Butz. Okay, so this is the weapon used in the murder.

Evidence 2 is Glass Shards from a broken light stand. It's broken beyond recognition, so maybe it's related to the crime scene but not directly pointing to the weapon.

Evidence 3 is a Receipt with letters written in blood on the back. This could be a clue left by the victim or someone else.

Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo, which mentions a conversation recorded on her cell phone. So, it's about potential audio evidence.

Evidence 5 is Mia's Autopsy Report, stating the time of death as 9/5 at 9:00 PM, caused by a single blunt force trauma, and death was instantaneous. So, the cause of death is a blunt trauma.

Evidence 6 is Maya's Cell Phone, which has a conversation between the Chief and Maya. It's for details, but not sure how it ties in yet.

Evidence 7 is a Wiretap found in Miss May's hotel room. Maybe related to surveillance or illegal activities.

Evidence 8 is Floor Plans of the Fey & Co. Law Offices, the murder scene. It helps visualize the crime scene layout.

Evidence 9 is May Testimony, describing how the victim dodged an attack, ran to the right, but was caught and struck. So, this is an eyewitness account of the murder.

Evidence 10 and 11 are Photographs related to the DL-6 Incident, Exhibits A and B. Not sure how they connect yet.

Evidence 12 is a Bellboy's Affidavit about a man staying with Miss May on the night of the murder. So, it's about identifying a suspect.

Evidence 13 is a Newspaper Clipping about a politician's suicide with the word "White" written on it. Maybe a red herring or related to another case.

Evidence 14 is Mia's Memo with a list of names. Potentially suspects or people involved.

Now, looking at the testimonies:

Testimony 0: Gumshoe says he secured the suspect and examined the crime scene himself.

Testimony 1: He found a memo next to the victim's body.

Testimony 2: The memo had "Maya" written in blood.

Testimony 3: Lab tests confirmed the blood was the victim's.

Testimony 4: There was blood on the victim's finger.

Testimony 5: Gumshoe believes the victim wrote the killer's name before dying.

Okay, now I need to see which evidence contradicts any of these testimonies.

Looking at Testimony 5, Gumshoe says the victim wrote the killer's name in blood. But looking at Evidence 3, it's a receipt with letters written in blood, but it doesn't specify that it's the killer's name. Maybe the memo Gumshoe found is this receipt, but the receipt doesn't necessarily have the killer's nameâ€”it could be something else.

Also, Evidence 1 is the murder weapon, a statue-clock. Testimony 2 mentions "The Thinker" as the murder weapon, which aligns with Evidence 1. So that's consistent.

Testimony 5 claims the victim wrote the killer's name, but if the receipt (Evidence 3) only has the word "Maya" as per Testimony 2, then Testimony 5 might be an assumption by Gumshoe that isn't supported by the evidence. The receipt doesn't confirm the killer's name was written, just that "Maya" was written.

So, Evidence 3 (Receipt) doesn't contradict Testimony 2, but Testimony 5 might be going beyond what the evidence shows. However, the user is asking for a pair that contradicts each other, so maybe Evidence 1 (murder weapon) and Testimony 5 (killer's name written) don't directly contradict, but perhaps another pair.

Wait, Evidence 5 says the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, which aligns with Evidence 1 being the murder weapon. So that's consistent.

Looking again, Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name, but the evidence (Evidence 3) only shows "Maya" was written. Unless "Maya" is the killer's name, but that's not indicated elsewhere. So, Testimony 5 might be making an assumption not fully backed by the evidence.

Alternatively, maybe the time of death in Evidence 5 (9:00 PM) contradicts something else, but I don't see a testimony about the time yet.

Wait, Testimony 0 says Gumshoe examined the scene, but I don't see a direct contradiction there.

Hmm, perhaps the key is that the receipt (Evidence 3) has "Maya" written in blood, but Testimony 5 claims it's the killer's name. If "Maya" is not the killer, then Testimony 5 contradicts Evidence 3.

So, the contradiction would be between Evidence 3 and Testimony 5.

{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 5}

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. Let's go through everything step by step.

First, I'll list out all the evidence and testimonies provided to get a clear picture.

**Evidence:**
0. Attorney's Badge - A defense attorney's badge.
1. The Thinker - A statue that's actually a clock, used as the murder weapon.
2. Glass Shards - Broken remains of a glass light stand.
3. Receipt - Department store receipt with blood letters.
4. Maya's Memo - Notes about a phone conversation.
5. Mia's Autopsy Report - Time of death 9/5 at 9:00PM, blunt trauma.
6. Maya's Cell Phone - Holds a conversation with the Chief.
7. Wiretap - Found in Miss May's hotel room.
8. Floor Plans - Murder scene at Fey & Co. Law Offices.
9. May Testimony - Victim dodged attack, ran right, got struck.
10. Photograph - DL-6 Incident Exhibit A.
11. Photograph - DL-6 Incident Exhibit B.
12. Bellboy's Affidavit - Describes man with Miss May.
13. Newspaper Clipping - Politician's suicide, word "White."
14. Mia's Memo - List of names in Mia's handwriting.

**Testimonies:**
0. April says she saw everything.
1. April describes the victim dodging an attack and running right.
2. April mentions a girl in hippie clothes chasing the victim.
3. April claims the girl hit the victim with the weapon.
4. April identifies the weapon as "The Thinker" clock.

Now, I need to find a contradiction between any evidence and a testimony.

Looking at Testimony 4, April says the weapon was "The Thinker" clock, which is Evidence 1. But Evidence 1 describes "The Thinker" as the murder weapon, matching the testimony. So that seems consistent, not contradictory.

Next, looking at Testimony 3, April says she saw the girl hit the victim with the weapon. If the weapon was "The Thinker," which is heavy, that makes sense. But I don't see any evidence directly contradicting this.

Wait, maybe looking at the time of death could help. Mia's Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) says the time of death was 9/5 at 9:00PM. If there's a testimony about the time, that could contradict. But I don't see any testimony mentioning the exact time of death.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 0 where April says she saw everything, but if there's evidence that she couldn't have seen, that would contradict. However, I don't see such evidence listed here.

Wait, Evidence 7 is a Wiretap found in Miss May's hotel room. If Testimony 4 mentions "The Thinker" as the weapon, but the wiretap could imply surveillance, maybe that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) could contradict something, but Testimony 2 mentions a girl in hippie clothes, not necessarily related to the glass shards.

Hmm, I'm not seeing a clear contradiction here. Perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, Evidence 1 is "The Thinker," which is the murder weapon. Testimony 4 correctly identifies it. So no contradiction there.

Maybe looking at the other evidence, like the Receipt with blood letters (Evidence 3). If a testimony says something about writing, but I don't see a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, Maya's Memo (Evidence 4) mentions a recorded conversation, but without knowing the content, it's hard to contradict.

Perhaps the key is that Testimony 4 identifies the weapon, which matches Evidence 1, so no contradiction.

Wait, maybe the time of death in Evidence 5 and any testimony about the time. But testimonies don't mention the exact time, so no contradiction.

I'm not finding a clear contradiction here. Maybe I need to look again.

Wait, Evidence 9 is May's Testimony, which says the victim ran to the right. Testimony 1 from April also says the victim ran to the right. So they agree.

Testimony 2 mentions a girl in hippie clothes, but no evidence contradicts that.

I'm stuck. Maybe there's no direct contradiction, but I have to choose one pair.

Perhaps Testimony 4 says the weapon was "The Thinker," which is Evidence 1, but maybe another testimony contradicts that.

Wait, no, Testimony 4 aligns with Evidence 1.

Maybe Evidence 5's time of death contradicts a testimony about the time, but no testimony mentions the time.

Alternatively, maybe the wiretap (Evidence 7) contradicts something, but I don't see a link.

I think I'll have to go with the first pair I thought of, even though it's not a perfect contradiction.

So, {"evidence": 1, "testimony": 8}
</think>

{"evidence": 1, "testimony": 8}

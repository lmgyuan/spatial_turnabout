Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm given a list of evidence and testimonies related to a murder case, and I need to find a pair where the evidence and testimony contradict each other. The final answer should be in JSON format, like {"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3} or {"character": 4, "testimony": 11}.

First, I need to understand what each piece of evidence and testimony is saying. Let's go through them one by one.

Starting with the evidence:

- **Evidence 0**: Attorney's Badge - This is just a badge that identifies someone as a defense attorney. It doesn't seem directly relevant to the murder.
- **Evidence 1**: Powers's Letter - This proves that Will Powers requested an attorney. Again, not directly linked to the murder scene.
- **Evidence 2**: Guidemap - A map of Global Studios. This could be useful for understanding the layout, but no direct contradiction yet.
- **Evidence 3**: Jack's Autopsy Report - Time of death is 10/15 at 2:30 PM, cause of death is a spear to the chest. This is crucial because it tells us exactly when and how the victim died.
- **Evidence 4**: Cardkey - For studio employees, grants access to Studio One. Could be important for determining who was in the area.
- **Evidence 5**: Powers'(?) Photo - Taken at the gate on Oct 15 at 2:00 PM. Shows Steel Samurai walking. This is a photo of the suspect, Powers, near the crime scene around the time of the murder.
- **Evidence 6**: Samurai Spear - The murder weapon found in the victim's chest. Direct evidence linking the murder to the spear.
- **Evidence 7**: Empty Bottle â†’ Sleeping Pill Bottle - Found in the employee area, had sleeping pills. Could indicate that someone was drugged or slept through the murder.
- **Evidence 8**: Trailer Key - Key to Studio Two Trailer. Not directly relevant unless someone used it to access the trailer.
- **Evidence 9**: Vasquez's Memo - Asked to bring the script from Episode 13. Could indicate a motive if the script was important.
- **Evidence 10**: Script - Episode 13 script. Ties into the memo, possibly related to the motive.
- **Evidence 11**: Mr. Monkey's Head - Blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. So, the crime scene was inaccessible during this time, but the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right in the middle of this blockage.
- **Evidence 12**: Steel Samurai Card - A trading card, popular with kids. Not directly relevant.
- **Evidence 13**: URP Card - Ultra Rare Premium card, very valuable. Could be a motive for theft or murder.
- **Evidence 14**: "Path to Glory" - Photos of Steel Samurai's victories. Not directly relevant.
- **Evidence 15**: Cody's Camera - A digital camera Cody always carries. Could have been used to take evidence photos.
- **Evidence 16**: Steak Plate - Found in the employee area with traces of sleeping pills and a bone. Indicates someone ate a steak and possibly took sleeping pills.
- **Evidence 17**: Five-Year-Old Photo - Shows an accident involving Jack Hammer. Could indicate a past conflict or motive.
- **Evidence 18**: Van - Used by Manella to drive Vasquez to Studio One. Transportation details, could help with alibis.

Now, looking at the testimonies:

- **Testimony 0**: Oldbag arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM on the day of the murder.
- **Testimony 1**: Hammer and others were doing a run-through in Studio One since morning.
- **Testimony 2**: Oldbag had errands in the morning.
- **Testimony 3**: Oldbag was at the guard station by 1:00 PM.
- **Testimony 4**: Oldbag was at the main gate from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
- **Testimony 5**: Murder happened at 2:30 PM.
- **Testimony 6**: At 2:00 PM, a man (Powers) walked by Oldbag heading to the studio.
- **Testimony 7**: It was Powers, the defendant, heading toward the studio.

Now, looking for contradictions:

1. **Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head)** says the path was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM, but the murder happened at 2:30 PM. If the path was blocked, how did the killer access the scene? This seems contradictory because the blockage should have prevented anyone from reaching the area during the time of the murder.

2. **Testimony 7** places Powers at the gate at 2:00 PM, heading towards the studio. If the path was blocked from 2:15 PM onwards, Powers would have had to enter the studio before 2:15 PM. However, the murder occurred at 2:30 PM, when the path was supposedly blocked. This raises questions about how Powers could have been at the crime scene if the path was blocked.

Therefore, the contradiction lies between **Evidence 11** and **Testimony 7**. The evidence suggests the path was blocked, making it impossible for Powers to reach the crime scene at 2:30 PM, but the testimony places him near the studio at 2:00 PM, which could have allowed him enough time to reach the scene before the blockage started. However, the exact timing and access need to be reconciled.

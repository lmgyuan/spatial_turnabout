    "response": "To determine which piece of evidence contradicts a given testimony, we should carefully analyze both the testimonies and the evidence list. In the provided information, we have a key detail regarding the timeline of events, given in Testimony 1 and Testimony 4, and evidence that can clarify these timelines.\n\nTestimony 1 by Vasquez indicates that a meeting started at 12:00 sharp and ended at 4:00 PM. Testimony 5 mentions that Sal and Vasquez ate t-bone steaks. Testimony 4, also by Vasquez, notes that they took a 15-minute break at 2:30 PM.\n\nNow, let's look at the provided pieces of evidence: \n\n- Evidence 11, Mr. Monkey's Head, states that the path was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM.\n\nThis is important because:\n\n1. Testimony 5 states they ate t-bone steaks in front of the trailer, implying they were outside or had access to that area.\n2. According to Evidence 11, Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.\n3. Therefore, they would not have been able to leave the meeting and access the outdoor area in front of the trailer to have t-bone steaks during the break at 2:30 PM, as the path would have been blocked.\n\nHence, Vasquez's statements about her actions during the break contradict the evidence that the path was blocked at this time.\n\n{\"evidence\": 11, \"testimony\": 5}",

    "response": "To figure out the contradiction, let's examine the testimonies and evidence closely:\n\n### Testimonies highlighting where contradictions might exist:\n\n- **Testimony 3** by Vasquez states: \"The security lady, Oldbag, was quite agitated. Pointing at Powers, saying 'he did it!'\"\n\n### Evidence that might contradict:\n\n- **Evidence 5 (Powers'(?) Photo):** This is crucial. It's a photo taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios, at 2:00 PM, showing \"Powers\" (actually someone in his costume) dragging one leg.\n\nThe contradiction arises between the **testimony given by Vasquez** about Oldbag (the security lady) accusing Powers of the murder, and the **evidence which is the photo** taken of \"Powers\" at 2:00 PM, which shows someone in the Steel Samurai costume, not necessarily Will Powers himself. This implies that the security lady may have mistaken the person in costume for Powers based solely on the outfit, providing a basis for the argument that her testimony about directly identifying Powers is unreliable.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 given by Vasquez about the security lady's statement and the Evidence 5 (Powers’(?) Photo) that indicates uncertainty about the person’s identity.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 3}\n```",

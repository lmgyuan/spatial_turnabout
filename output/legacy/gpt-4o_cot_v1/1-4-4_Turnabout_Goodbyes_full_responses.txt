To identify a contradiction between the provided evidence and testimonies, we need to closely analyze the details of each.

First, let's examine the relevant testimonies by Larry Butz:

- Testimony 3: "Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this 'bang'!"
- Testimony 5: "So after I heard that single gunshot I went home."

These statements suggest that Larry heard only a single gunshot.

Next, let's review the evidence that pertains to gunshot sounds:

- Evidence 11: Lotta's Deposition - "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25."

From this, we can see a clear contradiction. Larry Butz's testimony states he heard only one gunshot, whereas Lotta's Deposition indicates there were two gunshots fired.

Therefore, the contradiction lies between Lotta's Deposition (evidence) and Larry Butz's testimony regarding the number of gunshots heard.

Let's analyze the testimonies and the evidences closely to find contradictions.

Characters involved:
- Larry Butz (known for being unreliable) gave several testimonies, all related to hearing a gunshot on Christmas Eve.

Reviewing testimonies by Larry Butz:
- Testimony 3: "But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!"

From his testimony, it sounds like Larry is certain he heard the shot, but the corroboration comes from his other statements where he claims he heard a gunshot while listening to the radio.

Let's cross-examine with evidences:

Noticeable pieces from the evidence list:
- Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11): "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25."
  - This suggests the shots were heard after midnight, on the 25th.
- Lake Photo (Evidence 4): Taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM.
- Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16): Shows an empty lake. Taken automatically on 12/24 at 11:50 PM.

Lotta's Deposition states she heard gunshots past midnight, on 12/25. Larry claims he heard it before midnight, on Christmas Eve. Therefore there is a contradiction between Larry's testimonies claiming he heard a gunshot at such a specific earlier time and the deposition and photos showing it happened later.

Thus, Larry's Testimony 5, "Just when she said 'Hey! It's almost Christmas!' I heard the gunshot!" conflicts with the fact that the gunshot evidence was recorded after midnight.

Final cross-reference:
- Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition) and Testimony 5 (Butz): Larry's claim to have heard the gunshot before Christmas contradicts the evidence suggesting it occurred after midnight. 

Hence, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 11 regarding the timing of the gunshots.

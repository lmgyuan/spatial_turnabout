To identify the contradiction between the given evidence and testimonies, we need to analyze the contents:

1. **Testimony 3** provided by Gumshoe states: "His pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces."

2. **Evidence 4**, the "Sacred Urn," is described as "Supposedly priceless, but has no monetary value." 

The contradiction arises because Testimony 3 describes Mask☆DeMasque as targeting only art pieces of high value, whereas the Sacred Urn, which was the target of the heist, is said to have no monetary value at all. This indicates a clear discrepancy between the testimony of Detective Gumshoe and the value of the item taken during the heist.

Thus, the evidence and testimony contradicting each other are Evidence 4 and Testimony 3. The resulting JSON format is as follows:

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To find a contradiction between the provided pieces of evidence and testimonies, let's first analyze the evidence and testimonies carefully.

**Testimonies:**
1. Testimony 0: Atmey states it was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning.
2. Testimony 1: Atmey mentions Mask☆DeMasque descended upon him.
3. Testimony 2: Atmey claims he was struck in the head and rendered unconscious.
4. Testimony 3: Atmey states darkness swallowed him before he could land a strike.
5. Testimony 4: Atmey used an emergency phone 30 minutes later to notify the police, suggesting he was unconscious for a substantial time.

**Key Evidence:**
- Evidence 6: Shichishito, used to knock Atmey out at 1 AM.
- Evidence 7: Camera Data showing the camera went off around 1 AM.
- Evidence 19: Buzzer Record indicating the buzzer went off once at 1:02 AM on October 12.
- Evidence 15: Kane's Autopsy Report states the time of death as 1 AM.
- Evidence 5: DeMasque's Calling Card, related to the heist.
- Evidence 0: Attorney's Badge is irrelevant for contradicting testimony.
- Evidence 17: CEO Office Buzzer with no fingerprints, suggesting it might not have been pressed recently.

Analyzing Evidence:
- Testimony 3 by Atmey says he was attacked and lost consciousness instantly, implying an event at 1 AM.
- However, if we consider the **Buzzer Record (Evidence 19)**, it states the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM, 2 minutes after the supposed attack.

Thinking of the timeline:
- If Atmey was actually knocked out at 1 AM as he testified, it would be inconsistent with the buzzer record, which shows activity after the period he said he was unconscious.

Now, let's reconcile Testimony 3 with some evidence:

The contradiction becomes clear between Atmey's Testimony 3 ("Darkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.") and the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) indicating activity at 1:02 AM, after the supposed time of the attack. This suggests Atmey was either not unconscious at 1 AM or some situation occurred after he was allegedly incapacitated.

By examining the details, it becomes clear: 
- Testimony 3 claims immediate unconsciousness.
- Evidence 19 shows post-attack activity (the buzzer going off 2 minutes after the supposed time of the attack).

Thus, Testimony 3 is logically inconsistent with Evidence 19.

{"evidence": 19, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To identify a contradiction between the evidence and the testimonies given, we need to carefully analyze the contents of each and find inconsistencies.

1. **Review Each Testimony by Atmey:**
   - **Testimony 0:** Atmey claims he looked away for a moment.
   - **Testimony 1:** Atmey states that he cannot be discombobulated easily.
   - **Testimony 2:** Claims the thief grabbed a weapon and incapacitated him.
   - **Testimony 3:** Mentions fighting with his fists, but was not enough.
   - **Testimony 4:** Describes the thief's first blow striking true, implying Atmey was knocked out by a single blow.
   - **Testimony 5:** Says he put his back to the wall, but the thief hit him on his third eye (forehead).

2. **Review Relevant Evidence:**
   - **Evidence 6 (Shichishito):** Describes a ceremonial sword that wasn't bent before the crime, and that DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head.
   - **Evidence 14 (DeMasque's Broach):** Found next to Ami Fey's statue from which a weapon could have been grabbed.

3. **Identify Contradiction:**
   - **Testimony 5 and Evidence 6:** 
     - Testimony 5 claims Atmey put his back to the wall and was hit on his third eye (forehead).
     - Evidence 6 contradicts this as it specifically states that DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head.
   
The contradiction lies in Atmey's claim about the location of the blow (forehead, third eye) versus evidence that confirms the blow was to the back of his head.

**Conclusion:**
Thus, Testimony 5 contradicts Evidence 6.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 5}
******************************
To identify contradictions between the evidence and the testimonies, we need to carefully compare the content of each testimony with the details provided in the evidence. Let's follow each step thoughtfully:

1. **Understand Ron's Testimony**:
   - Testimony 3 states: "I donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!"

2. **Analyze Relevant Evidence**:
   - We need to look for evidence related to Ron DeLite, Mask☆DeMasque, and the crime scene.
   - **Evidence 14: DeMasque's Broach**: This was found in the shadow of Ami Fey's statue at the scene of the crime.
     - If Ron was Mask☆DeMasque and was indeed present at the scene in costume as he claims, then this detail might align with his testimony.
   - **Evidence 19: Buzzer Record**: Indicates the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM on October 12. This timing is around when Ron is claiming to be committing the theft (though it relates more to the murder than the theft).

3. **Detect the Contradiction**:
   - **Evidence 11: Ron's Wallet & Evidence 12: Key Card**: Ron's wallet was found at KB Security on the night of the crime, not at the location of the statue, contrasting with Ron's claim about being at the scene of the crime as Mask☆DeMasque.
   - The mention of the blackmail and instructions for thefts (Evidence 10: Blackmail Letter and Evidence 20: Ron's Testimony) provides more background on his actual involvement but does not directly contradict the costume claim.
   - **Evidence 9: Security Camera Photo**: If this evidence shows another person in the Mask☆DeMasque suit or anything different from Ron's claims, it can offer a contradiction.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The contradiction lies with Ron's claim in Testimony 3 that he descended upon the scene of the crime as Mask☆DeMasque when his wallet (Evidence 11) suggests he was elsewhere.
   
Now, summarizing this analysis in the required JSON format:

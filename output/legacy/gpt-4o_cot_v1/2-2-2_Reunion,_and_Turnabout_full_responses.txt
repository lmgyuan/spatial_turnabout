To determine which evidence and testimony contradict each other, let's analyze each piece:

**Testimony 3:**
- "The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back." (Person: Gumshoe)

**Contradiction Analysis:**
- Gumshoe claims that the victim did not fight back. If the victim did not fight back, we would not expect to find evidence suggesting a struggle or defensive action, such as possession of a weapon by the victim.

**Relevant Evidence:**
- **Evidence 9 (Pistol):** This is the murder weapon and it belonged to Dr. Grey (the victim). It was found with both Maya’s and Dr. Grey’s fingerprints, suggesting Dr. Grey had a role in wielding it, possibly for self-defense or some other active involvement.

**Conclusion:**
- The presence of a pistol with the victim’s (Dr. Grey's) fingerprints contradicts the statement that the victim "was not fighting back." If he was holding the pistol at some point, it implies he was involved in the altercation.

Thus, **Evidence 9 (Pistol)** contradicts **Testimony 3**. 

The answer in JSON format is:

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To find contradictions between the evidence and testimony, we need to closely examine relevant details and compare them to the claims made in the testimony.

### Analyzing the Testimonies:

1. **Testimony from Gumshoe (Testimony 3):**
   - "The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed."

### Analyzing the Evidences:

1. **Evidence 8 - Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report:**
   - Describes that Dr. Grey was first stabbed in the chest and then shot in the forehead at point-blank range.
   - Gunpowder residue is around the bullet hole, indicating close proximity.

### Identifying the Contradiction:

- Gumshoe's testimony claims the victim took a shot while fighting but missed due to being too close.
- However, the autopsy report (Evidence 8) indicates that Dr. Grey was shot in the forehead at point-blank range, as indicated by gunpowder residue, meaning the shot could not have missed.
- Therefore, the gunshot from the victim was direct and did not miss, contradicting Gumshoe's testimony of a missed shot.

Thus, the evidence that contradicts Gumshoe’s third testimony is Evidence 8 (Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report).

{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 3}

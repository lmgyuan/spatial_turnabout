    "response": "To find the contradictions between the testimonies and the evidence, let's examine them step by step:\n\n1. **Testimonies from Gumshoe:**\n   - Gumshoe mentions a memo with Maya's name written in blood found at the scene.\n   - Gumshoe claims a lab test confirmed the blood was the victim's.\n   - Gumshoe also says blood was found on the victim's finger and the victim wrote the killer's name before dying.\n\n2. **Relevant Evidence:**\n   - *Mia's Autopsy Report* (Evidence 5) states that the death was caused by a single blunt force trauma and was instantaneous, although it mentions that the victim may have lived for a few minutes after being hit.\n\n3. **Contradiction Analysis:**\n   - If Mia died instantaneously or even after living a few minutes post-trauma (as evidenced by the autopsy report), it would be improbable for her to have written a note in blood, given the circumstances of her death.\n   - Gumshoe’s testimony about the victim writing in blood contradicts the autopsy report that indicates death was due to a blunt force trauma that was either instant or exceptionally quick.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction lies between the autopsy report and Gumshoe's testimony about the victim writing the killer’s name in blood.\n\nFinal JSON answer:\n```json\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 5}\n```",

Let's think step by step:",
    "response": "To find a contradiction, we need to examine the relevant testimonies and the corresponding pieces of evidence. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Examine April's Testimonies:**\n   - **Testimony 0:** She claims to have seen everything.\n   - **Testimony 1:** She states the victim dodged and ran to the right.\n   - **Testimony 2:** She notes the girl in hippie clothes (Maya) ran after the victim.\n   - **Testimony 3:** She asserts Maya hit the victim with the murder weapon.\n   - **Testimony 4:** She identifies the weapon as a statue-like clock, which she calls \"The Thinker.\"\n\n2. **Assess the Relevant Evidence:**\n   - **Evidence 1** (\"The Thinker\") is identified as the murder weapon in April's testimony. It's described as a clock that appears like a statue.\n   - **Evidence 5** (Mia's Autopsy Report) specifies that the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma and that death was instantaneous, though it notes that Mia may have lived for a few minutes after being hit.\n\n3. **Determine the Contradictions:**\n   - If Mia died instantly or almost instantly from one blow, this contradicts April's assertion in Testimony 3 that Maya chased Mia and then struck her, suggesting a more drawn-out sequence of events.\n   - Additionally, **Testimony 1** might be considered contradictory with the concept of an immediate cause of death, as dodging and running implies more time than an instantaneous or near-instantaneous death.\n\n4. **Select the Most Clear Contradiction:**\n   - **Testimony 3** conflicts directly with **Evidence 5** because it suggests Maya chased and then hit the victim with a weapon. However, the autopsy report indicates that Mia might have lived for a few minutes but does not support a scenario where she could have dodged or run away.\n\nGiven the direct contradiction between the assertion of a chase and multiple events leading up to the strike with Mia's potential to have lived for a short time but in a manner inconsistent with the description, this pair provides a clearer contradiction.\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 3}",

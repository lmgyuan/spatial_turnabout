Now, let's review the evidence related to Mask☆DeMasque and the items involved in the heists:\n   - **Evidence 4** (Sacred Urn): Described as \"One of the treasures of Kurain Village. Supposedly priceless, but has no monetary value.\"\n\nAccording to the testimony, Mask☆DeMasque targets the most precious art pieces, which implies items with high monetary value. However, the Sacred Urn, although presented as a treasure, is explicitly described in the evidence as having no monetary value. \n\nThis is a contradiction because the pattern described in the testimony does not match the nature of the item targeted in the evidence.\n\nHence, the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are:\n- **Evidence 4**: Sacred Urn (described as having no monetary value)\n- **Testimony 3**: Asserting Mask☆DeMasque always goes after \"the most precious art pieces.\"\n\nThe contradiction between these is clear: the Sacred Urn is not a high-value piece but was targeted by Mask☆DeMasque, opposing the pattern identified in Gumshoe's testimony.\n\n{\"evidence\": 4, \"testimony\": 3}",

    "response": "To find a contradiction, we should carefully examine the testimonies and cross-reference them with the evidence. The goal is to identify where the timeline or details in evidence provide a contradiction to what has been testified.\n\nLet's start with the testimonies from Luke Atmey:\n\n1. **Testimony 0 - Atmey:** Mentions the crime happened at approximately 1:00 AM.\n2. **Testimony 1 - Atmey:** States that Mask☆DeMasque appeared as his nemesis.\n3. **Testimony 2 - Atmey:** Claims he was struck on the head before he could turn around.\n4. **Testimony 3 - Atmey:** Says he could not respond because of the attack, and he blacked out.\n5. **Testimony 4 - Atmey:** States he notified the police 30 minutes later.\n\nNow, let’s look at relevant evidence that might contradict these testimonies:\n\n- **Evidence 6 (Shichishito):** Describes how DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head. This relates to testimony 2.\n- **Evidence 12 (Key Card):** Indicates that the key card was used at 1 AM for entering the KB Security CEO office.\n- **Evidence 15 (Kane's Autopsy Report):** States time of death of Kane Bullard as 1 AM.\n\nOne critical issue is with **Evidence 19 (Buzzer Record):** which states that the CEO office buzzer went off at 1:02 AM. According to Atmey's testimony 3, he claims he was attacked and then everything went dark until he woke up to use the emergency phone. If he was still unconscious after being attacked, he would not have activated the buzzer at 1:02 AM within those two minutes.\n\nThis contradicts Testimony 3 as it suggests Atmey would not have been able to do anything such as trigger a buzzer if he was knocked out. Yet, the buzzer was activated at 1:02 AM.\n\nThus, the contradiction can be identified as follows:\n\n{\"evidence\": 19, \"testimony\": 3}",

You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}.

    "response": "To determine which piece of evidence contradicts a specific testimony, let's analyze the provided testimonies and evidence. We're looking for a testimony that is clearly disproven or contradicted by some detail in the evidence.\n\nFirst, let's consider the testimonies by Ron:\n\n1. Ron claims, \"The truth is, I've been Mask☆DeMasque all along!\" However, we need clear evidence to contradict this broad claim.\n\n2. \"I mean, you can't prove that I'm not actually Mask☆DeMasque, can you?\" This is a challenge for proof but not a factual statement easily contradicted.\n\n3. \"I don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all!\" This implies that Ron was acting as Mask☆DeMasque on the night of the theft. We need to find evidence contradicting his claim of lacking an alibi.\n\n4. \"I donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!\" This defines his presence at the crime scene while disguised as Mask☆DeMasque.\n\n5. \"Look! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!\" This implies he's identified as Mask☆DeMasque in a photograph.\n\n6. \"As for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!\" This mentions a piece of his costume interacting physically with the environment.\n\nNow, evaluate the evidence:\n\n- Evidence 11: Ron's Wallet and Evidence 12: Key Card both indicate Ron's presence at the building of his part-time job, particularly mentioning the use of the key card to enter the KB Security CEO's office at 1 AM, the time of the crime.\n\n- Evidence 15: Kane's Autopsy Report shows the time of death also at 1 AM.\n\n- Evidence 19: Buzzer Record shows a buzzer activated at 1:02 AM in the CEO's office.\n\nRon claims not to have an alibi for when the urn was stolen, yet he was at KB Security at the crime's timeframe according to Evidence 12. This setup suggests a specific contradiction:\n\nRon claims he has no alibi (Testimony 2), but Evidence 12 shows he used his key card to enter the KB Security building at 1 AM. Therefore, the key card evidence contradicts his claim of having no alibi for the night the urn was stolen.\n\nThus, the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 12.\n\n{\"evidence\": 12, \"testimony\": 2}",

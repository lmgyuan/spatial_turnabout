To identify a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies, we need to examine the details provided in each piece of evidence and compare them to the statements made in the testimonies. Here's a breakdown to help us find a contradiction:

1. **Review Edgeworth's testimonies:**

   - Testimony 0: Edgeworth was in the courtroom to observe his father's trial.
   - Testimony 1: During their exit, an earthquake struck and trapped them in an elevator.
   - Testimony 2: Edgeworth's father and Mr. Yogi argued.
   - Testimony 3: Something heavy fell at Edgeworth's feet.
   - Testimony 4: Edgeworth picked it up and threw it at Mr. Yogi.
   - Testimony 5: There was a single gunshot followed by a scream.
   - Testimony 6: Edgeworth remembers the scream vividly.

2. **Examine relevant evidence:**

   - **DL-6 Case File (Evidence 18):** This states that the murder weapon was fired twice.

3. **Identify contradictions:**

   By comparing Testimony 5 (where Edgeworth remembers a single gunshot) with the DL-6 Case File (which indicates the gun was fired twice), we can see a clear contradiction. If the gun was fired twice, Edgeworth's recollection of a single gunshot cannot be accurate.

This analysis points to a contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 18.

To identify the contradiction between the evidence and the testimonies provided, let's review the information step by step:

1. **Review the Testimonies:**
   - Testimonies 0 and 3 state that "Oldbag" arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
   - Testimony 4 mentions being at the main gate from 1:00 PM until 5:00 PM.
   - Testimony 6 notes that "a certain man walked right by" at 2:00 PM.
   - Testimony 7 identifies this man as "Powers!" and that he was heading toward the studio.

2. **Review the Evidences:**
   - Evidence 5, Powers's(?) Photo, was taken at 2:00 PM and shows the Steel Samurai (Powers's costume) heading toward the studio, dragging one leg. 

3. **Cross-Examine:**
   - The key testimony here is Testimony 7, wherein Oldbag claims it was Powers who walked by her at 2:00 PM heading toward the studio.
   - Evidence 5, the photo taken at 2:00 PM, shows the Steel Samurai walking, but with the detail of dragging one leg, which may indicate that it was not necessarily Powers wearing the costume if he does not normally drag his leg.
   - Therefore, there is a contradiction between the testimony asserting it was clearly Powers and the photographic evidence which suggests it may not be him (an assumption can be made since Powers is not known to drag his leg, especially if there is no known injury or reason).

Therefore, the pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other is:
- **Testimony 7** ("It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!")
- **Evidence 5** (Powers's(?) Photo showing a possible impersonator, as the costume is seen dragging one leg)

The photo of the Steel Samurai would imply uncertainty about the identity of the person wearing the costume, contradicting Oldbag's confident claim that it was Powers.

**Conclusion:**
{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 7}
******************************
To find a contradiction between Oldbag's testimony and the evidence, we need to analyze the statements and see if any piece of evidence directly contradicts what Oldbag claimed to have seen or not seen.

Testimonies by Oldbag:
1. She states the time of death was 2:30 PM.
2. She saw Will Powers go to the studio.
3. No one else went there, except for Will Powers.
4. If anyone else had gone, she would have seen them.

Now, let's assess Evidence 5:

- Evidence 5: Powers'(?) Photo - A photo taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios. This photo was taken at 2 PM, showing the Steel Samurai (allegedly Will Powers) walking. However, crucially, the character is seen dragging one leg.

Next, let's consider Evidence 11:

- Evidence 11: Mr. Monkey's Head - This evidence states that the path was blocked between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.

Analyzing the testimonies and evidence:

- Oldbag's testimony states that no one else went to the studio and that she would have seen anyone who did. However, Evidence 11 shows that the path was blocked between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM by Mr. Monkey's Head. Therefore, Oldbag could not have had a clear view of anyone entering during that time, which includes the time frame just after the photo was taken and prior to the proclaimed time of death.

Hence, despite Oldbag's claim of seeing anybody entering the studio, the obstruction indicates that her line of sight would have been impeded between 2:15 and 4:00 PM, contradicting her testimony that she would have seen anyone entering.

Therefore, the contradiction is between:

- Evidence 11: Mr. Monkey's Head
- Testimony 3: Oldbag claims she would have seen anyone entering.

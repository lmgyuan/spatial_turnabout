To identify the contradiction between the evidence and testimony, we need to analyze the details of each relevant piece of evidence and testimony:

From Evidence:
- Evidence 10: Shichishito - The apparent murder weapon had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but it is mentioned it was not the murder weapon.
- Evidence 9: Victim's Staff - Carried by Elise Deauxnim has a hidden sword inside known only to Detective Gumshoe and the player.

From Testimonies:
- Testimony 3 by Iris: She claims that Elise threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe.

Analysis:
- If the Victim's Staff (Evidence 9) had a sword hidden inside, it is wrong for Iris to claim Elise threw away a staff and then pulled out a dagger. The statement implies two separate weapons when the staff itself could function as a weapon.

This is a clear contradiction, as the staff was capable of being used as a weapon with the sword inside, yet Iris claims there was a separate dagger being pulled.

Final Contradiction:
- Testimony 3 (iris claims) contradicts with the function of the Victim's Staff (Evidence 9).

******************************
To find a contradiction, we need to closely examine the evidence and testimonies related to the murder of Elise Deauxnim.

1. **Testimonies by Iris:** Iris's testimonies (0-4) describe a sequence of events where Mystic Maya is involved in a physical altercation with Mystic Elise. 
   - Testimony 0: Mystic Maya is hit over the head with a staff.
   - Testimony 1: Maya dodges an attack and takes Elise's weapon.
   - Testimony 2: Elise is on the defensive, with her back to a stone lantern.
   - Testimony 3: Mystic Maya stabs Mystic Elise.
   - Testimony 4: Elise flings the knife away before collapsing.

2. **Evidence:**
   - **Victim's Staff (Evidence 9):** Elise Deauxnim carried a staff that contains a hidden sword. Only Detective Gumshoe and the protagonist know this.
   - **Shichishito (Evidence 10):** Has Elise's blood and the suspect’s fingerprints, but it is not the murder weapon.
   - **Elise's Autopsy Report (Evidence 11):** Indicates death due to a stab in the back and that her body fell 10 feet after her death.
   - **Stone Lantern (Evidence 20):** A stone lantern was present in the area where Iris claims the attack occurred. It was not lit the night of the crime.

3. **Review the Testimonies and Evidence for Contradictions:**
   - **Iris's Testimony 3:** "That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!" suggests Maya stabbed Elise.
   - **Elise's Autopsy Report (Evidence 11):** States the cause of death was a stab in the back, whereas Iris's testimonies imply a front confrontation, suggesting a contradiction.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Iris’s claim that Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise and the autopsy report detailing the stabbing in Elise’s back. This suggests the narrative in the testimony does not line up with the medical evidence.

******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, we'll examine the specific content of both. Here's the process step-by-step:

1. **Reviewing the testimonies:**
   - Testimony 0: Iris mentions calling out to Mystic Maya after Mystic Elise died.
   - Testimony 1: Iris felt it was her duty to protect the future Master of the Kurain Tradition.
   - Testimony 2: Iris claims to have removed the body from the Inner Temple by herself.
   - Testimony 3: Iris says she dragged the body across Dusky Bridge.
   - Testimony 4: Iris mentions using a snowmobile to carry the body back to Hazakura Temple.
   - Testimony 5: Iris confesses to using the Shichishito to alter how the wound appeared.
   - Testimony 6: Iris states that the murder occurred after the snow had stopped.

2. **Analyzing the evidence:**
   - Evidence 3: There's a map of Hazakura Temple.
   - Evidence 7: The Weather Data shows snow from 7 till approximately 10:50 PM, and lightning strikes from 10 to approx. 11 PM.
   - Other evidence includes items like victim's belongings, other people's testimonies, and more context about the area and the crime.

3. **Finding contradictions:**
   - Notably, Testimony 6 states that the murder took place after the snow had stopped. However, the Weather Data (Evidence 7) indicates that snow stopped at approximately 10:50 PM. 
   - Testimony 3 involves dragging the body across Dusky Bridge. If snow only stopped shortly before the fire incident at Dusky Bridge (Lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45, with a fire occurring shortly after), then the logistics of dragging a body during ceased snow and active lightning seem improbable.

4. **Checking back with testimonies and evidence:**
   - The contradiction is mainly observable between Testimony 6 (a specific statement about the weather) and the Weather Data in Evidence 7 which covers the detailed weather timelines, making it factually impossible to accomplish dragging the body as claimed with the weather events described.

In conclusion, Testimony 6 by Iris, stating "By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped," contradicts the Weather Data (Evidence 7), because the murder had to occur when it was snowing, as per the timeline.

******************************
In order to find a contradiction between the evidence and the testimonies, let's go through them systematically.

Firstly, let's look at Maya's testimonies and find any elements that may contradict the provided evidences.

1. Testimony 0: "I was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened."
   - This testimony sets the scene in the garden.

2. Testimony 1: "Suddenly, someone struck me over the head..."
   - Indicates an attack took place.

3. Testimony 2: "I stumbled... and ended up against the stone lantern."
   - Maya interacts with the stone lantern.

4. Testimony 3: "I think I screamed, 'Help me!'"
   - Maya calls for help. We need to check if there is any location constraint or evidence about environmental conditions that could contradict Maya's ability to scream or being heard.

5. Testimony 4: "I could see a man behind my attacker by the light of the stone lantern."
   - This implies the stone lantern was providing light, a critical detail.

6. Testimony 5: "Then something warm splashed over me..."
   - This is vague in terms of physical evidence but implies close proximity to some source of warmth or liquid.

7. Testimony 6: "That's when... I lost consciousness."
   - Maya eventually loses consciousness which follows logically from previous events.

Now, let's examine the relevant evidence:

- **Evidence 20 (Stone Lantern):** A lantern from the Inner Temple garden. Was not lit the night of the crime.
  
On comparing Testimony 4 “I could see a man behind my attacker by the light of the stone lantern.” with Evidence 20 "Stone Lantern: Was not lit the night of the crime.", we see the contradiction. Maya claims to see someone by the light of the lantern, but the evidence explicitly states the lantern was not lit, making it impossible for her to have seen someone by this light.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Maya's Testimony 4 and Evidence 20, the Stone Lantern.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 4}
******************************
To find the contradiction between the evidence and the testimony, we need to carefully analyze both the testimonies and the evidence provided.

Let's first look at the specific pieces of evidence and testimony:

1. **Maya's Testimony 3**: 
   - "The torches were lit... And the body was gone."

2. **Evidence 20**: Stone Lantern 
   - "A lantern from the Inner Temple garden. Was not lit the night of the crime."

There's a clear contradiction here. Maya's testimony mentions that the torches were lit, suggesting that there was light in the garden or around the area where the crime occurred. However, the Stone Lantern evidence specifically states that the lantern was not lit the night of the crime. This contradiction implies that Maya's statement about the lighting during the crime may not be accurate.

Thus, the contradiction is between Maya's Testimony 3 and Evidence 20 (Stone Lantern).

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To find the contradiction, let's first check the available testimonies from Maya and the evidences:

1. **Testimony 0** - Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night.
2. **Testimony 1** - The next morning, she looked around, but couldn't find anyone.
3. **Testimony 2** - The next day, when the bridge was finally fixed, she was in the spare prep room.
4. **Testimony 3** - That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!
5. **Testimony 4** - He found Pearly first, and cheered her right up!

We want to analyze Testimony 3 wherein Maya mentioned that Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time on the next day. This indicates the first time he came to the Inner Temple after the bridge was fixed. 

Now, let's identify any evidence that might contradict this claim:

Looking at the **Weather Data (Evidence 7)**:
- The weather report notes that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM, with 30 minutes passing between the fire starting and going out. 
- This evidence suggests Dusky Bridge was unusable during the night of the crime because of the lightning and ensuing fire, and according to the testimonies, it wasn't fixed until the day after the crime.

Reviewing the **Tracks Photo (Evidence 14)**:
- This evidence indicates that someone traveled from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge on the night of the crime, suggesting possible movement across the bridge before it was fixed.

Thus, the contradiction likely lies with evidence that suggests Mr. Godot or someone else might have visited the Inner Temple during the night (before the bridge was fixed), contrary to Maya's testimony that he arrived for the first time after its repair.

The contradiction strongly relates to **Tracks Photo (Evidence 14)** suggesting movement to the Inner Temple before the bridge was restored, hence challenging Maya's claim about Mr. Godot arriving there for the first time only after the repair.

Therefore, **Evidence 14** (Tracks Photo) and **Testimony 3** (Mr. Godot's first arrival) hold the contradiction.

This would undermine White's claim regarding visible action to the left, contradicting testimony about the layout and possible movement.\n\nThus, the contradiction can be found between these two, with the testimony and evidence suggesting impossible movement visibility.\n\n{\"evidence\": 8, \"testimony\": 8}",

That is what I saw.\n- **Testimony 3**: Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.\n- **Testimony 4**: You chased her and delivered the final blow.\n- **Testimony 5**: That is what Miss May saw.\n- **Testimony 6**: You see? You hit her twice!\n\n### Key Evidence Analysis:\n- **Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report)**: States the Time of Death as 9/5 at 9:00 PM, from a single blunt force trauma, and while death was instantaneous, she may have lived for a few minutes after being hit.\n\n### Contradiction Analysis:\n- **Mia's Autopsy Report** clearly states that there was a single blow, meaning she was only hit once. \n- **Testimony 6** by White contradicts this because he claims the victim was hit twice.\n\nGiven this contradiction between White's testimony and the autopsy report, these are the pair that don't align.\n\nTherefore, our answer would be:\n\n```json\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 6}\n```",

    "response": "To find contradictions between testimony and evidence, let's analyze both carefully. We need to identify discrepancies in the details between what is described in the testimonies and what is reported in the evidence.\n\nFirst, let's revisit the testimony by White:\n\n- Testimony 0: White claims he looked at another window when he heard something fall.\n- Testimony 1: He describes seeing a light stand on the floor.\n- Testimony 2: Describes Mia running to the left.\n- Testimony 3: Claims the killer attacked Mia, but Mia dodged.\n- Testimony 4: Mia supposedly turned and ran for the door.\n- Testimony 5: Claims the killer delivered a single blow resulting in Mia’s death.\n\nNow, let's compare these with the evidence:\n\n- Evidence 5: Mia's Autopsy Report – States the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, death was instantaneous, though it mentions she may have lived for a few minutes after being hit, but there isn't an account of numerous attacks or dodging before the fatal blow.\n  \n- Evidence 9: May Testimony – Differently mentions “the victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck.”\n\n- Evidence 8: Floor Plans – The fact the stand is blocked from view looking from the office might contradict anyone outside seeing the event clearly, especially from a hotel, indicating potential lying about witnessing the attack.\n\nGiven these, Testimony 3 by White claims that Mia dodged a blow, but according to the autopsy report (Evidence 5), there was a single fatal blow, and there’s an implication in the evidence that no multiple dodging or blows were involved in the murder scenario. White says she dodged before being struck, but there is no indication in the autopsy of a struggle indicative of dodging.\n\nTherefore, a contradiction exists between the testimony of White where he describes actions before the fatal blow which the autopsy doesn't support.\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 3}",

To find a contradiction between the provided testimony and evidence, let's first analyze the important details.

### Key Evidence:
1. **Evidence 5:** Mia's Autopsy Report:
   - Cause of death: Single blunt force trauma.
   - Death was instantaneous, although there is an implication she may have lived for a few minutes after being hit.

2. **Evidence 9:** May Testimony:
   - "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck."

### Key Testimonies:
1. **Testimony 8** by White:
   - "The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!"

### Contradiction Analysis:
- ***Testimony 8 (White)*** claims that the victim ran to the left.
- ***Evidence 9 (May Testimony)*** states that the victim ran to the right.

These two points are in direct contradiction regarding the direction in which the victim ran after the initial attack.

Thus, the contradiction is between **May's Testimony** (Evidence 9) and **White's Testimony 8**.

Here's the answer in the specified format:

```json
{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 8}
```
******************************
To identify a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, we need to carefully compare the content of each piece of evidence against each testimony.

Let's start by examining evidence that includes something related to the sequence of events at the crime scene:

1. **Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report):**  
   - It mentions that the death was from a single blunt force trauma. While it states that death was instantaneous, it also suggests Mia may have lived for a few minutes after being hit.
   
2. **Evidence 9 (May Testimony):**  
   - This is about the victim dodging an attack, running to the right, but being caught and struck.

Now, let's look at testimonies involving the murder sequence:

- **Testimony 1 (by White):**  
  - States that when the defendant assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left.

- **Testimony 3 (by White):**  
  - Indicates that next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right. 

- **Testimony 6 (by White):**  
  - Asserts that the victim was hit twice.

Contradiction Analysis:

- **Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report):**
  - Testimony 3 suggests movement indicating Mia was conscious and moving after the first blow, potentially similar to Evidence 9 (May Testimony). However, Testimony 3 describes her running to the right with the final bit of her strength.
  - According to Evidence 5, Mia was struck just once, and she may have been able to live for a few minutes, but a "running" scenario contradicts the severity suggested by the singular, fatal blow described in Evidence 5.

Given this examination, the contradiction lies between Testimony 6 (indicating two hits) and Evidence 5 (indicating a single blunt force trauma).

Final Conclusion:

- The autopsy report indicates Mia was killed with a single blow, contradicting White's testimony which claims there was more than one blow to Mia.

The contradiction relevant here is: 

**Testimony 6 by White** â€“ "You see? You hit her twice!" does not match with **Evidence 5 - Mia's Autopsy Report**, which records one single blunt force trauma as the cause of death.

Therefore, the pair that clearly contradict each other is:

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 6}
******************************
To find the contradiction between the evidence and the testimony, let's analyze the testimonies and the evidences associated with the case. We are given a series of testimonies from Redd White and pieces of evidence from the crime scene.

**Goal**: Identify a contradiction between one testimony and one piece of evidence.

**Examining the Testimonies by Redd White**:
1. Testimony 0: Mentions hearing something fall and looking towards the window.
2. Testimony 1: Points to seeing a light stand on the floor.
3. Testimony 2: Claims seeing Miss Mia run to the left.
4. Testimony 3: Says the killer attacked, but Mia dodged.
5. Testimony 4: Describes Mia running for the door.
6. Testimony 5: Indicates a final blow was delivered.

**Examining the Evidences**:
- **Evidence 5: Mia's Autopsy Report**: The report highlights death was likely due to a single blunt force trauma. It specifies that Mia might have lived for a few minutes after being hit, but suggests the final blow was crucial.
- **Evidence 8: Floor Plans**: Indicate blocked views from certain angles, specifically mentioning how something could block a view looking from the office, which might challenge witness testimony.
- **Evidence 9: May Testimony**: Describes Mia's actions in a similar way to Redd White's account: dodging, running, and being caught.

**Analyzing Potential Contradiction**:
- Redd White's testimonies, notably Testimony 3, indicate a scenario where Mia dodged an attack. This details movement and implies a struggle before the final blow was delivered.
- Examining **Evidence 5: Mia's Autopsy Report**, it suggests the final blow was the main cause of death, with only a slight possibility she lingered for a little while after. This can complicate the story of multiple encounters (dodging and then a final blow).
- If Mia was indeed bludgeoned in a manner that was "instantaneous" or significantly disabling, a detailed, dodging-filled narrative may not match the autopsy findings.
  
Upon reviewing:
- **Testimony 3 by White** ("The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged.") implies a sequence before a fatal blow.
- **Evidence 5: Mia's Autopsy Report** suggests the fatal blow was decisive, and while she might have survived moments after, an elaborate dodging scenario might be less viable.

Thus, Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 5.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To identify the contradiction between the evidence and testimony, let's break down the information given:

1. **Testimony 3: White** claims that he entered the Fey & Co. Law Offices to place a wiretap and that is when he saw the glass light stand.

2. **Evidence 3: Receipt** shows that a glass light stand was purchased the day before the murder.

The contradiction here is:

- White claims he saw the glass light stand while placing the wiretap at some point before the murder. However, the light stand was purchased only the day before the murder, making it impossible for White to have seen it during the initial wiretap placement, which would have likely occurred in advance of the murder to gather information prior to the event.

Thus, **Testimony 3** given by White contradicts **Evidence 3** the Receipt for the glass light stand due to the timeline inconsistency.

Here's the JSON with the contradiction:

```json
{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 3}
```

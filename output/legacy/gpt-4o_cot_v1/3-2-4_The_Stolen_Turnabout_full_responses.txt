To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies, given the provided details, let's sequentially analyze each piece of evidence and testimonial claims step-by-step.

1. **Review of the Evidence and Testimonies:**
   - **Evidence 5** (DeMasque's Calling Card): This card was specifically sent concerning the "Treasures of Kurain" exhibit stating the thief would come for the Sacred Urn.
   - **Testimony 3** by Atmey states: "I knew it was an extremely valuable treasure, so I sent my card 10 days beforehand."

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The sending of a card is usually significant and specific to a heist. It reflects prior knowledge and planning regarding the treasure targeted.
   - Atmey claims he sent the card knowing it was an extremely valuable treasure (implying knowledge of its value), yet in his earlier testimonies, he states he didn't see the urn himself until the day of the crime (Testimony 2).
   - There is an inconsistency if Atmey sent the card on the basis of the urn's value without having seen it or verified its particulars personally against the claim that he handled things smoothly (Testimony 4).

3. **Identifying Contradictions:**
   - **Evidence 5**, DeMasque's Calling Card, shows clear intention and foreknowledge about the specific target of the heist (the "speckled urn").
   - **Testimony 3** states the intent and timing (10 days beforehand), which needs a basis in understanding or verifying the value beyond speculation. This doesn't align with Testimony 2, where Atmey mentions being unable even to see the urn firsthand till later.

4. **Conclusion:**
   Thus, the contradiction specifically highlights that sending a card with assuredness about the urn's value contrasts with the notion of not witnessing it until much later.

**Resolution:**
We may conclude that **Testimony 3** by Atmey claiming he sent the card knowing about its extreme value and sending it "10 days beforehand" doesn't align logically with **Evidence 5** where DeMasque detailed specifics of the calling card. The card indicating specific knowledge contradicts Atmey's testimonial claims to seeing it significantly later, without providing how he assessed its value to send the notice.
   
Thus, the contradicted pair is between Testimony 3 by Atmey and Evidence 5 (DeMasque’s Calling Card).

******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, we need to scrutinize the information provided closely.

Let’s look at the testimonies from Atmey and see if any of them directly conflict with the evidence:

1. **Testimony 0:** "I, Luke Atmey, had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever." 
   
   We don't have evidence about contact between Atmey and Bullard directly, so keep this aside.

2. **Testimony 1:** "Kane Bullard decided to investigate Mask DeMasque and simply mistook who he was!"
   
   This doesn't directly contradict the evidence.

3. **Testimony 2:** "It was Mr. Bullard who wrote the blackmail letter and sent it to Ron DeLite."
   
   Evidence 10 (Blackmail Letter) aligns with this statement, showing Bullard as the author.

4. **Testimony 3:** "And it was again Mr. Bullard who harbored a grudge against Mr. DeLite for his betrayal!"
   
   We need to find if there's evidence suggesting Bullard actually harbored a grudge. But the evidence we have shows Bullard blackmailed DeLite rather, which can coincide with holding a grudge (seeking money in exchange for silence).

5. **Testimony 4:** "Mr. Bullard's mistake is quite excusable. The defendant truly believes he is Mask DeMasque."
   
   Evidence that DeLite was acting under a different guise or identity might relate to this.

6. **Testimony 5:** "That is why Mr. DeLite saw it fit to kill Kane Bullard. Truly a tragedy..."

   Here, Atmey is saying DeLite killed Bullard. We compare this with evidence around the time and place of death to find a contradiction. 

Step-by-step focus:
- **Evidence 10** (Blackmail Letter) ties DeLite to a known meeting with Bullard on the night of October 12 at 1 AM.
- **Evidence 15** (Kane's Autopsy Report) states Bullard's time of death at 1 AM from blunt trauma, making it possible for DeLite to be involved.
- **Evidence 19** (Buzzer Record) states the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM, adding another layer to the timeline.
- **Evidence 12** (Key Card) is used to access Bullard's office and confirms DeLite may have been there.
- **Evidence 17** (CEO Office Buzzer): Used with the **Evidence 19** showing the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM on October 12.

Upon examining **Testimony 0:** "I, Luke Atmey, had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever."
- **Evidence 7:** The camera data states the warehouse camera went off at 1 AM (the crime time), and if Atmey was there (related to DeMasque, Warehouse heist, etc.), this creates contradiction or involvement.
   
However another angle finds:
**Testimony 5:** "That is why Mr. DeLite saw it fit to kill Kane Bullard. Truly a tragedy…"

This may not directly contradict with the time sequence of all actions.

Nevertheless, the contradiction:
Between **Testimony 5** and the lack of any compelling direct evidence showing DeLite’s intent and commitment to the murder at that same moment without acknowledging the potential conflict presence by others or direct evidence.

Let's formulate this:
- **Testimony 5** claims DeLite "saw it fit to kill Kane Bullard," which implies motive beyond Measure.
- **Evidence 20 (Ron’s Testimony):** Is that DeLite was performing heists based on blackmail. Hence, shall explain it was under duress or not purely for intention of murder.

Between testimony of intention (based on hearsay) against a known position as subject to blackmail, Grants an immediate conflict inferred between accounts of various elements between testimonies:

After careful consideration, the conflict can be paired between another frame-work.
Inspect Atmey’s further proposition over general perception:

- **Testimony 0 & 5:** specific to potential non-involvement vs. assertive suspension of intent w/ juxtapose:

We must conclude between Tenry Body:
- Uncovering synthesis abrogation between indirect admission towards activities perched under unrelated blackmail.

Ultimately attributing regional identification:
Testimony versus Alleged Affairs of one Ron DeLite Per Image & Structural Lackey Per Letterhead brings forth undisrupted conjunctural flaw in effect.

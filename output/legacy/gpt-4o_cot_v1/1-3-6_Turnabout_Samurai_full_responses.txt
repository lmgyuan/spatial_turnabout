To identify a contradiction between the evidence and the testimonies, we'll need to carefully match what each piece of evidence suggests against the statements provided in the testimonies.

First, let’s summarize some key pieces of evidence:

1. **Evidence 11 - Mr. Monkey's Head**: This evidence indicates there was a blockage in the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.

2. **Evidence 18 - Van**: This evidence states that Sal Manella used this van to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer.

Next, let’s examine some key testimonies from Vasquez:

- Testimony 1 states the meeting ended at 4:00 PM.
- Testimony 3 states: "I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me."

Now, let's identify contradictions:

- If Vasquez’s testimony indicates she needed to be driven to Studio One by Sal Manella after the meeting (Testimony 3) because she was fatigued, this suggests it could have happened after the meeting ended at 4:00 PM.
  
- However, Evidence 11 shows that Mr. Monkey's Head was blocking the path from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. This means they couldn’t have driven that way during or immediately after the meeting (if it supposedly ended at 4:00 PM).

- There is indeed a contradiction here because if they went right after the meeting at 4:00 PM, the path would have been blocked until 4:00 PM, making immediate transit impossible. This suggests the evidence and testimonial statements don't align.

Thus, the contradiction is between Vasquez's claim that she was taken by Sal immediately after 4:00 PM and the evidence of a blocked path by Mr. Monkey’s Head from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM.

Therefore, the contradicting pair is:

Testimony 3 (Vasquez needing to be taken to Studio One) and Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head blocking the path until 4:00 PM).

******************************
To identify a contradiction between the evidences and testimonies provided, we need to scrutinize the content of both, looking for inconsistencies that suggest falsehood or error. Here are some relevant findings:

1. **Testimony 3 by Vasquez**: She states that the "security lady, Oldbag, was quite agitated. Pointing at Powers, saying 'he did it!'" This suggests that Powers was present at the scene when the body was discovered. This also links Oldbag, the security lady, to having been there.

2. **Evidence 11 - Mr. Monkey's Head**: The report about Mr. Monkey's head indicates that it blocked the path to the scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. This would have made access to and from the crime scene during this time quite difficult or even impossible.

For the contradiction:
- If Powers had to cross the path where Mr. Monkey's head blocked the way between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, it wouldn't have been possible for him to go through without obstruction or notice.
- The photo in Evidence 5 also suggests Powers (or someone dressed as him) was moving at 2:00 PM, which could place someone by the crime scene at around the described time, suggesting a discrepancy given access issues.

However, the contradiction here lies more specifically in the sequence and ability to interact with the crime scene spanning from access problems caused by the Monkey's head to no implications of any scenario in Vasquez's testimonies accounting for these access issues. Since she claims to have moved back to the trailer and did not acknowledge any timing or access concern, her testimony indirectly assumes unrestricted access, conflicting with the access restriction created by the fallen Monkey's head.

Given the descriptions, I will decide that the photograph (Powers')(?) Photo with timing (2:00 PM) (Evidence 5) conflicts with the aftermath activity claim in Testimony 3 regarding the simplicity of circumstances immediately after the crime.

In contradiction, the simplest indicates that Testimony 3 claims Powers' presence at the discovery despite access blockage logic.

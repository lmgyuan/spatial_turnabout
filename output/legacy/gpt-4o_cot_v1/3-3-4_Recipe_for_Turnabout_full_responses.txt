Let's examine each piece of evidence and testimony to find any contradictions.

**Testimony Analysis:**

1. **Testimony 0:** La mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.
   - Armstrong is indicating the mirror divides the restaurant, suggesting visibility may be limited.

2. **Testimony 1:** Z'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.
   - Armstrong specifies there's a particular vantage point from which the victim could be seen.

3. **Testimony 2:** Z'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.
   - Armstrong suggests that Victor Kudo was the only one with a view of the victim.

4. **Testimony 3:** After la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.
   - Armstrong admits to moving the mirror after the incident to no longer obstruct the way.

5. **Testimony 4:** But naturally, I did not touch anything else!
   - Armstrong claims he only moved the mirror and did nothing else to the scene.

**Evidence Analysis:**

1. **Evidence 12 (Crime Photo):** The crime photo shows two dining tables, a folding screen separating them, and certain conditions at the tables.
    - The photo seems to not include a clear image of Armstrong moving a mirror.
    - The photo shows a coffee cup spilled and stained tablecloth, but makes no mention of a mirror being moved.

**Finding the Contradiction:**

By looking at testimony 3, Armstrong claims he moved the mirror after the incident so it was not in the way, while also implying that he didn't touch anything else. This seems to contradict the presentation of the scene in **Evidence 12 (Crime Photo),** where the focus is on the tables, screen, and lack of a moved mirror. Specifically, the testimony suggests interaction with the crime scene, which is not reflected in the crime photo that suggests a pristine snapshot at the time of the crime, without mention of mirror movement.

Thus, the critical contradiction lies between Armstrong's testimony of moving the mirror (Testimony 3) and the Crime Photo’s evidence (Evidence 12) that doesn't support this action being noted, suggesting tampering or an inaccurate testimony depicting a change that is unreflected.

Therefore the contradicting pair is:

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies, let's closely analyze each provided piece of evidence and testimony.

First, let's look at Armstrong's testimonies:
- Testimony 0: He states that Glen Elg came to the restaurant alone.
- Testimony 1: Armstrong mentions an old man (likely Victor Kudo) arriving not long after Glen Elg.
- Testimony 2: He specifies that the old man arrived just after 2 PM.
- Testimony 3: Armstrong claims there were no other customers.
- Testimony 4: Armstrong says Glen Elg became excited after hearing about winning the lottery.
- Testimony 5: Armstrong narrates that approximately 5 minutes later, the poisoning incident occurred.
- Testimony 6: He asserts there was no time for a phony to act.

Now, looking into the evidence, let's search for a contradiction with these testimonies:
- Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) is a critical piece. It describes the scene, showing two dining tables, and notes that there is no one sitting across from Glen Elg, but there is a folding screen, which implies limited visibility in the dining area.
  
Armstrong's Testimony 3 states there were no other customers. This statement is directly contradicted by Victor Kudo's presence according to his note "Convicted before, a wicked man or woman" (Evidence 9), and corroborated by Armstrong's own Testimony 1. This suggests the restaurant was not empty aside from Glen Elg, as Armstrong later contradicts this in Testimony 3 by saying there are no other customers when the testimonies mentioned another person. 

Additionally, Victor Kudo's Testimony (Evidence 18: "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry.") contradicts Armstrong's Testimony 3 because it shows there was indeed at least one other person (Kudo) there and something happening involving him (breaking a vase), which goes against the claim that Glen Elg was alone.

Therefore, Armstrong's statement that there were no other customers conflicts with the presence of another witness, Victor Kudo, during the incident.

Let's write the answer in JSON format indicating this contradiction:

******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies, let's analyze the details.

1. **Tigre's Testimonies**: 
   - **Testimony 0**: Tigre claims ignorance about the murder.
   - **Testimony 1**: Busy with business in his office in December last year.
   - **Testimony 2**: Claims to be in the office on the day of the incident and never saw the victim.
   - **Testimony 3**: States that Tender Lender has people lined up to borrow cash every day.
   - **Testimony 4**: Suggests verifying his alibi with Violetta.

2. **Looking for Contradictory Evidence**:
   - **Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar)**: Specifies a meeting with "The Tiger" (Furio Tigre) on December 3rd, the day of the incident.
   - **Evidence 8 (Jean's Loan Contract)**: Shows Jean Armstrong owes money to Tender Lender, hinting at business dealings.
   - **Evidence 25 (Repair Bill)** and **Evidence 27 (Viola's Medical Papers)**: Relate to financial transactions and demands related to Tigre but not directly contradicting his daily cash flow claim.
   
3. **Identifying Contradictions**:
   - Testimony 3 claims that there are borrowers every single day, while Evidence 20 directly refutes Testimony 2, showing Tigre had a meeting with the victim, Glen Elg. 
   - The contradiction we're looking for could involve the frequency or nature of business dealings (every single day vs. specific notable meetings).

Considering the contradiction:
- Tigre claims that there are cash line-ups "every single day" at Tender Lender, insinuating no need for specific meetings, but Evidence 23 (MC Bomber), found at Tender Lender, contains a computer virus program. This can be seen in contradiction to Tigre's claim about business since finding a virus doesn't align with standard lending operations suggesting other illegal activities.

Thus, the more direct contradiction is between Tigre's testimony regarding business nature and the discovery of Evidence 23.
  
**Conclusion**: The contradiction lies between Tigre's testimony 3 about cash loans and Evidence 23 that hints at other non-lending activities happening at the Tender Lender location, implying illegitimate operations rather than standard borrower "whales".

{"evidence": 23, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To find a contradiction between a piece of evidence and a testimony, we need to compare the given testimonies with evidence details to uncover inconsistencies. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Testimony 3 by Tigre:** Tigre claims, "I waited around for him, but he ain't ever showed." This suggests that Tigre is claiming Glen Elg did not show up for a meeting.

2. **Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar):** This piece of evidence states that on December 3rd, the date of the incident, Glen Elg had a note saying, "Meet with The Tiger." This note suggests that Glen was supposed to meet with Tigre (nicknamed 'The Tiger').

3. **Evidence 3 (Sports Paper):** The sports paper belongs to Glen Elg and was left in Tres Bien on the day of the incident, corroborating his presence there. Additionally, the evidence ties Tigre to the poison (provided inadvertently by the MC Bomber connection to his loan company and the bid to erase the evidence of debt), hinting at indirect involvement.

Comparing all the elements, Tigre's claim of Glen not attending could be a cover-up given Glen was murdered. The contradiction notably stems from the facilitation of the meeting at Tres Bien rather than Tender Lender, as Tigre may have denied being there to avoid implication in the crime.

Upon careful examination and prioritizing evidence placement (proving Tigre's lie about Glen not showing up as opposed to any implications of Tigre's actual location):

- The contradiction lies directly between Glen's Calendar (Evidence 20) that confirms the meeting and Testimony 3 by Tigre, denying such a meeting ever took place.

Therefore, the calendar entry proves the meeting was scheduled, directly contradicting Tigre's testimony about the interaction never occurring.

  "testimony": 3

******************************
To solve this puzzle, we need to identify contradictions between the evidences and the testimonies given by the characters. Contradictions can arise when a piece of evidence reveals that a testimony is false or misleading.

First, let's analyze each component of Tigre's testimonies:

1. **Testimony 0**: Tigre says he was supposed to meet with Glen Elg at the restaurant.
2. **Testimony 1**: He mentioned the scene he observed upon entering the restaurant.
3. **Testimony 2**: He described Glen Elg as already being laid out over the table.
4. **Testimony 3**: Said he left because he figured the place was going to be 'hot'.
5. **Testimony 4**: Claims he heard police sirens on his way out and went back to his office.

Next, we will assess the relevance of the evidences provided:

1. **Evidence 10 - Glen's Autopsy Report**: States that Glen died from potassium cyanide poisoning between 1:30 and 2:30 PM.
2. **Evidence 14 - Victim's Lottery Ticket**: Found on Maggey, seemingly out of context but important in some narratives.
3. **Evidence 17 - Victim's Prescription Bag**: Shows Glen had medical prescriptions before the event.
4. **Evidence 20 - Glen's Calendar**: Notes a meeting with "The Tiger" scheduled for Dec. 3rd, corroborating Testimony 0.
5. **Evidence 19 - Millionaire Radio Flyer**: This is a crucial piece mentioning a radio broadcast every Monday at 1:30 PM, coinciding with the time of the murder.

Analyzing Testimony 3: Tigre claims he "figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split."

- Evidence 19 (Millionaire Radio Flyer) suggests the "Millionaire" show broadcasted around 1:30 PM every Monday. This timing is crucial because if Tigre was present during this broadcast, his claim of quickly leaving due to 'heat' is in question since the timing is precisely at or before when the murder took place.

Therefore, the step-by-step examination aligns Evidence 19 with Testimony 3. The contradiction lies in Tigre's claim of fleeing due to increasing 'heat', yet the murder coincides with the timing of the show, which suggests premeditated presence or intent not to flee quickly.

Here is the answer in the required JSON format:

{"evidence": 19, "testimony": 3}
******************************
Let's examine each piece of evidence and testimony to identify contradictions:

1. **Testimony from Tigre**: 
    - Testimony 0: Tigre loaned Glen Elg $100,000.
    - Testimony 1: Tigre was set to meet Elg because it was payback time.
    - Testimony 2: Elg couldn't pay back the loan.
    - Testimony 3: Before Tigre could react, Elg started screaming he had won half a million bucks.
    - Testimony 4: Elg got lucky with a lottery ticket.
    - Testimony 5: This implies something the waitress (Maggey) did affected the situation.
    - Testimony 6: Tigre's business with Elg ended due to something the waitress did.
    - Testimony 7: Tigre claims the only reason to kill Elg was for $100,000.

2. **Evidence Related to Tigre's Testimonies**:
    - **Evidence 14**: Victim's Lottery Ticket: shows Elg had a winning ticket for half a million dollars.
    - **Evidence 20**: Glen's Calendar: On Dec. 3rd, there is a note saying, "Meet with The Tiger".
    - **Evidence 23**: MC Bomber: a virus program indicating other potential motives.
    - **Evidence 21**: Losing Horse Racing Tickets: indicates financial trouble but not directly connected to Tigre’s actions or motive.
    - **Evidence 16**: Potassium Cyanide: This shows Maggey's fingerprints but may not be directly related to Tigre’s intent, unless we tie the murder method to someone's motive.

**Identifying a Contradiction:**

- In **Testimony 3**, Tigre claims Glen Elg starts screaming he won half a million dollars right before anything else happens, implying this information is freshly known to Tigre.

- However, **Evidence 14** (Victim's Lottery Ticket) supports that Glen indeed had a winning ticket, which should resolve the debt Elg had with Tigre, suggesting that this surprise reaction alone from Elg shouldn't lead to Tigre intending to harm him. 

- However, the real contradiction seems most likely related to Tigre's claim in **Testimony 3** about flattening Elg upon the lottery revelation, while his persistent focus on $100,000 (as in Testimony 7) does not account for the larger prize Elg had just claimed publicly.

- Specifically, Tigre insists they had no further business after Maggey's action (Testimony 6), conflicting with **Evidence 14** indicating a larger business transaction potential due to the lottery win, which would offer Tigre more motive than just the $100,000 cover-up.

Given these evaluations, **Evidence 16** (Potassium Cyanide) with Maggey's fingerprints and **Testimony 5** (implying Maggey's action as a problem) show the contradictions in Tigre’s statement that he focused only on $100,000 when clearly the lottery ticket implies financial dealings far beyond that, and it wouldn't pivot around Maggey’s involvement affecting Tigre's actions when money far exceeding $100,000 was in play.

Thus, evidence 16 contradicts Tigre’s testimony, specifically testimony 5, not because they align, but because the involvement of poison suggests murder was premeditated and unrelated to Maggey, contrary to the "end" claim in Testimony 6.

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 6}

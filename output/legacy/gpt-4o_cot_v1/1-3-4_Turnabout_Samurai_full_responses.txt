To identify a contradiction between the testimonies and the provided evidences, we need to examine the specifics of what is stated and whether it aligns with the evidence details.

We start by examining Cody Hackins' testimonies. Notably, Testimony 8 mentions that Cody did not have his camera with him, "If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you."

However, Evidence 15, named Cody's Camera, shows that Cody always carries his camera. The description states: "A new digital camera. Cody always carries it, though he's still learning how to use it." This statement suggests that Cody should have had his camera because he always carries it.

This inconsistency between Testimony 8 and Evidence 15 creates a contradiction; Cody claimed he didn't have his camera when he habitually carries it.

Let’s prepare the final response:

{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 8}

To identify which evidence and testimony contradict each other, we need to closely examine the evidence and testimonies relating to Cody and find a pair where Cody's statements do not align with the evidence provided.

First, let's summarize Cody's testimonies:

1. Testimony 0: Cody acknowledges something with a "Yeah, you're right, pops."
2. Testimony 1: He mentions seeing the Steel Samurai escape from a villain.
3. Testimony 2: Cody claims he tried to take a picture.
4. Testimony 3: Cody says the lens wouldn't open in time, so he missed taking the picture.
5. Testimony 4: He insists that what he said is all that happened.
6. Testimony 5: Cody states he took a few shots but erased them because he was late.

Now, let's consider Cody-related evidence:

- Evidence 15: Cody's Camera. It’s mentioned that Cody always carries it.

Upon analysis, the contradiction lies in Cody's testimonies about not being able to take photos (Testimony 3: lens wouldn’t open and missed it) and then later asserting he took some shots but erased them (Testimony 5). He suggests he didn't manage to take photos because of the lens issue, but later contradicts himself by saying he took photos.

Although these are two testimonies, the evidence to consider is Cody's Camera (Evidence 15), which indicates he always has it with him, contradicting his reason for being unable to capture the moment.

Hence, the contradiction can be spelled out as between Testimony 3 and Evidence 15 because Cody suggests technical issues with his camera to avoid disclosing the images, which should have been on his camera.

Therefore, the contradiction is:
- Evidence: Cody's Camera (Evidence 15)
- Testimony: The lens wouldn't open in time (Testimony 3)

{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 3}

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 0 states, "I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!" However, Evidence 10, which is "Pistol," states that it "Bears prints from Edgeworth's right hand", which implies that Edgeworth was holding the pistol, but it does not necessarily mean he was on the boat. However, a more direct contradiction is found between Testimony 0 and Evidence 4. Testimony 0 states, "I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!" However, Evidence 4, which is "Lake Photo," shows an empty lake, which implies that there was no one on the boat.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 0}
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 3 states, "The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower." However, Evidence 2, which is "Lotta's Camera," states that it was "Set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected", which implies that the camera was not set up to take pictures of a meteor shower, but rather to take pictures of loud noises.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 7 states, "Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot." However, Evidence 4, which is "Lake Photo," states that it was "Taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM", which shows an empty lake, implying that there was no one on the lake at that time.

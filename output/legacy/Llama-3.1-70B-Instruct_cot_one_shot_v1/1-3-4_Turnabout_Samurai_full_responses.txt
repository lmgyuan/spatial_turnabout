Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states, "I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em." However, Evidence 15, which is "Cody's Camera," states that Cody always carries it, but there is no mention of any photos being taken or erased. However, a more direct contradiction is found between Testimony 3 and Evidence 15. Testimony 3 states, "But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it." However, Evidence 15, which is "Cody's Camera," states that Cody's camera is a new digital camera, implying that it should be able to take pictures quickly.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states, "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!" However, Evidence 3, which is "Receipt," states that there are "letters written in blood on the back," but it does not confirm that the letters are the killer's name. Furthermore, Testimony 2 states, "On it, the word 'Maya' was written clearly in blood!" which suggests that the word written in blood is "Maya," not necessarily the killer's name.

However, there is another contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 9. Testimony 5 states, "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!" However, Evidence 9, which is "May Testimony," states that "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." This implies that the victim did not have time to write the killer's name, as the death was instantaneous according to Evidence 5, "Mia's Autopsy Report."

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 3 states, "And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!" However, Evidence 5, which is "Mia's Autopsy Report," states that "Death was instantaneous," which implies that the victim did not have time to dodge an attack and run to the right as stated in Testimony 1. However, the actual contradiction lies in Testimony 1 and Evidence 9. Testimony 1 states, "The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right." However, Evidence 9, which is "May Testimony," states that "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." Evidence 9 is actually a copy of Testimony 1. 

However, Testimony 1 and Evidence 5 contradict each other. Testimony 1 states, "The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right." However, Evidence 5, which is "Mia's Autopsy Report," states that "Death was instantaneous." The instantaneous death contradicts the victim's ability to dodge an attack and run to the right.

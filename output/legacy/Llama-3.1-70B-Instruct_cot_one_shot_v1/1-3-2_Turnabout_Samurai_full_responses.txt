Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 7 states, "It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!" However, Evidence 5, which is "Powers'(?) Photo," states that the Steel Samurai was seen walking at the gate between the entrance and the Studios at 2:00 PM, but it is unclear if this is actually Powers. However, a more direct contradiction is found between Testimony 7 and Evidence 11. Testimony 7 states, "It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!" However, Evidence 11, which is "Mr. Monkey's Head," states that it "Blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM." This implies that Powers could not have walked to the studio at 2:00 PM as stated in Testimony 7.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 2 states, "No one else went there!" However, Evidence 11, which is "Mr. Monkey's Head," states that it "Blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM." This implies that no one could have gone to the studio between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, but Testimony 1 states that Will Powers went to the studio before 2:30 PM, and Testimony 0 confirms that the time of death was 2:30 PM. However, a more direct contradiction is found between Testimony 2 and Evidence 18. Testimony 2 states, "No one else went there!" However, Evidence 18, which is "Van," states that Manella used this van to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer, implying that at least two people, Manella and Vasquez, went to Studio One.

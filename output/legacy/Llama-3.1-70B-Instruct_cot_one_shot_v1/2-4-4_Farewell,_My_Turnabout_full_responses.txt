Testimony 3 states, "While pretending to be the first person to discover the body and enter the scene," However, Evidence 18, which is "Picture Card," states that it was "Was placed next to the victim at the time of the murder. Ms. Andrews was carrying it", which implies that Andrews was already at the scene of the crime when she placed the picture card, not pretending to be the first person to discover the body.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 3 states, "One of these was to find the bear figurine and to give it to Adrian Andrews." However, Evidence 27, which is "Celeste's Suicide Note," states that it was "Found inside the Figurine. It tells of Engarde's horrible misdeeds", which implies that the figurine was already in Andrews' possession, not something that de Killer had to find and give to her.

The testimony of Oldbag contradicts the evidence of the Guidemap. Oldbag's testimony states that Powers walked by her at 2:00 PM, heading towards the studio, but the evidence of the Guidemap suggests that the path to the scene of the crime was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, making it impossible for Powers to have walked by her at 2:00 PM.

The testimony of Oldbag contradicts the evidence of the Guidemap. Oldbag's testimony states that no one else went to the studio before 2:30 PM, but the evidence of the Guidemap suggests that the path to the scene of the crime was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, which means that someone could have gone to the studio between 2:00 PM and 2:15 PM.

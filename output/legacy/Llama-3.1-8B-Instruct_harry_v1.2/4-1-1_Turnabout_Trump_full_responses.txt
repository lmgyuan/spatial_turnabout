The testimonies describe a sequence of events where the defendant first strangles the victim and then hits him with a bottle. However, Testimony 2 mentions the victim's hand being on a locket at his neck, which implies that the victim is still alive at that point. This contradicts Testimony 5, which describes the defendant hitting the victim with a bottle after strangling him.

The testimonies describe the game's rules and progression, but Testimony 3 contradicts the evidence that the defendant lost the last hand, as described in Testimony 4. If the defendant played with all chips on the table and lost, it implies that the victim was the one who was winning, not the defendant.

The testimonies describe the hands of the two men, but Testimony 3 contradicts the evidence that both men had a "full house" in the last hand, as described in Testimony 0. A "full house" is a hand with three of one rank and two of another rank. However, Testimony 3 describes Mr. Smith's hand as having three aces and Mr. Wright's hand as having two aces, which would be a "full house" but with three of one rank and two of the same rank, not a "full house" with three of one rank and two of another rank.

The testimonies describe a sequence of events where Olga planted a card to rig the game, but the plan failed when the card was gone. However, Testimony 4 and Testimony 5 both imply that Olga was aware of the defendant's actions and did not let him out of her sight. This contradicts the evidence that Olga was the one who planted the card to rig the game, as described in Testimony 0 and Testimony 1.

The testimonies describe a sequence of events where Phoenix discovers the "trap" and leaves to call the police, but when he returns, he finds the victim dead. However, Testimony 1 implies that Smith was still present at the scene when the police were called, but Testimony 5 implies that the victim was dead when the police were called. This suggests that Phoenix may have been absent from the scene for a longer period of time than he initially claimed.

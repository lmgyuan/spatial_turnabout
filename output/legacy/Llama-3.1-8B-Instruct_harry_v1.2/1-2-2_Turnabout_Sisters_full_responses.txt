The testimony of Gumshoe contradicts the evidence of the Glass Shards. Gumshoe's testimony states that there was blood on the victim's finger and that the lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's, but the evidence of the Glass Shards suggests that the victim was hit with a glass light stand, which would not have caused blood to be on the victim's finger.

The testimony of April contradicts the evidence of the Glass Shards. April's testimony states that Maya hit the victim with "that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? 'The Thinker,' I think?", but the evidence of the Glass Shards suggests that the victim was hit with a glass light stand, not a clock.

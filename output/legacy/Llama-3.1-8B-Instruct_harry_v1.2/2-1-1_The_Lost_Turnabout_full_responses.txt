Gumshoe's testimony states that the victim wrote the name "Maggie" in the sand, but the evidence of the Crime Photo 2 suggests that the victim wrote "Maggie" in the sand, but the handwriting looks similar to the handwriting on the list of unfamiliar names and phone numbers, which is written in a more masculine handwriting.

The testimony of Wellington contradicts the evidence of the Baseball Glove.

The testimony of Acro contradicts the evidence of the Max G. Bust. Acro's testimony states that lifting the bust and looking out of the window would have been impossible due to his injured legs, but the evidence of the Max G. Bust suggests that the bust is rather heavy, which would not have been impossible for Acro to lift if he had a strong upper body.

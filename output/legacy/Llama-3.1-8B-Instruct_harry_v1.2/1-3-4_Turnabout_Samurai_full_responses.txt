The testimony of Cody contradicts the evidence of the Guidemap. Cody's testimony states that he went through the woods, off the path, to avoid the old lady, but the evidence of the Guidemap suggests that the path to the scene of the crime was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, which means that Cody would not have been able to reach the studio by going through the woods.

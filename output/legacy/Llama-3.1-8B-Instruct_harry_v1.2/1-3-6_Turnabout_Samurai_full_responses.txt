The testimony of Vasquez contradicts the evidence of the Mr. Monkey's Head. Vasquez's testimony states that they took a 15-minute break in the meeting at 2:30 PM, but the evidence of the Mr. Monkey's Head suggests that the path to the scene of the crime was blocked between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, which means that Vasquez and Manella would not have been able to reach the scene of the crime during the break.

Okay, so I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through each piece of evidence and testimony to see where there might be inconsistencies.

First, looking at the evidence list, I see several items. Evidence 2 is Glass Shards, which are the broken remains of a glass light stand, broken beyond recognition. That seems important because it's a physical piece of evidence from the crime scene.

Now, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 9 says, "Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over..." This is from White. Impaction usually refers to a heavy impact or force, which could relate to the cause of death. Mia's Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) mentions a single blunt force trauma, so that lines up with Testimony 9. But wait, the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken light stand. If the murder weapon was the statue clock (Evidence 1), then the shards might not directly relate to the cause of death. However, Testimony 9 talks about the impact, which would be consistent with the blunt force trauma.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The Glass Shards are from a broken light stand, but the autopsy says the cause was a single blunt force trauma, which was the Thinker statue. So the Glass Shards might not be the murder weapon but just broken glass at the scene. However, Testimony 9 mentions an impaction, which aligns with the blunt force trauma from the statue. So maybe the Glass Shards don't contradict the testimony. Hmm.

Looking at other testimonies, Testimony 4 says White saw a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair. Testimony 8 says the victim ran to the left, and the attacker chased. But in the evidence, the Floor Plans (Evidence 8) might show the layout, but I'm not sure if that's a contradiction yet.

Wait, perhaps looking at the direction the victim ran. Testimony 8 says the victim ran to the left, but in Evidence 9, May's Testimony says the victim ran to the right. Oh, that's a contradiction. So May Testimony (Evidence 9) says the victim ran to the right, but White's Testimony 8 says she ran to the left. That's a direct contradiction.

So the conflicting pair would be Evidence 9 (May's Testimony) and Testimony 8 (White's testimony about the victim running left). Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 9 and Testimony 8.

Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony. Let's see, there's a list of evidence and testimonies provided. I need to find a pair where something from the evidence doesn't match up with what someone said in their testimony.

First, I'll go through the evidence one by one to understand what each piece is about. Evidence 0 is an Attorney's Badge, which seems pretty straightforwardâ€”just something an attorney would carry. Evidence 1 is called "The Thinker," and it's described as the murder weapon, which is a clock made by Larry Butz. That's interesting because it's both a statue and a functional clock. Evidence 2 is Glass Shards from a broken light stand. Evidence 3 is a receipt with blood writing on the back. Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo about a recorded conversation. Evidence 5 is Mia's Autopsy Report, which states the time of death and cause. Evidence 6 is Maya's Cell Phone with a conversation recorded. Evidence 7 is a Wiretap found in Miss May's hotel room. Evidence 8 is Floor Plans of the murder scene. Evidence 9 is May's Testimony about the victim running to the right. Evidence 10 and 11 are Photographs related to the DL-6 Incident. Evidence 12 is a Bellboy's Affidavit describing a man with Miss May. Evidence 13 is a Newspaper Clipping about a politician's suicide with the word "White" written on it. Evidence 14 is Mia's Memo with a list of names.

Now, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 0 says Miss May's testimony was correct, as was White's. Testimony 1 mentions the girl running to the left when assaulted. Testimony 2 says the assailant hit her savagely. Testimony 3 says she then ran to the right with her last strength. Testimony 4 states the assailant chased her and delivered the final blow. Testimony 5 mentions that's what Miss May saw. Testimony 6 claims the assailant hit her twice.

I need to find a contradiction between evidence and testimony. Let's see, May's Testimony (Evidence 9) says the victim ran to the right, but Testimony 1 says she first ran to the left. That seems contradictory. So, Evidence 9 says the victim ran to the right, but Testimony 1 says she ran to the left. That's a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, I could look at other testimonies, but this one stands out because it's about the direction the victim ran, which is a specific detail that could be crucial in the case. If May's Testimony (Evidence 9) says right, but Testimony 1 says left, that's inconsistent and could be important evidence.

Another angle is to check if any evidence directly refutes a testimony. For example, if there's physical evidence showing the victim couldn't have run in a certain direction, but I don't see that here. The Floor Plans (Evidence 8) might show the layout, but without details, it's hard to say. The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) being broken beyond recognition might not directly contradict any testimony unless someone said the glass was intact.

The Wiretap (Evidence 7) in Miss May's room could imply she was being spied on, but I don't see a testimony that directly contradicts that. The Newspaper Clipping (Evidence 13) mentions a politician's suicide with "White" written on it, but White is the person giving testimonies, so maybe that's a clue, but it's not a direct contradiction.

Focusing back on the directions, since May's Testimony (Evidence 9) and Testimony 1 are about the victim's movement, and they conflict, that seems like the best pair to highlight. It's a clear contradiction that could impact the case's credibility.

So, in summary, Evidence 9 (May's Testimony) stating the victim ran to the right contradicts Testimony 1, which says she ran to the left. This discrepancy could be significant in determining the accuracy of the testimonies and the overall investigation.

Okay, so I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other based on the information provided. Let's start by going through each piece of evidence and each testimony to see if there are any inconsistencies.

First, I'll list out the evidence and their descriptions to have a clear picture:

- **Evidence 0**: Attorney's Badge - No one would believe I was a defense attorney if I didn't carry this.
- **Evidence 1**: The Thinker - The murder weapon. Looks like a statue, but it's actually a clock. Made by Larry Butz.
- **Evidence 2**: Glass Shards - The broken remains of a glass light stand. Broken beyond all recognition.
- **Evidence 3**: Receipt - A department store receipt with letters written in blood on the back.
- **Evidence 4**: Maya's Memo - "A conversation I had with my sister is recorded on my cell phone."
- **Evidence 5**: Mia's Autopsy Report - Time of death: 9/5 at 9:00PM. Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous.
- **Evidence 6**: Maya's Cell Phone - Holds a conversation between the Chief and Maya. Click here for details.
- **Evidence 7**: Wiretap - Found in Miss May's hotel room.
- **Evidence 8**: Floor Plans - The murder scene, the Fey & Co. Law Offices. Click here for details.
- **Evidence 9**: May Testimony - "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck."
- **Evidence 10**: Photograph - On the back the words "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A" are written in pencil.
- **Evidence 11**: Photograph - On the back the words "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B" are written in pencil.
- **Evidence 12**: Bellboy's Affidavit - Describes the man who stayed with Miss May in the hotel on the night of the murder.
- **Evidence 13**: Newspaper Clipping - Article about politician's suicide. The word "White" is written in pen at the top.
- **Evidence 14**: Mia's Memo - A list of people's names in Mia's handwriting.

Now, the testimonies:

- **Testimony 0**: "Umm, well, see--I looked at the other window when I heard that thing fall." - Person: White
- **Testimony 1**: "A light stand was lying on the floor when I looked." - Person: White
- **Testimony 2**: "Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!" - Person: White
- **Testimony 3**: "The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged." - Person: White
- **Testimony 4**: "She turned, and ran for the door!" - Person: White
- **Testimony 5**: "Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!" - Person: White

Alright, now I need to look for contradictions between evidence and testimony.

Starting with **Evidence 2: Glass Shards** - The broken remains of a glass light stand. This suggests that there was a broken light stand at the scene.

Looking at **Testimony 1**: "A light stand was lying on the floor when I looked." This seems to support the evidence, not contradict it.

Next, **Evidence 9: May Testimony** - "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck."

Now, looking at **Testimony 2**: "Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!" 

There's a contradiction here. The evidence (May's testimony) says the victim ran to the right, but Testimony 2 says she ran to the left. That's a direct inconsistency regarding the direction the victim ran after the attack.

So, the contradiction is between **Evidence 9** and **Testimony 2**.

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find a pair where the evidence and testimony contradict each other. So, first, I'll list out the evidence and testimonies provided to understand their contents better.

Looking at the evidence, I see Evidence 2 is about Glass Shards from a broken light stand, and Evidence 7 is a Wiretap found in Miss May's hotel room. Then, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 2 mentions placing a wiretap, and Testimony 3 talks about seeing a glass light stand.

Wait, so Testimony 2 says White placed a wiretap, which would correspond to Evidence 7. But Testimony 3 says White saw a glass light stand, which relates to Evidence 2. However, the question is about contradictions. 

If I think about it, if White placed the wiretap (Evidence 7) but also claims to have seen the glass light stand (Evidence 2), is there a contradiction? Maybe not directly. Perhaps I need to look for something else.

Wait, Evidence 2 is about broken glass shards, but Testimony 3 says White saw the glass light stand, implying it was intact when he saw it. But Evidence 2 says it's broken beyond recognition. So, if White saw it intact but the evidence shows it was broken, that's a contradiction.

So, Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 3 (saw the glass light stand intact) contradict each other because one is broken, and the other was seen whole.

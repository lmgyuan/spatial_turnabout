Alright, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I'll list out the evidence and testimonies provided to see if any obvious contradictions jump out.

Looking at the evidence, I see Evidence 5 is Mia's Autopsy Report, which states that the time of death was on 9/5 at 9:00PM and the cause was a single blunt force trauma. That seems pretty straightforward.

Now, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 5 says that before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name. Testimony 2 mentions that the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood next to the victim's body. Testimony 3 confirms that the blood was the victim's.

Wait a minute, if the victim wrote the killer's name, that would imply she was conscious and able to write. But according to the autopsy report, the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, and death was instantaneous. If death was instantaneous, the victim wouldn't have had time to write anything after being struck.

So, Evidence 5 says death was instantaneous, but Testimony 5 suggests the victim wrote the killer's name, which would require her to be alive for a moment after the attack. That's a contradiction.

I don't see any other obvious contradictions at first glance, so I think this is the pair that doesn't match up.

Okay, so I need to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. Let me go through everything step by step.

First, I'll look at the evidence provided. There are 15 pieces of evidence, numbered 0 through 14. Each has a name and a description. For example, Evidence 1 is "The Thinker," which is described as the murder weapon—a clock made by Larry Butz. Evidence 5 is Mia's Autopsy Report, stating the time of death was 9/5 at 9:00 PM, caused by a single blunt force trauma, and death was instantaneous.

Now, the testimonies. There are five testimonies, all from a person named April. Testimony 0: "I did see everything! I did!" Testimony 1: "The victim—the woman—dodged the first attack and ran off to the right." Testimony 2: "Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her..." Testimony 3: "And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!" Testimony 4: "That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? 'The Thinker,' I think?"

I need to find a contradiction between any evidence or character and a testimony. Let's start by looking at the testimonies and seeing if they align or clash with the evidence.

April's Testimony 4 mentions "that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? 'The Thinker,' I think?" This directly refers to Evidence 1, "The Thinker," which is indeed the murder weapon. So, in this case, Testimony 4 supports Evidence 1.

Next, Testimony 1 says the victim dodged an attack and ran to the right. There's also Evidence 9, which is "May Testimony," stating: "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." This seems consistent with April's Testimony 1. So, no contradiction there.

Testimony 3 says April saw the girl in hippie clothes hit the victim with the weapon. This aligns with the murder weapon being "The Thinker" (Evidence 1). So again, no contradiction.

Looking at Evidence 5, Mia's Autopsy Report, it says the time of death was 9/5 at 9:00 PM. Now, I need to check if any testimony contradicts this. April's testimonies don't mention the time of death, so there's no direct contradiction there.

Evidence 2 is "Glass Shards" from a broken glass light stand. None of the testimonies mention glass shards, so no contradiction there.

Evidence 3 is a receipt with blood on the back. Again, no mention in the testimonies.

Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo about a conversation with her sister on her cell phone. Testimony 6 is Maya's Cell Phone holding a conversation between the Chief and Maya. No contradiction here.

Evidence 7 is a wiretap found in Miss May's hotel room. Testimony 12 is the Bellboy's Affidavit about the man staying with Miss May. No direct contradiction.

Evidence 10 and 11 are photographs related to the DL-6 Incident. No mention in testimonies.

Evidence 13 is a newspaper clipping about a politician's suicide with the word "White" written on it. No mention in testimonies.

Evidence 14 is Mia's Memo with a list of people's names. No contradiction with testimonies.

Now, looking at the characters, there's Gumshoe who provided several testimonies in the previous conversation, but in this case, the testimonies are from April. So, no contradiction there.

Wait, in the previous interaction, the user provided a different set of testimonies from Gumshoe, but in this current query, the testimonies are from April. So, I need to focus only on the current testimonies.

So, in the current set, all testimonies from April seem to align with the evidence, except maybe if there's something I'm missing.

But wait, Testimony 0 says, "I did see everything! I did!" If April claims to have seen everything, but the evidence shows that the murder happened at 9:00 PM (Evidence 5), and if April wasn't present at that time, that could be a contradiction. But there's no evidence provided about April's whereabouts at that time.

Alternatively, if the autopsy report says death was instantaneous from a blunt force trauma (Evidence 5), and Testimony 3 says the victim was hit with the weapon, that aligns. So, no contradiction there.

Perhaps there's no direct contradiction in this set, but the user expects an answer, so maybe I need to infer differently.

Wait, in the previous interaction, the user provided testimonies from Gumshoe, but now they're from April. So, perhaps the user is testing if I can spot that the testimonies have changed and identify a contradiction based on that.

But in this case, the testimonies are all from April, so I don't see a direct contradiction with the evidence provided.

Alternatively, maybe Evidence 5 says death was instantaneous, but Testimony 1 says the victim dodged and ran, implying she survived the first attack. That could be a contradiction because if the death was instantaneous, she wouldn't have been able to run after being struck.

So, Evidence 5: "Time of death: 9/5 at 9:00PM. Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous."

Testimony 1: "The victim—the woman—dodged the first attack and ran off to the right."

If the death was instantaneous, the victim couldn't have dodged and run after being struck. Therefore, Testimony 1 contradicts Evidence 5.

So, the pair would be {"evidence": 5, "testimony": 1}.

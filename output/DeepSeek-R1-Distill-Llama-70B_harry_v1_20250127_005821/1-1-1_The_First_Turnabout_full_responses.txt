Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the task is to find a pair where either an evidence and a testimony contradict each other or a character and a testimony contradict each other. I need to choose only one pair and present it in the specified JSON format.

First, I'll list out all the provided evidence and testimonies to get a clear picture.

Evidences:
0. Attorney's Badge: No one would believe I was a defense attorney if I didn't carry this.
1. Cindy's Autopsy Report: Time of death is between 4PM-5PM on 7/31. Cause is loss of blood due to blunt trauma.
2. Statue: A statue in the shape of "The Thinker". It's rather heavy.
3. Passport: Victim arrived home from Paris on 7/30, the day before the murder.
4. Blackout Record: Electricity was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime.

Testimonies (all from Sahwit):
0. Saw a man fleeing an apartment.
1. He left the door half-open.
2. Looked inside the apartment.
3. Saw her lying there, unresponsive, dead.
4. Too frightened to go inside.
5. Thought to call the police immediately.
6. The phone in the apartment wasn't working.
7. Went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
8. The time was exactly 1:00 PM.
9. The man was the defendant.

Now, I need to look for contradictions between evidence and testimony or character and testimony. Since the characters aren't explicitly listed except for the defendant and Sahwit, I'll focus on evidence-testimony contradictions.

Starting with Evidence 1: Autopsy Report states time of death is 4PM-5PM. Testimony 8 says Sahwit called the police at 1:00 PM. If the time of death is 4-5 PM, but Sahwit saw the body at 1 PM, that would mean the victim was still alive when Sahwit saw her, which contradicts the autopsy report. Alternatively, if Sahwit saw the body at 1 PM, and the time of death is 4-5 PM, then the body was already there at 1 PM, but the victim died later, which doesn't make sense. So, there's a contradiction here.

Another point is Evidence 4: Blackout Record. Electricity was out from noon to 6 PM. If the phone wasn't working (Testimony 6), that could be because of the blackout. But Sahwit went to a public phone, which might have worked because the park's electricity was on. Not a direct contradiction, but perhaps not as strong as the time issue.

Looking at the statue (Evidence 2), it's heavy. If it was used as the blunt trauma object, but there's no testimony mentioning the statue being at the scene or used, so maybe not a contradiction.

Passport (Evidence 3) shows the victim arrived on 7/30, which is the day before the murder. Sahwit's testimonies don't contradict this; they just establish she was there.

The Attorney's Badge (Evidence 0) is about the defense attorney, which doesn't directly relate to Sahwit's testimonies.

So, the main contradiction seems to be between Evidence 1 (time of death 4-5 PM) and Testimony 8 (Sahwit saw the body at 1 PM). If Sahwit saw the body at 1 PM, the victim would have been dead by then, but the autopsy says she died between 4-5 PM. That's a clear contradiction because the victim can't be dead at 1 PM and also die later at 4-5 PM.

Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 1 and Testimony 8.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I have a list of evidence and testimonies, and I need to find a pair where the evidence and testimony contradict each other. I should only provide one pair in the end, formatted as JSON.

First, I'll go through each evidence and testimony to understand what they say.

**Evidences:**
1. **Attorney's Badge**: Just a badge; probably not relevant to the contradiction.
2. **Cindy's Autopsy Report**: Time of death is between 4 PM and 5 PM on 7/31. Cause of death is loss of blood due to blunt trauma.
3. **Statue**: A heavy statue in the shape of "The Thinker."
4. **Passport**: Victim arrived home from Paris on 7/30, the day before the murder.
5. **Blackout Record**: Electricity was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime.

**Testimonies:**
- **Testimony 0**: Sahwit found the body and heard the time.
- **Testimony 1**: Sahwit heard a voice saying the time, probably from the TV.
- **Testimony 2**: Sahwit mentions the time was three hours off.
- **Testimony 3**: Sahwit guesses the victim was watching a taped program.
- **Testimony 4**: Sahwit thought it was 1:00 PM because of the TV time.
- **Testimony 5**: Sahwit apologizes for the misunderstanding.

Now, I need to find where evidence and testimony clash.

Looking at **Testimony 4**, Sahwit thought it was 1:00 PM. But the **Autopsy Report (Evidence 1)** says the time of death was between 4 PM and 5 PM. If Sahwit thought it was 1 PM, that's a contradiction because the autopsy shows the death happened later.

Wait, but Testimony 2 mentions the time was three hours off. So if the TV said 1 PM, but it was actually 4 PM, that fits the autopsy report. So Testimony 4 says Sahwit thought it was 1 PM, but the actual time was 4 PM, matching the autopsy. That seems consistent, not contradictory.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again.

If the TV was showing a taped program that was three hours behind, and Sahwit heard the time as 1 PM, but it was actually 4 PM, that aligns with the autopsy. So Testimony 4 and Evidence 1 don't contradict; they actually support each other.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check other testimonies.

**Testimony 2** says the time was three hours off, and **Testimony 3** suggests it was a taped program. So if the TV showed 1 PM, but it was actually 4 PM, that fits the autopsy. So no contradiction there.

Wait, maybe the **Blackout Record (Evidence 4)** is relevant. It says the electricity was out from noon to 6 PM. If the power was out, the TV wouldn't have been on. But Sahwit heard a voice from the TV saying the time. That's a contradiction.

So, **Evidence 4** (Blackout Record) says the electricity was off, but **Testimony 1** and **Testimony 4** mention hearing the time from the TV, which wouldn't have been possible if the power was out.

Yes, that makes sense. The blackout would mean the TV wasn't working, so Sahwit couldn't have heard the time from it. But Sahwit claims to have heard the time from the TV. That's a clear contradiction.

So, the pair is **Evidence 4** and **Testimony 1**.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a list of evidence and testimonies, and I need to find which pair contradicts each other. The user wants only one pair, and the answer should be in JSON format like {"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}.

First, I'll list out all the evidence and testimonies to get a clear picture.

**Evidence:**
0. Attorney's Badge - Description: No one would believe I was a defense attorney if I didn't carry this.
1. Cindy's Autopsy Report - Time of death: 7/31, 4PM-5PM. Cause of death: loss of blood due to blunt trauma.
2. Statue - A statue in the shape of "The Thinker". It's rather heavy.
3. Passport - The victim apparently arrived home from Paris on 7/30, the day before the murder.
4. Blackout Record - Electricity to Ms. Stone's building was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime.

**Testimonies:**
0. Sahwit: Actually, I didn't "hear" the time... I "saw" it!
1. Sahwit: There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!
2. Sahwit: Yeah, the murder weapon! The killer used it to hit the victim!
3. Sahwit: That must have been what I saw.

Now, I need to see which evidence and testimony contradict each other.

Starting with Evidence 0: Attorney's Badge. The description doesn't seem to relate directly to any of the testimonies provided. It's about the attorney's credibility, but none of the testimonies mention the attorney or the badge. So, probably not a contradiction here.

Evidence 1: Cindy's Autopsy Report states the time of death was between 4PM and 5PM on 7/31. The cause of death was loss of blood due to blunt trauma. Looking at the testimonies, none directly mention the time of death or the cause. So, no direct contradiction here.

Evidence 2: Statue - It's heavy and in the shape of "The Thinker". Testimony 2 mentions the murder weapon, implying that the killer used something heavy to hit the victim. Since the statue is described as heavy, it could be the murder weapon. Testimony 3 says, "That must have been what I saw," which might refer to the statue. So, there's a connection here, but is it a contradiction? Not exactly. It seems more like corroborating evidence.

Evidence 3: Passport shows the victim arrived home on 7/30, the day before the murder. The testimonies don't mention the victim's travel, so no contradiction here.

Evidence 4: Blackout Record indicates the electricity was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime. Testimony 0 says Sahwit saw the time, and Testimony 1 mentions a table clock. If the electricity was out, a table clock that relies on electricity wouldn't be working. However, some table clocks are battery-powered. But if Sahwit saw a table clock showing the time during the blackout, that could be a contradiction because the clock shouldn't have been working if it's electric.

Wait, but Testimony 0 says Sahwit saw the time, and Testimony 1 mentions a table clock. If the electricity was out, and the clock was electric, then the clock wouldn't have been showing the correct time, which Sahwit claims to have seen. That could be a contradiction.

But earlier, I thought Evidence 2 and Testimony 2 were related. Let me double-check.

Evidence 2 is the statue, which is heavy, and Testimony 2 refers to the murder weapon as something heavy used to hit the victim. So, the statue could be the murder weapon. That doesn't seem contradictory; it's more supportive.

On the other hand, Evidence 4 and Testimony 1 could be contradictory if the table clock was electric and thus not working during the blackout. Sahwit claims to have seen the time on the clock, which wouldn't have been possible if the electricity was out.

So, Evidence 4 (Blackout Record) contradicts Testimony 1 (mentioning a table clock that was presumably working during the blackout).

But wait, maybe the table clock was battery-powered. If that's the case, then the blackout wouldn't affect it, and there's no contradiction. However, if it's an electric clock, then it wouldn't work during the blackout.

Since the problem likely assumes that table clocks are electric, I'll go with that.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 4 (Blackout Record) and Testimony 1 (table clock was working).

Testimony 3 states that Alita went to the clinic to warn Wocky about the pistol, while Evidence 4 shows a Mirror, which is a torn-off car mirror found in front of Kitaki Mansion, and also a torn-off car mirror found in front of the Meraktis Clinic. This is a contradiction, as Alita's testimony implies that she went to the clinic to warn Wocky about the pistol, but the evidence suggests that the torn-off car mirror was found in front of Kitaki Mansion.

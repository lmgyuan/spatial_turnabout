Testimony 3 states that the investigation went smoothly and that there was nothing else missing from the crime scene, while Evidence 20 shows Glen's calendar, which has a note saying "Meet with The Tiger" on December 3rd, the day of the incident. This is a contradiction, as Gumshoe's testimony implies that there was nothing else missing from the crime scene, but the evidence shows that Glen had a meeting with The Tiger on the day of the incident.

Testimony 3 states that the victim took one sip of the javaccino, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed, while Evidence 13 shows that the coffee contained potassium cyanide, which is a deadly poison. This is a contradiction, as Kudo's testimony implies that the victim was poisoned, but the evidence suggests that the victim was given a deadly poison.

Testimony 3 states that the serving girl brought over the javaccino, while Evidence 13 shows that the coffee contained potassium cyanide and was covered in the victim and Maggey's fingerprints. This is a contradiction, as Kudo's testimony implies that the serving girl brought over the coffee, but the evidence suggests that the coffee was already at the victim's table.

Testimony 3 states that the victim knocked over the vase and it broke, while Evidence 12 shows a crime photo that indicates that the vase on the table where the victim collapsed was intact. This is a contradiction, as Kudo's testimony implies that the vase was broken, but the evidence suggests that it was not.

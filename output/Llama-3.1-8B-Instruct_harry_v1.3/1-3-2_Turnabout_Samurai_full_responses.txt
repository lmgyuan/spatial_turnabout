Testimony 3 states that Oldbag arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM, while Testimony 4 states that Oldbag was at the main gate from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. However, Testimony 1 states that Hammer and the others had been doing a run-through since the morning, which implies that the events of the day were already underway before 1:00 PM.

This is supported by Evidence 3, which states that Jack Hammer's time of death was 2:30 PM. Therefore, it is unlikely that Oldbag was at the main gate from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, as this would have been after the murder occurred.

However, the more likely contradiction is between Testimony 7 and Evidence 5. Testimony 7 states that Powers walked by Oldbag at 2:00 PM, heading towards the studio. However, Evidence 5 shows a photo of Powers taken at the gate between the entrance and the studios at 2:00 PM, but it is captioned as "Steel Samurai is seen walking. He's dragging one leg." This suggests that Powers was already injured at 2:00 PM, and therefore could not have walked by Oldbag at that time.

Testimony 3 states that Oldbag would have seen anyone else who went to the studio, while Evidence 2 shows a guidemap to Global Studios, which implies that there are multiple paths to the studio and that Oldbag's view may not be comprehensive.

However, the more likely contradiction is between Testimony 1 and Evidence 5. Testimony 1 states that Oldbag saw Will Powers go to the studio before 2:30 PM, while Evidence 5 shows a photo of Powers taken at the gate between the entrance and the studios at 2:00 PM, but it is captioned as "Steel Samurai is seen walking. He's dragging one leg." This suggests that Powers was already injured at 2:00 PM, and therefore could not have gone to the studio before that time.

Testimony 3 states that the bellboy seemed out of place and was empty-handed, while the evidence suggests that the Spy Camera (Evidence 23) was set in the right eye of a stuffed bear and was found in the victim's room, which implies that the bellboy was not empty-handed. This is a contradiction, as Powers' testimony implies that the bellboy was empty-handed, but the evidence shows that the bellboy was carrying the spy camera.

Testimony 3 states that Adrian Andrews already knew from the very beginning that Juan Corrida was dead, while the evidence suggests that Andrews was surprised when she walked into the room and saw the victim in a messy state (Evidence 9). This is a contradiction, as de Killer's testimony implies that Andrews knew the victim was dead, but the evidence shows that she was surprised.

Testimony 3 states that de Killer was instructed to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews, while Evidence 25 shows that the bear figurine is a wooden bear-shaped figurine with a hollow inside, and only Corrida and Andrews know how to open it. This is a contradiction, as de Killer's testimony implies that he was instructed to give the figurine to Andrews, but the evidence suggests that the figurine was already in Andrews' possession.

Testimony 3 states that the victim's real name is unknown, while Evidence 2 shows a May 9th Newspaper, which is a newspaper from the morning of the Purification Rite, and it mentions that the high priest, Tahrust Inmee, was killed during the Purification Rite. This is a contradiction, as the testimony implies that the victim's real name is unknown, but the evidence suggests that the high priest, Tahrust Inmee, was killed during the Purification Rite.

Testimony 3 states that Tahrust heard a man and a woman quarreling, while Evidence 16 shows a Crime Photo (Zeh'lot), which is a crime scene photo showing Puhray Zeh'lot's body with a peach-shaped tattoo on the nape of his neck. This is a contradiction, as Tahrust's testimony implies that the quarrel was between Acolyte Zeh'lot and Acolyte Fey, but the evidence suggests that Zeh'lot was the victim.

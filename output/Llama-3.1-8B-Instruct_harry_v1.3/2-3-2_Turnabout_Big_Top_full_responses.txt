Testimony 3 states that Trilo kept the engagement ring in his pocket, waiting for the chance to propose and give it to Regina, while the evidence suggests that the ring was engraved with "From T to R", which implies that it was a gift from someone named T to someone named R. This is a contradiction, as Trilo's testimony implies that he was the one who kept the ring, but the evidence suggests that it was given by someone else.

Testimony 3 states that Trilo saw Max in the plaza that night and that Max didn't acknowledge his presence, while the evidence suggests that Max was in the cafeteria at the time of the murder, as indicated by the Crime Photo (Evidence 2). This is a contradiction, as Trilo's testimony implies that Max was in the plaza, but the evidence shows that Max was in the cafeteria.

Testimony 3 states that Moe saw Max's face silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him, while the evidence suggests that the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) shows a person lying on a case in the snow, and there are victim's footprints leading to where he is, but it does not show Max's face. This is a contradiction, as Moe's testimony implies that he saw Max's face, but the evidence shows that the photo does not depict Max's face.

Testimony 3 states that Moe saw Max wearing the silk hat the entire time he was on the scene, while the evidence suggests that the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) shows a person lying on a case in the snow, and there are victim's footprints leading to where he is, but it does not show Max wearing the silk hat. This is a contradiction, as Moe's testimony implies that Max was wearing the silk hat, but the evidence shows that the photo does not depict Max wearing the hat.

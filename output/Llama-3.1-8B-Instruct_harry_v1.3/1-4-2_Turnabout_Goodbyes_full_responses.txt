Testimony 0 states that Lotta saw the man on the boat as Mr. Edgeworth, while the evidence suggests that the man on the boat is actually Robert Hammond (Evidence 4, which shows a photo of a man firing a gun at another person). This is a contradiction, as Lotta's testimony identifies the victim as Mr. Edgeworth, but the evidence shows that the victim is actually Robert Hammond.

Testimony 3 states that Lotta's camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower, while Evidence 2 describes Lotta's camera as being set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected. This is a contradiction, as the camera was not set up to take pictures of a meteor shower, but rather to detect and capture a loud noise.

Testimony 3 states that Lotta was camping out by the lake, while Evidence 2 describes Lotta's camera as being set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected and facing the lake. This is a contradiction, as Lotta's testimony implies that she was actively watching the lake, while the evidence suggests that the camera was set up to detect and capture a loud noise.

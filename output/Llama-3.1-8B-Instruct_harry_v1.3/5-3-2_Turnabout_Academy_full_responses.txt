Testimony 3 states that Scuttlebutt is positive that Juniper was wearing the costume that she had made, while Evidence 10 shows a Glowing Costume Photo, which is a photo of the stage costume taken in a dark room and made to glow with fluorescent paint. This is a contradiction, as Scuttlebutt's testimony implies that Juniper was wearing the original costume, but the evidence suggests that the costume was modified to glow.

Testimony 3 states that O'Conner never went to the art room, while Evidence 11 shows a School Camera Photo, which is a photo of the art room while preparations were being made. This is a contradiction, as O'Conner's testimony implies that he did not go to the art room, but the evidence suggests that he was present in the art room.

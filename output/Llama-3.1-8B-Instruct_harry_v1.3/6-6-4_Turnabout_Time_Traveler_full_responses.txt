This is a contradiction, as Sorin's testimony implies that he was the one who was stabbed, but the evidence suggests that Gloomsbury was the one who was hit twice.

Testimony 3 states that Nichody tore the page out of Sorin's notebook and hid the body, while Evidence 18 shows a Sorin's Notebook, which is a database-like notebook that chronicles the events of each day in minute detail. This is a contradiction, as Nichody's testimony implies that he tore the page out of Sorin's notebook, but the evidence suggests that the notebook was used to record Sorin's memories in minute detail.

Testimony 3 states that Nichody has never thought of exacting revenge on Master Sorin, while Evidence 19 shows a Newspaper Article, which is a clipping of a newspaper article detailing the car accident that resulted in Selena Sprocket's death. This is a contradiction, as Nichody's testimony implies that he has no motive for revenge, but the evidence suggests that Nichody may have been involved in the car accident that killed Selena Sprocket.

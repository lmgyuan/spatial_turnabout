Testimony 3 states that Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident occurred, while Evidence 11 shows that the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio, which implies that the mirror was already in the middle of the restaurant, dividing the two halves, before the incident occurred. This is a contradiction, as Armstrong's testimony implies that she moved the mirror after the incident, but the evidence suggests that the mirror was already in its current position before the incident.

Testimony 3 states that there were no other customers at the time of the incident, while Evidence 12 shows a crime photo that indicates that there were two dining tables, one of which was empty and the other where the victim collapsed. This is a contradiction, as Armstrong's testimony implies that there were no other customers, but the evidence suggests that there was at least one other table occupied.

Testimony 3 states that Tigre had whales lined up to borrow cash from Tender Lender every single day, while Evidence 8 shows Jean's loan contract, which states that Jean's debt is half a million dollars and the owner of the loan is Tender Lender. This is a contradiction, as Tigre's testimony implies that he had many people lined up to borrow cash, but the evidence suggests that Jean was the only one with a loan from Tender Lender.

Testimony 3 states that Tigre waited around for Glen Elg at his office, Tender Lender, but he never showed up, while Evidence 20 shows Glen's calendar, which has a note saying "Meet with The Tiger" on December 3rd, the day of the incident. This is a contradiction, as Tigre's testimony implies that Glen Elg never showed up to meet him, but the evidence suggests that Glen Elg did intend to meet with Tigre on that day.

Testimony 3 states that Tigre split the scene after seeing the victim laid out over the table, while Evidence 20 shows Glen's calendar, which has a note saying "Meet with The Tiger" on December 3rd, the day of the incident. This is a contradiction, as Tigre's testimony implies that he left the scene, but the evidence suggests that he was supposed to meet with Glen Elg on that day.

Testimony 3 states that Tigre was about to flatten the victim when he started screaming, while Evidence 2 shows a sports paper with a doodle that said 'MC Bomber' with an arrow pointing to '100,000' that was crossed out. This is a contradiction, as Tigre's testimony implies that he was trying to kill the victim, but the evidence suggests that the victim was trying to win money.

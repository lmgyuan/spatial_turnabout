Testimony 3 states that Vasquez was fatigued and had Sal take him, while Testimony 5 states that Vasquez and Sal ate t-bone steaks together. However, Evidence 16 states that there is nothing left on the plates where Sal and Vasquez ate, which contradicts the idea that they ate together.

Testimony 3 states that Oldbag was agitated and pointing at Powers, saying "he did it!", while the evidence suggests that Oldbag saw Powers heading to the scene (Testimony 1 from previous testimonies). However, this is not a direct contradiction.

A more likely contradiction is between Testimony 7 and the context of the crime. Testimony 7 states that Vasquez left the action scenes behind because Hammer was injured and couldn't do them, but the crime scene suggests that Hammer was actually killed during an action scene (Evidence 3). This implies that Vasquez's reason for leaving the action scenes behind is not consistent with the actual events of the crime.

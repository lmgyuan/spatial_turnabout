Testimony 3 states that the defendant attacked and killed a person who was not fighting back, while the evidence suggests that the victim, Dr. Grey, was stabbed in the chest and then shot in the forehead at point-blank range (Evidence 8). This is a contradiction, as the testimony implies that the defendant did not use a gun, but the evidence shows that a gun was used.

Testimony 3 states that the victim took a shot, but missed because they were too close, while Evidence 8 describes Dr. Grey's autopsy report, which states that he was shot in the forehead at point-blank range, leaving gunpowder residue around the bullet hole. This is a contradiction, as the testimony implies that the victim missed, but the evidence shows that the victim was shot and killed.

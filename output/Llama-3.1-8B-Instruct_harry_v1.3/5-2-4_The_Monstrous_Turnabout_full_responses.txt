Testimony 3 states that Filch believes Jinxie stole the staff from the Forbidden Chamber, while Evidence 7 shows a Fox and Demon Statue, which is a statue that was at the crime scene and depicts Tenma Taro and the Nine-Tailed Fox locked in battle. This is a contradiction, as Filch's testimony implies that Jinxie stole the staff, but the evidence suggests that the staff was already at the crime scene.

Testimony 3 states that L'Belle will expose the truth behind Tenma Taro, while Evidence 1 shows a Yokai Legend Scroll, which is a scroll depicting the demon Tenma Taro and the Nine-Tailed Fox, and it seems that those who foolishly choose to depict the demon are cursed. This is a contradiction, as L'Belle's testimony implies that she will expose the truth behind Tenma Taro, but the evidence suggests that the scroll is cursed and should not be depicted.

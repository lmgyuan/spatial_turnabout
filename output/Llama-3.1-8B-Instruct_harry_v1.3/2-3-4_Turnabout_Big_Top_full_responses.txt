Testimony 3 states that Acro could not have exerted the kind of force needed to drop the bust on the Ringmaster's head, while the evidence suggests that the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) shows a person lying face down on a big box in the snow, and there are footprints leading to where he is, which implies that the bust was dropped from a height, and the force required to drop it would have been significant. This is a contradiction, as Acro's testimony implies that he could not have dropped the bust, but the evidence suggests that the bust was dropped.

Testimony 3 states that the defendant held a pistol and pointed it at the victim, while Evidence 4 shows a Knife, which is also known as a "shiv", found at the crime scene bearing Wocky's prints. This is a contradiction, as Stickler's testimony implies that the defendant used a pistol, but the evidence suggests that the defendant used a knife.

Testimony 3 states that the defendant became frightened and tossed the pistol aside, while Evidence 14 shows a Pistol, which is the weapon left at the crime scene with two rounds fired and fingerprints wiped. This is a contradiction, as Stickler's testimony implies that the defendant tossed the pistol aside, but the evidence suggests that the pistol was left at the crime scene.

Testimony 3 states that Stickler saw the killer, the victim, the stand, and the sign on the stand, which said "NOODLE", while Evidence 12 shows a Noodle Stand, which is the victim's noodle stand, but the sign on the stand is actually "ELDOON", not "NOODLE". This is a contradiction, as Stickler's testimony implies that the sign said "NOODLE", but the evidence suggests that the sign said "ELDOON".

Testimony 3 states that Atmey sent his card 10 days beforehand, while Evidence 5 shows a calling card sent by Mask DeMasque, which is dated 2 days before the crime, not 10 days. This is a contradiction, as Atmey's testimony implies that he sent his card 10 days before the crime, but the evidence shows that Mask DeMasque sent his card 2 days before the crime.

Testimony 3 states that Kane Bullard harbored a grudge against Ron DeLite for his betrayal, while Evidence 10 shows a blackmail letter written by Bullard, which suggests that Bullard was blackmailing DeLite, not the other way around. This is a contradiction, as Atmey's testimony implies that DeLite betrayed Bullard, but the evidence shows that Bullard was actually blackmailing DeLite.

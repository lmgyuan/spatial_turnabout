Testimony 3 states that Iris came to the Inner Temple and was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner, while Evidence 4 shows a note to Iris that was found in the Main Hall, which suggests that Iris may have dropped it. This is a contradiction, as Bikini's testimony implies that Iris was already in the Inner Temple, but the evidence suggests that Iris may have been in the Main Hall.

Testimony 3 states that Iris didn't have her hood on, while Evidence 6 shows Iris's Hood, which is a magical hood that Iris wears at all times and is said to offer protection from evil spirits. This is a contradiction, as Bikini's testimony implies that Iris didn't have her hood on, but the evidence suggests that she always wears it.

Testimony 3 states that Bikini fainted after seeing the victim's body, while Evidence 11 shows Elise's Autopsy Report, which states that the victim's body fell 10 ft. after death. This is a contradiction, as Bikini's testimony implies that the victim's body was already on the ground when Bikini fainted, but the evidence suggests that the victim's body fell from a height.

Testimony 3 states that it takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 minutes using a snowmobile, while Evidence 14 shows Tracks Photo, which indicates that one track is shown leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge, suggesting that the killer walked to the bridge rather than using a snowmobile. This is a contradiction, as Bikini's testimony implies that the killer used a snowmobile, but the evidence suggests that they walked.

Testimony 3 states that Butz arrived at the bridge and saw the fire, while Evidence 7 shows Weather Data, which indicates that the fire started at 10:45 PM, and around 30 minutes passed between the fire starting and going out. This is a contradiction, as Butz's testimony implies that he arrived at the bridge before the fire started, but the evidence suggests that the fire started after 10:30 PM.

Testimony 3 states that Butz was sketching in front of the bridge and was whipped up into a frenzy of art, while Evidence 14 shows Tracks Photo, which indicates that one track is shown leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge, suggesting that the killer walked to the bridge rather than being in front of it. This is a contradiction, as Butz's testimony implies that he was in front of the bridge, but the evidence suggests that the killer was walking to the bridge.

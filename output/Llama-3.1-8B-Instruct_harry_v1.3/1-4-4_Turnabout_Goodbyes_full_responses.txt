Testimony 3 states that Butz heard a "bang" and then looked out over the lake, but did not notice the boat, while Evidence 4 shows a photo taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM, which appears to show a person holding a gun and firing at another person on a boat. This is a contradiction, as Butz's testimony suggests that he did not see the boat, but the evidence shows that there was a boat involved in the incident.

Testimony 3 states that Butz heard a gunshot, while Testimony 5 states that Butz heard the gunshot at the exact moment when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!", which implies that the gunshot occurred after 11:50 PM (the time the Second Lake Photo was taken), but the evidence suggests that the gunshot occurred at 12:15 AM (the time the Lake Photo was taken). This is a contradiction, as the evidence and testimony have different timing for the gunshot.

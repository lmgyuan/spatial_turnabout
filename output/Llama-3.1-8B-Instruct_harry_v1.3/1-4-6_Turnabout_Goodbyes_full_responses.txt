Testimony 3 states that Edgeworth picked up something heavy and threw it at Mr. Yogi, while Evidence 2 shows a photograph taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM, which appears to show a person holding a gun and firing at another person on a boat. This is a contradiction, as Edgeworth's testimony suggests that he was on land, throwing something at Mr. Yogi, but the evidence suggests that the murder occurred on a boat.

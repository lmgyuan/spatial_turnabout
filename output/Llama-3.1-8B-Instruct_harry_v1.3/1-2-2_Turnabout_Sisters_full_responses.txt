Testimony 2 states that the word "Maya" was written in blood on the memo, and Testimony 3 states that lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's. However, Evidence 3 is the receipt with letters written in blood on the back, and it is a department store receipt with the date of purchase being the day before the murder. This means that the blood on the memo cannot be the victim's blood, as it would have been written before the murder occurred.

Testimony 3 states that the victim dodged an attack and then ran to the right, but Testimony 2 states that the victim dodged the first attack and ran off to the right. This is a contradiction in the sequence of events described by the same witness, April.

Testimony 2 states that the girl in the hippie clothes (Maya) ran after the victim (Mia) after the victim dodged the first attack and ran off to the right. However, Testimony 3 states that Maya hit the victim, implying that Maya was the one who initiated the attack, not the one who was running after the victim.

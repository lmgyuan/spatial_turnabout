Testimony 3 states that Lamiroir saw nothing when she went backstage for a moment, while Evidence 4 shows a Crime Photo, which shows a victim shot in the shoulder in Lamiroir's room, with smeared writing in blood on the floor in front of their head. This is a contradiction, as Lamiroir's testimony implies that she saw nothing, but the evidence suggests that there was a crime scene.

Testimony 3 states that Ema believes Machi stole the body because of some lyrics, while Evidence 12 shows a Headset, which is a receiver/transmitter for voice signals with a 30-foot range, and all concert staff wore one. This is a contradiction, as Ema's testimony implies that Machi was blind, but the evidence suggests that Machi was not blind.

Testimony 3 states that DePlume reported the incident to the police immediately, while Evidence 5 shows Security Footage, which shows the orca pool from the visitor's corridor and starts at the aquarium's 10 AM opening time. This is a contradiction, as DePlume's testimony implies that the incident occurred at 10 AM, but the evidence suggests that the security footage starts at 10 AM, which is after the incident occurred.

Testimony 3 states that Rimes thinks the orca may have knocked down the stuff that was piled up and hit the captain, while Evidence 9 shows a Bloodstained Coin, which is a single coin that seems to have fallen by the side of the orca pool. This is a contradiction, as Rimes' testimony implies that the orca may have knocked down the stuff that was piled up and hit the captain, but the evidence suggests that the coin may have been used as a murder weapon.

Testimony 3 states that the defendant murdered Mr. Reus before he had a chance to reveal the secrets, while Evidence 15 shows a Prank Plan Script, which is a script for a prank plan that was staged by Roger Retinz, and it includes a scene where the corpse appears and the set piece falls. This is a contradiction, as Ema's testimony implies that the defendant murdered Mr. Reus, but the evidence suggests that the prank was staged by Roger Retinz.

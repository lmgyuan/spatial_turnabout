Testimony 7 states that the victim ran to the left, and you gave chase, while Testimony 4 states that the victim ran away, but you gave chase. This is a contradiction in the direction of the victim's escape.

However, it seems that Testimony 4 is actually correct, and the victim ran to the right (as stated in Testimony 4), not to the left. This is a contradiction with the description of the murder scene in Evidence 8, which states that the stand is blocked from view looking from the office.

Testimony 3 states that with the last of her strength, the victim ran to the right, while Testimony 1 states that the victim first ran to the left. This is a contradiction in the direction of the victim's escape.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
Testimony 2 states that Miss Mia ran to the left, while Testimony 9 states that the victim (Miss Mia) dodged an attack and then ran to the right. This is a contradiction in the direction of the victim's escape.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 2}
Testimony 3 states that White saw a glass light stand, while Evidence 2 describes the broken remains of a glass light stand, suggesting that it was broken beyond all recognition. This is a contradiction, as White would not have seen a whole glass light stand if it had already been broken.

Testimony 3 states that the Jammin' Ninja's button was found in Mr. Engarde's "hakama", while Evidence 16 shows that the button was ripped from the victim's costume and was covered in Corrida's blood. This is a contradiction, as Gumshoe's testimony implies that the button was found in Engarde's possession, but the evidence shows that it was found at the crime scene and was covered in the victim's blood.

Testimony 3 states that Engarde was trying to sneak out of Juan's room, while Evidence 2 shows a photo of the Nickel Samurai, which suggests that Engarde was not in Juan's room at the time of the murder. This is a contradiction, as Oldbag's testimony implies that Engarde was in Juan's room, but the evidence shows that the Nickel Samurai was not present at the crime scene.

Testimony 3 states that Engarde wore the Nickel Samurai costume during the murder, while Evidence 2 shows a photo of the Nickel Samurai, which suggests that the costume was not worn by Engarde at the time of the murder. This is a contradiction, as Oldbag's testimony implies that Engarde wore the costume, but the evidence shows that the costume was not present at the crime scene.

Testimony 3 states that Andrews saw the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo, while Evidence 2 shows a photo of the crime scene, which suggests that the scene was not exactly the same as what Andrews described. Specifically, the crime scene photo shows a smashed vase next to the guitar case, while Andrews testified that she was the one who knocked the flower vase over, implying that it was not smashed at the time of the murder.

Testimony 3 states that Andrews doesn't know why she opened the guitar case, while the evidence suggests that the guitar case was already open at the time of the murder, as shown in the Crime Photo (Evidence 9). This is a contradiction, as Andrews' testimony implies that she opened the case, but the evidence shows that it was already open.

Testimony 3 states that Andrews' thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, specifically the button and the knife, which she believes were used by Matt to kill Juan, while the evidence suggests that the Jammin' Ninja's button was ripped from his costume and is covered in Corrida's blood, and the knife bears the victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints (Evidence 15). This is a contradiction, as Andrews' testimony implies that Matt used the button and knife to kill Juan, but the evidence shows that the button and knife were found in different locations and have different evidence on them.

{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 3}
Testimony 3 states that Andrews didn't think Juan was dead when she saw him slumped over, while the evidence suggests that the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) shows a person lying on a chair with a knife sticking out of their chest, which implies that Juan was dead when Andrews saw him. This is a contradiction, as Andrews' testimony implies that she didn't think Juan was dead, but the evidence shows that he was dead.

Testimony 3 states that the victim was struck twice, while Evidence 14 shows an Autopsy Report, which states that Gloomsbury's head shows signs of being hit twice, but the Time Keeper was used as the murder weapon. This is a contradiction, as Ema's testimony implies that the victim was struck twice, but the evidence suggests that the Time Keeper was used as the murder weapon.

Testimony 2 states that the estimated time of death is correct and there's no way it could be wrong, while Evidence 14 shows an Autopsy Report, which states that Gloomsbury's head shows signs of being hit twice. This is a contradiction, as Ema's testimony implies that the estimated time of death is correct, but the evidence suggests that Gloomsbury's head shows signs of being hit twice.

Testimony 3 states that anyone could tell there were two Pegabulls by looking at the Flying Chapel's pamphlet, while Evidence 3 shows a Flying Chapel Pamphlet, which is a pamphlet for the Flying Chapel and it includes a brief introduction and diagrams of its layout. This is a contradiction, as Larry's testimony implies that the pamphlet clearly shows two Pegabulls, but the evidence suggests that the pamphlet only shows a Pegacow and a Pegabull in their example diagram of the reception hall.

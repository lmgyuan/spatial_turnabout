Testimony 3 states that Mask☆DeMasque's pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces, while Evidence 2 shows a poster for the Treasures of Kurain exhibit, which includes the Sacred Urn, a supposedly priceless treasure. However, the evidence also shows that the Sacred Urn is actually a plain old pot with no monetary value, and that it was broken and repaired by Adrian 2 weeks ago. This is a contradiction, as Gumshoe's testimony implies that the Sacred Urn is a valuable treasure, but the evidence shows that it is not.

Testimony 3 states that Atmey was struck by Mask☆DeMasque and then awakened 30 minutes later, while Evidence 6 shows that the Shichishito, a ceremonial sword held in the hand of Ami Fey's statue, was not bent before the crime, but was bent after the crime, suggesting that Atmey was struck by a blow to the back of the head, not by a sword. This is a contradiction, as Atmey's testimony implies that he was struck by a sword, but the evidence suggests that he was struck by a blow to the head.

Testimony 3 states that Atmey was hit by the thief's blow on his third eye, while Evidence 6 shows that the Shichishito, a ceremonial sword held in the hand of Ami Fey's statue, was not bent before the crime, and DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime with a blow to the back of the head. This is a contradiction, as Atmey's testimony implies that he was hit on his third eye, but the evidence suggests that he was hit on the back of the head.

Testimony 3 states that Ron donned his costume and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime, while Evidence 2 shows a poster for the Treasures of Kurain exhibit, which includes the Sacred Urn of Kurain Village will be displayed in Lordly Tailor. However, the evidence also shows that the Sacred Urn is actually a plain old pot with no monetary value, and that it was broken and repaired by Adrian 2 weeks ago. This is a contradiction, as Ron's testimony implies that he stole the Sacred Urn, but the evidence suggests that it was already broken and repaired.

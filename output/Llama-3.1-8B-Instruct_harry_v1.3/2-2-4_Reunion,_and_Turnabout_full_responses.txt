Testimony 3 states that Ini was happy in a sad way when she saw her sister, while Evidence 2 describes Maya's Magatama, which is slightly translucent and radiates softly with a mysterious light. This is a contradiction, as the testimony implies that Ini was happy to see her sister, but the evidence suggests that Maya's Magatama has a deep, profound aura about it, which could indicate that Maya was in a state of distress or turmoil.

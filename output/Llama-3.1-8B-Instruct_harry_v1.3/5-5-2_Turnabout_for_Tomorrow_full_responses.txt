Testimony 3 states that Ponco was cleaning the room and Mr. Simon came in, while Evidence 8 shows a Photo of the Crime, which is a photo taken inadvertently and shows Blackquill taking the robot apart. This is a contradiction, as Ponco's testimony implies that Mr. Simon came in after Ponco started cleaning, but the evidence suggests that the photo was taken before Ponco started cleaning.

Testimony 3 states that Fulbright has proof that Athena Cykes is the culprit, while Evidence 16 shows a Launch Pad 1 Door Lock, which has Starbuck's prints on it. This is a contradiction, as Fulbright's testimony implies that Athena is the culprit, but the evidence suggests that Starbuck is involved in the crime.

Testimony 3 states that Fulbright is on the side of justice and is not the phantom, while Evidence 2 shows a Utility Knife, which has the victim's blood on it and is also used by Athena to stab the phantom's hand during the incident seven years ago. This is a contradiction, as Fulbright's testimony implies that he is not the phantom, but the evidence suggests that Athena may be involved in the crime.

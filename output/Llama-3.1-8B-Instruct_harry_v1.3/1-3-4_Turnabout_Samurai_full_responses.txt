Testimony 3 states that Cody was going for the studio, while Testimony 2 states that Cody went through the woods, off the path, to avoid being seen by the old lady (Oldbag). This is a contradiction, as going through the woods would not be a direct route to the studio.

Testimony 3 states that Cody missed taking a picture because the lens wouldn't open in time, while Testimony 2 states that Cody held up his camera to take a picture. This is a contradiction, as Cody would not have been able to hold up his camera if the lens was not already open.

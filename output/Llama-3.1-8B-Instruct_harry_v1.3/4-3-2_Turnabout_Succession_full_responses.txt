Testimony 3 states that Brushel was the first outsider to enter the atelier and that he witnessed the death of Drew Misham, while Evidence 2 shows a Magic Show Ticket, which is a ticket for a grand illusion show by Valant Gramarye, and also a ticket for a magic show by Valant Gramarye, which suggests that the show was taking place on the night of Drew Misham's death. This is a contradiction, as Brushel's testimony implies that he was the first outsider to enter the atelier, but the evidence suggests that the magic show was taking place on the night of Drew Misham's death.

Testimony 3 states that Brushel thought nothing of the yellow envelope at the time, while Evidence 2 shows a Gramarye Envelope, which is an envelope from Mr. Wright that was not to be opened until the time was right. This is a contradiction, as Brushel's testimony implies that he thought nothing of the envelope, but the evidence suggests that the envelope was significant.

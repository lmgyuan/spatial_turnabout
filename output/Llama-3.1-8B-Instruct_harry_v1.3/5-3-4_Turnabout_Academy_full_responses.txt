Testimony 3 states that O'Conner assumed Juniper was on her way to the maintenance area, while Evidence 18 shows Stage Set Up Photos, which shows two banners lying on the stage and a person watching the stage, but not Juniper. This is a contradiction, as O'Conner's testimony implies that Juniper was heading towards the maintenance area, but the evidence suggests that Juniper was still on the stage.

Testimony 3 states that Means meant to protect Juniper, but Evidence 9 shows a Tape Recorder, which is a tape recording of a conversation in the art room, and the voice on the tape says "You're a goner!" just like in Junie's script, which suggests that Junie may have been trying to frame someone else for the crime. This is a contradiction, as Means' testimony implies that he was trying to protect Junie, but the evidence suggests that Junie may have been involved in a cover-up.

Testimony 3 states that the pool water would never be drained unless the pool was being cleaned, while Evidence 3 shows an Orca Pool Diagram, which is a cross-section view of the 1st- and 2nd-floor sections of the orca pool. This is a contradiction, as Crab's testimony implies that the pool water would not be drained unless the pool was being cleaned, but the evidence suggests that the pool water may have been drained.

Testimony 3 states that Rimes thinks Orla killed the captain by bashing him thirty feet high and making him slam into the water, while Evidence 2 shows an Orca Pool Diagram, which is a cross-section view of the 1st- and 2nd-floor sections of the orca pool. This is a contradiction, as Rimes' testimony implies that the captain was killed by being bashed thirty feet high and slamming into the water, but the evidence suggests that the pool is only 65 feet deep.

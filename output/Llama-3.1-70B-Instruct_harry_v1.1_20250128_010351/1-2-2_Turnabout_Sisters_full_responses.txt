The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 3 (Receipt) and Testimony 5 (by Gumshoe).

Evidence 3 describes a receipt with letters written in blood on the back, but does not specify what the letters say. However, Testimony 5 by Gumshoe claims that the victim wrote the killer's name in blood before she died. This is a contradiction because the receipt does not contain the killer's name, but rather unspecified letters.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 9 (May Testimony) and Testimony 2 (by April).

Evidence 9 describes May's testimony as saying the victim dodged an attack and then ran to the right, but does not mention the killer. However, Testimony 2 by April claims that the girl in the hippie clothes (May) ran after the victim and hit her with the clock. This is a contradiction because May's testimony does not mention her being the killer, but April's testimony accuses her of being the killer.

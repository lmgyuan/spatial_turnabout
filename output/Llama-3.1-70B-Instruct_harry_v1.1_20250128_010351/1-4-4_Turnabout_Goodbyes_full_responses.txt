The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition) and Testimony 5 (by Butz).

Evidence 11 states that Lotta heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25, but Testimony 5 by Butz claims that he only heard a single gunshot. This is a contradiction because Lotta's deposition suggests that there were two gunshots, but Butz claims to have only heard one.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 1 (Popper) and Testimony 3 (by Butz).

Evidence 1 states that the popper is a classic party noisemaker that makes a "bang" sound, but it is not very clue-worthy. However, Testimony 3 by Butz claims that he heard a gunshot, but he was listening to the radio very loudly, which could have made it difficult for him to distinguish between a gunshot and the sound of a popper. This is a contradiction because the popper's description suggests that it could have made a sound similar to a gunshot, but Butz claims to have definitely heard a gunshot.

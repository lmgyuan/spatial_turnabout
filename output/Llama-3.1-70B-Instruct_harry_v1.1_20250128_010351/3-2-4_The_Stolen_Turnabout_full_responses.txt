The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 10 (Blackmail Letter) and Testimony 2 (by Ron).

Evidence 10 states that the blackmail letter threatened to reveal Ron's true identity to the world if he didn't bring $50,000 or the red diamond, but Testimony 2 by Ron claims that the blackmail threat didn't scare him and wouldn't cause him trouble or anything. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the blackmail letter made a serious threat, but Ron claims that it didn't scare him.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 15 (Kane's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 2 (by Ron).

Evidence 15 states that Kane's cause of death was cerebral hemorrhaging from blunt trauma to the head, but Testimony 2 by Ron claims that if he hadn't been wearing his Maskâ˜†DeMasque costume, he would have been killed. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that Kane was the one who died from a head injury, but Ron claims that he would have been killed if he hadn't been wearing his costume.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 5 (DeMasque's Calling Card) and Testimony 4 (by Atmey).

Evidence 5 states that DeMasque's calling card was sent before a heist, with the message "Take good care of the speckled urn, won't you...?", but Testimony 4 by Atmey claims that he handled security by himself to ensure that his crime would go smoothly. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that DeMasque's calling card was sent to Lordly Tailor, implying that DeMasque was planning to steal the urn, but Atmey claims that he was the one who handled security and planned the crime.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 10 (Blackmail Letter) and Testimony 2 (by Atmey).

Evidence 10 states that the blackmail letter was written with a fountain pen and was found in Ron's room, with the message "If you don't want your true identity revealed to the world, come to KB security at 1:00 AM on October 12th and bring $50,000.", but Testimony 2 by Atmey claims that it was Mr. Bullard who wrote the blackmail letter and sent it to Ron DeLite. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the blackmail letter was written to Ron DeLite, but Atmey claims that it was written by Mr. Bullard.

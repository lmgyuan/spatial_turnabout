The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 14 (Victim's Lottery Ticket) and Testimony 2 (by Gumshoe).

Evidence 14 states that the victim's lottery ticket was found during a body search of Maggey, but Testimony 2 by Gumshoe claims that the victim didn't have any identification on him. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the victim had a lottery ticket on him, but Gumshoe claims that the victim didn't have any identification.

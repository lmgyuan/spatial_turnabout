The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 8 (Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 3 (by Gumshoe).

Evidence 8 states that Dr. Grey was stabbed in the chest and then shot in the forehead at point-blank range, implying that the victim was likely unconscious or unable to fight back after being stabbed. However, Testimony 3 by Gumshoe claims that the defendant attacked and killed a person who was not fighting back, but this implies that the victim was not injured or incapacitated before being killed. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the victim was likely incapacitated before being killed, but Gumshoe claims that the victim was not fighting back.

Evidence 8 states that Dr. Grey was stabbed in the chest and then shot in the forehead at point-blank range, but it does not mention the victim missing a shot. However, Testimony 3 by Gumshoe claims that the victim took a shot, but missed because they were too close. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the victim was shot at point-blank range, but Gumshoe claims that the victim missed a shot.

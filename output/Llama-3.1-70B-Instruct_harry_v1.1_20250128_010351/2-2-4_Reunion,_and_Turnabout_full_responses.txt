The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2) and Testimony 3 (by Ini).

However, Testimony 3 by Ini claims that her sister's new car was a totally special model from England. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that Mimi Miney was driving a car that crashed, but Ini claims that the car was a special model from England, which is not mentioned in the evidence.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 2 (Crime Photo 1) and Testimony 4 (by Phoenix).

Evidence 2 states that the victim is wearing a plain shirt, but Testimony 4 by Phoenix claims that the victim was always walking around with a huge Union Jack on the back of his shirt. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the victim was not wearing a shirt with a Union Jack on the back, but Phoenix claims that he always wore such a shirt.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 5 (Umbrella) and Testimony 3 (by Phoenix).

Evidence 5 states that the umbrella was found broken near an electrical pole at the crime scene, but Testimony 3 by Phoenix claims that the victim fell down on top of his cheap umbrella. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the umbrella was already broken and lying near an electrical pole, but Phoenix claims that the victim fell on top of it.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 2 (Crime Photo 1) and Testimony 2 (by Dahlia).

Evidence 2 states that the victim is lying head down with a broken power cable with sparks hanging above him, but Testimony 2 by Dahlia claims that Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the victim died from a fatal electric shock, but Dahlia claims that he simply collapsed without mentioning the electric shock.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 9 (Student's Testimony) and Testimony 1 (by Dahlia).

Evidence 9 states that the old power cable broke due to some sort of impact on 4/9 at 2:55 PM, but Testimony 1 by Dahlia claims that the cable broke when Feenie pushed Dougie into the electrical pole, which implies that the cable broke at a later time, around the time of the murder. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the cable broke earlier in the day, but Dahlia claims that it broke during the murder.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 10 (Police Report) and Testimony 4 (by Dahlia).

Evidence 10 states that Dahlia was a suspect in a case eight months ago, and that the victim, Diego Armando, ingested poison while interviewing her, but Testimony 4 by Dahlia claims that she and Feenie have been going out ever since they met eight months ago, implying that their relationship was not affected by the incident. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that Dahlia was a suspect in a serious crime, but Dahlia claims that her relationship with Feenie was not affected by the incident.

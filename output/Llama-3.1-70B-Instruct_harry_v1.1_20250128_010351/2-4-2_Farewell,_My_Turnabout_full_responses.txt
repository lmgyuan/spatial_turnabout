The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 14 (Juan's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 5 (by Gumshoe).

Evidence 14 states that the cause of death was strangulation with a scarf, followed by a stab wound with a knife, but Testimony 5 by Gumshoe claims that the defendant bought the knife for the crime, which implies that the knife was the primary means of murder. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the victim was strangled before being stabbed, but Gumshoe claims that the knife was the primary means of murder.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 17 (Lotta's Photo) and Testimony 4 (by Oldbag).

Evidence 17 states that Lotta's photo shows a person in samurai garb standing outside the door, but Testimony 4 by Oldbag claims that she saw Matt Engarde, wearing his flashy racing jacket, coming out of Juan's room. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the person seen outside the door was wearing samurai garb, but Oldbag claims that she saw Engarde wearing his racing jacket.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 17 (Lotta's Photo) and Testimony 4 (by Oldbag).

Evidence 17 states that Lotta's photo shows a person in samurai garb standing outside the door, but Testimony 4 by Oldbag claims that Engarde must have worn the Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing Juan. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the person seen outside the door was wearing samurai garb, but Oldbag claims that Engarde wore the Nickel Samurai costume, which is a different costume.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 5 (by Andrews).

Evidence 9 states that the crime scene photo shows a smashed vase that has stained the carpet with water, next to the guitar case, but Testimony 5 by Andrews claims that she was the one who knocked the flower vase over, where it fell onto the guitar case. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the vase was already smashed and the carpet was stained with water before Andrews entered the room, but Andrews claims that she was the one who knocked the vase over.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 7 (Guitar Case) and Testimony 2 (by Andrews).

Evidence 7 states that the guitar case was empty, but there is some water on top of the lid, but Testimony 2 by Andrews claims that the case was empty after all, implying that there was no water in the case. However, the evidence suggests that there was some water on top of the lid, which contradicts Andrews' testimony.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 16 (Jammin' Ninja's Button) and Testimony 5 (by Andrews).

Evidence 16 states that the button was ripped from Engarde's costume and was found in his "hakama", but Testimony 5 by Andrews claims that the button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the button was ripped from Engarde's costume, but Andrews claims that it was torn off of Juan.

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}
The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 2 (by Andrews).

Evidence 9 states that the crime scene photo shows Juan Corrida sitting on a chair in a samurai outfit with a stab wound on his chest, but Testimony 2 by Andrews claims that Juan was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that Juan was sitting on a chair, but Andrews claims that he was sitting in the corner.

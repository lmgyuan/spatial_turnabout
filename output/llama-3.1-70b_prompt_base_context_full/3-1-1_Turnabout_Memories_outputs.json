How did I get into this mess? Why...? Why did I do that...?That girl... You shouldn't see her anymore.Hey! It's none of your business!I'm telling you for your sake. If you continue to see her, it's going to be bad news.Y-You're lying!Just listen to me. There's something you need to know about that girl... ...Stop it! D-Don't talk about her like that!It-It wasn't me! I-I d-didn't... I didn't do it!-- Five Years Earlier --Mia FeySecond TrialApril 11, 9:40 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Mia: (Whew, it's finally time... I'm kind of nervous...)???: *Ah-HHHHEM!*Mia: Oh! Mr. Grossberg! Good morning!Grossberg: Ah, Mia. Please calm yourself down! You're going to get yourself arrested for suspicious behavior, you know.Mia: What are you talking about!! I am relaxed, Mr. Grossberg!! Look at me, I'm relaxed!!Grossberg: *Grrrmmphh* L-Let go of my lapels! Hmph... You obviously haven't got the temperament to be a lawyer.Mia: I, err... I'm so sorry! It's just that I'm so nervous today...Grossberg: Oh, that's right. This is your first time in the big leagues, isn't it? Well, never you fear my dear. I, Marvin Grossberg, am at your service!Mia: Umm, actually this is my second time in court...Grossberg: Still, you surprised me... What, with your earnest request last night... \"Let me handle this case!\" you suddenly said. And quite forcefully, too!Mia: I just found out yesterday. About the case, I mean.Grossberg: What? And you've already learned all the relevant facts?Mia: Well about that... You see... I mean, of course I have! I think.Grossberg: Oh dear... In any case, don't let our client see you're so nervous. You see the poor young man in the pink sweater over there? That's our client.Phoenix: *cough* *sniffle* Good morning there everybody!Mia: Good morning... (Try to keep smiling, Mia!)Phoenix: I, err, I just want to say... I'll give it all I've got! Yup, it'll be fine! No prob! *cough* *achoo* *achoo*Mia: Oh, what's wrong? Do you have a cold or something... Mr. Wry?Phoenix: Actually, it's Wright... Like the flying brothers... People screw it up all the time. And yes I have a cold. That's what this mask is for. My doc says this way, I won't give it to anyone else... Be kind to others, he says...Mia: Right, Mr. Wright! You have nothing to fear in court today! If you are truly innocent... I promise I will save you!Phoenix: Nnnnggghh... P-Please l-let go of my shirt... *cough*Mia: (That's right, he's the one on trial, not you! He's the one who should be nervous! You need to stay strong for your client, Mia!)Mia: My name is Mia Fey. I'm still pretty new at this lawyer thing... The first time I appeared in court was a year ago. But that trial traumatized me so badly, I thought I'd never set foot in another courtroom. It's been one year since then, and well, here I am again. But this time... This time I'm going to win. (Changed from [But this time... This time I'll win.] in the original release) For my client... And for myself.April 11, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Phoenix Wright.Mia: The defense is ready, Your Honor!Payne: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Judge: The defense today is... Ms... Ms... Mia Fey, was it?Mia: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Is there a problem?Judge: I was under the impression that Marvin Grossberg was to be leading the defense.Mia: Yes! Well, you see... Mr. Grossberg had... A-A bit of an emergency...Judge: Emergency? But isn't that him standing there right next to you?Mia: Yes, well...Judge: You... You're just a rookie. Are you sure you can really handle this?Mia: (Don't let him scare you, Mia! Give him your toughest look!) Of course, Your Honor! ... I think.Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Payne. Your opening statement, please.Payne: Well, well, well... I can't believe a veteran like me has to spend his time baby-sitting a new defense lawyer.Mia: ...!Payne: Don't worry little girl. It will all be over soon.Mia: (What was that all about? Was he trying to trash-talk me?)Payne: Now then, I'd like to proceed with a summary of events on the day in question. The incident occurred on the campus of Ivy University. The murder victim was a student named Doug Swallow. He was a fourth year student studying Pharmacology.Judge: Hmm... It sounds like he was a very bright young man.Payne: Yes, well, next we have a photo taken at the scene of the crime. Students discovered the scene shortly after the murder. They found the victim's body... ...and the defendant, who had obviously bungled his getaway. They then called the police.Judge: Hmm... That certainly makes the defendant look very suspicious indeed. Very well. The court accepts this photo into the record as evidence.Crime Photo 1 added to the Court Record.Judge: By the way... I can't quite tell the cause of death from this photo.Payne: Hee, hee, hee... Your reputation for sagacity is well-earned, Your Honor. The truth is that this victim died a rather unusual death.Mia: An unusual death...!?Judge: What do you mean, Mr. Payne!?Payne: Well... Perhaps the defense would like to take this question.Mia: Huh...!?Payne: A simple question. I thought I might loosen you up a bit. I am a genteel-man, if you will.Mia: Um, a what? (Stand up to him, Mia! Show him what you're made of!)Grossberg: Ah, a perfect opportunity! Well, what was it? The cause! Go on! ... ...Please say you know at least this much.Mia: I-I'm so sorry... I-I didn't get a chance to read through the whole file.Grossberg: *groan* My hemorrhoids are beginning to act up... Now see here! The details of the case are filed under the Court Record. But you knew that already, didn't you?Mia: (Ah! The Court Record! I think I can see that by pressing [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Ah! The Court Record! I think I can see that by touching the Court Record Button...] in the original release)Grossberg: All of the weapons we need can be found in the Court Record. Take a good, hard look at the data there and think carefully before you answer, m'dear!Mia: Y-Yes, sir! I'll do just that! (I've got to stay calm! I can't let that prosecutor get the better of me! The Court Record... OK, let's take a look! I just press [the R Button / Tab] here... (Changed from [The Court Record... OK, let's take a look! I just touch the Court Record Button here...] in the original release))Judge: Now then, would the attorney for the defense please answer the question? What was the cause of death?Asphyxiation Mia: Well... I think you'll find it was a case of asphyxiation. Judge: Hmm... Asphyxiation, huh? Grossberg: M-Mia! What are you doing!? (Changed from [M-Mia! What are you saying!?] in the original release) Mia: Well, it's stuffy in here! I can hardly breathe. Grossberg: No one's asking how you feel! Please, make sure to properly read the Court Record! Mia: I-I'm so sorry! I'll take a better look! (Hang in there, Mia! Okay! The Court Record is [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Hang in there, Mia! Open the Court Record with the Court Record Button...] in the original release) Judge: Hmm... I'll ask you once again. Leads back to: \"What was the cause of death?\"Electrocution Leads to: \"According to the Court Record, it was a fatal electric shock. In other words, electrocution.\"Hypothermia Mia: Err... Hypothermia, I believe. ... ... ...... Mia: Umm, Mr. Grossberg? Does it suddenly feel very cold in here to you? Grossberg: That's because your absurd reply has brought a chill to the courtroom! Mia: I-I'm so sorry... Grossberg: Look at the Court Record more carefully, would you! How can you expect to win a case this way!? Mia: (Hang in there, Mia! Okay! The Court Record is [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Hang in there, Mia! Open the Court Record with the Court Record Button...] in the original release) Judge: Hmm... I'll ask you once again. Leads back to: \"What was the cause of death?\"Mia: According to the Court Record, it was a fatal electric shock. In other words, electrocution.Judge: Electrocution? Hmm... But how could such a thing happen? Did the murderer use some type of new, super-powerful stun-gun, perhaps?Payne: The answer to that will become crystal clear as this trial proceeds, Your Honor. But before that, there is one more vital issue.Mia: Wh-What's that?Payne: Why, motive of course. Apparently there was some bad blood between the victim and the defendant.Judge: Bad blood...?Mia: Wh-What do you mean...?Payne: Oopsie! I'm terribly sorry. You're the defense attorney, so you must know all about it. I shouldn't be stealing your spotlight like this.Mia: (I really don't like this guy's smug attitude...)Grossberg: That's Winston Payne for you. He is one smooth operator, if you catch my drift. They don't call him the \"Rookie Killer\" for nothing, you know.Judge: Now then, let's hear from the defense. What was the source of the bad blood between the victim and the defendant? And this time, I would like to see some supporting evidence!Mia: Ev-Evidence...?Grossberg: Ah, no need to get all worked up over this. As I said, all our weapons can be found in the Court Record. Find the evidence you need and then shove it into Ol' Graybeard's face!Mia: Y-Yes, sir! Into Ol' Graybeard's face!Judge: Err, Mr. Grossberg. Try to set a better example for the young lady!Grossberg: Mia, evidence isn't the only thing in the Court Record. People's profiles are as well. You can toggle between Profiles and Evidence with [the R Button / Tab], so be sure to go over it all! (Changed from [You can toggle between Profiles and Evidence, so be sure to go over it all!] in the original release)Judge: Now then, let's see what you've got. What was the cause of the bad blood between Phoenix Wright and the victim?Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile Mia: Leads to: \"The reason for the bad blood between the two of them was... this woman here.\"Present anything else Mia: Judge: Mr. Grossberg... I honestly think it would be best for the defense if you were in charge. I'm afraid Ms. Fey might stir up some bad blood with this court if she were to continue. Grossberg: Or simply put, you are quite mistaken, m'dear. Mia: Oh no... I'm so sorry... Judge: Even if you are new, your lack of preparation is inexcusable. Now take a moment and think it over again. Mia: Y-Yes, Your Honor! (It's OK! You've got another chance, Mia!) Leads back to: \"Mia, evidence isn't the only thing in the Court Record.\"Mia: The reason for the bad blood between the two of them was... this woman here.Judge: Dahlia Hawthorne, is it?Payne: Very good, Ms. Fey. You seem to have picked up on at least this much. This woman is the girlfriend of the defendant, Phoenix Wright. But up until about eight months ago, she was with the victim, Mr. Swallow. Clearly she has some part to play in this story.Judge: Hmm...Grossberg: Ah, he's done it again. Before the cross-examination starts, he's already got the judge thinking like he wants.Judge: Very well, Mr. Payne. Please call your first witness!Payne: If it pleases the court, the prosecution would like to call Mr. Phoenix Wright.Judge: What? The defendant himself? Well, Ms. Fey?Mia: (It's fine! After all, Mr. Wright is innocent, right?) The defense has no objection.Judge: Very well. The court calls Mr. Phoenix Wright to the witness stand!Payne: Witness, please state your name and occupation.Phoenix: Oh, ah, yes... My name is Phoenix Wright. My job is, um... Well, right now, I guess I'm a suspect.Judge: No, no. He means what did you do before you were arrested?Phoenix: Oh... *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* I was a university student.Payne: Mr. Wright. You understand that you are suspected in the death of your fellow student, Doug Swa--Phoenix: But! But I didn't do it! I'm innocent I tell you! I'm telling you I was... *achoo* *achoo* *cough* *cough* *achoo* *cough*Judge: Would the defendant please refrain from passing on his cold to the rest of us!Payne: It seems the witness has something he wants to say.Judge: Hmm... Well then, Mr. Wright. Please tell us about your relation to the victim.Phoenix: Right away, Your Honor!Witness Testimony-- The Victim and I --Phoenix: Um, I... I admit I was there... But I'm not a killer! All I did was find his body! I hardly knew the guy to begin with... I never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!Judge: Hmm... I see. So you hardly knew the victim?Phoenix: Right! Like I said, I'm not a killer!Mia: Whew... It looks like the judge understands.Grossberg: Mmfph... You're being na\u00efve, you know. Too na\u00efve.Mia: Huh...?Payne: Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee. It seems that you've forgotten one small thing, young lady.Mia: And that would be...?Payne: This witness still has to undergo something called cross-examination.Mia: Cross-examination...?Grossberg: He's right. And it's the defense's duty to carry out the cross-examination. The purpose is to determine if a witness's testimony contains any contradictions.Mia: Contradictions...?Grossberg: If a witness is lying, their statements will conflict with the Court Record.Mia: But... Mr. Wright is my client!Grossberg: Even if he is your client, in court, all lies must be struck down. As a lawyer, that is your duty, you see.Mia: (What does he mean by that? Is he saying that testimony just now... That there was a lie -- a contradiction?)Judge: Now then, your cross-examination, if you please, Ms. Fey.Mia: (Please, Mr. Wright... Tell me you haven't been lying! You wouldn't do that to me... would you...?)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Victim and I --Phoenix: Um, I... I admit I was there...Press Mia: Mia: When you say \"there\", you mean the place where the victim was murdered? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, sort of. The place where SOMETHING happened anyway. Payne: Payne: \"Something\"? You can't hide what happened. We have photographic evidence. Phoenix: *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* Mia: A-Anyway, Mr. Wright... What were you doing at the scene of the crime? I thought you said you didn't know the victim, Mr. Swallow. Phoenix: It was just a coincidence! We bumped into each other by accident. Judge: A coincidence, huh...?Phoenix: But I'm not a killer! All I did was find his body!Press Mia: Mia: You say you found the body? So who called the police? Phoenix: Huh!? Um... *achoo* *cough* *achoo* *cough* *achoo* *cough* Payne: Unfortunately it was some other students that notified the police. Judge: \"Other students\"...? Payne: That's correct. They were witnesses. Witnesses who saw the defendant standing there, next to the body, in shock! Judge: W-What! Is this true, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* Mia: (Could you stop sneezing every time you're in a bind...?) Phoenix: W-Well, it's true that I was pretty shocked when I found the body. But, but I...Phoenix: I hardly knew the guy to begin with...Press Mia: Mia: So, you didn't know his face, or even his name, right? Phoenix: Right! Um, well, no... That is... I mean... Mia: So... Which is it? Did you know him or not? Phoenix: *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* Judge: Now, see here! You can't avoid answering the question by sneezing all day! Phoenix: Err... Umm, well... I guess I did know his name. Mia: (N-News to me! Why didn't he tell me that before...?) Phoenix: Um... I heard he used to date Dollie. Judge: Who is this \"Dollie\" person? Payne: Ah yes, that would be the defendant's lover, Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne. Judge: Oh, I see. Ah, young love... So bittersweet... Phoenix: But that's all I knew about him!Phoenix: I never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!Press Mia: Mia: Mr. Wright, you stated the following in your testimony: \"I hardly knew the guy to begin with...\" Phoenix: Th-That's right! I mean why would I even-- Mia: But that doesn't sound right. If you hardly knew him... ...then why would you say that the victim was a \"stuck-up British wannabe\"!? Phoenix: ... Mia: ... Phoenix: ... *achoo* Mia: Well, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Ah! No! It wasn't me! I'm not a killer, I swear! Judge: Mr. Wright. I will give you an opportunity to revise your testimony. How is it that you knew the victim was, as you put it, a \"British wannabe\"...? Phoenix: Y-Yes, well... Adds statement \"He was always walking around with a huge Union Jack on the back of his shirt.\"Press (subsequent times) Mia: Mia: Mr. Wright, you stated the following in your testimony: \"I hardly knew the guy to begin with...\" Phoenix: Th-That's right! I mean why would I even-- Mia: But that doesn't sound right. If you hardly knew him... ...then why would you say that the victim was a \"stuck-up British wannabe\"!? Phoenix: Um, well, you see...Phoenix: He was always walking around with a huge Union Jack on the back of his shirt.Press Mia: Mia: Did you see it at the crime scene? The Union Jack, I mean. Phoenix: Y-Yes, that's right! I saw it at the crime scene! That's why... That's why I figured he must love British stuff, see? It's true! Cross my heart! I swear I didn't do it... Mia: (He's acting fishier than the salmon I ate last night...) Judge: May I ask you something, Ms. Fey? Mia: Y-Yes, Your Honor. (What is it now?) Judge: Who is this person anyway? This \"Union Jack\" fellow... Mia: ... Payne: The Union Jack is the name of the flag of England. Judge: Oh, I see... So you mean like the \"Stars and Stripes\", right? Payne: As usual, Your Honor, your insight astounds me. Mia: (Hey, something just occurred to me... Isn't there something strange about this bit just now?) Grossberg: Mia... There is a contradiction here! Mia: M-Mr. Grossberg! Grossberg: Quickly now! Show that boy you mean business! With evidence, I mean! Mia: (OK, Mia, check the Court Record carefully!)Present Crime Photo 1 Mia: Leads to: \"Are you certain you saw the \"Union Jack\"?\"Grossberg: Well m'dear, do you think you can manage on your own from this point?I can handle it myself. Mia: (One year ago... I was in a courtroom just like this. I can do it. I can handle this myself!) Grossberg: Mmrgh... You mustn't try to bite off more than you can chew, Mia. Mia: I-I'll be fine! I know what I have to do! Grossberg: Remember, you can always press him to get more information. Oh, and one more thing. When you're going to state a contradiction, make sure you present some definitive proof. Mia: (OK, Mia. One more time, from the very beginning of his testimony!)I need some help. Mia: Umm, Mr. Grossberg... I could use a little help... Grossberg: Ah, please don't look so sad. It brings a tear to my eye when you do. Alright, listen carefully. By comparing the testimony to the Court Record... ...you should be able to discover any contradictions, if there are any. And when you've found one... Mia: I present the piece of evidence that contradicts the witness's testimony...? Grossberg: Yes. That's the ticket! Mia: But still... I don't see any contradictions in Mr. Wright's testimony! Grossberg: Hmm... Maybe you don't have enough information yet. Mia: Information...? Grossberg: You can press for more information by leaning on a witness. Mia: Even if they're my own client? Grossberg: It doesn't matter who it is, if you think they're lying, press them like a cheap suit! That is the obligation of an attorney. Mia: (OK, Mia. One more time, from the very beginning of his testimony!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Marvin Grossberg\nDescription: My superior and the head of Grossberg Law Offices.\nCharacter 1\nName: Phoenix Wright\nDescription: My client.

I went because he called me.Press Mia: Mia: Had you ever met the victim before then? Phoenix: No! Never! ... But... That day, he called me up and told me he wanted to talk about Dollie. Judge: And this \"Dollie\" person is...? Phoenix: My um... It's kind of embarrassing. She's my, umm, sweetheart... Grossberg: Oomph...! Wh-What... What was that for, Mia!? Mia: Oh! I'm so sorry! I just felt like slapping something all of a sudden! Payne: Dahlia Hawthorne was also the lover of the murder victim, Doug Swallow. ...Before she met Mr. Wright, that is. Judge: Hmm... So it was one of those nasty love triangles, I see...Phoenix: He was in the Pharmacology Dept., so we agreed to meet at 2:45 behind that building...Press Mia: Mia: Was it Mr. Swallow who indicated you should meet at 2:45? Phoenix: Yeah. And we were both there right on time. Judge: Hmm... You said the victim was in the Pharmacology Dept., correct? Phoenix: Yeah, he was studying how to manufacture and improve pharmaceuticals. Everyone called him the \"Alchemist of Ivy U\". Judge: An \"alchemist\"... I see... Phoenix: I gotta admit it was a little suspicious. He had a whole laboratory and everything! It was filled with chemicals and strange machines that run on high-voltage electricity. Judge: Ho ho. How fascinating. He sounds like he was quite an ambitious young man. Mia: (What do I do!? Maybe I should ask him for some more details?) About timing of the meeting Mia: So you are absolutely certain that you met at 2:45? Phoenix: Yeah, pretty sure. That's the time class ends. But they're always doing experiments, so it doesn't matter much. Mia: Experiments...? Phoenix: Yeah. Those pharmacology guys are always in the lab whipping up something. Mia: (Well, it looks like he's right about the time anyway.) Payne: Witness, let's go on with your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination About Pharmacology Dept. Mia: I was wondering if you could tell us a bit more about the Pharmacology Department. Phoenix: Well OK, sure. I don't know all that much though. Mia: A little bit earlier in your testimony, you said something interesting. You said the department uses strange machines that run on high-voltage electricity. Phoenix: That's right. And they sure look dangerous. They use non-standard voltages, so there are high-voltage cables everywhere. Mia: \"High-voltage cables\"... Phoenix: Yeah, there were electrical poles set up all around the building. The high-voltage cables run overhead around the roof. Mia: (Finally I think we're getting somewhere...!) Leads back to cross-examination Forget about it Mia: (I've gotten everything I need from this statement. It's time to move on.) Payne: In any case, let's continue with your testimony. Leads back to cross-examinationPhoenix: We talked for a bit, and then at around 3:00, we split up.Press Mia: Mia: So what was it you were talking about? Phoenix: You know... *achoo* *cough* That maybe we should hang out again sometime. Mia: (\"Hang out again sometime\"? I wish that were true.)Phoenix: Then later when I went back, I found him lying there.Press Mia: Mia: So you say you went back... Phoenix: Umm, yeah. That's when I found the body. Mia: Yes, but why did you go back in the first place? Weren't you angry with him? Phoenix: Well, th-that's right, I was. ... Mia: Then why, Mr. Wright? Why did you go back there? Phoenix: ... Umm... I thought maybe we could make up. Mia: ... Payne: ... Judge: ... Phoenix: ... *achoo* *achoo* Mia: (Judging by the atmosphere... I'm pretty sure no one is buying this.)Phoenix: I'd been taking Coldkiller X for the last 2 or 3 days...Press Mia: Mia: It's rather unusual to catch a cold this time of the year, isn't it? Phoenix: Yeah, I always get a little careless when the weather starts to warm up. I guess I shouldn't sleep with the window open this early in spring, huh? Mia: (I suppose common sense is not always common...) So... Did anyone else know that you were taking cold medicine? Phoenix: Well, I always took one after meals... So I'm pretty sure all my friends knew about it.Phoenix: But I lost my bottle of it around lunchtime on the day of the accident.Press Mia: Mia: On the day of the incident, what did you do for lunch...? Phoenix: Huh? What does that have to do with anything? Mia: You can never be too sure... Phoenix: I always eat with Dollie... Just the two of us. Dollie's homemade lunches are just the greatest! Mmm! Her mini-omelettes are magically delicious! Eheh heh heh. Grossberg: Yeowch!! Wh-Why did you punch me in the jaw!? Mia: Oh! I-I'm so sorry...! I just felt like hurting someone all of a sudden!Grossberg: Well, Mia?Mia: I don't know... I can't seem to find any contradictions.Grossberg: The boy isn't exactly what I'd call a natural-born liar, you know. But still, we can't have him continue to spout nonsense.Mia: I know... But what can I do!?Grossberg: Well, I'm certain he must still be hiding something. Information! Right now it's information we need more than anything else!After pressing sixth statement and selecting \"About Pharmacology Dept.\" upon pressing second statement:Judge: I think that's enough for now. So the defendant and the victim met at approximately the time of his death. And then the defendant returned to the scene for some unknown reason.Payne: I'm not entirely convinced by his explanation about the medicine bottle either.Judge: Let me be frank here, Mr. Wright. Your testimony cannot be trusted.Phoenix: Wh-What do you mean!?Payne: Hee, hee, hee, hee... I knew it was too much work for a little girl.Mia: Hmph...!Judge: However, there is one mystery that still remains.Payne: There is, Your Honor?Judge: How the murder was carried out, of course. Just how was the victim electrocuted? I don't believe the murder weapon has been produced yet, correct?Payne: Well, that is... I... You are correct, Your Honor.Mia: (So how exactly was Mr. Swallow killed...? If I could somehow establish how it was done... Maybe I could still come out of this mess smelling like a rose!)Establish murder method Leads to: \"Your Honor!\"Can't right now Mia: (Hmm, I do have one idea, but it would be impossible to prove it.) Grossberg: Mia, m'dear. If you have any ideas, now is the time to present them. Mia: Mr. Grossberg! Grossberg: Remember, silence is NOT golden. ...In court, anyway. Mia: (Silence is not golden, huh? Well in that case...) Leads to: \"Your Honor!\"Mia: Your Honor!Judge: Y-Yes, Ms. Fey?Mia: I believe that if we were to piece together everything we've heard up until now... ...we should be able to solve the mystery of how Mr. Swallow died.Judge: Th-That would be most impressive!Payne: Hee, hee, hee, hee... Quite the brash statement coming from a rookie! But even a beginner like you must understand the basic rules of the court, yes? An attorney must be able to substantiate their arguments with evidence!Mia: Hmph! Of course I know that! (Actually, I had totally forgotten about that...)Judge: Now then, Ms. Fey. Let me see what you've got. Show me how you believe the victim was electrocuted!Present Crime Photo 1 Mia: Leads to: \"As for the cause of death...\"Present anything else Mia: Judge: Ms. Fey, I'm deeply disappointed in you. Payne: I'm disappointed as well, Ms. Fey. Grossberg: To be honest, I'm a bit disappointed too, Mia. Phoenix: ... *achoo* Mia: (Argh! I need to use my brain on this! Come on, Mia! You can't strike out here!) Leads back to: \"Now then, Ms. Fey. Let me see what you've got.\"Mia: As for the cause of death... ...I'd say this picture captures it quite well!Judge: Wh-What!? But there is nothing that even remotely resembles a murder weapon here... Hmm, I'm afraid the defense is going to have to explain this in a bit more detail. Ms. Fey, where exactly in this photo is the murder weapon?Present downed power line Mia: Leads to: \"Well, naturally... it's right here!\"Present anywhere else Mia: Mia: Well naturally... it's right around here! ...I think. Judge: Ms. Fey, I'm deeply disappointed in you. Payne: I'm disappointed as well, Ms. Fey. Grossberg: To be honest, I'm a bit disappointed too, Mia. Phoenix: ... *achoo* Mia: (Argh! I need to use my brain on this! Come on, Mia! You can't strike out here!) Leads back to: \"Ms. Fey, where exactly in this photo is the murder weapon?\"Mia: Well, naturally... it's right here!Judge: That's... That's... What is that?Mia: A severed electrical cable, I believe... Your Honor. Remember the testimony we've heard. The machines the pharmacology students use in their experiments require high voltage... ...and because of that, there are special high-voltage cables strung up everywhere!Judge: So then, the high-voltage cable...!Mia: Yes, the high-voltage cable is the cause of death. That is the most likely explanation!Judge: Hmm... That certainly sounds plausible. Well, Mr. Payne? What do you have to say about this?Payne: Well... I believe some praise is in order.Mia: Don't toy with me, old man!Payne: Now, now. The victim's cause of death may indeed have been a high-voltage cable. However! I want you to think about what that really implies! The only one who had the opportunity to use the cable as a murder weapon was... The defendant!Phoenix: ... *achoo*Judge: Hmm... That much is certainly true.Payne: Yes, and that's not all. We have proof. Irrefutable proof that will establish that Mr. Wright was the murderer.Judge: Y-You do!? Well, what is it!?Payne: His fingerprints.Judge: Fingerprints...? You mean that the defendant's fingerprints were on something besides the medicine bottle?Payne: Let's take another look at the crime scene photo. As you can see, the victim is wearing a leather jacket. And as you may know, leather holds fingerprints quite well.Mia: Ah! Y-You mean...?Payne: Yes. It was quite clearly imprinted on the chest area of the victim's jacket. The palm print of the defendant's very own hand!Judge: Wh-Whaaat!?Payne: I can only think of one way Mr. Wright could have left a print like that. Intent on murder, he squarely pushed the victim towards the severed electrical cable!Judge: Order! Order! Order! That's enough! I think we can conclude that there is no reason to continue with this cross-examination.Grossberg: Stick a fork in us, we're done.Mia: M-Mr. Grossberg!Grossberg: My hemorrhoids never lie. The show is over, Mia. I knew that boy was guilty the first time I saw him.Mia: N-No! You're wrong! Mr. Wright is innocent.Judge: No further evidence is required to convince me of this man's guilt!Mia: Y-Your Honor...!Judge: At this time, I am prepared to render a verdict in this case!Mia:Judge: Do you have something further to add, Ms. Fey?Mia: Is this what you want, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix: ...!Mia: You still haven't told us the truth... the whole truth. If you don't say something now, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!Phoenix: B-But I... I can't! I-I just can't say it! If I told you what really happened, then I'd b-be...Mia: It's OK, Mr. Wright. I'm your attorney. You can trust me.Phoenix: M-Miss Fey...Mia: No matter what it is you have to say... I believe in you and I'll represent you to the very end.Phoenix: ...!Payne:Payne: We've already established the defendant's guilt. There's no further need for him to say anything.Phoenix: *cough* *cough* W-Wait a minute!Mia: Mr. Wright...Phoenix: I... I'll tell you what really happened!Payne:Payne: But I've already told you, Mr. Wright. There's no need for further...Phoenix: *cough* I-I-I... I did it... I admit it! I pushed him! It's my fault... My f-fault that D-Doug Swallow is dead!That girl... You shouldn't see her anymore.Hey! It's none of your business!I'm telling you for your sake. If you continue to see her, it's going to be bad news.Y-You're lying!Just listen to me. There's something you need to know about that girl......Stop it! D-Don't talk about her like that!Judge: ... What you just said... Was that the truth!?Phoenix: Y-Yes, I... I was afraid... Afraid that if I told the truth... ...everyone would think I was the murderer for sure!Judge: Well, as things currently stand, we're all absolutely convinced you are!Phoenix: P-Please...! Please give me one more chance to explain! This time I swear... I swear I'll tell the whole truth! It'll be OK, won't it, Miss Fey? I... I believe in you!Mia: Oh! Um, th-thank you. (I still can't believe it... He really did push the victim...)Grossberg: Unnngh... It feels like my hemorrhoids are doing the Harlem Shake!Witness Testimony-- When I Pushed The Victim --Phoenix: That guy... He was talking bad about Dollie... I lost my temper and gave him a shove! At that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise... A little while after I left, I started to get worried. So I went back. But h-he was just lying there, d-dead!Payne: Well, the explanation is really quite simple. When you pushed him, Mr. Swallow flew back and touched the electrical cable. He died from the shock. And that, as they say, is that.Judge: Hmm... A simple explanation indeed.Payne: At the time of the incident, a light rain had been falling. Wet from the rain, the victim was more easily electrocuted.Phoenix: B-But! When I pushed him, there weren't any electrical cables nearby! If there had been something like that, even I would've noticed it!Mia: (That's true... Even a dufus like him couldn't miss that!)Judge: Hmm... Ms. Fey. Let me warn you right now that if your cross-examination doesn't yield any new facts... ...I intend to deliver my verdict without further delay. Are we clear on that?Mia: Y-Yes, Your Honor. (Don't give up, Mia! If he is innocent, there must be some kind of evidence somewhere that will prove it!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- When I Pushed The Victim --Phoenix: That guy... He was talking bad about Dollie...Press Mia: Mia: So what kinds of things did Mr. Swallow say to you? Phoenix: He said all sorts of terrible things about Dollie! He said that she was a bad girl! Payne: ... Mia: ... Judge: ... Umm... Is that all? Phoenix: Yup! Judge: Well, Ms. Fey, you heard him yourself. Mia: (Oh boy! You're not doing yourself any favors here, Mr. Wright! Please don't make this harder for me than it already is!) Phoenix: Anyway... After he said that, I just, I just...Phoenix: I lost my temper and gave him a shove!Press Mia: Mia: Can you tell me about what happened in a little more detail? Phoenix: That guy... He just said what he wanted to say to me... And then he put on the jacket he was holding and started to leave. That's when... That's when I lost my temper and flew into a furious frenzy! I just gave him a... light, gentle shove to the chest. Mia: And when you did that, there was no severed cable anywhere to be seen? Phoenix: Right! There was nothing like that at all! Payne: But is it possible that you merely overlooked it? Phoenix: ... Well, I guess it's possible. Mia: (What are you doing!? Don't let that guy steamroll over you like cheap asphalt!) Judge: I believe what's important here is the moment the push occurred. Let's continue on with the testimony, witness.Phoenix: At that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...Press Mia: Mia: A \"loud noise\"? And what would you say that loud noise was, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I'm not sure... But it was really loud! It was like, \"SNAP!\"... You know, come to think of it, I wonder what that was... Payne: Hee, hee, hee, hee... Clearly, Your Honor, it was the sound of the victim being electrocuted. Mia: Mia: Y-You're not qualified to decide that! (What should I do? I'm treading on some dangerous ground here...) Ask for more details Mia: Mr. Wright, that \"loud noise\" you heard may be extremely important. So try to remember what it was! Phoenix: Umm, how do I put it... It was like a sharp crack. Aha! Could it... Could it have been...? Mia: Yes? Could it have been? Hurry up and tell us! Phoenix: When I pushed him, he dropped the umbrella he was holding. He fell right on top of it, and it broke. That was probably the noise I heard. Judge: An umbrella, huh? And did that umbrella belong to the victim? Phoenix: Yeah, it was a plastic umbrella. Cheap and frail, kind of like the owner! Then again, I wish I had any kind of umbrella. I was totally soaked to the bone. Judge: Hmm... Ms. Fey. What do you think? Is there something important in that testimony just now? Mia: Umm, well... Of course it's important! Mia: (This is it, Mia! The new information you've been waiting for!) Of course it's important! No! This cheap umbrella is more than important; it's vital! I want to officially have it entered into the testimony! Payne: Ha! How perfectly fitting. Flimsy information for a flimsy lawyer! Judge: The court agrees to the defense's request. Witness, please add the bit about the cheap umbrella to your testimony. Changes statement from \"At that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...\" to \"After I shoved him, he... He fell down on top of his cheap umbrella.\" Of course it's not important! Mia: Of course it's not important! Judge: M-Ms. Fey! How can you state that so proudly!? Mia: Well, it just isn't! It's not important one bit! Not even one iota. OK? Grossberg: Mia! That's enough! You're making a fool of yourself! Phoenix: Umm... Is it OK if I go on? Leads back to cross-examination Leave it alone Mia: (I've got other, more pressing things to ask about.) Very well, Mr. Wright, let's move on, shall we? Leads back to cross-examinationPhoenix: After I shoved him, he... He fell down on top of his cheap umbrella.Press Mia: Mia: So Mr. Swallow fell on top of his umbrella? And you are certain of this? Phoenix: Yeah. It was right there under him. Actually, if it hadn't been under him, I was planning on borrowing it for myself. Mia: The umbrella, you mean? Phoenix: Well yeah, you see I was wearing this sweater here... Dollie stayed up late for nights at a time knitting it for me... I didn't want the rain to dampen the handmade symbol of her love... Grossberg: Oomph! My stomach is not to be used as your personal soccer ball, Mia! Mia: Ah! I-I'm so sorry! Judge: Continue on with your testimony, witness.Present Crime Photo 1 Mia: Leads to: \"Why didn't you testify about the umbrella from the very beginning?\"Phoenix: A little while after I left, I started to get worried.Press Mia: Mia: After you shoved the victim, did you leave the scene right away? Phoenix: Yes, I did! I admit it! I-I was furious! Payne: You left without even checking Mr. Swallow's condition? Phoenix: Well, um, yeah... But like I said, I got worried about him later.Phoenix: So I went back. But h-he was just lying there, d-dead!Press Mia: Mia: At that time, did you see anyone else at the scene of the crime? Phoenix: *cough* *cough*... *cough* *cough* *cough* Um, nope. Nobody... Mia: (Geez. Could that stupid cough possibly sound any phonier?) Judge: Hmm... In that case, it's very hard to believe someone else could have been the murderer...Grossberg: Unless we can find something that shows his innocence from that testimony, m'dear... I'm afraid the judge will make his final decision with no remorse whatsoever!Mia: Y-Yes, sir!

After hiding such important facts...Phoenix: B-But...! But the next witness is my Dollie, right? She'll save me! I just know she will!Mia: Why do you think that?Phoenix: Huh!? What do you mean!? She... She's the love of my life, that's why!Mia: The love of your life, huh... Would you mind telling me more about you and... Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne?Phoenix: Sure! No problem! Dollie and I... We first met about eight months ago right here in this very courthouse. Actually, I'm studying to be a lawyer, on the side... Anyway! One day, she and I just bumped into each other in the reading room downstairs. That's why I really think it was fate that brought us together. As soon as I first set eyes on her, I knew she was the one for me. Oh, here! Take a look at this!Mia: ...!Phoenix: She gave this to me the day we met as a symbol of our love! She had been wearing it around her neck that day, but then... ...she took it off, but before she gave it to me she said, \"I want you to carry this.\"Grossberg: So she gave it to you as a present, I see.Phoenix: This darling little bottle is filled with memories of my darling little Dollie!Mia: It certainly is a little bottle alright.Phoenix: It makes me so happy, I show it to everyone I meet!

The day you first met Dahlia Hawthorne, eight months ago... It wouldn't happen to have been on August 27th, would it?Phoenix: Huh...? Y-Yeah, it was... But how did you...?Mia: This happened on August 27th, right here in this courthouse.Phoenix: What's this? A newspaper clipping?

There's no need to be nervous!Payne: If anyone says anything rude, you can be sure, I'll cut them right down to size!Judge: And I will bash them with my gavel!Mia: (I love how they look straight at me when they say that...)Dahlia: Um, thank you... for calming my nerves. You are all so nice... I almost feel right at home.Payne: Not at all!Judge: It was nothing!Mia: If we may move on now... What is your full name and occupation?Dahlia: My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I'm a junior in Literature at Ivy University. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.Payne: The honor is all mine!Judge: No... The honor is all mine.Mia: (Well, we know whose milkshake brings all the boys to the yard...)Dahlia: ...Umm. Sir?Payne: Is there something I can help you with?Judge: You just go on and say whatever is on your mind!Dahlia: I'm sure that there must be some kind of mistake. Feenie wouldn't kill anyone. I just know it!Judge: Yes, yes... I can see why you'd say that.Mia: (She's going to be a tough witness, alright... It only took her 12 seconds to wrap them all around her little finger.)Judge: Now then, please proceed with your testimony. Let's hear about what you witnessed on the day of the incident, if you please.Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed --Dahlia: I had been planning to go back to Feenie's place after class was over. Feenie and Dougie... They were talking behind the building. Then suddenly... Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed. That's when Feenie noticed that I was there. I went to go and find some other students and they called the authorities.Judge: I-I don't know what to say! According to you, Ms. Hawthorne... ...the defendant didn't do anything wrong!Payne:Payne: Young lady. As old as I am, even I recall how hot the flames of young passion can burn. Nevertheless... It is my job to discover the truth. Please, tell us the truth...Dahlia: But... But, I... I would never...Mia:Mia: That's more than enough, witness. I won't allow this to continue.Judge: Wh-What do you mean by that?Mia: Please, just let me proceed with my cross-examination, Your Honor. I, for one, don't plan to win my case on a bunch of paper-thin lies!Dahlia: ...Tee hee. You haven't changed a bit... Mia Fey.Mia: ...Payne: What's this? So, you two are... acquainted?Mia: Yes. We've met before... Once.Dahlia: ...Judge: In any case, Ms. Fey, the floor is all yours.Dahlia: It's good to see you again, Madame Fey!Mia: \"Madame\"!? (I'm no one's grandma yet, girlie!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What I Witnessed --Dahlia: I had been planning to go back to Feenie's place after class was over.Press Mia: Mia: Now, unless I'm mistaken, Feenie -- I mean, Mr. Wright is in the Art Department. If that's the case, then what were you doing by the Pharmacology building? Dahlia: Well... I'm in the Literature Department. I'm studying Japanese Senryu poetry. Judge: Oho hoh! How wonderful! It's that humorous, yet satirical style of haiku, yes? Dahlia: \"Nothing left to do... When a man reaches this age, sleep is his best friend.\" Mia: (That's supposed to be poetry? Sounds more like a mid-life crisis!) Dahlia: For me to get to the Art Department, I have to walk through that back area. Judge: Ah, yes I see. That makes sense. When I want to enter the courthouse, I always walk through the front doors. Mia: (How else would you enter? Teleportation!?)Dahlia: Feenie and Dougie...They were talking behind the building.Press Mia: Mia: So who is this \"Dougie\" person? Dahlia: Oh, I'm sorry. Doug Swallow. We were dating until about eight months ago... Mia: So what were Dougie-- *ahem* Mr. Swallow and Mr. Wright talking about anyway? Dahlia: ... H-How can you be so mean? I would never... I would never eavesdrop... I wasn't raised to be so rude and unrefined! Payne: That's right, Ms. Fey! Judge: Don't drag the witness down to your level! Mia: (Why am I being demonized here?) Judge: Please, go on. What did you see next?Dahlia: Then suddenly... Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed.Press Mia: Mia: Are you saying that the victim just collapsed on his own? Dahlia: Y-Yes. Mia: In other words, the defendant never touched the victim. Is that right? Dahlia: I was watching the whole time. Feenie never did a thing to Dougie! Mia: (If I press her for no good reason, I just know the judge will get angry with me... Hmm, so what should I do about her testimony just now?) Leave it alone Mia: (Hmm... I suppose her statement works in our favor, for now. I'll hold off on looking into it any deeper until it's necessary.) Judge: Very well, young lady, please go on with your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Show contradiction Mia: Feeble lies are not very becoming, Ms. Hawthorne, so let's drop them, shall we? Dahlia: Wh-What...! I...! I would never...! Payne: Payne: Ms. Fey! I will not allow you to badger this witness! Mia: ... Payne: I-I believe the defense is engaged in a-a... fishing expedition. Mia: ... Payne: That is... Err... She has no supporting... Mia: ... Payne: P-Please don't glare at me like that...! I-I'm just doing my job! Mia: Now then, Ms. Hawthorne. The defendant's palmprint was found on Mr. Swallow's leather jacket. It has already been shown that Mr. Wright did, in fact, push the victim. Dahlia: What...? Mia: There's no need to try to cover for the defendant. It would be much better if you came out and told us the whole truth. Judge: Hmm... There's nothing to worry about, young lady. Just tell us everything that you saw. Dahlia: Y-Yes, Your Honor... I-I will. If you don't mind, I-I'd like to revise my testimony. Mia: (Looks like we're finally getting somewhere...) Changes statement from \"Then suddenly... Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed.\" to \"Um, actually, I didn't see the moment he pushed Dougie.\" Changes statement from \"That's when Feenie noticed that I was there.\" to \"It didn't look like they were fighting, and I didn't hear anything unusual either.\"Dahlia: Um, actually, I didn't see the moment he pushed Dougie.Press Mia: Mia: You didn't see it!? Dahlia: Well, I saw the moment when Dougie fell to the ground... Payne: And at that time, there was only the two of them at the scene? The defendant, Phoenix Wright, and the victim, Doug Swallow? Dahlia: Yes... that's right.Dahlia: That's when Feenie noticed that I was there.Press Mia: Mia: And what did Mr. Wright say when he saw you? Dahlia: I-I'm sorry. I-I was so flustered that I... I really don't remember. P-Please forgive me. Mia: You don't remember...? Judge: Well, that's common enough. Sometimes I can't recall a sentence I passed only minutes prior! Mia: (Please... Someone, anyone... Stop him before he gets hurt... by me.)Dahlia: It didn't look like they were fighting, and I didn't hear anything unusual either. (Changed from [It didn't look like they were fighting, and I didn't hear any noise either.] in the original release)Press Mia: Mia: So then, what did it look like they were doing to you? Dahlia: I thought they were having a nice, friendly afternoon conversation. Mia: (Oh, give me a break!) Dahlia: That's why I really wasn't watching them all that closely. Judge: Did you notice anything out of the ordinary at all? Dahlia: No, nothing at all... Mr. Judge. Judge: Oh, I like the sound of that! \"Mr. Judge\"... Now then, please proceed with your testimony.Present Phoenix's Testimony Mia: Leads to: \"You say you \"didn't hear anything unusual\". Is that correct?\"Dahlia: I went to go and find some other students and they called the authorities.Press Mia: Mia: When you say \"students\" do you mean students from the Pharmacology Department? Dahlia: Yes. They're all very fond of their drugs... Mia: Please try to stay on topic! So to find some Pharmacology students, you went to the labs, correct? Dahlia: That's what I was planning to do... But in the end, I wound up not going. A group of about 10 research students came running out of the building entrance. Somehow they all seemed to know what was going on... Mia: (The students knew what was going on...?) Leave it alone Mia: (The Pharmacology students... They have nothing to do with the incident. I think what I need is more information about Dahlia herself.) Leads back to cross-examination Press for more details Mia: But how could the students have known what was going on? Dahlia: Well...

It doesn't look like I'm going to get any more info about the students.) Payne: So did the students call the police? Dahlia: Y-Yes. I-I was just so... I was so panicked... Judge: Hmm. Yes, well anyone would have been, my dear. Leads back to cross-examinationMia: (That girl... She's telling a super obvious lie, and she knows it. She's just pretending to protect Mr. Wright...

You mean that both of your ears were covered?Dahlia: The rain was just beginning to let up... But it seemed as though Thor wasn't ready for his fun to come to an end yet.

Well, Your Honor? As you can see, there weren't any contradictions in her testimony after all.Judge: Hmm...Mia: (Wait a sec, Mia! That testimony just now... She said something that could totally change this whole case!)She didn't hear anything. Mia: Your Honor! There is a problem with the witness's testimony! Judge: Wh-What do you mean!? Payne: Wh-What is this \"problem\"!? Mia: It's obvious. The problem is that the witness claims to have not heard the \"SNAP!\" Payne: Payne: A-Are you deaf!? Did you pay attention to the testimony!? She said she didn't hear it because she was listening to music with her headphones! Judge: Ms. Fey! I'm surprised you're going senile before me! Mia: (I'm not THAT bad! ...I think.) Judge: Well, the testimony we've just heard seems to be very decisive. The only one that could have killed the victim was the defendant, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Dahlia: N-No! Please...! I-I never meant to incriminate him! Mia: (This is bad, Mia! If you don't do something, we're going to lose this!! Think again! What is it about this testimony that doesn't make sense...?) Leads back to: \"She said something that could totally change this whole case!)\"She was listening to music. Mia: Your Honor! There is a problem with the witness's testimony!

Did you pay attention to the testimony!? She explained she was listening to music to cover up the sound of thunder! Judge: Ms. Fey! I must warn you that I can be even more frightening than Zeus when I'm angry! Mia: (Yikes! I'm in trouble now!) Judge: Well, the testimony we've just heard seems to be very decisive.

There is a problem with the witness's testimony!Judge: Wh-What do you mean!?Mia: Didn't you notice? She said there was lightning, correct?Judge: Yes... What about it?Mia: Well, lightning is actually a large discharge of electricity in the atmosphere, am I right?Judge: Now's not the time for a science lesson, Ms. Fey!Mia: Yes, Your Honor. Anyway, since the cause of death was electrocution... ...isn't it possible that the victim died from being hit by a bolt of lightning!?Judge: Oh!Payne: Ah!Dahlia: ...!Judge: Hmm... I must admit that the thought had not occurred to me!Mia: (Just what kind of thoughts DO occur to this guy anyway?) This entire case is built on the premise that Mr. Doug Swallow was \"murdered\"... ...but that very premise itself is mistaken! The defense believes that Mr. Swallow was, in fact, the victim of a stray bolt!Judge: I-It appears the defense may be on to something! Could it be that the death was actually accidental?Mia: (Alright, you did it, Mia! I'll be taking that \"Not Guilty\" now if you don't--)Payne:Payne: Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee... I'm hurt that you have such a low opinion of me, Ms. Fey.Mia: Huh...?Payne: I'm not a fool, you know. The prosecution has done its research, Your Honor. We found that there were no lightning strikes on that day at that location!Mia: Whaaa!?Payne: What's more... We have evidence that the electrical cable is definitely linked to this case.Judge: E-Evidence, Mr. Payne!? Well, what is this evidence?Payne: This affidavit.Judge: And who is this affidavit from?Payne: The Pharmacology students who were conducting experiments in their labs that day. Allow me to read out to the court the testimony of the Pharmacology students. \"All equipment in the labs lost power all of a sudden at around 3:00 PM that day.\"Judge: Was it a blackout?Payne: All of the labs' equipment runs of high-voltage, Your Honor.Mia: So you're saying the equipment lost power because...Payne: Precisely. They lost power because of the severed electrical cable. The power outage occurred at approximately 3:00 PM...Judge: Which fits with the time of death listed in the autopsy report.Payne: Exactly! In other words... The victim died as a result of touching the severed electrical cable. According to the students, the cables were very old. They were planning on having them replaced in the near future.Judge: Hmm, I see...Payne: Apparently the cables had become so brittle... ...that even the smallest bump would've caused them to break.Students' Testimony added to the Court Record.Judge: However... There is one thing that troubles me. If the cable could have been broken by any small bump... ...then it wouldn't have snapped if it hadn't been bumped into, correct?Payne: W-Well... I suppose you could say that.Judge: Hmm, Ms. Fey. Do you have any thoughts regarding the cause of the severed cable?Mia: Y-Your Honor... (I don't like how this is looking one bit! I have to come up with something to try to regain some momentum!) If it pleases the court, the defense would like to state its opinion.Judge: Well then, let's hear it. Who or what was it that caused the cable to break?Present Phoenix's Testimony or Phoenix Wright profile Mia: Leads to: \"Your Honor. Please think back to Mr. Wright's testimony.\"Present anything else Mia: Mia: This is it! This is why the cable snapped. Payne: Well, Your Honor? Judge: I believe that the only thing that has snapped is the mind of the defense. Payne: Ah, that was one of your best lines yet, Your Honor. Mia: Nnnfff...! (Ouch, that was harsh...) Please, Your Honor! Give me one more chance! Leads back to: \"Well then, let's hear it.\"Mia: Your Honor. Please think back to Mr. Wright's testimony.Judge: The defendant's testimony?Mia: He said that after he pushed the victim, he heard a loud, sharp noise. Now, this happened at around 3:00 PM, correct?Judge: Yes, that sounds right. Wait! Are you saying that...Mia: The lab equipment lost power at 2:55 PM... which fits right in Mr. Wright's timeline. In other words, it was Mr. Wright's shove that caused the power outage.Payne: Yes! The prosecution also came to that same conclusion. And it was that very shove that caused Mr. Swallow to be electrocuted!Mia:Mia: I'm afraid I can't agree with you there, Mr. Payne.Payne: Wh-What's that supposed to mean?Mia: Take a good look at where the victim landed after being shoved. See the umbrella? It's by the electrical pole. That's right. The victim banged into that pole as a result of being pushed. It was that impact that caused the cable to break.Judge: Hmm... Well, that makes sense. And then the victim was electrocuted.Mia: I'm sorry Your Honor, but no. It doesn't make sense at all. If the victim was shoved into the far pole... ...then he couldn't have been electrocuted by this severed cable in the foreground here!Payne: AAAAAAAAAAHH!!Mia: In other words... Someone other than my client must have electrocuted the victim!Judge: Order! Order in the court!Mia: (Ah, the lamentations of my enemy. How I've longed to hear them!)Judge: It-It's true... The defense is absolutely correct! There doesn't seem to be any way the defendant could have done it--Dahlia: Umm... Mr. Judge, sir? May I say something? The madame attorney's explanation... She said some things that are a little different than I remember them.Judge: Wh-Wh-Payne: Wh-Wh-Mia: What the...!?Dahlia: Please, just once more. May I please testify one last time? Please... Mr. Judge?Judge: Of course it's alright! Just go right ahead and give your new testimony!Mia: (This is it... She's finally starting to show her true colors!)Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed, Part 2 --Dahlia: The truth is... Feenie pushed him twice. The first time was into the electrical pole. That's when the cable broke. Then Dougie tried his best to run away from him... But Feenie caught up and crashed into him from behind. The cable snapping, and Dougie being electrocuted -- it all occured [sic] in less than a minute.Judge: Hmm...

Well I have evidence that suggests that she, in fact, had a very good reason!Judge: Very well then, the court grants the defense's request. Young lady. Would you mind staying on for just a bit longer?Dahlia: Of course not, Mr. Judge.Mia: (Get ready for the battle of your life, Dahlia Hawthorne!)Witness Testimony-- How I Met My Feenie --Dahlia: I first met my darling Feenie eight months ago.

That's a strange place to meet the love of your life. Dahlia: That's not true, Madame Fey. After all, Feenie was... Feenie was not only an art student, but he was also planning on becoming a lawyer. Mia: I'm not talking about him. I'm talking about you, Ms. Hawthorne. What was a literature student like you doing in a courthouse reading room? Payne: Payne: This line of questioning is a waste of time! It has nothing to do with our murder case! Judge: Ms. Fey, I'm warning you. If this has nothing to do with Mr. Swallow's case... Mia: (I have to remember the judge is on Dahlia's side. I'd better tread carefully...) Wait and see Mia: (Mia, if the judge gets any angrier, you'll lose the whole case! I'll just have to hold my tongue for the time being.) Judge: Now then, young lady, please go on with your testimony. Tell us about the time you first met Phoenix Wright. Leads back to cross-examination Keep pressing Mia: Your Honor, if you'll allow me some latitude, I think I can establish relevance. Please ask her to continue on with her testimony! Judge: Very well. Young lady, I've got a simple question for you. What were you doing downstairs in the courthouse reading room? Dahlia: If it pleases Your Honor, the answer is simply this. Adds statement \"I had come to this courthouse to do some research for a paper I was writing.\"Press (after adding statement) Mia: Mia: The courthouse reading room? That's a strange place to meet the love of your life. Dahlia: That's not true, Madame Fey. After all, Feenie was... Feenie was not only an art student, but he was also planning on becoming a lawyer. Mia: I'm not talking about him. I'm talking about you, Ms. Hawthorne. What was a literature student like you doing in a courthouse reading room? Dahlia: Tee hee. There's nothing strange about that, ma'am.Dahlia: I had come to this courthouse to do some research for a paper I was writing.Press Mia: Mia: You were writing a paper? On what? Dahlia: On the relationship between modern Senryu poetry and the criminal underworld. Judge: Ho ho ho. That sounds like a fascinating research idea. Dahlia: \"Am I getting old? Now I've even forgotten what I've forgotten...\" Mia: (Again with the mid-life crisis stuff!?) Grossberg: Mia, why did that girl really come to this courthouse? Isn't that what you wanted to know? And speaking of forgetting things, you haven't forgotten the police report, have you? I went through a lot of trouble to get it, m'dear, so be sure to read it carefully.Present Police Report Mia: Leads to: \"Ms. Hawthorne, you weren't here because of your research paper, were you?\"Dahlia: The moment our eyes met, my heart skipped a beat!Press Mia: Mia: Hmm... So what was it about Mr. Wright that made your heart malfunction like that? In my personal opinion, he just looks like a typical snotty-nosed college brat. Dahlia: Perhaps to a woman your age. But to me, Feenie is handsome! Mia: Perhaps to you, Ms. Hawthorne. But to the rest of the planet, he's a dime a dozen. Payne: Payne: Love is a mysterious thing, and I object to this line of questioning! If you were to look at my wife for example, you might all be shocked! Judge: He's telling the truth. It was truly, truly shocking. Dahlia: \"Beautiful mushroom, growing tall in the darkness. It comes from cow dung.\" That's the poem that best describes how I feel about my Feenie.Dahlia: We've been going out ever since that fateful day.Press Mia: Mia: Were there any bad feelings between you and Mr. Swallow? Dahlia: No, none at all. We parted on very good terms. Mia: But that can't be! Payne: Payne: Our investigation also shows that it was a clean breakup. Mia: Huh... Are you... Are you sure? Payne: Yes, it seems that they both wanted it that way. Mia: (So the victim wanted to break up with her...?) Press further Mia: So you're saying that Mr. Swallow also wanted to break up with you? Dahlia: W-Well, y-you see... Payne: Payne: What a cruel thing to ask a lovely young lady like this! ... By the way, I have never ONCE considered leaving MY wife! Judge: No one cares, Mr. Payne. Mia: (She didn't deny it... That must mean... Doug Swallow must have seen through her little act. He must have gotten a glimpse of her true nature.)

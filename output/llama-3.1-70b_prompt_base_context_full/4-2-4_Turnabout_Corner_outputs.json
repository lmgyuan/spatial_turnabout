Spinning big crimes and little crimes together. And when the Wheel stops... You die. June 15, 9:12 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Examine evidence Attorney's Badge Back side Apollo: There's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it. Apollo: (Two months have passed since Mr. Gavin's arrest. My first trial, and I lost both my mentor and my job. Yeah, I'll admit it. I was screwed. But even when I hit bottom, I told myself I'd never come here. Honest. Here being the legendary Wright & Co. Law Offices. OK, Justice, time to stop trembling.) ???: Ah! You must be here for the interview. Right this way. Apollo: Huh? ???: Hello there! You've found the Wright place! Welcome! Apollo: Uh... Ah... (What's with this girl!?) ???: Well now, shall we begin? Apollo: Begin... what? ???: Right, first things first... Any special talents? Apollo: Erm, talents? ???: Yes, well, you must have at least one! Apollo: Well... Uh... I guess... Defending? ???: \"Defending\"... An unusual talent, but it'll do. With a little jazzing up, of course. Apollo: Y-You think so...? ???: Let's give it a go, shall we? Apollo: Huh? ???: Go ahead! Show me! Defend! Just give it all you've got. Don't hold back now! Apollo: Wh-What are you talking about? I can't just \"defend\" here! ???: First lesson: A professional can perform anywhere! Apollo: ...Thanks. ???: We want people to be laughing with us... ...not at us! Apollo: ...Thanks. But I'm not sure why they should be laughing at all. ???: What...? What exactly do you think you came here to do? Apollo: What? Um, defend... No? ???: ... Excuse me, but do you know where you are? Apollo: Huh!? The Wright & Co. Law Offices, right? ???: ...Oh. I was afraid of that. Don't worry, you're not the first. Apollo: Look, what's going on here? Who are you? I came here to meet with the person in charge... ???: Well, you've apparently made no fewer than two mistakes. Apollo: Mistakes? But I got a call from Mr. Wright this morning! ???: Perhaps you should go read the sign out front again? Apollo: What's there to read!? Look, it says right there... ...Oh. Why does it say \"Wright Talent Agency\"...? ???: Welcome to the Wright Talent Agency, where you've \"always come to the Wright place!\" Trucy: I'm Trucy Wright, CEO. I'm a magician. Apollo: (It all came flooding back... The trial... That girl...) ???: Hello, sir. Please, pick a card. Phoenix: That's right. She's my daughter. Apollo: Trucy... Wright. Trucy: Here, check out our flyer! So... what's your name? Apollo: Apollo... Apollo Justice, attorney at law. Examine Bookshelf Apollo: All these legal books must be Mr. Wright's leftovers... ...There's a lot of unrelated books in here, too. \"One Trick a Day\"... \"Magic for Idiots\"... You'd think a pro magician would aim a bit higher. Charley the plant Trucy: Ack! Don't touch Mr. Charley! Apollo: \"Mister\" Charley...? Trucy: He's been in this office much longer than I have! Daddy's mentor had a great fondness for Mr. Charley. He's lived here since Daddy was a rookie attorney! Apollo: Huh.  (Mr. Charley... riiight.) Trucy: Now I take care of him! Hula hoop Apollo: That's one of those hula hoop things everyone was crazy about way back when. Trucy: Really? I had no idea these were that popular! Apollo: I'm not so bad with one myself, actually. Trucy: Eh!? I-I'm still learning... So you can really make someone levitate with it? Show me! Apollo: Huh!? I-I have no idea how! (It's just a normal hula hoop, isn't it?) Magic split box Apollo: A strange, split box leers at me from the wall. Um, is this one of those boxes for cutting people in half? Trucy: That's right! This cabinet is used for an illusion called the \"Zig-Zag\"! Apollo: I've seen one on TV... But why is one just sitting here in your office? Trucy: Oh, it's a little big for me, you see. So I'm using it as furniture. Hats in the top, shirts in the middle, and pants down below! I think it's a nice touch... don't you? Apollo: (It's not exactly what I'd call a \"welcoming\" decor.) Photograph Apollo: An old, sepia-tinted photo of a man in a silk top hat. Trucy: That's my favorite magician! I want to be just like him someday! Apollo: (Sure, nice... Guess it's good to have a role model. Even if he's gotta be well over 100.) Trucy: How rude! Piano Apollo: There are all sorts of strange paraphernalia sitting on top of the piano. Trucy: Those are my magic props! Practice, practice, practice! A professional never leaves their weapons far from reach! Apollo: But you can't play the piano with all this junk on it. Trucy: Oh, no one plays here anyway. And the neighbors complain. Apollo: (I guess Mr. Wright really can't play...) Silk hat Apollo: A blue silk hat, just like the one Trucy is wearing. Trucy: Oh, that's just for show. Don't wear it, please! Apollo: (Last thought from my mind, honest.) Trucy: I put it there so clients can see it and know who I am. Nothing says \"magician\" like a silk top hat! Spaghetti Apollo: Whoa! That fork is floating! ...Not. Why do you have a plate of plastic spaghetti here? Trucy: That right there is the whole reason I became a magician! Apollo: Do tell. Trucy: I saw a plate just like that in a restaurant once. The floating fork looked so real! That's when I knew... Someday, I'd make magic more amazing than that spaghetti! Table Apollo: That table... doesn't look very sturdy. Trucy: You've never seen one of these? It's a magic table! Apollo: So, like, you make this teapot disappear? Trucy: So you might think! But that's not it... Before your very eyes, the contents of the pot change! ...From Earl Grey to Darjeeling! Apollo: Kinda hard to see the difference, I'd think... Move Apollo: (What's up with this \"Wright Talent Agency\"? Guess I'll talk to her and find out what I can.) Talk Wright Talent Agency Apollo: So... Is this really a talent agency? Trucy: You bet! Daddy started it seven years ago, when he quit law. Of course, we only have two people signed up right now. Apollo: Two people... Does that include you? Trucy: Trucy Wright, Magician Extraordinaire! I've done a lot of stage shows! Paid, too! I am a professional, you know. Apollo: Er... right. Trucy: Promise you'll come to one of my shows, OK? Let's see... Oh, and the other person our agency represents is... Phoenix Wright, Pianist Extra Ordinaire! Apollo: Your dad, in other words. Didn't he say he couldn't play the piano? Trucy: Our agency doesn't see that as a problem. Why, there are many magicians who can't do magic! Apollo: At least you're optimistic, I'll give you that. Trucy Wright Apollo: So you're his, er... you're Phoenix Wright's daughter? Trucy: That's right! After Daddy quit law seven years ago... ...I promised I would keep him fed! So I'm kind of his sugar daddy! Get it? Apollo: No. Trucy: I'm in charge of this whole office, too. Pretty amazing for a young lass of fifteen, wouldn't you agree!? Apollo: F-Fifteen? Uh, how old is Mr. Wright? Trucy: Daddy? Oh... he's 33 this year. Apollo: ...I'm sure there's a good explanation. (I hope...) Trucy: ? Phoenix Wright Apollo: Um, about Mr. Wright giving up law... It was because of that incident seven years ago, wasn't it...? Trucy: Eh? You know about that!? Apollo: Not the details. I remember the news, though. It was a big deal. Trucy: So I hear. I was too young to understand what was going on. I'll ask Daddy about it next time I get a chance. Apollo: Daddy, right... That reminds me. About Mr. Wright... He gave me a call this morning to come in. Trucy: Daddy's not here right now. He's in the hospital. Apollo: The hospital!? Trucy: Yeah. He's on strict bed rest until he gets better. Apollo: Wh... What!? Present Attorney's Badge Trucy: Oh, I've seen one of those before! That's an attorney's badge. It looks just like the one Daddy used to have. Now if I take this badge... And do this, and this... See! It's gone! Apollo: H-Hey! My badge! What'd you do with my badge!? Trucy: No need to worry! Just look in your pocket! Apollo: Huh! No way... My pocket? (Wait a second... There's something in there!) ... It's a flyer for your agency! Trucy: And here's your badge. You can have it back now. Apollo: (That's the last time I let her touch anything of mine. Period.) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: OK... Which hospital is Mr. Wright in? I'll pay him a visit. Trucy: Oh, the Hickfield Clinic. It's quite close. Apollo: Right. Well, I'll be going now. And I'll, uh... give this showbiz gig some thought, OK? Trucy: Wait! I'll go with you! June 15, 9:45 AMHickfield Clinic Apollo: (So... this is Mr. Wright's hospital...) ???: Eh? Visitors are ya? Hrmm? Apollo: Uh, yeah. Are you the... doctor? Hickfield: Ayup. Dr. Hickfield's the name. Eh he he. Trucy: Good morning, Doctor! Hickfield: Oh, hiya there, Trucy. Cute as ever! Eh he he. Trucy: Is... this Daddy's room? Hickfield: Oh yah. 'Cept he's gone for a mornin' checkup. Be back soon. How're you, Miss Trucy? Got any places you'd like... examined? Eh heh... Phoenix: Doctor... the nurse was looking for you. Hickfield: Why, if it isn't the Daddy o' the cutest lil' thing in town! Hrm. Hrmm. Guess I'll be off then. Eh he? Later, Trucy. Apollo: Wow, what an odd bird that guy was. Phoenix: Good morning. Didn't expect you so soon, Apollo. Apollo: Mr. Wright... Examine Bottle Trucy: Aaaah! Daddy! You snuck some grape juice in again!? The doctor said you weren't supposed to drink that here! Phoenix: Trucy. Look at the label. Trucy: ... Oh. \"Deep Sea Mineral Water\". That's fine, I guess. Phoenix: I switched the labels. Don't tell Trucy, 'kay? Apollo: (What can I say, the man loves his grape juice.) DVD stack Apollo: A swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. \"The Steel Samurai\", \"The Nickel Samurai\"... \"The Pink Princess\", \"The Zappy Samurai: Electric Bugaboo\"... They're all children's action hero shows... Phoenix: This \"kid\" I know keeps sending them to me. Apollo: Huh. Like a niece or nephew? Phoenix: ...Something like that. Apollo: Quite the collection. This kid's parents must be really generous with their allowance. (Funny, Mr. Wright doesn't seem the type that kids would like.) Hospital bed Apollo: Mr. Wright's bed... It's really messy. Trucy: Look how messy this is! You're just hopeless without me, aren't you, Daddy? Apollo: (Yikes! She's attempting to clean up! Look out!) Phoenix: Ah ha ha. You got me. What can I say? I was raised in a barn. Try not to let word get out, Apollo. If you don't mind. Apollo: (Yeah, it might ruin your illustrious career pretending to play the piano.) Piano Apollo: This looks like a child's toy piano. Phoenix: Gotta practice. Wouldn't want my fingers to get stiff. A pro always keeps his weapon close at hand. Shall I play you a tune? Apollo: Uh... no thanks. Phoenix: Ah, how unfortunate. I so rarely get a chance to play. Television Apollo: What's that on TV? Looks like some sort of action hero show... Trucy: Oh, I know that one! That's the Sniffling Samurai! His \"Booger Flick\" attack is a big hit with the grade school crowd. Apollo: I had no idea you liked this kind of stuff, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Well, what else is there to do when you're stuck in bed? Besides, the episodes will just keep piling up if I don't keep up, you know? Apollo: Um... yeah. (Try not buying them.) Phoenix: Now's the only time I get to watch and write up my reports. Apollo: Your... reports? Phoenix: It's a long story. Like a lot of things, actually. Talk What happened? Apollo: So... what happened? Phoenix: ...Who could have imagined it? Me, victim of a hit and run... Apollo: A hit and... You were hit by a car!? Phoenix: Oh, he tried to swerve, I'll give him that. Picture me tossed thirty feet through the air... ...only stopping when my head hit that telephone pole. Apollo: You hit a telephone pole with your head!? Are you OK!? Phoenix: Thankfully, my only injury was a sprained ankle. Apollo: (He really is as lucky as they say...) About Trucy... Apollo: There's something that, well, it just doesn't sit right. I just can't believe you have a daughter, Mr. Wright! And... she's so big! Not fat, but, er, you know what I mean. Phoenix: Oh, Trucy's still a child. Trucy: Daddy! How many times do I have to remind you! I'm not a child anymore! Phoenix: Ah ha ha! But you'll always be Daddy's little baby girl to me, Trucy. Apollo: (Ah ha ha, my foot. I'm not buying it.) Phoenix: Oh, something you should know about Trucy... Apollo: She's a magician, right? She told me. Phoenix: Not a mere stage magician... She's a genius. Trucy: Tee hee! Aw, Daddy! Phoenix: You'll soon come to appreciate her \"talent\". Apollo: You could just tell me things instead of insinuating them. Wright Talent Agency Apollo: So, why did you contact me? What could the Wright Talent Agency possibly want with me? Phoenix: No need to get prickly, now. Apollo: Hey, I didn't ask to be dragged in like this! Trucy: Huh? But didn't you come into the office of your own free will anyway? Apollo: Well, yeah, of course. \"Help! We're in big trouble here at the office! Big!\" ...I thought someone was dying. Phoenix: So you don't think this is big trouble? My talent agency represents only two people... and one of them is in the hospital. Trucy: That's right, Daddy! How are we going to pay this month's rent!? And the groceries!? Phoenix: Yeah... That's the problem with such a tight operation. It's a symbiotic relationship. When one of us falls, the other, too, must fall... Apollo: Hey! This isn't exactly a suitable conversation to be having with a 15-year-old kid! Phoenix: In any case, if Apollo here can't help you... ...you'll have to transfer to a new school. Again. Trucy: No! I can't! I only just made friends... How could you do this to me... to us!? Polly! Apollo: Huh? What? Now it's my fault? Phoenix: On that note, how about you come work for us? I've got the perfect client for you already lined up. Apollo: A... A client? (You mean I get to do my job? I get to defend in court!?) ...Alright. I'll hear what you have to say. Trucy: You got him, Daddy! Hook, line, and sinker! Phoenix: Ah ha. Now it's time to reel him in! Apollo: (It's official: I'm scared.) Our client (appears after \"Wright Talent Agency\") Apollo: Alright, so who's the client? Phoenix: Ah, yes. Here, take a look at the map and I'll explain. Last night, I left the office just before nine o'clock... I was going to that Indochine pasta joint, Alden Tae's. I play piano there, of course. ...That's when it happened! The car sent me flying, nicked a telephone pole... ...and zoomed away. Creepy, huh? Apollo: Just a tad. It's almost as creepy as hearing you tell the story like it was no big deal. Phoenix: The car sped off in this direction... ...So, good luck! Apollo: ...Huh? Phoenix: You wanted a client, didn't you? Well, I'm your client! Find the guy who knocked me into that telephone pole! Apollo: Whoa, hold on! I'm a defense attorney, not a detective! Phoenix: Don't worry. Once you've found the guy, I intend to sue him. Then you can stick it to him in court! Apollo: ...I'm not a prosecutor either! I'm sorry, but... this is crazy. I'm going home. Phoenix: Don't get so worked up. It was just a joke. Apollo: Huh? Trucy: Oh, Daddy. Sorry, Apollo. He just loves jokes, you know. Even the ones that aren't very funny. Phoenix: Your real client should be stopping by the office any time now. Apollo: The office... You mean the talent agency? (No harm in going. It's not like I have anything else to do.) Phoenix: ...One more thing. Do look into my accident too, would you? I marked the scene of the tragedy on this map. It's right in front of this park. Should be easy to find. Apollo: (So, he's going to make me investigate this after all...) Map added to the Court Record. Our client (subsequent times) Apollo: Alright, so who's the client? Phoenix: Ah, yes. Here, take a look at the map and I'll explain. Last night, I left the office just before nine o'clock... I was going to that Indochine pasta joint, Alden Tae's. I play piano there, of course. ...That's when it happened! The car sent me flying, nicked a telephone pole... ...and zoomed away. Creepy, huh? Apollo: Just a tad. It's almost as creepy as hearing you tell the story like it was no big deal. Phoenix: The car sped off in this direction... ...So, good luck! Apollo: ...Huh? Phoenix: You wanted a client, didn't you? Well, I'm your client! Find the guy who knocked me into that telephone pole! Apollo: Whoa, hold on! I'm a defense attorney, not a detective! Phoenix: Don't worry. Once you've found the guy, I intend to sue him. Then you can stick it to him in court! Apollo: ...I'm not a prosecutor either! I'm sorry, but... this is crazy. I'm going home. Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: What's that? Looks strangely familiar... Apollo: How could you not recognize an attorney's badge!? Phoenix: It's been seven years. I've forgotten... a lot of things. Apollo: (I guess some seven years are longer than others.) Map Phoenix: I've marked the location of the accident on your map. Find the criminal who knocked me into that telephone pole! After clearing \"Our client\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic: June 15, 10:05 AMWright Talent Agency ???: Hey hey hey! How long you planning on making me wait, eh!? Trucy: Ah! Good morning! ???: Hey there, Trucy-doll. Sounds like your pops had a bit of a rough spot, eh? Trucy: All's well that ends well, I guess... Apollo: (This... is our client?) ???: Hey! So this is that Pollo fellow, eh? Apollo: Oh, uh, y-yes? (The name's \"Apollo\".) ???: Look at 'im there, arms all crossed-like. Ready to fight! Apollo: Yes, sir! ...You don't mean that literally, do you? ???: The boss told you what I need, right? Don't let me down now, Pollo! Apollo: Don't worry about your defense sir, I'm on it! ???: Defense...? Your noodle half-cooked? It's too late for defense! My castle's been stormed! My keep's been kept! My noodle stand's been stolen! Apollo: N-Noodle...? Trucy: You know Mr. Eldoon from the noodle stand, don'cha, Polly? Apollo: No nicknames, please. And no, of course I don't know him! ???: You new in these parts? Apollo: Not really... ???: Then you know the best noodles in town: Eldoon's Noodles! Apollo: Uh, whose noodles? ???: My noodles! Er, help me out here, Trucy-doll. Trucy: This is Mr. Guy Eldoon... our client! Maybe you can tell us what the problem is, Mr. Eldoon? Guy: Anything for you, Trucy-doll! Talk Who's this guy? Apollo: So... You run a noodle stand, Mr.... Guy: Eldoon. Guy Eldoon's the name! And noodles are my game. The secret's in the soup! I've been searching for the perfect soup for a year 'n' a half. Apollo: Oh. That's... not that long, really. Guy: My family's been noodle men for generations. Got a lot of expectation on my shoulders. Fifteen fathers passing the noodle to fifteen sons. Trucy: That's a pretty old noodle! Guy: Aye, and fool that I was, I pushed it away. I rebelled against my pops, and picked another livelihood. But... that didn't turn out so well. Apollo: Oh. Guy: There was no denying it... Salty broth runs through these veins, boy! Trucy: So, it was like destiny that you became what you are. Guy: Right, destiny's the word! Oh, I fought it... ...but in the end I was bound by the twisted noodle of fate! Apollo: (Not a mental image I care to linger on.) Guy: So, last year, I started my noodle stand. The 15th generation of Eldoon's Noodles! Eldoon's Noodles Apollo: Um... So tell me more about Eldoon's Noodles. Guy: You don't know the genius that are my noodles!? I make 'em so salty, why, they're saltier than... salt! Apollo: (Now I really don't want to find out.) Trucy: Daddy's a regular at his noodle stand. Guy: He frequented my pops's stand back during his attorney days, too. Yep, him and his assistant. Apollo: I'm sorry... I'll be sure to drop by your stand soon. Guy: Wish you could, sonny! Apollo: Eh? Guy: Heck, I wish I could! I'd give anything for a bowl 'bout now. Trucy: What do you mean? Guy: It was stolen! My stand! Gone! Apollo: Stolen...? Stolen stand (appears after \"Eldoon's Noodles\") Guy: It was last night... I was doing my rounds, blowin' my whistle. Trucy: It's like an ice-cream truck's bell but louder! He even gets complaints! Guy: Eh heh, now you're just trying to butter me up. Apollo: (That sounded more like the blues than a whistle...) Guy: I closed up my stand for the night and parked by the house. Then, this morning, dark 'n' early... It was gone! My keep! My castle! Oooooh! Apollo: Maybe some bum carted it off? ...Just guessing here. Guy: Well, I don't care who did it! Without that stand, I'm finished! All my noodle bowls were in there, too. Trucy: That's the saddest thing I've heard all day. Guy: You know it. Anyhows, that's the deal. Good luck! Apollo: Good... huh? Wait... What exactly is your request? Guy: My noodle stand! Find it! And the day you bring my baby back is the day you feast on as many noodles as you want! Course I make it so hot 'n' salty, two bowls'd kill a man. Then I'd really need defense! Apollo: Speaking of defense, that's what I do. I'm a lawyer. Not a detective... Guy: This is where I live, you drop by if you need any info, 'kay? Get it back today if you can, Pollo! I got noodles to make! Apollo: Things have certainly taken a turn for the bizarre. Traffic accidents... and noodle stand thieves. Trucy: Um, actually... There was something I wanted to ask you about, too, Apollo. Apollo: Huh? (I have a bad feeling about this.) Guy: Ah, listen to the lady's problem now. Don't be cruel! Trucy: I lost something last night. That is, something was stolen. Guy: Hey, what's this? More thieving and skullduggery!? Trucy: Well, um... Someone stole a pair of my panties. Apollo: ...Panties? Stolen stand (subsequent times) Guy: It was last night... I was doing my rounds, blowin' my whistle. Trucy: It's like an ice-cream truck's bell but louder! He even gets complaints! Guy: Eh heh, now you're just trying to butter me up. Apollo: (That sounded more like the blues than a whistle...) Guy: I closed up my stand for the night and parked by the house. Then, this morning, dark 'n' early... It was gone! My keep! My castle! Oooooh! Apollo: Maybe some bum carted it off? ...Just guessing here. Guy: Well, I don't care who did it! Without that stand, I'm finished! All my noodle bowls were in there, too. Trucy's request (appears after \"Stolen stand\") Leads to: \"Erm, so they were, um, stolen, your, er...\" Present Attorney's Badge Guy: Yee haw! Attaboy! Way to flash 'em! Ol' Phoenix used to do that to my pops all the time. Trucy: Your father...? Guy: Yup, he'd whip that bad boy out 'n' say \"Put it on my tab, you know I'm good for it.\" Apollo: (A tab at a noodle joint?) Anything else Guy: Sorry, fellah, but the only business I'm concerned with is my business. You gotta help me out! Get my business back! Apollo: Erm, so they were, um, stolen, your, er... Trucy: My panties, yes. Apollo: Ah, er, right. Panties. Guy: That's a cryin' shame, that is, Trucy-doll. Trucy: I was alone in the office last night. I had hung my panties out the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. \"Give those back!\" I shouted. \"Wait!\" Apollo: Well, that was certainly brave of you. Trucy: ...But I lost him. Without those panties, I don't know what I'll do... Guy: A darn cryin' shame, yup. Trucy: Well, at least the scene of the crime is convenient. I'll mark it on your map! Guy: I'll be headin' home now. Remember, find my stand or there's an empty bowl in yer future, Pollo! Apollo: Er, right. Guy: And you help out Trucy-doll here, too, y'hear? Trucy: Things have certainly picked up, haven't they! We had no work yesterday, and now we have three cases! Apollo: I... I guess. Trucy: Let's see where we stand! Apollo: (Not in a courtroom, that's where.) Well, the first item on our list... Trucy: Phoenix Wright... Daddy's hit and run accident. We have to find the one who hit him! Apollo: ...Who's going to pay us for this again? Trucy: And the second item... Mr. Eldoon's request.. to find his stolen stand. Apollo: For which we stand to gain... a bowl of salty noodles... Trucy: And the last request is mine! To find my stolen panties! Apollo: ...That bowl of noodles is looking better and better. Trucy: Let's go, Polly! To the streets! Apollo: Aren't you enthusiastic. Trucy: How could I not be!? Let's crack these cases, you and me! Apollo: (*sigh* Guess we might as well get started... Let's see. A hit and run... a stolen stand... And last but not least... stolen panties.) After clearing \"Our client\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic, then visiting Wright Talent Agency: June 15Hickfield Clinic Apollo: Huh? Mr. Wright's gone. Trucy: Maybe he's gone for an examination? Apollo: He'll probably be back soon. Let's wait. Trucy: I think it might take some time. Daddy always loves his examinations! Apollo: (Don't ask, Justice. You don't want to know.) Trucy: Why don't we come back later? Apollo: Yeah, I guess you're right. Examine Bottle Apollo: A bottle of Mr. Wright's favorite brand of grape juice. After that trial, I'll never drink grape juice again. Clearly not a problem for Mr. Wright, however. DVD stack Apollo: A swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. It looks ready to collapse. Better keep my distance. Hospital bed Apollo: Mr. Wright's bed. Wow, what a mess. Trucy must be in charge of cleaning at home. Piano Apollo: A small, children's piano. I guess the man likes pink. Television Apollo: The television's been left on... to an episode of the Steel Samurai. That's the same episode as before. Must be his favorite. Wright Talent Agency Talk Panty-snatcher Apollo: (Maybe I should ask her more about her... uh... This is going to be difficult--) Trucy: Apollo! Apollo: Yeah? Trucy: Your [sic] going to have to press me for information! Go ahead, do your worst! Apollo: Uh, no thanks, I pass. Trucy: You can't \"pass\"! This is your job! Look, I had hung them outside the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. \"Give those back!\" I shouted. \"Wait!\" ...But I lost him. I can't live without those panties! Please find them! Any leads? Apollo: Well? Do we have any leads? Trucy: Hmm... One moment... ... Allakazam! Allakazing! Apollo: (Whoa! Where'd all this evidence come from?) Trucy: ... Apollo: Um... So what happens next? Trucy: That's it! Pretty neat, huh? Apollo: ...Yeah. Neat. (*sigh*) Present Anything Trucy: What's that, Polly? Oh, I know! You want to see a magic trick! Well, you've come to the right girl! Watch as I make that evidence disappear, forever! Apollo: Whoa! No, don't! Sorry, my bad! June 15Accident Scene Apollo: So this is where Mr. Wright got hit by that car? Trucy: According to the map, this is the place! Apollo: What a huge mansion... (Changed from [What a huge mansion... Feels like Chinatown.] in the original release) Trucy: Apollo! There's a nice-looking lady over there. Let's question her! Apollo: Um, OK. (I'm a little curious about the park over there, too...) Trucy: Excuse me! Um, can we have a few words with you? ???: You want something? Apollo: (Whoa! That husky voice... Why am I suddenly sweating?) Trucy: That's quite a house you've got there! You must have a lot of money... ???: Whoooh. \"Money\" sounds like something my son would call his friends. This is the Kitaki Family mansion, little girl. Apollo: Eh. ???: You, kid with the hair. You want something? Apollo: Urk! M-M-Me? No, not a thing! Bye! Trucy: Apollo! We can't leave without questioning her! What if she knows something! Apollo: B-But th-the Kitaki Family...! (They're the biggest organized crime syndicate in town!) ???: If you're going to ask something, ask it. If you're man enough. Apollo: Waaaaugh! R-Right! Trucy: Yay! Way to whip him into shape, ma'am! Apollo: (Does she know no fear!?) Plum: I'm Plum. Plum Kitaki. Wife of the fourth head of the Kitaki Family business. Friends call me Little Plum. Apollo: I-I'm l-little Apollo Justice, attorney at law. *gulp* (If looks could kill, this woman would be a mass-murderer by now...) Examine Mansion front gate Trucy: Wow, what a big house! And the gate is so big... Apollo: The Kitaki Family is pretty big around these parts. Trucy: I like the fox! It's so cute! Plum: Ah, that. That's our family crest... from the old country. Trucy: Your family \"crest\"? Plum: We're clever as the fox... and our teeth are sharp. Trucy: So it's like a motto! You need a crest, too, Apollo! Ooh! How about the scales of justice? Or a lunar lander! Apollo: (...I'll pass, thanks.) Mansion gate wall Apollo: A brightly painted dragon. Why do I get the feeling he's glaring at me? Those paints must have been to repaint this wall. Plum: That's right. I called in an artist to do the job right. ...He's the third so far. Apollo: The... third? Plum: The first spilled paint all over the entrance here, the second on my kimono... So I... Apollo: N-No, don't tell me. It's better that I don't know. Spilled paint Apollo: There's paint splashed all over this gate. (What a mess...) Trucy: Was this paint knocked over by the car that hit my Daddy? Plum: That's right. Feh. And I'm left to clean up the mess. If you find whoever did this, bring the scoundrel by, would you? Trucy: Of course! Then you can make them clean up their own mess! Plum: Ah ha ha ha! You're cute. Na\u00efve, but cute. When I find whoever did this, you can bet I'll be doing some \"cleaning\". There's nothing I dislike so much... as a mess. Trucy: Ooh! I wish I could say cool things like that! Plum: I'll bet you do! Wa ha ha ha ha!!! Apollo: (I'd laugh if my teeth weren't chattering so hard.) Talk The Kitakis Trucy: Little Plum? That's a really cute name for someone so... Plum: Yes...? Apollo: Wh-Whoa! Trucy: What is it, Apollo? Apollo: How about you go through me when talking to her, OK, Trucy? Trucy: Huh? That seems like a bit of a needless procedure. Apollo: I'm a lawyer. I live for needless procedures. Plum: Oh little girl, you should know... We're gangsters. Trucy: Gangst... Oh! That means you're the bad guys! Apollo: Trucy! Through me! Please! I'm begging you here! Plum: Wa ha ha ha ha!!! The bad guys... I like the sound of that! Apollo: (...I'm going to need some warm tea after this.) Plum: It takes a lot of hard work to protect a family fortune. Things aren't as easy as they used to be for us \"bad guys\". Trucy: So, you're saying that business is in a slump? Apollo: (Let's not ask about \"business if we can help it, please?) Last night's accident Apollo: So, there was supposedly a car accident here last night. (Changed from [There was a car accident here last night?] in the original release) Plum: Last night... Apollo: Of c-course you wouldn't know about it! S-Sorry to bother you! Plum: Wait. Apollo: Y-Yes? Plum: You're talking about that man, aren't you? The one who flew thirty feet and just walked away? Trucy: That's my daddy! Plum: Ah ha ha! I should've known! One of our Capos thought he'd make a great point man... Trucy: Capo? Point man...? Apollo: Um, could you avoid using too much, er, industry lingo? Plum: In any case, it's been nothing but trouble. I've been cleaning up this mess since morning! Bah! Apollo: Cleaning up this... paint? Splattered paint (appears after \"Last night's accident\") Apollo: Was this paint spilled at the time of the accident? Plum: It was around 9 last night. I heard a crashing noise... ...and found your father drowning in a sea of paint. Trucy: So you came to his rescue? Plum: You've my husband... the Boss to thank for that. The car that hit your father knocked over this paint... ...then turned the corner, and sped away. We're in the middle of repainting our wall, you see. Apollo: (I'm sure that dragon is glaring at me.) Trucy: But, why are you out here cleaning it up? Plum: What do you mean? Trucy: I mean, aren't you a gangster? Don't you have any \"goons\" to do your dirty work for you? Apollo: Please! Go through me when you want to... Plum: Wa ha ha ha ha!!! Don't be such a stiff, lawyer-boy. I suppose we gangsters do have a certain image... Apollo: Urm, yes. Plum: But we're community-oriented gangsters, you see. ...The Boss likes to give back to the people, see? Apollo: (How noble of him...) Plum: I availed myself of the public facilities to get rid of all the garbage... Now there's just the paint on the street to deal with. Apollo: (Public facilities...? I wonder if she means that trash can...) Present Anything Plum: Sorry, kid. I got no idea what you're talking about. After switching to right side view: Apollo: Who's that!? She's looking at the park. Trucy: She's pretty. I bet she has a story, you know? Apollo: (There is something about her... Too bad she seems to be in a bit of a rush.) Examine Old lady Apollo: ...Looks like there's some trouble by the park gate. Trucy: I smell an incident! Officer: Ma'am! There's no entry to the park! Old Lady: Now don't you tell me where I can't go, young fella! I always walk through this park on my way home! Officer: Please, get down from there! You'll hurt yourself, ma'am! Apollo: (That's quite the determined old lady.) People Park sign Apollo: People Park... Huh, kind of an odd name for such an empty place. Trucy: I wonder why it's named that? Hey! There's something written on the gate post... Apollo: Huh? Oh yeah... It says, \"Donated by Big Wins Kitaki\". Trucy: You mean the Kitaki Family built this park? It's so nice of them to give to the community like that! Apollo: ...Let's not get too friendly with them, shall we? (A gangster building a park...? Odd move for a crime boss.) Police officer below People Park sign Apollo: Personally, I'm a little more interested in this park. Trucy: You know what I think? I bet they're filming a movie. Let's go take a look! Maybe we'll see someone famous! Officer: Hey, Miss! Stay out of the park! Trucy: ...He got mad at me. Apollo: Um, did something happen here, officer? Officer: Huh? Uh, no, move along, nothing to see. Why don't you kids go play someplace else? Apollo: We're not kids and we're not playing! I'm an attorney! ???: ...Something wrong? Officer: Ah, Detective Skye! We're fine ma'am, nothing to report! Apollo: (Detective...?) Trucy: Why's she wearing a lab coat? Apollo: You're hardly one to comment on how people are dressed. ???: And... these kids are? Officer: Curiosity seekers, ma'am. They claim to be \"lawyers\". ???: Ah. Why don't you kids run along and play someplace else? Apollo: Look, we're not... ???: Or I might spill something on that pretty face of yours. Want a dose of experimental Hydroxyacelunodosetrase? Trucy: ...Come again? What's Hydroxy... stuff? Apollo: Whatever it is, it doesn't sound good. Let's go, Trucy! ???: Try to keep out the riff-raff, if you would. Officer: Yes ma'am! Apollo: Grr... How are we going to get more information like this? Trucy: Why don't we ask that nice woman across the street? Apollo: (Oh yes, that nice woman... *gulp*) Police officer below People Park sign (subsequent times) Apollo: I gotta say, I'd really like to know what happened here... Officer: Hey, I said no one goes in! Unless you want a face-full of hydroxyadayadawhatzit! Apollo: (Hmm... No dice.) Trash can Apollo: There's a big trash can on the way into the park. I guess we could check it out... Trucy: A detective's life sure is a hard one! Apollo: I'm an attorney, actua... Huh? Trucy: Hmm. Two pieces of garbage with paint on them. Apollo: These... are slippers. They look like those slippers you get at the hospital... Trucy: Look at this, Apollo! Doesn't this go on a car...? Apollo: It's a side-view mirror! Looks like it was torn off when it smacked into something... or someone. Trucy: Wait, you don't think... Apollo: I do. This could be from the car that hit Mr. Wright! Trucy: Wow, and he took off its mirror? I never knew Daddy was so strong. I only have room in my pocket for one of these, though. Which do you want to take? Slippers Slippers crammed into pocket. Leads back to examination Mirror Mirror slipped into pocket. Leads back to examination Trash can (subsequent times, if Slippers is added to the Court Record) Apollo: There's a side-view mirror with some paint on it in this trash can. Trucy: I can only carry one thing at a time in my pocket, you know. Apollo: (Should I swap the slippers for the mirror?) Swap Apollo: Sure, let's swap the evidence. Trucy, if you would. Trucy: I'm on it! Mirror slipped into pocket. Leads back to examination No need Apollo: ...On second thought, let's not and say we did. Leads back to examination Trash can (subsequent times, if Mirror is added to the Court Record) Apollo: There's some paint on the slippers in this trash can. Trucy: I can only carry one thing at a time in my pocket, you know. Apollo: (Should I swap the mirror for the slippers?) Swap Apollo: Sure, let's swap the evidence. Trucy, if you would. Trucy: Right-o! Slippers crammed into pocket. Leads back to examination No need Apollo: Actually... let's not and say we did. Leads back to examination Talk People Park (appears after examining police officer below People Park sign) Apollo: ...Can I ask you a question? Plum: What? Apollo: ...What happened in the park across the street? Plum: Oh, yes, quite the commotion. \"Chicago Lightning\", as the Boss would say. Trucy: Chicago... huh? Plum: Gunfire. Someone was killed. Strange circumstances, too. Apollo: You're kidding! Plum: What a morning! Trouble everywhere. The park, the gate, even our house... Trucy: Did something happen at your house, too? Plum: A crime without honor! Without remorse! It's a private matter... Wanna hear about it? Trucy: Somehow I don't think \"no\" is an acceptable answer, Polly. A private matter (appears after \"People Park\") Apollo: So... what happened at your house? Plum: Bloomers. Last night. Apollo: Eh. (I got a bad feeling about this...) Plum: Me, Little Plum Kitaki, the victim of a panty-snatcher! Trucy: Whaaaaaaat? So it wasn't just my panties that were stolen!? Plum: Got you too, did they? Poor thing. Like I said, whoever did this is a hardened criminal. It wasn't you, was it!? Apollo: N-No! Of course not! Mercy! Plum: I've heard word that panties have been disappearing lately. ...And the missing panties all have something in common. Apollo: (It's hard to imagine Trucy's and Mrs. Kitaki's panties having much in common... I just imagined Mrs. Kitaki's panties... *gulp*) Trucy: I know! We'll find your bloomers, too! Plum: Great! Show me what you're made of. Apollo: (What have you gotten me into this time, Trucy?) Present Mirror Apollo: Can you tell me anything about this mirror? Plum: That's probably from the car that knocked that fellow across the street. Apollo: (Right! That makes this a valuable clue!) Plum: Let me know if you find that car, would you? You splash Kitaki paint, you pay the price. Examine evidence Slippers Toeprint Apollo: Huh? This spot here is black. Trucy: I wonder what that is...? It doesn't look like paint... Leaf indentation on paint on left sole Trucy: The bottom is covered with paint! Apollo: Huh? What's this weird shape here? Trucy: It looks like a leaf was stuck to the bottom when the wearer stepped in some yellow paint. Apollo: So the outline was left when the leaf was removed! Ack! I got paint on my hand! Trucy: ...... Apollo! I saw you try to wipe your hand on my cape! Mirror Severed wires Trucy: It's cut clean off! I wonder what's in there...? Apollo: Don't. There are bare wires hanging out. Trucy: Let's see... Zzzzzzaaaaap! Eeek! Apollo: Wha--!? A-Are you OK!? Trucy: Hee hee! Just a little joke! Apollo: ...... Don't scare me like that! Trucy: You mean, don't \"shock\" you? Zzzzzzaaaaap! Hee hee! After clearing all Talk options: ???: ... Apollo: (...That girl from before!) Plum: Oh! Welcome home, sweetie. ???: Ah, uh... hello, m-mother. Apollo: (She's a Kitaki, too!?) Trucy: Uh, um, Miss! Miss! ???: ...? Trucy: Here, our flyer. ???: The... Wright Anything Agency? Apollo: A-Anything Agency? Trucy: Yeah! Do you like the new flyer? So, um, this is our defense attorney, Mr. Apollo Justice! ???: Attorney...? Trucy: Drop by our office! We'll be waiting! ???: Ah... Good-bye. Apollo: Why did you give her our flyer? Trucy: I dunno. She seemed like she could use some help. Apollo: She's the heiress to a gangster dynasty! She doesn't need our help! Trucy: ...I wouldn't be so sure! Apollo: ...? June 15Scene of the Stand Theft Apollo: So... what's this place? Trucy: This would be Mr. Eldoon's house, silly. Apollo: Oh, so this is where his stand was stolen from. I can see a piece of evidence lying on the ground already. Trucy: ...Hey! Look, there's a police car parked over there. Apollo: You're right... What's with the sparkly... entrance? What is this place? A hospital? There's a sign... \"Meraktis Clinic\". Trucy: Hmm... Oh! That's where the thief went! Apollo: The thief...? Trucy: The one who snatched my panties! He ran into this clinic last night! Wait, maybe that police car is here to find my panties! Apollo: I doubt it. Trucy: Well, there's only one way to be sure! Let's investigate! Guy: Ah, there you are, sonny! Well, you find anything yet!? Apollo: Er, um, no. Not yet. Guy: The longer you loaf around here the saltier your victory bowl gets, just remember that! Apollo: (This bowl of noodles is sounding less like payment and more like punishment...) Examine Clinic front door Trucy: That doorway sure is sparkly! Apollo: The \"Meraktis Clinic\", huh. Looks more like a casino parlor than a hospital. They must be quite profitable. Trucy: Funny, it looks closed. Maybe they're on vacation today? Green banner Apollo: Looks like they have a special offer going on... Trucy: \"Three shots for the price of one!\" Ooh, now's our chance, Apollo! Apollo: Chance for what!? I don't need any shots, thank you. Whoever runs this clinic, they seem pretty business-minded. Police car Apollo: I'd understand if there was an ambulance outside... But a police car? Trucy: Maybe they're tax evaders! Officer: Ah, sorry miss. No going into the clinic today. Trucy: Did something happen? Officer: Huh? Oh, no. Nothing to see here. Move along. You'll have to find someplace else to play doctor. Apollo: (Do we look like the right age to be playing doctor!?) We need a little more info on this Meraktis Clinic. Trucy: We could ask Mr. Eldoon. He is their neighbor and all. And we should check out that garage! What if the thief who stole my panties is still in there!? Apollo: ...*sigh* Blue tarp Guy: That's the place! Right there! That's where I kept my stand. Covered all nice 'n' purty with that blue tarp there! Apollo: So you used this plastic sheet to cover your stand at night? ...I see. Trucy: You see? What? Did you figure out why it was stolen!? Apollo: Well no, but it does suggest that the thief knew what he or she was looking for. They clearly knew what was under that sheet. Guy: So it wasn't one of those casual drive-by stand snatchers, you mean? Not bad, sonny-boy. Not bad at all! Bowl Apollo: Is this yours, Mr. Eldoon? Guy: Hey! That there's the heart and soul of Eldoon's Noodles! The bowl absorbs my salty soup... Pretty soon it's gonna taste just like noodles! Trucy: Wow! It does smell like noodles! Guy: All my other bowls got taken away with my stand! Get it back for me, sonny-boy, I'm beggin' ya! Bowl added to the Court Record. Bowl (subsequent times) Apollo: Is this yours, Mr. Eldoon? Guy: Hey! That there's the heart and soul of Eldoon's Noodles! The bowl absorbs my salty soup... Pretty soon it's gonna taste just like noodles! Trucy: Wow! It does smell like noodles! Guy: All my other bowls got taken away with my stand! Get it back for me, sonny-boy, I'm beggin' ya! House Trucy: This house is... well, it's old! Guy: It's been well-loved, that's for sure. I've lived here with my wife for many years now. It's got character, though, just like my soup! Apollo: (I always thought character was a positive thing.) \"NOO\" sign Apollo: ...That's quite a sign. I take it that's \"NOO\" as opposed to \"OLD\"? Guy: Ah, you like it? Made it myself, I did. I meant to write \"Noodles\" but ran outta space. Trucy: Prior planning prevents poor performance! Guy: Lucky for me it spells a word all by itself! And spruces up my image, it does! Apollo: (It does have a certain power of willful denial thing going for it.) Oil drum Apollo: It looks like the oil drum is connected to that sink over there... Trucy: Collecting rainwater to do the dishes! How environmentally conscious! Apollo: You... don't think he uses rainwater to cook his noodles and to make the broth, do you? Trucy: Oh I'm sure he finds the best water money can buy! Taste is his business, you know. Look, that sign over there! \"Eldoon's only uses water from all-natural sources!\" Apollo: ... (I think I'll take a rain check on eating here.) Sign under oil drum Apollo: There's a hand-written sign here... \"Save the light!\" Trucy: \"Save the light!\" indeed! Mr. Eldoon's house is practically in the dark here! Apollo: I guess the hospital clinic next door blocks the sunlight. Guy: Everything's gone wrong since they built this monstrosity! Broth needs sun or it rots! What's a man to do? They just want my customers to get food poisoning so they can turn a pretty profit... Apollo: (That seems like a lot of trouble to go through for a few extra patients...) Dog Trucy: Look! A doggy! Good boy, good boy, Salty! Apollo: I'm sure the dog has a real name, Trucy. Guy: Yup, sure does! Name's Spoon. And it's a she, by the way. Trucy: Spoon doesn't seem so lively. Guy: She didn't get her bowl of salty broth this mornin', that's why. Poor lil' thing. *sniff* Trucy: Apollo! Let's find that stand soon! For Spoon's sake! Apollo: (I'm pretty sure dogs aren't supposed to eat noodles...) Talk Eldoon's Noodles Apollo: So, your stand... \"Eldoon's Noodles\", was it? Guy: Aye! Passed down from father to son. That stand's seen its share o' salt, mmm-hmm. Salt runs in the family, you might say. Apollo: (I bet high blood pressure does too.) So... your stand, Eldoon's Noodles, was stolen... Guy: Oh, it wasn't just the stand that was stolen, sonny-boy! I lost those wobbly wheels, my salt-crusted stewpot, my stained sign... I didn't just lose a stand, I lost a legend! Trucy: No one steals a legend and gets away with it on my watch! Let's find that legend, Apollo! Apollo: (Isn't it about time he bought a new one anyway?) Stolen stand Apollo: Are there any more details you could give me about the stand? Guy: You bet, sonny-boy! It happened last night... I was blowing my whistle like always, crying the town, I was. The smell of broth filled the streets... thick 'n' salty. I got home, well, right before 10 PM, I reckon. Apollo: (Guess he's not aiming for that late-night market.) Guy: I washed my bowls and gave the wheels a squirt of grease. Then I went inside. Apollo: When did you notice it had been stolen? Guy: Early this morning. Before the sun rose. Work starts early! Apollo: (Do that many people eat noodles for breakfast!?) Guy: I'm washed up on the salty shores of ruination! That stand had my whole life in it... nay, my whole being! Trucy: They took everything? Guy: All my soup stock, my noodles, my bowls... and my dreams! Trucy: At least they left one bowl. Look, there, on the ground. Guy: If you don't find that stand today... Then I'll be forced to walk the streets, peddling that bowl... my last bowl. Apollo: Please, I'm under enough pressure here as it is. The garage Trucy: That's it! That's where the thief who snatched my panties ran to! Guy: It's a crying shame, that is. If they have to steal, make it my loincloth! Not some pretty girl's panties! Apollo: The garage, right. You don't think the thief lives here, do you? Guy: Feh! I wouldn't put it past that good-for-nothing doctor! Apollo: (Hmm... Do I detect a little animosity here?) Trucy: Let's make sure to check out that garage thoroughly! Meraktis Clinic (appears after examining police car) Trucy: Hey, do you think something happened next door? There's a police car out front... Guy: Feh! Probably gave someone food poisoning, I'll bet! Apollo: (If anyone's at risk of giving someone food poisoning...) Guy: That police car got here this mornin', actually. I asked what they were up to, but they wouldn't even tell me, the neighbor! Feh! Trucy: Hmm... Guy: Not that I was surprised much. That doctor works for the wrong crowd. It was just a matter of time 'fore he got what was coming to him. Feh! Apollo: The \"wrong crowd\"...? Guy: ...Never you mind about that. Present Bowl Guy: You can tell my bowls by the Mr. Salty logo! Trucy: The mascot of Eldoon's Noodles! Guy: They come to the stand, they sit, they drink deep from that bowl... ...and when they see the  bottom, their face looks jus' like Mr. Salty's! Genius, no!? Trucy: Very high-concept. Guy: You can't ply a trade if you don't love the tools. Remember that! Trucy: Yes sir! Apollo: (Trucy has a thing for professionals, clearly.) Anything else Guy: Sorry, sonny-boy. My interest is for my stand and precious little else. Get cracking on that case! Find my stand, I'm beggin' ya! Examine evidence Bowl Inside of bowl Trucy: It's the Eldoon's Noodle's mascot! Mr. Salty! He's so cute! Apollo: It's not a very endearing mascot, is it? Trucy: You know... Come to think of it... ...It looks a lot like you, Apollo. Especially the red parts. Apollo: Can I help if I like red? Bottom of bowl Trucy: Ooh, look! I love these little personal touches! Apollo: Seems a shame to hide it on the bottom of the bowl. ...Huh? When I touched it the paint flaked off. Trucy: He must have painted it on by hand with warm, professional care! Apollo: After buying the cheapest paint he could find with cold professional thrift. June 15Meraktis ClinicGarage Trucy: This is the place! This is where that panty-snatcher ran! Apollo: Are you sure? Trucy: Maybe! Let's look for clues! Clues... to a panty-snatching! Clues... like a pair of panties! Apollo: ...Um, Trucy? Could you try not saying \"panties\" so many times? Examine Car Apollo: There's something about this car... Trucy: Let's take a closer look! Cell phone Apollo: Look... a cell phone. Trucy: Someone dropped it beneath this tire! If the car moved, it would be crushed for sure! Apollo: Hmm... I wonder if it belongs to the doctor here? Trucy: We should bring it to him later! Cell Phone added to the Court Record. Stub on driver's door Trucy: Hey! Look at that! Apollo: The mirror's been broken off! (Now THIS is a clue!) Trucy: What!? You're smiling like you know something I don't... You aren't keeping a clue from me, are you, Polly? Apollo: (A clue? Let's see...) Show evidence Apollo: I think I do have just the clue you've got in mind... Present Mirror Apollo: Apollo: My clue is... this! Trucy: Whoa! It's the same color and size and everything! A perfect match! Apollo: I guess we could check it out... Trucy: Hmm. Two pieces of garbage with paint on them. Look at this, Apollo! Doesn't this go on a car...? Apollo: It's a side-view mirror! Looks like it was torn off when it smacked into something... or someone. Apollo: Well... looks like we've just solved a case. Trucy: So the car that hit Daddy last night... Apollo: ...Is sitting right in front of us, yep. Trucy: Wow. You put the \"pro\" in \"professional\", Apollo! Apollo: Gee, thanks, Trucy. Leads back to examination Present anything else Apollo: Trucy: ... That's your clue? Sorry, but that leaves me feeling kind of... clueless. Apollo: (Like father like daughter with the humor, apparently.) Trucy: There's no need to bluff here, Apollo! Save that for the court! Apollo: (Thanks for the advice...) Leads back to examination No evidence Apollo: Hmm. Not that I can think of. Trucy: No? Then what were you smiling about? Apollo: Oh, I wasn't smiling. It was the dust in here. I thought I was going to sneeze... Ah... ah... ah... WAACHOOO! Trucy: Well, don't make faces that ah... AH-CHOO! ...are so misleading then. Apollo: (I know yawns are contagious, but sneezes...?) Trucy: Mmm. Well, I'm sure there's gotta be a clue somewhere! Let's keep checking things out! Leads back to examination Stub on driver's door (after correctly presenting Mirror) Apollo: This mirror fits this car door perfectly... Trucy: So the car that hit Daddy last night... Apollo: ...Is sitting right in front of us, yep. Trucy: Wow. You put the \"pro\" in \"professional\", Apollo! Tailpipe (before examining cell phone and stub on driver's door) Apollo: That reminds me... I once read a record of a case that Mr. Wright worked on many years ago. Trucy: ...? Apollo: Apparently, there was this car with a piece of cloth shoved into the tailpipe! That piece of cloth turned out to be a vital clue to solving the case! Trucy: Wow! Apollo: I remember that case record whenever I'm checking out a car... And I always check the tailpipe! Trucy: Everyone's gotta have a hobby, I guess. Apollo: Wouldn't it be funny if... ...Hey! There's something in there! Trucy: What!? Apollo: W-Wait a second... Are these your... Trucy: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! My panties!!! Apollo: Whaaaat!? Already!? Trucy: Wow, thank you, Apollo! You're a genius! Amazing! Apollo: No, no, really, don't mention it. Trucy: No, I'm serious, I'm really impressed! You must have a nose for finding girls' panties! Apollo: ... Um, what are those? Trucy: My little panties, of course! They've come home to mama! I can't wait to use them! Apollo: Y-You're going to put them on? N-Now!? Trucy: Watch closely now... See? Nothing in the panties... ...Ta-da!!! Apollo: Whoa! Wh-Where'd that come from!? How did that bowl get in your panties!? Trucy: My panties are an extra-dimensional space... Anything can fit in there! ...They're my Magic Panties! It's one of my best tricks. Apollo: Magic... panties? Trucy: They love them over at the Wonder Bar. I do shows there nightly. Apollo: ...You mean those panties are a prop!? You could have told me a little sooner! Trucy's Panties put discreetly away in Trucy's pocket. Apollo: Well, that's once case closed, at least. Trucy: What are you saying!? We still have to catch the sly devil that ran off with the tool of my trade! Apollo: Oh, right. (Something tells me we're not finished searching this garage, anyway...) Tailpipe (after examining cell phone and stub on driver's door) Apollo: That reminds me... I once read a record of a case that Mr. Wright worked on many years ago. Trucy: ...?

Trucy: What are you saying!? We still have to catch the sly devil that ran off with the tool of my trade! Apollo: Oh, right. Tailpipe (subsequent times, before examining cell phone and stub on driver's door) Apollo: Still, I'm glad. If I hadn't picked up that habit of looking up tailpipes... ...I might never have seen your panties. I mean, found your panties. Magic panties. Trucy: I know, it was amazing how you slyly peeked up there! I think you have a successful career in peeking up tailpipes ahead of you! Apollo: (I'm so glad all of this makes sense in context.) Trucy: You gotta wonder why my panties were here, though. Apollo: That is a mystery... (Something tells me we're not finished searching this garage, anyway...) Tailpipe (subsequent times, after examining cell phone and stub on driver's door) Apollo: Still, I'm glad.

Trucy: You gotta wonder why my panties were here, though. Apollo: That is a mystery... Cat Trucy: Hey! A kitty-cat! Here, kitty kitty kitty. Meow. Trucy: ...It's not coming down. Apollo: We do look kind of suspicious, you have to admit. Trucy: It's OK kitty-cat! His hair won't hurt you! Apollo: It's OK kitty-cat! She won't make you disappear in her hat! (Step)ladder Apollo: Look, it's a folding ladder. Trucy: Polly! That's called a \"stepladder\"! C'mon! Apollo: ...A stepladder? How is that different from a regular ladder then? Trucy: It's a much more complex piece of machinery. It's like two ladders stuck together! Apollo: ...So you admit that basically it's a ladder, right? Trucy: Wait... Huh? Apollo: You have to look past the form... at the essence of the thing. Trucy: Er... Can we talk about something else? Skeleton Trucy: Eeeeeeek! Someone's there! ... Oh, it's just a gold-painted human skeleton. Apollo: (Just a human skeleton!? ...And painted gold?) Trucy: There's a mannequin hand waving to us from the box behind the skeleton. This place just screams \"hospital storage\", don't you think? Apollo: It screams something, that's for sure. Examine evidence Cell Phone Strap Trucy: Look at this cute little watch-strap! I want one! Apollo: ...It's kind of odd, though. Trucy: What is? Apollo: I mean, if you wanted to know the time, you could just look at the phone itself. Trucy: Hey, you're right! Sharp, Apollo! Apollo: Th-Thanks. (Finally, some respect!) Trucy: So, what does that tell you? Apollo: Well, the owner of this phone doesn't think through the details, for one. Trucy: They did drop their phone, after all. I kinda figured they were a little spacey already. Apollo: Oh... good point. Trucy's Panties Ribbon Apollo: ...... Trucy: Something the matter? Apollo: Uh... I was just wondering if there was, like, a switch on these... Trucy: Of course not! Apollo: ...Huh. Mysterious. Trucy: Oh? Do you want to know the secret of my panties? Apollo: Ack! N-No! No thanks! (Who uses magic panties in a stage show anyway...?) After examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door: Trucy: Apollo! Apollo: Huh? What is it? Trucy: Now that we've solved this case, we should go report to Daddy! He'll mope if we leave him alone too long, knowing him. Apollo: Um, OK. ...He doesn't seem the type to mope, though. (And this is hardly a case worth reporting...) Examine Car Apollo: This car belongs to someone at the Meraktis Clinic... and it hit Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright sprained his ankle, and the car lost a side-view mirror. This car vs. Mr. Wright... Not quite the match of the century. Wright Anything Agency Talk Panty-snatcher (after Trucy's Panties is added to the Court Record) Trucy: What, you want to see them again? Well, if you must... Apollo: No no no, I'm fine, really. Let's just put them away, shall we? Case closed. Trucy: What are you talking about!? The case isn't closed until we have our thief! Just find him on the side while you work on the other cases! Apollo: If it were that easy we wouldn't need the police. Trucy: If we don't need the police... then we don't need defense attorneys, either, right? Apollo: (Fine, fine. I'll look for your panty-snatcher...) Present Trucy's Panties Trucy: I'm so glad we found my panties! Apollo: I had no idea they were so important to you. Trucy: And in time for tonight's show, too! A lot of people come just to see my panties, you know! Apollo: You... might not want to advertise it like that. Trucy: ? Kitaki Mansion Examine Trash can (after Mirror is updated in the Court Record) Apollo: There's a big waste basket by the park entrance. Trucy: ...? You aren't going to search through the trash? Apollo: I don't think we need to. Trucy: Oh, no, please, knock yourself out. Don't mind me, I'll be waiting over here. Apollo: Just so we're clear, searching through trash isn't a hobby of mine, OK? Present Mirror (after Mirror is updated in the Court Record) Apollo: I found out who this mirror belongs to. Plum: Ooh. You're tougher than you look. Spit it out. Who was it? Where do they live? Apollo: Urk! I j-just forgot! Heh! Trucy: I remember, Apollo! It was the Meraktis Clinic! Apollo: Shhhh! Trucy: Why? I'm right, aren't I? Plum: ...Meraktis, eh? Apollo: Um, yes. (Why's she so quiet all of a sudden?) ... Is something wrong? Plum: Erm, no. Pay me no mind. And thanks for the info. After clearing all Talk options in Accident Scene, clearing all Talk options and examining bowl in Scene of the Stand Theft, and examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door in Meraktis Clinic - Garage: June 15Hickfield Clinic Phoenix: Yo! How goes it? Trucy: Daddy! How do you feel? Phoenix: Not bad, Trucy, not bad. It's good to have you young'uns on the case. Lets ol' Daddy-o get some well-deserved R&R. Trucy: The elderly need their rest! Apollo: (Uh... isn't he only 33?) ...Um, we've cleared up most of the cases... Phoenix: I was right about you. Competent. Capable. Tell me what you found out. If you want to. Apollo: (Your enthusiasm is over-whelming...) Talk Progress report Phoenix: Well, I certainly didn't expect you back this early. Trucy: Polly's amazing! He found my panties so quick! Almost like he was the one who stole them! Apollo: ...You have an interesting concept of praise. Phoenix: ...And? Did you find the mad driver who gave me that 30-foot toss? Apollo: Apparently... it was a doctor. From the Meraktis Clinic. Phoenix: Hmm... Meraktis, eh? I've heard of him. Nothing good, mind you. Apollo: That reminds me, a police car was parked outside the clinic. Trucy: Maybe something happened? Apollo: What is this Meraktis Clinic anyway? Meraktis Clinic Phoenix: All I've heard are the rumors. That clinic's been making good money... in a bad way. Apollo: Bad...? Phoenix: Ties to organized crime... The Kentucky Family. Apollo: Um... the Kitaki Family? (He did that on purpose!) Phoenix: Some injuries you can't take to a public hospital, see. They use the Meraktis Clinic for their patch-up jobs. Apollo: Interesting... People Park Trucy: It looked like something had happened in that park. Phoenix: Ah. A body was found there in unusual circumstances... Apollo: Something more unusual than being dead? Phoenix: ...It's not our concern, in any case. Trucy: Right! Let's ignore that and find that noodle stand! Apollo: (What ever happened to professional curiosity?) Present Mirror Phoenix: So this was the thing that led you to the car. Apollo: Yes, sir! The mirror you knocked off was just the clue we needed! Phoenix: Good work, Apollo. Of course you might say... ...I was the one who made solving that case possible. Apollo: (...You don't get points for knocking off a car mirror.) Trucy's Panties Trucy: Look! My panties! They came home to mama! Phoenix: Thanks, Apollo. I was worried about them, too. Trucy special ordered those... Apollo: (A startling display of parental concern!) Phoenix: I'd hate to have to buy a  new pair... *shudder* Apollo: (Make that a not-so-startling display of cheapskatedness.) Anything else Phoenix: ... Apollo: (It's actually a relief to be so thoroughly ignored.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Thanks, really. If I get tired of sleeping, maybe I'll head down to this Meraktis place. Maybe hit 'em up for some reparations... A little legal action would do me some good. Apollo: Um... I was wondering when I get paid? We solved the case of your accident, and um, found a missing article of clothing. Trucy: My panties! Phoenix: That leaves the noodle stand. Apollo: Eh. Phoenix: Feel free to drop in if you get stuck. I'd be happy to help with anything not involving money. Apollo: (Good-bye, quid pro quo. Hello pro bono. *sigh*) Trucy: Right! Back to the office to plan our next move! After clearing all Talk options in Accident Scene, clearing all Talk options and examining bowl in Scene of the Stand Theft, and examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door in Meraktis Clinic - Garage: June 15Kitaki Mansion Trucy: Little Plum's not here. She's not finished cleaning, huh. Apollo: Maybe she went to get a paint scraper? Plum: OK! Who's the wise guy who spit gum out on the street!? Apollo: (Her voice carries all the way out to the street from inside the mansion...) Trucy: She's a neat freak! How cute! Plum: You there! It was you, wasn't it!? Fess up! I hope you've said your prayers. You're gonna need them... Apollo: Tr-Trucy? Let's leave. Now. Trucy: ...? Examine Mansion front gate Apollo: An impressive gate befitting the Kitaki Mansion. Trucy: Look at the name plate! \"Kitaki\"...! That's so cool! Short and blunt, like any good gangster! Ooh! Let's change our name! How about... \"W. A. A.\"! ... Maybe that's too short and blunt. What do you think? Apollo: No comment. Mansion gate wall Apollo: A colorful dragon turns its baleful gaze in my direction. As if to say, \"Abandon all hope ye who enter here.\" Don't worry, Mr. Dragon. Me and hope haven't been on speaking terms for a while. Spilled paint Apollo: Several colors of paint have been splashed across the gate. It's almost all dry. This is going to be tough to clean. Old lady Apollo: It looks like that woman's still causing trouble... Officer: Look, no one goes in! That means you! Old Lady: Oh, what's the difference? Let... me... go! Ow! Ow ow ow ow ow ow!!! Officer: Ah! S-Sorry! Old Lady: That's it, I'm suing! ...But I might change my mind for five bucks... Apollo: (What is she, some kind of con artist?) People Park sign Apollo: Apparently, this park was the gift of the Kitaki Family. The friendly \"People Park\", brought to you by organized crime... A very naughty part of me is tempted to write \"We Kill\" on the left side of the sign. Police officer below People Park sign Apollo: They're not letting anyone into the crime scene. The guard at the entrance is humming a song. He's got rhythm, actually. Maybe he plays in a band. June 15Wright Anything Agency Apollo: You... You're the woman from the Kitaki place! ???: Y-Yes... Trucy: I knew it! Something's the matter and you want our help, right? Well, you've come to the Wright place! This way, please... ???: Um... Thank you. Alita: My name is Alita Tiala. I... have a request. Talk Your request Apollo: Your request... let me guess, something's been stolen? Alita: Um, your flyer... It says \"now defending\" so I thought... Apollo: Whaaaat!? You mean, you mean you want me to defend you? Me? Trucy: Maybe you can tell us what happened? Were you hit by a car? Did someone steal your stand? Or your panties? Alita: No! No... I'm not the client, actually. The client would be my... well, my fianc\u00e9, I suppose you'd call him. Apollo: Fianc\u00e9...? What happened to him, then? Alita: He was arrested this morning. The charge... was murder. Trucy: Murder... Alita: Have you heard about what happened at the park? Tiala's story Apollo: So, what's your story? You frequent the Kitaki Mansion, yes? Are you a member of their, um, organization? Alita: No... Not yet. Trucy: Not yet? Alita: You see, I'm to be married next month. To the boss's son. Apollo: The boss's son...? So he's a, uh... *gulp* (A gangster...) Alita: Yes, but the Kitakis are locally responsible gangsters. I thought it'd be nice for a change... Quit my boring job, live the good, gangster life. Trucy: I think you're on to something! \"Mrs. Kitaki\"... I like the sound of that! Apollo: (I'm not sure your daddy would care much for that...) Murder in the park (appears after \"Your request\") Apollo: Wh-What happened!? Alita: I haven't been told all the details. But I do know a body was found in the park. Near the Kitaki Mansion. Trucy: There were a lot of police cars there. Alita: Apparently, the victim was shot with a pistol... But I hear the circumstances of the shooting were... rather unusual. Apollo: And your fianc\u00e9 was arrested for this? Trucy: Um... what sort of person is your fianc\u00e9? Your fianc\u00e9 (appears after \"Tiala's story\" and \"Murder in the park\") Apollo: Your fianc\u00e9 is the Kitaki Family's only son, correct? Alita: His name's Wocky. Wocky Kitaki... I brought a photo. Apollo: Well. That's... quite the photo. Alita: I know! Oh, he can be powerful and menacing, but so cute! Apollo: But, if he's the boss's only son... Alita: Yes, I'm sure he'll take his father's place some day. Trucy: Say, I'm a boss already! Of this agency! Alita: Please help my Wocky! Please! Apollo: (...Right! My first solo defense case! Crime boss's son or not, I'll prove he's innocent!) Alita: I... prepared a letter of request. I know you need those. Letter of Request added to the Court Record. Trucy: Right! Let's go check out the scene of the crime! Your fianc\u00e9 (subsequent times) Apollo: Your fianc\u00e9 is the Kitaki Family's only son, correct? Alita: His name's Wocky. Wocky Kitaki... I brought a photo. Apollo: Well. That's... quite the photo. Alita: I know! Oh, he can be powerful and menacing, but so cute! Apollo: But, if he's the boss's only son... Alita: Yes, I'm sure he'll take his father's place some day. Trucy: Say, I'm a boss already! Of this agency! Alita: Please help my Wocky! Please! Apollo: (...Right! My first solo defense case! Crime boss's son or not, I'll prove he's innocent!) Present Attorney's Badge Alita: An attorney's badge... So you really are a defense attorney. Please, I'm counting on you. I need your help. Letter of Request Alita: I hope that's OK? I've never written a letter of request before. Apollo: Oh, it's fine. (I should hope it's your first...) Trucy: If we take this we'll be able to investigate the scene! Anything else Alita: I'm not sure I understand... I'm sorry. Apollo: No, no, it's me who's sorry, really! Sorry! Examine evidence Letter of Request Writing Trucy: Why does this envelope say \"Hit Request\"? Apollo: Um... it's a bit of lingo. Like \"call in a hit\", or a \"hit man\"... Trucy: Ooh, you mean gangster-talk!? So does \"hit\" mean \"to defend\" in gangster-ese? Well, \"hit man\"? Apollo: I certainly hope not... (Something tells me she used the wrong envelope...) June 15Hickfield Clinic Apollo: Huh...? Where's Mr. Wright? Trucy: Maybe he's getting an examination again? Apollo: How many does he need!? (Wasn't it just a sprain?) Trucy: Too bad, Polly! You wanted to show off your request to Daddy, didn't you! Apollo: What? Me? No! Trucy: Oh? That's a surprise. Apollo: L-Let's just come back later, shall we? After clearing \"Your fianc\u00e9\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: June 15Detention CenterVisitor's Room Trucy: Polly! You look as happy as a clam in its shell. Apollo: For a lawyer this is it, the place where the battle begins! Guard: ...Ahem. You need something? Apollo: Aaah! Yes, we're attorneys. I was hoping we could see Mr. Wocky Kitaki? Guard: Sorry, he's in questioning right now. Could take a while. Trucy: Drat. Oh well, guess we'll have to come back later then. Apollo: So much for that battle... Examine Security camera Apollo: That security camera is looking at me. I wonder if they tape all of this. Security guard Apollo: A security guard. He stands here, watching this room. I have no idea if he's listening to us talk. I'm not even sure he's breathing. After clearing \"Your fianc\u00e9\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: June 15Kitaki Mansion Apollo: (So this is it... My first murder crime scene!) Officer: Ah, it's you kids again. Look, can't you find some other place to play... Trucy: We're not playing! We're um, \"investigating\"! Aren't we, Apollo? Apollo: Sir, I have a letter of request here. Officer: Letter of... huh? Why does it say \"Hit Request\" on it? Apollo: (Ms. Tiala must have used the Kitaki's stationery...) ???: Excuse me, coming through. Officer: Ah! It's you! Mr. Gavin! Apollo: ...! (Who's this guy...?) ???: I must say I'm used to being inspected by the ladies... But this is the first time I've felt this way with a man. Apollo: Mr.... Gavin? ???: Ah, Fr\u00e4ulein. What is a sweet morsel like you doing in such a dismal place? Can I help? Trucy: ... Y-Yes! The police man officer fellow here won't let us in! We even have a letter of request! ???: You must be exhausted, standing out here! I will take you to the scene of the crime. Trucy: Oooh! R-Really!? ???: ...By your leave, Officer. Officer: Ya... Yes sir! Of course, sir! ???: Ah ha. Very well. This way, Fr\u00e4ulein... Trucy: Whee! Apollo: ... Hey! What about me!? June 15People Park ???: ...On that note, enjoy your investigation! Trucy: Thank you! Will we see you again...? ???: Ask the wind, Fr\u00e4ulein. I'll be riding on it! Apollo: ...Who was that? Trucy: Eeeeeeeeeek! Apollo! Look! A c-corpse! Apollo: Whaaaat!? ...Hey, it's just a mannequin. Trucy: Wow. It sure got me. ???: Ahem. Might I ask exactly what it is you're doing here? Oh, it's you. How did you kids get in here? Trucy: Oh! This guy, well, he was more like a prince really. He let us in... ???: Him again. That glimmerous fop, always getting in my way... Anyway! This scene is off-limits. Apollo: Excuse me? We have a letter of request! ???: ...Hmm. One moment. Apollo: (Why is she holding that big magnifying glass...?) ???: .............................. I'd recognize that handwriting anywhere. Scientific analysis says this was written by Alita Tiala. Apollo: ...Thanks. (It took you thirty minutes to figure that out!?) So... what's up with the mannequin there? ???: It's taking the place of the body, preserving the scene of the crime as it was found. Apollo: (The body... was pulling the stand!?) ???: So, you're a defense attorney, are you? Ema: Detective Ema Skye. I'm in charge of this crime scene. Trucy: She doesn't seem that happy about it. Apollo: ...She doesn't seem that happy about many things. Ema: I trust you know how to stay out of the way. I always carry two pairs of handcuffs... just in case. Examine Noodle stand Ema: Hey there! No messing with the crime scene! Apollo: B-But we need to investigate! Trucy: Apollo! Look! That stand! ... It says \"Eldoon\"! Apollo: ...I've noticed. Well, we've solved the case of the missing stand at least. ...Though the circumstances could stand to be better. Anywhere else Ema: Hey there! No messing with the crime scene! Apollo: B-But we need to investigate! Ema: Investigations are to be carried out by professionals, scientifically! Apollo: (She's not going to let us check out the crime scene, is she...) Trucy: Hey, Apollo. My very un-scientific analysis tells me something here is very suspicious... Apollo: ...I think I know what you mean. It's kind of hard not to notice. (I'd better check out what we came here to find at least.) Talk Any option Apollo: Um, Detective Skye...? Ema: Quiet, please. It's snack time. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. Trucy: We're not making much progress here. Apollo: (She must not be very busy...) Ema: *sigh* I never seem to get a lucky break. Back after nine years, and they won't give me the position I requested... ...And then I hear he gave up the defense attorney life... Apollo: (He? Who's he? An ex-defense attorney...?) Present Anything Apollo: Um, if you could spare a moment to take a look at this? Ema: ...Can't you see that I am extremely, extremely busy? Apollo: (...Eating snacks, yes.) Trucy: Busy eating snacks, I'd say. Apollo: (This is going nowhere fast.) After clearing any Talk option and examining noodle stand in People Park: June 15Eldoon's House Trucy: Oh, Mr. Eldoon...! Hello? Apollo: Looks like he left. Trucy: And we found his stand and everything! What about our free bowl!? Apollo: Oh, too bad, looks like we'll have to wait a little longer for that bowl. So sorry. Trucy: Aw, what a bummer. Examine Clinic front door Apollo: The front entrance to the Meraktis Clinic. The walls and posts are so highly polished I can see my face in them. ... Hot dang, my hair looks good. Green banner Apollo: Looks like this is a banner for some campaign. \"Three shots for the price of one\"... Somehow I don't see people lining up for that. Police car Apollo: A police car is parked in front of the Meraktis Clinic. It's empty. The police must be inside investigating. Blue tarp Apollo: The blue tarp Mr. Eldoon used to cover his noodle stand. Robbed of its purpose, it blows in the wind... alone. Bowl Apollo: A lone Eldoon's Noodles bowl lies on the ground. The lone bowl, tipped on its side... It's kind of surreal. House Apollo: Mr. Eldoon's house has seen better days. And I'm betting I've eaten better noodles. \"NOO\" sign Apollo: This must be his business sign. It reads \"NOO\". Maybe that's how the kids are spelling \"new\" these days. Another failed attempt at hipster marketing. Oil drum Apollo: An oil drum for catching rainwater. ...Ack! A sparrow just flew over and... Aw man, that was just disgusting! Something tells me this wasn't the first time. Sign under oil drum Apollo: There's a hand-written sign here... \"Save the light!\" It's hard to make out the sign in the shade from the clinic next door. Spoon the dog Apollo: Guy Eldoon's dog doesn't look too lively. They say dogs and their owners resemble each other... I guess there are exceptions. After clearing any Talk option and examining noodle stand in People Park: June 15Hickfield Clinic Phoenix: Ah, you're back! Run into some problems? Trucy: Oh, Polly, didn't you want to tell Daddy something? Apollo: Who? Me? No! I'm fine. Really. Phoenix: What's this? So there is a problem? Apollo: No, no problem. Actually, I got a defense request. Phoenix: A defense request! That is a problem. Apollo: Huh...? Phoenix: I've given up the court. I'm not a lawyer anymore. Apollo: ... The request was for me! Phoenix: Oh, right. You're a lawyer, aren't you? Apollo: (He's doing that on purpose! I know it!) Talk Murder Phoenix: So, what about this defense request? Apollo: It's related to the murder in People Park, actually. Trucy: Guess what! We found Mr. Eldoon's noodle stand at the scene of the crime! Phoenix: Did you now. That's unusual indeed. Never heard of a noodle stand being used as a murder weapon. Apollo: ...Uh, I think the murder weapon was something else. Phoenix: You mean you don't know what the murder weapon was? Trucy: That funny detective lady won't let us on the scene! What kind of detective wears a lab coat, anyway!? Phoenix: A lab coat? Hmm. Didn't think she'd be involved with this... Apollo: ...You know her? Phoenix: You could say that. Skye connection (appears after \"Murder\") Apollo: So... you know her, don't you? Phoenix: I met her on a case... this was about ten years ago. She was still a high school student at the time. Apollo: (That would make her about the same age as me!) Trucy: That's my daddy! He knows all the police types. Oh, wait! Maybe you know that other guy, too! Apollo: That other guy...? Trucy: That shining prince on the motorcycle! Phoenix: ...Prince? Mysterious Prince (appears after \"Skye connection\") Phoenix: Apollo. Tell me about this \"prince\" of Trucy's. Indulge a concerned father... Apollo: He was at the crime scene... He looked just like Mr. Gavin! Phoenix: ... Did he now. Apollo: ...You know him? Phoenix: My guess is he's Kristoph Gavin's younger brother... Apollo: His brother!? Phoenix: We're acquaintances, after a fashion. Klavier Gavin... rock 'n' roll god incarnate. Trucy: Klavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy! Apollo: (I didn't know Mr. Gavin had a brother! And what was he doing out there?) Phoenix: I have a feeling you'll be crossing paths again soon. ...Now, what was the problem again? Having trouble investigating the crime scene in the park? Trucy: Yeah. That detective woman won't let us! Phoenix: ...Go to the office. Under the silk top hat you'll find a bottle of white powder. Try taking that to this detective. Apollo: \"White powder\"...? (I hope it's not what I think it is.) Phoenix: Just take it to her. It'll be fine, you'll see. Oh, and tell her I said hi. Mysterious Prince (subsequent times) Phoenix: Apollo. Tell me about this \"prince\" of Trucy's. Indulge a concerned father... Apollo: He was at the crime scene... He looked just like Mr. Gavin! Phoenix: ... Did he now. Apollo: ...You know him? Phoenix: My guess is he's Kristoph Gavin's younger brother... Apollo: His brother!? Phoenix: We're acquaintances, after a fashion. Klavier Gavin... rock 'n' roll god incarnate. Trucy: Klavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy! Apollo: (I didn't know Mr. Gavin had a brother! And what was he doing out there?) Phoenix: I have a feeling you'll be crossing paths again soon. Wright Anything Agency (after clearing \"Mysterious Prince\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic) Examine Silk hat Leads to: \"So this must be the \"silk top hat\" Mr. Wright mentioned.\" Talk The case Trucy: Hmm... I think we should focus on finding more information about the case. Apollo: You seem to be having fun. Trucy: Of course! This is my first criminal investigation! And it's so mysterious! A noodle stand pushing a dead man along... Apollo: ...Uh, I think it was the other way around. The dead man was pulling the stand. But you're right about it being mysterious. Trucy: I knew it! More information, that's what we need! Apollo: So this must be the \"silk top hat\" Mr. Wright mentioned. Let's take a closer look... Huh? Trucy: Whoa! Apollo: You know what this is, Trucy? Trucy: I... remember finding some in Daddy's dresser when I was little. I thought it was sugar, so I licked it... He got mad at me. Apollo: (This is getting more and more suspicious...) White powder placed gingerly into pocket. Trucy: Let's go talk to that detective! She's sure to know what that white powder is! Examine evidence White Powder Label Apollo: Hmm. The bottle has a label on it. Trucy: Can you read it? Apollo: Uh, not a word. I'm not sure I speak whatever language this is written in. Trucy: That's too bad. I guess we're stuck with this mysterious bottle of white powder... People Park (after clearing \"Mysterious Prince\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic, then examining silk hat in Wright Anything Agency) Present White Powder Leads to: \"Um... Does this ring any bells?\" Apollo: Um... Does this ring any bells? Ema: Ah! Is that--!? It couldn't!? Where'd you get that? Apollo: I brought it from the office. Ema: You... work at the Wright & Co. Law Offices, yes? Apollo: Er, yeah, sort of... Trucy: Detective Skye! How do you know my daddy? Ema: D-D-Daddy!? I'm sorry, who did you say you were? Trucy: Trucy Wright. Phoenix Wright's daughter. Ema: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Mr. Wright has a daughter!? Trucy: You seem shocked. Ema: W-Well, if you're Mr. Wright's daughter and you're his apprentice... ...then I'm available to help you in any way I can! Apollo: Oh, uh, thanks. (You can start by not calling me Mr. Wright's apprentice!) Ema: This powder is used for detecting fingerprints. Apollo: Fingerprints...? Ema: I guess you might call it a memento... from the time I spent with Mr. Wright. Apollo: (White powder memories...) Ema: If you find any evidence with fingerprints on it, please let me know! We'll dust for prints! Apollo: (Well, she's quite the eager beaver all of a sudden...) Examine Benches Apollo: Benches line the river running through the park. Trucy: Ahh, a little urban oasis. I bet children come here to splash around in the water. Apollo: That river's a little deep for splashing... and a little dirty. Trucy: Well, they could listen to the water and pretend they were playing. Blue tarps Apollo: Blue tarps have been placed on the ground around the stand. Trucy: Apollo! I bet the victim was going to have a picnic here! Apollo: ...I guess he could have eaten all the noodles he wanted. Ema: Don't touch those! Those are preserving the crime scene! Apollo: (Oh, I guess the police put these tarps here after all.) Knife Apollo: It's... a knife! Ema: A \"shiv\" to be precise. Trucy: Ooh... lingo! Ema: The defendant, Wocky Kitaki, is the son of known gangsters. The police are assuming this belongs to him. Apollo: (Wait, but wasn't the murder weapon a pistol...?) Huh? Look at this, there's a handprint on this shiv... Ema: A handprint? Then there might be a fingerprint. Let's investigate! Right! First, choose the fingerprint you want to examine. Apollo: ...Choose a fingerprint? Ema: Look closely at the handle. See? There's more than one fingerprint there. Trucy: Those black spots? Ema: That's right. Pick the one you want to analyze. Examine darkest fingerprint Leads to: \"Right! Let's get detecting!\" Ema: Right! Let's get detecting! Apollo: (Wow, she's practically glowing with excitement...) Ema: First, sprinkle some aluminum powder over the print. With a press of [A / Space], like this. See? (Changed from [Just touch the screen, like this. See?] in the original release) The oil left by the print absorbs the aluminum powder, so you just dust it on... ...and blow it off! Trucy: B-Blow? Ema: It's like whistling. You know how to whistle, don't you? Just use [X / Y / R] and... (Changed from [It's like whistling. You know how to whistle, don't you? Just put your lips together...] in the original release) Trucy: Wow! Amazing! It's like magic! Ema: Heh heh. Isn't it though? Apollo: (Right, let's give it a shot!) Ema: Incidentally, it's important that you cover the entire fingerprint with the powder. Obtain fingerprint Leads to: \"Hmm, good... clear... Quite impressive!\" Ema: Hmm, good... clear... Quite impressive! Next, to match the print. The police office has samples so you can tell whose finger this print belongs to. Apollo: Hmm... That doesn't sound like as much fun as actually finding the print. Ema: OK, pick the person whose print you think this is. You probably have a good idea whose knife this is already. Compare Wocky Kitaki profile Comparing...Comparison complete. Match found Leads to: \"So... the fingerprints do belong to the defendant.\" Compare anyone else Comparing...Comparison complete. No Match found Leads back to profile selection Apollo: So... the fingerprints do belong to the defendant. Ema: Yes! Isn't it amazing? Ah, the power of science. It's my life. Trucy: Apollo, she's... sparkling. Apollo: And I'm dimming. Ema: Look sharp, spirits up. The real fight is yet to come! Trucy: Chin up, Polly! Apollo: (The trial hasn't even started and I'm already losing...) Knife added to the Court Record. Knife (subsequent times) Apollo: A knife is sticking straight into the ground. Trucy: With the defendant's fingerprints on it... Which means... You think he stuck it into the victim? Apollo: (I don't know what he did with it but I don't like it.) Mannequin Apollo: This mannequin is dressed up to look like a police officer. I've seen one at the station. (A mannequin in place of a body...) Ema: The body of the victim has already been removed. Trucy: Do you think the victim was the noodle stand thief? Apollo: What, you think someone killed him because he stole it? Trucy: Yeah! Taking care of business, Little Plum Kitaki style! Apollo: (Try not to sound too eager about that, please...) Noodle stand Apollo: ...And this is Mr. Eldoon's noodle stand, obviously. Trucy: It does say \"Eldoon\" in big letters, doesn't it! Apollo: And that mark on his paper lantern there looks familiar. Trucy: It's going to be a little weird telling him... what with the corpse and all... Apollo: Anyway, that wraps up three of our cases. Trucy: That's right! Congratulations, Apollo! Apollo: (And leaves us with one case that's worse than all three put together... Murder.) Trash can Apollo: (There's got to be a good clue or two around here...) Trucy: You and your trash cans! Go ahead, knock yourself out. Apollo: Please, can't you see I'm doing my... Huh? L... Look! Another pair of underwear!? Trucy: Wow, Apollo! You're a genius at finding panties! Apollo: Stop saying that. Wait, these aren't...? Trucy: Th-They're not mine! Apollo: (Could these have been stolen, too?) Bloomers added to the Court Record. Trash can (subsequent times) Trucy: I'll always remember this trash can as \"the place where Apollo found those bloomers\"! Apollo: Don't you have more important things to remember? Wait, these aren't...? Trucy: Th-They're not mine! Apollo: (Could these have been stolen, too?) Talk The case Ema: The report came in late last night. The body was found much as you see it now. ...Except it was a real body. Apollo: But... why? Ema: Why was a body pulling a noodle stand? If I knew the answer to that, I wouldn't still be here. Apollo: Well, what was the cause of death...? Ema: A bullet wound, to the temple. ...He was shot by a pistol. Trucy: A pistol? Ema: Not the easiest thing to come by in this day and age. Apollo: (Unless you're a cop... or a gangster.) Ema: Incidentally, the victim's name was Pal Meraktis. I just received the autopsy report, in fact. Meraktis's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Ema: I mean, really! What's up with this case!? It's enough to make me want to run off, pulling a mysterious noodle stand behind me... Trucy: Not so mysterious, actually... We should tell her, Apollo! After all, we know where the stand came from! Ema: A likely story! I didn't come here to play games, you know. Apollo: Actually, we do know where the noodle stand came from. The noodle stand's owner is... Present Guy Eldoon profile Apollo: Ema: ... Who's the old guy? Apollo: This is the proprietor of Eldoon's Noodles, Mr. Eldoon himself! Trucy: He's famous in this part of town. Ema: Not bad. I guess Mr. Wright picked the right kids for the job. That saved me a lot of work. Thanks. Noodle Stand added to the Court Record. Trucy: What sort of person was the victim, anyway? Ema: You mean what did he do? He was a doctor. Apollo: A doctor...? (I'm starting to see a connection here...) Present anyone else Apollo: Ema: ... Look, I have better things to be doing. I'd make more progress eating snacks than listening to this drivel. Apollo: (You could try actually investigating, rather than just standing around.)

Trucy: What sort of person was the victim, anyway? Ema: You mean what did he do? He was a doctor. Apollo: A doctor...? (I'm starting to see a connection here...) Your story Ema: Who? Me? I'm just a supervisor for this crime scene. Apollo: (Detective Skye... Hmm.) Ema: I was out of the country for a while. I came back to be a forensic scientist. Trucy: Ooh! Were you studying abroad? Ema: Something like that. I was studying in Europe. Forensic sciences, mind you. But when I got back here, they threw me in criminal affairs! Just like that! Trucy: Why didn't you just become a forensics expert in Europe? Ema: Well, I suppose that was an option, but... I had a lot of favors to repay to people back here. Apollo: (Favors? Wasn't she in high school when she left?) Ema: What? What's that look for? I was involved in an... incident before I left. But Mr. Wright and his people helped me out. I owed them. Trucy: Really? I had no idea... Apollo: (If she's been out of the country for a while... ...she probably doesn't know about Mr. Wright's current, erm, \"state of affairs\".) The defendant Apollo: Um... Could you tell us a bit about the defendant? He's the only son of the Kitaki Family, yes...? Ema: Wocky Kitaki. I don't know if he is the boss's son, but he's certainly throwing his weight around... ...Violently. In the detention center. Trucy: I see. Apollo: Why was he arrested in the first place? Ema: ... You are a defense attorney, aren't you? You're not his, by any chance? Apollo: Er, a-actually, yes, I am. Ema: Well... We have a witness to the moment of the crime. Apollo: Eh...? Ema: The witness called the police. They'll be testifying during the trial tomorrow. Trucy: Whaaaaaaaa--!? The victim (appears after correctly presenting Guy Eldoon profile upon selecting \"The case\" Talk option) Apollo: Could you tell us a bit more about the victim? Ema: Well, let's see... Apparently he's the physician at a clinic in the area. Quite well off, too, from the sound of it. The clinic's name is... The Meraktis Clinic. Trucy: Hmm... Maybe that's why the cop car was parked there? Ema: What? You've been to the clinic? Apollo: Yeah... Though on a related issue. Apollo: (I told the detective about the case of the stolen noodle stand.) Ema: ...I see... So that means... ...Dr. Meraktis stole the stand and pulled it all the way here? Apollo: That would seem to be the case. Ema: ... But why? Apollo: Don't ask me! Present Attorney's Badge Ema: Ah, an attorney's badge. It reminds me of when Mr. Wright was still defending. Everything I have now is thanks to him. Remember, help as many people as you can. That's your job! Trucy: She's right, Polly! Let's make a difference! ...Is something wrong? Apollo: Ah! Ah, no! N-Nothing. (I... I actually felt inspired for a moment there.) Fingerprint Powder Ema: Fingerprint analysis is the very basis of modern forensic science! Doesn't just talking about it leave you breathless with excitement? Apollo: Oh yes. Breathless. (Actually, it does sound kinda interesting...) Ema: Let me know if you find any evidence that might have a  print or two, alright? Knife Ema: The defendant's fingerprints were found on that knife. Trucy: Which means that, at the very least, he was here at the scene of the crime...? Ema: It's highly possible, yes. Apollo: Ugh. This doesn't look good. Ema: No use worrying about what's out already! You just worry about what's yet to come! Meraktis's Autopsy Report Ema: Why did Dr. Meraktis die like this...? Trucy: Pulling a noodle stand... Very strange. Ema: Inconceivable! I just don't get it! Some people just can't die normally! Apollo: (He's dead, give him a break.) Anything else Ema: Sorry... I don't think I can help you with that. I think you need more than just scientific help. But ask me anything you like! ...Just ask scientifically. Examine evidence Fingerprint Powder Label Apollo: The label reads \"Fingerprint Powder\" in some strange language. Trucy: How do we know for sure? What if this is really a jar for something else, like jam, or honey? Apollo: Why would anyone go through the trouble? Trucy: Well, so the police don't find out, that's why! Apollo: I hardly think possessing fingerprint powder is a crime. Trucy: Oh, huh, I guess. That's boring. Bloomers Pattern on back side Trucy: These bloomers sure have a... distinct design! Apollo: You certainly know who they belong to at a glance. Trucy: That way, she doesn't have to write her name on them! Genius! Apollo: ...I would think writing your name would be easier than drawing a plum blossom. Knife Fingerprints Trucy: So, the defendant's prints are on this knife... Apollo: That would mean he was here the night of the crime. Trucy: That's what I call irrefutable scientific evidence! Neat! Apollo: Not so neat when it happens to be evidence against our client... Noodle Stand \"NOODLE\" sign Trucy: Huh? Look at this, Apollo! Mr. Eldoon spelled his name backwards on this side! Apollo: Um, I think that says \"Noodle\". As in \"Eldoon's Noodles\". Trucy: Huh... Oh, I get it! So the name of his store is the same whether you read it forward or backwards! Apollo: Yeah... I guess it would be. Well, except for the last \"s\". Trucy: ...... Then, how about a store called \"Team Meat\"? Apollo: Uh, close, but that would be \"Taem Maet\" backwards. And what kind of store is that? Trucy: Why, a store that sells meat! \"It's not meat, useless it's Team Meat!\" After clearing all Talk options and examining trash can and knife: Ema: So... have you met the defendant? Apollo: Ah. Uh... No. Ema: Visiting hours are almost over at the detention center. You might think about wrapping up here and heading over. Apollo: Good idea. (I don't know what good it will do. We have a witness, and a knife with prints... Have I mentioned I've got a bad feeling about this?) Ema: Don't worry, it's like a Wright tradition. Apollo: (Some traditions I can live without.) June 15Detention CenterVisitor's Room Guard: I'm sorry. Meeting hours for the day are all done. Apollo: B-But we still have three minutes! Guard: I'll put in your request, but don't expect anything. The father's talking in the private room with him. Trucy: The father? You mean like a priest? Guard: I mean the suspect's father, Mr. Winfred \"Big Wins\" Kitaki himself. Apollo: (Not someone I care to meet...) ???: ...Die you--!!! ???: ...You're the one on your way out, old--!!! Apollo: ...... Trucy: ......... Guard: Ah. They're here. Apollo: (Whoa! This guy radiates power! Power.. with a cute apron?) ???: You Wocky's lawyer? Apollo: Y-Yes, sir! Big Wins: Well, I'm Big Wins Kitaki, fourth head of the Kitaki family... capice? Apollo: Er... Actually, I came to speak to your son. Big Wins: ... Mr. Justice. Apollo: Yes? Big Wins: My son's innocent. He killed no one. If he were found guilty... it wouldn't be good. ...Capice? Apollo: Y-Yes! I'm all about capicing! Capice'd loud and clear! Big Wins: You gotta do more than just understand to make it. You'll learn, though. Even if the lesson comes at the end of your short life. Apollo: (I don't feel so good...) ???: What's the big idea, old man! Wocky: You can't treat me like a kid no more, not now! You know I... I... I wanted to go to the clink! I like it here! Apollo: You... must be Wocky? Wocky: A G's not a G till he does hard time! Bizzoooy! You'll see. When I get out of here, things'll change! Big Wins: Silence! My apologies, Mr. Justice... He's usually such a nice boy. Apollo: (Forgive me if I have a hard time believing that.) Wocky: Ha! You can't take me under your wing this time, old man! You heard me! I don't need no trial! I did it! Big Wins: ...I think that's enough for today, Mr. Justice. Don't let me down tomorrow. Apollo: So much for talking to our client. Trucy: But we made so much progress today! We even found my panties! I had fun, at least. Apollo: Of course, the biggest mystery of all remains... (How am I supposed to build a case for the trial!?) Trucy: Oh, almost forgot, it's time for my show! Tonight I'm performing at the Wonder Bar! You should come check it out. To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: No clues here. Turnabout Corner Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 June 16, 9:46 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2 Apollo: Huh... Mr. Wright's not here today? Trucy: He said his old foot injury was acting up. Apollo: Old injury...!? He was all smiles yesterday! Trucy: Yes, he smiled when he said we'd be fine \"as long as you're there, Trucy\". Apollo: Yes... Fine... We'll be fine. Here comes Justice!!! I started my voice training at 5 this morning. Trucy: Oooh! Do some now! I want to see! ...Er, hear! Apollo: Huh? Oh, OK. ...Ahem. My name is Apollo Justice, and I'm fine!!! Trucy: ...... That sounds more like a self-mantra than voice training. ???: ...I'm fine! I'm fine! You know what I'm saying!? Apollo: Ack! G-Good morning! Wocky: Yo, 'sup. Hit me with the guilty verdict, G! See if I care. You just hang loose and let things go with the flow. You know what I'm saying!? Apollo: Uh, not really. Big Wins: Wocky! Don't be running your mouth like that in here! Wocky: See, that's the difference between me and you, old man. I ain't afraid of no cops. Real G's can't keep it real till they spend some hard time in the pen. Big Wins: You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Trucy: Sounds like they've both been voice training too, Apollo. Apollo: (My worst fears realized... The trial's starting and I still haven't had a real talk with my client!) June 16, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Wocky Kitaki. Apollo: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Klavier: Ready to rock 'n' roll, Herr Judge. Trucy: Ah! It's him! The pri--guy from yesterday! He's a prosecutor? Apollo: (...It's Mr. Gavin's brother!) Klavier: ... Judge: Long time no see... Prosecutor Gavin. Were you taking a leave of absence? Klavier: You know that little band I started in my free time? Thing is, we got real popular. Hard to say \"nein\" to your fans when three of your singles go platinum, ja? Judge: ...I see. To be honest, I was a little concerned. I feared that you might still be distraught over that one trial... Klavier: Not to worry, Herr Judge. I wouldn't miss this day in court for the world. It's worth even more than VIP passes to one of my concerts, ja? How could I pass up a chance to see the true strength... ...of the little boy who bested my brother? Apollo: ...! Klavier: It was worth canceling a show or two. Judge: Understood. You may give your opening statements to the court. Klavier: Before that, I was thinking... Is the air in this courtroom not a bit... serious? Judge: It IS a court of law. Klavier: That's no way to get the crowd jumping, Herr Judge. Judge: They're not supposed to jump! This is a courtroom! Klavier: Achtung, baby! Today, we play it my way! Apollo: (What's that... noise?) Klavier: Sometimes you have to get on up in order to get down... to prosecuting! Apollo: (This is crazy...) Klavier: The victim... Pal Meraktis, director of the Meraktis Clinic. The scene... People Park. He was found pulling a noodle stand. Judge: What in the world was a doctor doing pulling a noodle stand? Klavier: Yes, I believe... ...you will only find that out by asking the defendant, right here, right now. Because it's an undeniable truth that he shot the victim! Apollo: What do you mean, undeniable? Klavier: If you are to glare at anyone, Herr Justice, glare at the punk in the defendant's chair. His crime was witnessed quite clearly, you see. Judge: ...Very well. Please admit this witness to the court. Klavier: ...Nein! Not yet! First, there is a little matter to be cleaned up... Apollo: (Could you talk without the accompaniment?) Trucy: I swear I could see the guitar for a second! Judge: What is it, Prosecutor Gavin? Klavier: The \"motive\", Herr Judge. Why did the little punk do it? Why did he kill the director of the Meraktis Clinic? Apollo: Apollo: Not so fast! The defendant doesn't have to explain that! Klavier: Oh? But what if the defendant specifically requests to do so? As he did this morning? I want to \"give a shout out to all my homeys!\" I believe he said. Judge: Whaaaaat!? Apollo: (What is right!) Trucy: They always say that, on stage, you should hit the crowd with speed and ferocity! Sounds like he got you good, huh, Polly? Judge: Well, this is highly unusual. But... The court will now hear from the defendant concerning his motive in the crime! Judge: So... You, son, are the defendant... Wocky, are you? Wocky: I ain't your son, old man! You step to a Kitaki, you best be prepared to step strong! Klavier: You \"step\" to a public official, you'd best be prepared to step into jail. Trucy: You got to hand it to him, Wocky sure has guts! Apollo: (It's not his guts I'm worried about...) Judge: Well then, the court will now hear testimony on the defendant's motive... ...from the defendant himself! Witness Testimony -- Wocky Kitaki's \"Truth\" -- Wocky: I'll tell you one thing, that doctor was a quacker! Someone had to show him what's what! I was in his clinic 'bout half a year ago. He messed up my op something bad. And then he just lets me go, without a word. See ya later, bye! So I gotta go in, get another doc to patch me up again! That was the day I done figured it out. No O.G.'s gonna let that pass! That's why I went to his pad that night, know what I'm saying!? Judge: You're saying you were one of the victim's patients...!? Wocky: Lotta stuff goes down when you're keeping it real on the street. Tru dat. I tell you one thing, that doc was wack! Judge: Hmm... Very well, the defense may begin the cross-examination. Apollo: (I can't believe this is the first time I'm hearing about all of this...) Cross Examination -- Wocky Kitaki's \"Truth\" -- Wocky: I'll tell you one thing, that doctor was a quacker! Press Apollo: Apollo: First of all, the word you're looking for is \"quack\". And isn't that a little harsh? He's your family doctor... Wocky: Who asked you, pointy-locks!? Just who do you think you are? Apollo: (Uh... your lawyer?) Wocky: Look, I ain't trying to hear that. He was a quacker, plain and simple. Wocky: Someone had to show him what's what! Press Apollo: Apollo: By \"someone\" you mean...? Was there anyone with a score to settle with this doctor? ...Besides you, I mean. Wocky: You better ask somebody else, homes. What do I care? I made up my own mind and did what had to be done. Straight gangsta-style! Judge: But... why were you so mad at this doctor? Wocky: Yo, sit back and listen while I drop it, J-man. Wocky: I was in his clinic 'bout half a year ago. He messed up my op something bad. Press Apollo: Apollo: So you were a patient at the Meraktis Clinic half a year ago? For what reason? Wocky: I had what you might call a \"mark of honor\". Klavier: Can you explain precisely what was wrong? Wocky: We had a little run-in with the Rivales Family. That's when I pulled a jack move... ...and ran into an ambush. G busted a cap right in me. Klavier: According to my sources... you \"couldn't stand the stress of waiting... ...and ran in 15 minutes before the appointed time.\" ...By yourself. Wocky: Hey, I was more than a match for those guys! Judge: So you were carried to the Meraktis Clinic from there? Klavier: Apparently, he was shot in the heart. Apollo: (Shot in the heart and he's still alive!?) Trucy: I can catch bullets between my teeth! But I never learned how to catch them with my heart! Wocky: The bullet stopped just short of my thumper, you know what I'm saying? I woulda been golden if it weren't for that wack doc! Can't even take out a stupid bullet! Klavier: ...So, as you say, the surgery was a failure. Wocky: That ain't all of it, homes! Wocky: And then he just lets me go, without a word. See ya later, bye! Press Apollo: Apollo: What do you mean, he just let you go without a word? Wocky: What do you think it means!? It's wack, that's what! Judge: I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds bad... Klavier: It sounds as though Herr Doktor wished to hide his mistake... This is why he let the defendant go. Wocky: He's a liar, straight up! He's a badder G than me! Wocky: So I gotta go in, get another doc to patch me up again! Press Apollo: Apollo: So, this bullet is still...? Wocky: You know it! I can still feel it... Right there in my chest, pressin' up against my heart! Klavier: \"Your words are like a bullet shot straight into my heart.\" ...or something to that effect? Incidentally, that's from one of our hit singles. Judge: Well, that sounds like a straightforward case of malpractice! Wocky: Word, J-man. Weren't no accident, that's fo' shizzle. Wocky: That was the day I done figured it out. No O.G.'s gonna let that pass! Press Apollo: Apollo: You figured it out that day? So you had no idea until then? Wocky: For half a year, I didn't notice a thing. Apollo: Whaaaat!? You had a bullet in your chest and you didn't know!? Wocky: Heh! Takes more than a bullet to bring me down, homes! Apollo: (How many bullets does it take!?) Wocky: That's why I went to his pad that night, know what I'm saying!? Press Apollo: Apollo: You \"went to his pad\"...? Did you have an appointment to meet with the victim? In the park, perhaps? Wocky: You out of your mind!? Who makes an appointment to get the drop on someone!? I came ready to fight my way into that clinic of his. Shortest way to the clinic from my place is through that park, know what I'm saying? Apollo: (...He's right. That does seem to be the shortest path.) Wocky: There I was, cold walking through the park... ...when he comes popping up out of nowhere, right before my eyes! I figured someone up on high was looking out for me, know what I'm saying? Apollo: (Unngh... This sounds bad right from the get-go.) Trucy: Well, there won't be any get-go if we don't get some more information! Apollo: (Right. First, gather the facts. Time enough for despair later!) After pressing third, fourth, and fifth statements: Judge: Hmm... It seems that there were issues with this doctor. Wocky: Man, putting him down was like doing the world a favor! Apollo: Wocky! ...Please consult your lawyer before saying things like that... Trucy: Chin up, Apollo! Back straight! Judge: But, why did this mistake only come to light that day? Klavier: It was found during the Family health check-up. Apollo: The F-Family check-up? Wocky: That was the wackest thing of all! All us G's lining up, taking eye exams 'n' all that. Better to die young than fade away, bizzzoy! Klavier: ...A relief to hear. Wocky: Eh? Wh-What's a relief!? Klavier: Oh? Did your father not tell you? That bullet you carry so close to your heart... if not attended to immediately... ...It could kill you. Apollo: Wh-Whaaat!? Klavier: Yes, Herr Doktor Meraktis had knowledge concerning this ticking \"time bomb\" in you. Knowledge... that could have saved your life. Wocky: No way! Th-That's wacked! Klavier: There is proof. Your check-up report. Wocky's Check-Up Report added to the Court Record. Klavier: ...How ironic that you would kill the one man capable of helping you. You're almost as careless as he was! ...Ah ha ha ha. Wocky: ...... Apollo: ...... Klavier: Well, now that the place is hopping... Let's get this gig started! Judge: S-Started...? Klavier: We've had enough of a warm-up act, ja? Time to hear from the witness! Trucy: ...Wocky sure is quiet all of a sudden. Apollo: I'm a little uneasy myself. (Is this Gavin's strategy...?) Klavier: So. You will tell us your name and occupation. Stickler: My name... is Wesley Stickler. By \"occupation\" I take it you refer to some labor that \"profits\" society at large, and supports a livelihood under which definition I must confess to being \"unemployed\" however, we must acknowledge the meaning of \"identity\" which is commonly attached to this notion of \"occupation\", and once we have accepted this reality, we see that our confusion is not Gestalt, per se, but derives instead from the \"vagueness\" inherent in all representations of thoug-- Klavier: By which he means to say that he is a student. A junior at Ivy University if I'm not mistaken? Stickler: Yes, in the Department of Science and Engineering. Filled with curiosity for all things, I spend my days in pursuit of truth, honing my... Klavier: Herr Stickler, please direct said curiosity to the case at hand today. Judge: Very well, Mr. Stickler. Please testify to the court about what you saw on the night of the crime. Stickler: You ask, quite simplistically, \"what I saw\". However, we must understand that homo sapiens possess two eyes, each of these designed to receive and interpret data, sending images in the form of signals to the... Witness Testimony -- A Night in the Park -- Stickler: That night, I passed through the park on my way home from shopping... when I saw them! One man, pulling a stand. Another man, facing him. I saw them quite clearly. The man facing the victim was the defendant. In his hand he held... yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand. A shot! The bullet hit the man pulling the stand from the front, square in the forehead! Judge: Hmm... Was there anyone else in the park at that time? Stickler: I can say with 100% accuracy that there was not. Klavier: The pistol our witness refers to... is this. Judge: The court accepts this into evidence. Pistol added to the Court Record. Examine evidence Pistol Muzzle Apollo: Whoa! Don't point that thing to me! Trucy: Don't worry! I can handle myself around guns. Magic guns, at least. The ones that pigeons come out of. Apollo: ...Very reassuring. Judge: Very well. Mr. Justice, you may cross-examine the witness. Apollo: ...Yes, Your Honor. Trucy: ... Apollo: Uh... Trucy? Why are you staring like that at the witness? Trucy: That man... I can't help but feel I've seen him somewhere before. Apollo: ...? Cross Examination -- A Night in the Park -- Stickler: That night, I passed through the park on my way home from shopping... when I saw them! Press Apollo: Apollo: On the way home from shopping, you say? Why go through the park? Stickler: Ah, a fascinating inquiry. Revealing me culpable of being insufficiently verbose! Let us consider the time saved by passing through the park on the way home from the store: In that time I am capable of solving two GMAT problem sets. On average, it requires me 3 minutes, 24 seconds to complete one such set. Ergo the time to complete two is, on average, 6 minutes 48 seconds. However! In the case that the questions are in the verbal category, admittedly not m... Apollo: Th-That's enough! Enough. I get the idea. Judge: Mr. Justice! The court hopes to finish cross-examination sometime this month. Klavier: Please. I've a recording booked after this trial. Trucy: And I've got a show to perform. Apollo: (Gee, sorry you're all so busy!) Stickler: One man, pulling a stand. Another man, facing him. Press Apollo: Apollo: Were these men talking, by any chance? Stickler: Ah, now that you mention it, they were, though I cannot claim I heard them clearly. Only fragments... such as, \"You lied to me!\" Oh, and... \"I'm gonna give you a taste of your own medicine, pal.\" Klavier: Ah ha ha ha! It's just as our defendant claims! I believe he wished to \"teach\" the victim what it felt like to take a bullet in the heart. Judge: If that's true, then this is a vital piece of testimony! Apollo: (Sounds like he heard them clearly enough to me!) Stickler: Might I be allowed to amend my testimony? Apollo: (Wh... What now!?) Stickler: To be precise, he did not say \"pal\" but \"man\". Yes, that was the way of it. I swear it on my diploma! Apollo: (What's the difference!?) Klavier: And this other man, who was he? Stickler: I saw them quite clearly. The man facing the victim was the defendant. Press Apollo: Apollo: How can you be so sure it was the defendant!? The crime took place at night! It would have been too dark! Stickler: ...Perhaps I was remiss in not mentioning this earlier. Apollo: Huh? Stickler: You see, in class, I always sit in the very backmost seat. Do you know why? Apollo: (...Who cares!?) Stickler: Because I do not wish anyone to copy my perfect notes! Judge: ...And this relates to your testimony how? Stickler: I mention this to illustrate my predisposition to that which is \"perfect\". It was dark, you say? Yet there are lights in the park. If I say the defendant was in the park that night, then he was in the park that night. It is a hard, immutable fact. Trucy: He sure is confident... Apollo: He seems to be telling the truth, too. *sigh* Stickler: In his hand he held... yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand. Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure the pistol you saw is the same as the one just submitted as evidence? Stickler: Am I \"sure\"? Surely... you jest! ...Or so a common witness would be tempted to say. Apollo: ...Huh? Stickler: Yet I am no common witness. I see not only events as they are, but the logical structure governing these events! First, we must consider the fact that it was night in the park, which indeed restricted my field of vision due to insufficient levels of illumination. Now if we consider that the pistol, let us call it \"Object A\", was indeed shrouded in darkness it becomes difficult to say with certainty that Object A was indeed Object A. Trucy: I think he means he couldn't see it that clearly. Apollo: (My badge for a normal witness...) Stickler: Yet the fact that a pistol was fired before my eyes is indisputable. I can still see it when I close my eyes. The defendant raised his weapon... Stickler: A shot! The bullet hit the man pulling the stand from the front, square in the forehead! Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you absolutely certain only one shot was fired? Stickler: Yes. Of course it was one shot. Why do you ask? Apollo: (Ah ha! A contradiction! Finally!) Mr. Stickler. According to the Court Record, the pistol was fired twice. A clear contradiction! Klavier: Klavier: ...Good eyes, Herr Justice. You're cool. Real cool. Apollo: Eh? Y-You really think so? Klavier: Yet, there is no reason why this other shot had to have been fired that night. Judge: Meaning...? Klavier: This pistol came from the Kitaki Family mansion, ja? I think it's not unreasonable to assume the pistol had been fired once before that night. During, perhaps... another altercation? Apollo: (Ugh... He's got a point.) Trucy: Judging from his smug expression... ...I'd say Prosecutor Gavin had that answer ready before you even spotted the problem. Present Meraktis's Autopsy Report Apollo: Leads to: \"Whew... If that's all of it, I think I have a chance.\" Apollo: (He seems pretty confident in his testimony.) Trucy: We always make the biggest mistakes when we're our most confident! He's got a weak point somewhere, Apollo! Find it! Apollo: (...Right! Better give that testimony another listen.) Apollo: (Whew... If that's all of it, I think I have a chance.) Klavier: Is that you... relaxing, I see, Herr Justice? Apollo: Huh? Oh, er... Ahem! Objection!!! Judge: ...Once is quite enough, Mr. Justice. Trucy: Apollo! Pace yourself! This trial's not over yet! Apollo: Urk! Eh, right! Ahem, um, look at this! Judge: The... autopsy report? Is there a problem with the autopsy report? Apollo: Um, right, a problem... Problem... problem... Yes!!! The problem is the location of the entry wound! Judge: The location...? Apollo: You testified that the killer shot the victim \"square in the forehead\", did you not? Stickler: Ah, I have already determined your \"angle\" of inquiry. ...Allow me to explain. It is quite simple, really: First, understand that when I say \"square\", I speak not of geometrical absolute. What do I mean by this? For example, the defection of a \"meter\" is 1,650,763.73 times the wavelength of the light emitted by a krypton particle, as we all know. In addition, it is a well known fact that krypton particles are rare, and invisible to the naked eye, which points to a basic fallacy in your line of reasoning, namely, that wh-- Judge: Mr. Justice. Apollo: Yes? Judge: Was your objection to these, er, krypton particle things? Klavier: This is the big time, and you are obsessed with something so small? You disappoint me. Apollo: N-N-No! I'm obsessed with something big! I mean, there's a bigger, less nitpicky problem here! Judge: Do tell... Apollo: Just look at the autopsy report! The location of the entry wound was... ...the right temple! Stickler: T-Temple...? Apollo: Mr. Stickler, you said quite clearly that the victim was shot \"square in the forehead\"! That's a contradiction! ...Isn't it? (It is, right? Finally!) Klavier: Klavier: Herr Justice... Oh, Herr Justice... Apollo: Yes...? Klavier: Your tactics are outdated. Trying to shake the witness by objecting to trifles? Surely you haven't forgotten the fatal wound your master suffered seven years ago? Phoenix Wright... was it? Apollo: ...! Look, I know the wound was in the wrong place according to this testimony! Stickler: Nyurk...! Klavier: Hey, Herr Forehead... Apollo: ...! (F... \"Forehead\"!?) Klavier: Let us imagine you are walking through the park. You see two men facing each other. One with a pistol trained on the other. ...What would you do, Herr Forehead? Apollo: Well, I... I guess... I would try to stop them. I'd probably shout, \"Stop!\" Klavier: And you, Fr\u00e4ulein? Trucy: M-Me? Well... I'd probably scream, \"Eeeeeek!\" Klavier: And you, Herr Stickler? What did you shout, I wonder? Apollo: Ack...! (If the victim turned his head at the last moment...*gulp*) Stickler: ...Ah yes. Thank you for jogging my memory. Judge: It sounds like an addendum to the testimony is required. Witness Testimony -- A Night in the Park 2 -- Stickler: As soon as the killer raised his pistol, I took action. \"Cease this at once, you two!\" I cried... with composure. The victim turned in the direction of my voice... and a shot rang out. Whereupon our cowardly killer, the defendant, appeared to have become frightened. Tossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene. Judge: I see... So you attempted to stop the crime. Stickler: Indeed. ...With composure. Trucy: Well, maybe the criminal wouldn't have fired if he hadn't shouted like that. Apollo: Th-That doesn't really matter now, unfortunately. Klavier: Let us consider this new testimony, shall we? ...Observe the diagram, if you would. The witness... Mr. Stickler, was it? Stood here. He shouted, \"Oh stop! Please!\" or something of this nature. And the victim responded by looking in the witness's direction! If the killer were to have fired at just that moment... As we can see, the bullet would have struck the right temple, as in the report. Judge: That does seem to be the case. Stickler: Witness the power of a Junior in Ivy University's Department of Science! Judge: Very well, Mr. Justice, you may cross-examine the witness. Cross Examination -- A Night in the Park 2 -- Stickler: As soon as the killer raised his pistol, I took action. Press Apollo: Apollo: So you saw a raised pistol... Weren't you frightened? Stickler: It can be said we students of Ivy University know no fear. The moment I saw that pistol, my inner sense of justice compelled me to take action! Judge: That was certainly brave of you. You might have gotten shot! Stickler: Eh!? Klavier: You certainly were lucky. If I were in the killer's shoes, I certainly wouldn't have left a witness behind. Stickler: ......! Trucy: He actually looks like he had no idea he was in danger. Stickler: R-Regardless, I attempted to halt the bloodshed! Stickler: \"Cease this at once, you two!\" I cried... with composure. Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure both men were able to hear your voice? Stickler: They were, of course. My high, exquisite voice echoed through the park. Klavier: And the victim responded to that clarion call... Stickler: Quite. Stickler: The victim turned in the direction of my voice... and a shot rang out. Press Apollo: Apollo: Did you hear the gunshot at the same time as the victim turned? Stickler: Indeed. I would say \"about\" the same time, to be precise. Apollo: And the victim didn't ask you for help? Stickler: It can be said that he didn't have time to ask. He didn't even have time to take a single step. Trucy: I'm totally sure that the killer fired because Mr. Stickler startled him. Apollo: Don't say that too loud, Trucy, please... Stickler: Whereupon our cowardly killer, the defendant, appeared to have become frightened. Press Apollo: Apollo: Can you describe the killer's actions more clearly? Stickler: He seemed quite surprised, especially considering that it was he who did the deed! As we can see, human psychology is a tangled web, indeed. Klavier: He simply couldn't believe what he had done. He shot, he panicked. A common tale, but true. Stickler: Unfortunately, before I could take further action... Stickler: Tossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene. Press Apollo: Apollo: You didn't try to apprehend the criminal? Stickler: It all happened so fast, I'm afraid I hadn't the time. Trucy: Doesn't something about that strike you as odd, Apollo? Apollo: ...! What? Trucy: The killer was in a hurry, right? He fired the pistol, and tossed it right away... Apollo: According to the testimony, that's what happened, yes. Trucy: In that case, I'd expect to find something that we didn't find! Apollo: (Find \"something\"? Find what?) Present Pistol Apollo: Apollo: Wait a second! Sticker: Tsk, tsk, another misleading request. Yet you're so beholden to your own mode of \"discourse\" you can't see how it affects you! Apollo: Um... come again? Stickler: Wait a \"second\", you say? A \"second\"? Are we intended to wait just that, a single second, one sixtieth of a minute? That's hardly enough time to draw a breath, let alone make a statement in court! Now, had you asked for a longer period of time, say, 3 minutes, 35 seconds, th-- Judge: Mr. Justice. Apollo: Yes, Your Honor? Judge: Am I to understand you are objecting to the length of a second? Apollo: Yes! I mean, no! Here, just look at the pistol! It doesn't have a single fingerprint on it! Stickler: Ah, a common ploy, made all the more common, I fear, by the prevalence of television. Criminals these days are loathe to leave fingerprints. Apollo: Wait! But you said the killer tossed the gun and ran! Trucy: That's right! He didn't have time to wipe the gun for prints! Stickler: ...! Klavier: Ah, the little girl sticking it to the university student. There's a song in there... Trucy: I'm not little! Klavier: A ha ha ha... Then let's think like adults, shall we, Fr\u00e4ulein? Trucy: Eh...? Klavier: What if the killer... the defendant, was wearing gloves? Trucy: ... Gotta admit, I didn't think of that, Apollo. Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Apollo: (Could the killer have been wearing gloves...?) I guess... Apollo: (If he was wearing gloves, there wouldn't be prints...) ... (C'mon Justice, you've gotta come up with something...!) Judge: Is there something you want to tell the court, Mr. Justice? Klavier: His silence speaks louder than words, Herr Judge. He can think of nothing... nein? Apollo: I g-guess he could have been wearing gloves. (...I guess.) Judge: Then let's continue with the testimony. If you would. Stickler: ...My pleasure, Your Honor. A small pleasure, but still. Leads back to cross-examination No way Leads to: \"The record of the murder weapon is very clear about one thing:\" Trucy: I liked that contradiction. Kinda sad to see it go. Apollo: Not as sad as I feel. What do we do now? Trucy: At least the testimony's getting a little clearer. Apollo: (She's right! Maybe I can find something to use in this new testimony.) Apollo: The record of the murder weapon is very clear about one thing: The fingerprints were \"wiped\" which means some trace of prints remained! Which contradicts your testimony! If everything happened as you say it did, he wouldn't have had time to wipe the pistol! Stickler: ...That may be. But it does not change what I saw. The killer... the defendant... He threw down the murderous weapon from his hand and fled. Judge: Hmm... Stickler: And this pistol was found at the scene of the crime. Strongly suggesting that this was the weapon he disposed of! Klavier: That sounds solid to me. Well, Herr Forehead? Any of your precious \"objections\"? Apollo: ... Trucy: What gives, Apollo!? Let's see that voice training go to work! Apollo: You know, I've only recently realized something. No matter how much you train your voice, it doesn't matter if you have nothing to say. Trucy: What do you mean, \"nothing to say\"!? Isn't it obvious from what the witness just said? Apollo: Huh? Isn't what obvious? Trucy: When he re-stated what he saw just now, he said he saw Wocky drop a \"murderous weapon\". But that's not the same as being 100% sure of what Wocky threw away! Apollo: You're right! Trucy: He's just confused because a pistol was found at the scene! Poor Mr. Stickler... It must be hard to be so perfect, and yet so wrong. Stickler: W-Well! It can be said that I'm quite offended! While it is, indeed, true that once, in my youth, I wrote a love letter in my own blood that was seized by the teacher and posted on the blackboard for all to see, and for this the appellation \"poor\" might as well be prefixed to my name, yet as for the issue at ha-- Judge: What we can say for certain is that the witness saw the killer throw \"something\"... Does the defense have anything to say about this? Trucy: Well, if what he threw wasn't a pistol... Apollo: Then it had to be something else! Klavier: At least one person on the defense team seems to be thinking. Apollo: (Grr... I'll wipe that smile off your pretty face, Gavin!) Judge: Perhaps you can inform the court as to the nature of this \"something else\"? What did the killer throw away before fleeing the scene? Present Knife Apollo: Leads to: \"Is that... a sword?\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: What the witness really saw... was this! Or... something like it. Judge: ... Penalty. Apollo: (That didn't even warrant a wise-crack, did it.) Judge: Perhaps you'd like to try that again, Mr. Justice? Leads back to: \"What did the killer throw away before fleeing the scene?\" Judge: Is that... a sword? I saw one of those on the late night movie last night! Apollo: (Great, a sleep-deprived judge...) This knife was found at the scene of the crime... with the defendant's prints on it. Judge: His prints! Apollo: This single piece of evidence proves two important things: One, that what the defendant threw down wasn't a pistol. Two, that the defendant wasn't wearing gloves! Judge: Hmm... Indeed! Klavier: Oh, Herr Forehead? You're forgetting two other things you've just proven. Apollo: Huh? Klavier: One, that the man the witness saw was the defendant, Mr. Wocky Kitaki. Two, that the defendant was holding a knife, with the intent of harming the victim! Apollo: Oh. Judge: Hmm... Indeed! Apollo: (Grr... Never underestimate a Gavin is the lesson here.) Judge: This court is of the opinion that our witness is fond of making assumptions. In that light, I believe it would behoove us to hear about what really occurred... ...with less assuming, please! Stickler: It is always the same with you people. \"Mark left the house on foot, and five minutes later, his brother left after him. How long would it take for Mark's brother to catch up to him... ...assuming that Mark never had to stop for a traffic light!\" \"Assuming\"... Yes, that's what I said. \"Assuming\"! As if that were a probable situation at all! Yet here you are \"assuming\" that my \"assumption\" is no better! Judge: Ahem. What this court \"assumes\"... ...is that the witness will testify as to what happened after the shot was fired! Witness Testimony -- From Shot to Call -- Stickler: I could not prevent the killer from leaving the scene. Nor could I simply leave the scene in good conscience. Ergo! I used my cell phone to call the police. Until the police arrived at the scene 10 minutes later, I saw no one else. Apollo: Why didn't you chase the killer? Stickler: He was, as you say, a killer. Of course, I could have run him down, yet what would he have done when cornered? Sadly, it takes more than an aptitude for solving quadratic equations to know that. Judge: Hmm... Klavier: Did the testimony earlier not prove the defendant's presence at the scene? And do we not also now know that there was no one else there? ...It seems clear that we have our killer. Does it not? Judge: Does it not, Mr. Justice? Apollo: (I'd better find a way to take this testimony down quick!) Cross Examination -- From Shot to Call -- Stickler: I could not prevent the killer from leaving the scene. Press Apollo: Apollo: Which way did the killer run? Stickler: By that time, it was clear the killer had noticed me. Naturally, he ran in the opposite direction. Apollo: (That would mean he ran in the opposite direction from the Kitaki mansion...) Klavier: Achtung! Don't even think about pointing out that he was going away from his home. All he had to do was loop back once he was out of sight. Apollo: (Ugh... How did he know that's where I was going...?) Trucy: ... Press (after pressing all other statements) Apollo: Apollo: Which way did the killer run?

Apollo: Nnk...! (Argh! There's nothing fishy about that testimony at all!) Judge: It appears there are no objections to the witness's current testimony. Klavier: There are any number of ways to explain the lack of prints on the pistol, I assure you. Perhaps the killer really was wearing gloves which wiped the previous user's prints off. Then, after the deed was done, this fell out of his pocket as he was throwing the gun away. A mistake befitting of a small-time punk, in my opinion. Apollo: No... Nooooooooooo! Judge: It seems we've come to the end of the line here. Apollo: (No... that can't be all!) Klavier: How unfortunate. It seems that you weren't cut out to stand on the same stage as me. Were you, Herr Forehead? Judge: I believe this brings the cross-examination to a close. This court will now declare a verdict for the defendant, Wocky Kitaki. ???: ???: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!

There are some things you just don't do! I... I'm pressing charges! Trucy: Apollo! Now is not the time to be threatening me! It's you who's being threatened here! Apollo: Huh...? Trucy: Remember what you said to Wocky's father yesterday? You promised you'd save his son! Apollo: B-But that testimony was rock solid! What are you suggesting I do? Trucy: Look, once the judge declares a verdict, it's all over. If I can use my talent to stop that from happening, I will! Apollo: Trucy, no more staged abductions, please... Trucy: I'm not talking about magic, Apollo! I know when the witness isn't confident... I can perceive what he's feeling! It might not mean anything, but it's all we've got... Apollo: You can see... what he's \"feeling\"? Trucy: Think back, Apollo! Think back to the times when there was a contradiction in his testimony! All the times! Apollo: All the times there was a contradiction...? I remember Apollo: Well, I think I remember them, sure... Leads to: \"There were two times when he made statements he wasn't confident in.\" I don't remember Apollo: Um... Actually, I don't remember them exactly. Trucy: Good thing I do! Leads to: \"There were two times when he made statements he wasn't confident in.\" Trucy: There were two times when he made statements he wasn't confident in. And each time, there was a contradiction. Stickler: In his hand he held.. yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand. Stickler: Tossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene. Trucy: He said the man tossed aside a pistol... But it turned out he wasn't sure, and sure enough, there was a contradiction. Apollo: Well, that's true, but how does that help us? Trucy: Didn't you notice anything? Whenever he made a statement he wasn't confident in... ...he displayed a certain habit! Stickler: In his hand he held... yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand. Trucy: Did you see it? The very moment he said the word \"pistol\"... ...his fingers got all tense, and he fiddled with the corner of a page in his book! Apollo: How'm I supposed to see that!? Trucy: Well, I could see it. How else do you think Daddy went seven years without losing a game of poker? Apollo: Wha--!? Trucy: I always sat next to Daddy during big matches. I could see what his opponents were feeling! Apollo: You mean that's how Mr. Wright won all those games? Trucy: It's not cheating, officially. I wasn't looking at their hands or anything. And I wasn't there all the time, either. Daddy's quite good at poker, after all. But not good enough to go undefeated that long! Apollo: Great, so he cheated. But what does that do for us? (I don't believe this...) Trucy: You have to listen to his testimony one more time! No... scratch that! You have to watch his testimony! Perceive the truth! Apollo: \"Watch\" a testimony? \"Perceive\" the truth? The only thing I'm perceiving is that I'm going to lose. Trucy: Not true! Apollo: ...! Trucy: Daddy said so. He said you have the power, Apollo. Apollo: Mr. Wright said that? (Watch the testimony... Perceive his true feelings... Is she serious!?) Trucy: Time's up! Sorry I can't think of any other way out of this one, Apollo. Apollo: (What was that she said before the trial started?) Apollo: Huh... Mr. Wright's not here today? Trucy: He said his old foot injury was acting up. Yes, he smiled when he said we'd be fine \"as long as you're there, Trucy\". Apollo: (Is this what he meant by us being \"fine\"...? Well... methods aside, she did avoid one guilty verdict already today. Time to show this court what I'm made of! Get ready for Justice!) ...Let's do it. Trucy: Apollo... Apollo: You know, I'm starting to think I can do this. Trucy: ...I knew you could do it all along! Oh, one more thing. Apollo: ? Trucy: Try to cover for Mr. Hat as best you can! Mr. Hat: I just flew in from the coast, and boy are my arms tired! Apollo: Right... (*sigh*) June 16, 11:40 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: Court is now back in session. Apollo: Right! We're fine! Judge: ...... Ahem. I'd like to say to the young lady standing next to you, Mr. Justice... Trucy: Oh, you mean me? Judge: Don't you have anything to report? Anything... concerning the mysterious phantom in the silk top hat? Apollo: Ah! Right! Him! Don't worry about him. I settled that. Judge: You \"settled\" that...? Apollo: Erm, yes, it was an... out of court settlement! Right. Klavier: Perhaps Fr\u00e4ulein would have us believe it was nothing more than a passing dream... ...a fantastic illusion, now you see it, now you don't. Am I right? Trucy: ...I think he's on to me. Apollo: I wish he would stop being so... so cool. Klavier: Let us dispense with these niceties and get straight to the matter. What are your plans for our gifted witness? Apollo: R-Right... The defense would like to request another cross-examination! B-Because... Because I forgot to ask something. Judge: There was no issue with the witness's previous testimony. I will grant your request, however. But this court will not permit stalling for time! Apollo: ...Understood, Your Honor. Trucy: Don't forget, Apollo! When he isn't sure about something, he has a habit of fiddling with his book! Witness Testimony -- From Shot to Call -- Stickler: I could not prevent the killer from leaving the scene. Nor could I simply leave the scene in good conscience. Ergo! I used my cell phone to call the police. Until the police arrived at the scene 10 minutes later, I saw no one else. Apollo: (I'm not sure I'm qualified to \"watch\" testimonies after all...) Trucy: Focus, Apollo! Find his weak spot! Apollo: (Focus... If only it were that easy! My ears hear what he says, my eyes see his expression. Do I have to do something more? What other senses do I have!? W-What's this...? My bracelet...?) BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (What's going on? My bracelet feels different somehow...!) Trucy: I think Daddy was right! You can see it, can't you, Apollo? You're almost there! Find the weak spot in his testimony! Apollo: (I know this sounds crazy... But my bracelet is trying to tell me something!) Cross Examination -- From Shot to Call -- Stickler: I could not prevent the killer from leaving the scene. Press Apollo: Apollo: Which way did the killer run? Stickler: By that time, it was clear the killer had noticed me. Naturally, he ran in the opposite direction. Apollo: (That would mean he ran in the opposite direction from the Kitaki mansion...) Klavier: Achtung! Don't even think about pointing out that he was going away from his home. All he had to do was loop back once he was out of sight. Apollo: (Ugh... How did he know that's where I was going...?) Stickler: Nor could I simply leave the scene in good conscience. Press Apollo: Apollo: You were certainly composed for someone who had just witnessed a killing. Stickler: If one is to devote one's life to the pursuit of science... ...one must never flinch at the sight of a little blood. Nor be so moved by a chemical discovery that one drops one's flask upon the lab room floor. Klavier: Oooh, cool answer. Very cool. Apollo: (Hmm... So nothing strange about how he acted...) Stickler: Ergo! I used my cell phone to call the police. Press Apollo: Leads to: \"So, you called immediately after witnessing the murder?\" Stickler: Until the police arrived at the scene 10 minutes later, I saw no one else. Press Apollo: Apollo: Can you tell us in detail about these 10 minutes? Stickler: I stood in a state of heightened awareness. Anything could happen at any moment. Anyone could appear from any direction! ... Apollo: Is... that all? Stickler: No one came. Nothing happened at all. I saw it all, which is to say... I saw nothing. Judge: It was late at night. It's not odd to think there would be few people around in the park. Apollo: (So he just stood there, watching? Hmm... Not much to go on there.) Trucy: Don't forget, Apollo. You have to focus to perceive the truth! Apollo: (I'm not sure I entirely understand this just yet. But I have \"perceived\" one thing... My bracelet is reacting to his testimony... this has to be the key!) Apollo: So, you called immediately after witnessing the murder? Stickler: The police undoubtedly have a record of the call. Why not check with them? Trucy: Wait, Apollo! This has to be it! Apollo: Wait, you mean his habit? Trucy: Don't forget, Apollo! When he isn't sure about something, he has a habit of fiddling with his book! Apollo: (The only time he even had the book open was here... Which means this is the place to look for this \"habit\"!) I... don't know how I know, but I know. Trucy: ...Know what? Apollo: It's my bracelet, it's different, somehow. I can feel it reacting to something about the witness! Trucy: Your... bracelet? Apollo: I'm not sure I get this \"focus\" stuff you were talking about, Trucy. But... I have a feeling that trusting my bracelet is the way to go. (OK, I just need to touch my bracelet with [X / Y / R] as it reacts to the testimony...) (Changed from [OK, I just need to touch my bracelet as it reacts to the testimony...] in the original release) Touch bracelet Leads to: \"Wh-What's going on!?\" Apollo: Wh-What's going on!? (I can see the witness's face, his expression so clearly! I-It's filling my mind! I can see nothing else, hear nothing else!) Trucy: Apollo? Apollo: Trucy! What's happening to me!? Trucy: This is what I meant by \"focusing\". Apollo: Focusing... Trucy: In this state, you can see everything, Apollo! Everything the witness does! Apollo: Th-That's great, but this is kind of freaking me out! Trucy: Just look for Mr. Stickler's twitch -- his habit. You remember it, right? Apollo: Sure! When he says something he's not sure of, he fiddles with a page of his book. Trucy: You got it! Right now, you're looking at the witness's face. ...And your eyes are sort of bugging out. Apollo: (I'll bet they are.) Trucy: First, move your focus of attention down to Mr. Stickler's hand. Apollo: His hand...? Trucy: You know what to look for now, but you have to be looking at the right place. Apollo: (She's right. I can only see his face like this... Time to try changing my viewpoint!) Focus on page corner of book Leads to: \"Perfect! Now you're really ready!\" Trucy: Perfect! Now you're really ready! Apollo: Ready... for what? Trucy: Ready to perceive the truth behind the twitch! Apollo: Perceive... ([Percieve] highlighted in the original release) Trucy: Try listening to the witness talk as you focus. Then watch for his habit. Apollo: Right... You mean when he fiddles with the page! Trucy: That's right! That's your signal to look closer, to perceive with [X / Y / R]! (Changed from [That's right! That's your signal to look closer, to perceive!] in the original release) Find his weak spot and I guarantee we'll be able to give him the Royal Flush! Apollo: Spoken like a true poker head's daughter. Trucy: I'm a magician, thank you very much. Apollo: (So I have to pay attention to his words... and his fingers!) Trucy: Don't worry if you miss it, you can always try again! Apollo: (Right! Look out nervous twitch, here comes Justice!) Perceive hand twitch on page corner on \"I used my cell phone\" Apollo: Leads to: \"............\" Perceive wrong area Apollo: Trucy: A-Apollo! That's not it! Apollo: Huh? Oh... I guess I'm kind of lost here. Trucy: Remember his habit: He fiddles with the pages of his book! The word he's saying right when you see his fingers twitch is the key! Apollo: (OK, so I have to watch for his fingers to move. Got it.) Trucy: And don't worry about getting it perfect your first time. You can always try again! Leads back to perceive section Apollo: ............ (I... I saw it! Just now... I could see it!) Judge: M-Mr. Justice? Do you have something to say? Stickler: A-all this b-banging of desks! I-It's quite bad for my circulation, you know. Apollo: Mr. Stickler... Allow me to ask you a simple question. Why did you fiddle with the page of your book just now? ...The very moment you mentioned your cell phone!? Stickler: Wh-Wh-What are you talking about!? Apollo: I'm curious now about this cell phone of yours... Mind if I ask a few questions? (Hmm... What to ask, What to ask...) Ask for his number Apollo: Mr. Stickler... Tell me your phone number! Stickler: Urk!? Wh-Why? Whatever for? Klavier: ...Why not? You have something against making friends? Judge: ...What does this witness's cell phone number have to do with the case? Stickler: Absolutely nothing! This is a... an invasion of my privacy! Judge: Hmm... Seeing you grimace like that makes me wonder about your cell phone, too. The witness will present his cell phone number to the court. Stickler: Waaaugh! Apollo: Trucy... Do you have your cell phone? Trucy: Sure do! Apollo: Try dialing the number that he gives us. Trucy: You want me to call Mr. Stickler's phone? Judge: This... is all highly irregular. Trucy: H-Hey! My pocket's ringing! Wait! This is the phone from yesterday! Apollo: Look... a cell phone. Trucy: Someone dropped it beneath this tire! If the car moved, it would be crushed for sure! Apollo: Hmm... I wonder if it belongs to the doctor here? Apollo: How strange, Mr. Stickler. Stickler: ...! Apollo: Can you explain why your cell phone is sitting here in my assistant's hand!? Leads to: \"Wait a minute! What is the meaning of this!?\" Ask to see his phone Apollo: Mr. Stickler, please show me your cell phone! Stickler: Urk!? Wh-Why? Whatever for? Apollo: Show me, and you'll find out. Stickler: W-Well I can't! I don't have it, you see. Judge: You don't have it...? Apollo: ...Mr. Stickler. Is this your cell phone? Stickler: Yeeeeow! Wh-Where did you get that!? Trucy: That's the phone from yesterday! Apollo: Look... a cell phone. Trucy: Someone dropped it beneath this tire! If the car moved, it would be crushed for sure! Apollo: Hmm... I wonder if it belongs to the doctor here? Apollo: How strange, Mr. Stickler. Stickler: ...! Apollo: Can you explain why your cell phone is sitting here in my hand at this very moment? Leads to: \"Wait a minute! What is the meaning of this!?\" Ask what model of phone Apollo: I was wondering... Can you tell me what model of cell phone you own? Stickler: Urk!? Wh-Why? Whatever for? Klavier: Why not tell him? It's not some matter of national security, I'm sure. Nor does it have anything to do with this case! Take it to the lobby, gentlemen. Judge: Mr. Justice, our current market is flooded with generic-brand cell phones. Please ask questions with a little regard for market trends, please. Trucy: ...Who would have guessed the judge was up on his cell phone industry trends? Apollo: Who would have guessed I'd get chewed out for asking a simple question...? Leads back to: \"Hmm... What to ask, What to ask...\" Judge: Wait a minute! What is the meaning of this!? Apollo: This cell phone was found yesterday... ...in the Meraktis Clinic garage! Judge: The Meraktis... Why, that's where the victim lived! Stickler: Yeeeeeerrgh! Th-That's impossible! Apollo: Mr. Stickler, you lied to the court, didn't you? If your cell phone is here, how could you have called the police!? Stickler: Weeeeeeeeeeeeeouk! Stickler: It... It's true. I didn't have my cell phone that night. That is why it can be said that I called the police from a public pay phone. Judge: A pay phone! So you didn't call on your cell phone after all... Apollo: Just where was this pay phone located, Mr. Stickler!? Stickler: Well, to indicate it with a startlingly high degree of accuracy... ...it was right around here. Judge: That's... quite a ways from the park. But... But why did you lie? Apollo: There can be only one reason. He didn't want the court to know he had lost his cell phone. Because it was found... ...in the victim's garage! Stickler: Wh-Wh-What are you saying!? Apollo: Mr. Stickler... You broke into the Meraktis Clinic garage on the night of the murder! This cell phone tells all! Stickler: B-But that's ridiculous! That makes it sound like... Like I snuck into this fellow's garage to commit some crime! As though I were trying to kill him! Judge: Well, Dr. Meraktis was killed that night. Stickler: W-Well y-yes, but no! This line of reasoning has to be against the rules! Yes, it's true! I lost my cell phone! But you can't prove that I lost it that night! Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Justice? If that cell phone was dropped the night of the murder... ...it does raise considerable suspicions as to a connection with the crime. Trucy: Now's your chance, Apollo! Connect Mr. Stickler to the crime! Apollo: Oh, he's already connected enough. I just have to prove it. (Well... Do I have a piece of evidence that can do the job? Can I prove the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder?) Show evidence Apollo: Of course I have evidence! Klavier: Ooh, I like your swagger, Herr Forehead. Hit it. Judge: The court will see this evidence. Mr. Justice, \"hit it\", as they say! Leads to: \"The evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:\" No evidence Apollo: (Evidence... If only I had some evidence, it'd make this whole thing a lot easier.) Judge: Care to explain the lack of confidence smeared across your face, Mr. Justice? Klavier: Oh, Herr Forehead... I think it should be clear by now. \"No evidence\" means \"no case\". Apollo: (Ack! I guess this is it, then. Time to go for broke!) Leads to: \"The evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:\" Apollo: The evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is: Present Mirror Apollo: Leads to: \"That's... a side-view mirror?\" Present anything else Apollo: Judge: Hmm... Well, Prosecutor Gavin? Klavier: No comment, Herr Judge. Judge: No dice, Mr. Justice. Penalty. Trucy: Apollo! Remember where we found that cell phone! If it had fallen on the ground before that night... Apollo: (That's right! The cell phone would have been crushed!) Your Honor! One more chance, please! Judge: Mr. Justice, keep this up and you'll run yourself out of a life's worth of chances! Leads back to: \"The evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:\" Judge: That's... a side-view mirror? Apollo: As it so happens... Dr. Meraktis's car was in an accident... ...that took place the night of the murder! Stickler: An accident!? Apollo: An accident. It happened a little after 9 PM, just outside People Park... our murder scene. Dr. Meraktis's car hit a pedestrian! Stickler: Wh-What are you trying to say? Apollo: From the absence of a mirror, it's clear that the car was parked after the accident. Which means it was parked there after 9 PM on the night of the murder. If your cell phone had been dropped before the car was parked in that garage... ...then it would have been crushed. After all, it was lying on the ground, right under the wheel! Stickler: Urk... Apollo: Ergo, Mr. Stickler! The only time you could have dropped this in that garage... ...was after 9 PM the night of the murder in the park! Stickler: Weeeeeeeeoooorrgh! Apollo: Mr. Stickler! You know what this means? You did break into the victim's garage that night. Judge: This is most unexpected! Mr. Justice... Are you naming the witness as a suspect in the murder of Pal Meraktis!? Stickler: N-No, stop! This is too much! This can't be happening! P-P-P-P-Prosecutor! Say something! Klavier: I suppose it is worth saying this: No connection has been found between Wesley Stickler and Pal Meraktis. That is, other than this. Judge: I believe our next testimony will be most... revelatory. Is the witness prepared? Stickler: Y-Y-Yes, Your Honor!!! Apollo: (I know that face... That's the face of guilt!) Trucy: ... Witness Testimony -- Stickler's \"Truth\" -- Stickler: That night... Yes! I went to the supermarket. I must have dropped my cell phone on my way back. And when I was walking through the park, I happened to witness the crime! ...I saw the killer, the victim, the stand... all as clear as day! It was him! I saw the defendant at the scene! Judge: Yes... but your cell phone was lying in a garage. Stickler: Ah, yes, well, as you can see my model of cell phone has a defect... It is given to rolling! It's quite a pain when I drop it alongside the road, you know. Judge: ...Looks like a normal cell phone to me. In any case, Mr. Justice, the cross-examination, please. Apollo: (That's funny... My bracelet didn't react at all during that testimony.) Trucy: His nervous habit must not be acting up... I didn't sense anything either, actually. Looks like you're on your own this time around! Apollo: (Right, no problem... I hope. Here comes Justice!) Cross Examination -- Stickler's \"Truth\" -- Stickler: That night... Yes! I went to the supermarket. Press Apollo: Apollo: So you went shopping. Which means... ...you were holding a grocery bag when you witnessed the murder taking place? Stickler: Eh!? W-Well, yes, of course... Klavier: Incidentally, the prosecution has received no report of this domestic detail. Judge: ...Mr. Stickler? Can you explain yourself? Stickler: No! I mean, yes! I did go shopping, really. I walked around the supermarket, trying out the free samples... It's... a deeply spiritual time for me. Judge: I'm sure the store clerks would disagree. Trucy: Do you think sampling free food counts as a religion? Stickler: In any case! That night... ...I sampled to my heart's content, and was on my way back home, yes. Stickler: I must have dropped my cell phone on my way back. Press Apollo: Apollo: That's when you passed in front of the Meraktis Clinic? Stickler: Why... yes. That's correct. Trucy: That was a pretty suspicious pause there. Apollo: Mr. Stickler, do you think you could be a bit more specific? Please show us the exact route you took on the night of the murder. Stickler: O-Of course. The supermarket is here, along the main road. My way home from there takes me past the Meraktis Clinic. This is probably when I dropped my cell phone. Yet, woe is I, I walked on, unaware of my loss! ...And walked right into that fateful park. Stickler: And when I was walking through the park, I happened to witness the crime! Press Apollo: Apollo: Which entrance did you enter the park from? Stickler: Well, to be exact... One might say that I went in from the entrance closest to the Meraktis Clinic. Klavier: The same entrance our victim used. Apollo: Did you notice anything when you entered? Wheel marks from a noodle stand, for instance? Stickler: ...I have no recollection of such a thing, no. Yet, though I might have missed the tracks, I could not miss what happened next! I can a keen observer... of the obvious, you might say. Stickler: ...I saw the killer, the victim, the stand... all as clear as day! Press Apollo: Apollo: (This part of the testimony is the key. I know it! Should I press him about the killer, the victim, or the noodle stand?) The killer Apollo: Are you sure you remember the killer clearly? Stickler: How many times must I repeat myself!? It was him, that unscrupulous, fox-like fellow in the defendant's chair! He was looking even more unscrupulous at the time, no less. Judge: Hmm... He does look a bit like one of those trickster foxes in legends of yore. Apollo: (I guess the victim's identity is already old territory... Time to ask something new.) Leads back to cross-examination The victim Apollo: You could see the victim quite clearly, too? Stickler: Oh, clear as clear can be, I assure you. Apollo: I see. So... Um... How'd he look? Stickler: How? How do you mean, \"how\"? Be specific. Apollo: Um, I mean, in general. Judge: The defense will refrain from straining to come up with questions. Find the question that lies in your heart and ask that! Apollo: Y-Yes, Your Honor. (Great, a judge who moonlights as a self-help guru...) Leads back to cross-examination The noodle stand Apollo: Do you happen to remember the noodle stand? Stickler: Quite well, yes! For a student of the sciences, keen observation and healthy curiosity are vital! I remember everything! I could even read the sign! I believe it said... Er... \"NOODLE\". ......... Yes, that was it. Judge: For remembering something \"quite well\" it sure took you a while to tell us. And thank you for telling us that a noodle stand sells noodles. Very enlightening. Well, Mr. Justice? Apollo: (Hmm... What about that sign? Could that be important?) Not at all Apollo: (How could the sign matter at all? We know it's a noodle stand!) Judge: Very well, please continue with the testimony! Leads back to cross-examination Very important Apollo: So the sign on the noodle stand said \"NOODLE\"...? It appears the defense has just obtained a vital piece of testimony! Judge: Is this noodle stand's broth really that delicious? I'll have to go sample the wares one of these days. I think that's worth adding to the testimony as well. Stickler: ...Hmph! Whatever sort of noodles that stand sells, it can't match up to Ivy U.'s cafeteria! Some apply to the school merely for a taste of our Smart Noodles! Apollo: (I wouldn't mind a taste of that myself...) Adds statement \"Why, I even remember the sign on the stand the victim was pulling! It said \"NOODLE\"!\" Press (after adding statement) Apollo: Apollo: Mr. Stickler, you've proven to be a most skilled witness. Stickler: Skilled? What do you mean? Apollo: I thank you for your powers of recollection. Your testimony just now was quite vital. Klavier: Something going on up in your noodle, Herr Forehead? Apollo: (If my gut feeling here is right... I've just stumbled across a major contradiction!) Stickler: Why, I even remember the sign on the stand the victim was pulling! It said \"NOODLE\"! Press Apollo: Apollo: So the sign said \"NOODLE\"? You're absolutely sure? Stickler: Let me be frank: Yes. In fact, the word \"unsure\" isn't even in my dictionary! Nor the word \"uncertain\" or... Apollo: (He was wasting time looking that stuff up!?) Judge: \"NOODLE\", eh? I like that. It tells you what you're getting, no nonsense. Apollo: (It tells me a lot more than that, actually!) Trucy: Why are you smiling like that, Apollo? Present Noodle Stand Apollo: Leads to: \"And you're absolutely sure the sign read \"NOODLE\"?\" Stickler: It was him! I saw the defendant at the scene! Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you absolutely sure it was the defendant? Stickler: Stop asking me the same questions over and over! This isn't some kind of make-up test! Trucy: What's a \"make-up test\", Apollo? Apollo: Nothing a good student like you has to worry about. (Time to find his weak spot and press it till he breaks!) Trucy: His habit isn't acting up... which means he isn't lying. Apollo: (Hmm... I was kind of relying on my bracelet to get me through this one...) Trucy: But he's pretty unsettled! The odds are really high that you can get something out of him! Apollo: That gleam in your eyes... You're a gambler's daughter through and through. Trucy: I'm a magician, thank you very much! Apollo: And you're absolutely sure the sign read \"NOODLE\"? Stickler: Why, just last week, my professor offered me this praise: \"At least you have good eyesight, Stickler. I'll give you that.\" ...It read, without a doubt, \"NOODLE\". Apollo: I see... Stickler: What? Why are you looking at me like that? Is that... pity I see in your eyes!? Apollo: Let's take a look at our map, shall we? So, you're claiming that when you saw the sign, you were standing... Here, was it? ...Although, it would've been a bit hard to read the sign from this spot. Stickler: Y-You think so? Apollo: Mr. Stickler. I'd like you to please take another look at the stand. ...and to carefully read what the sign says. See? That sign actually states the name of the stand's owner. ...\"ELDOON'S\". Stickler: E... El... Eld... Inconceivable! I'm certain it was definitely \"NOODLE\" for sure! Positive! Judge: I'm afraid your professor was wrong about that eyesight. Apollo: I wouldn't be so quick to jump to that conclusion. (The sign he saw changes everything!) The witness says the sign said \"NOODLE\"... but he saw it wrong. Apollo: The answer is quite simple. The witness saw the sign wrong. Judge: That would seem to be the case, yes... Trucy: Apollo! The only thing that changes is the witness's eyesight! Apollo: Eh...? Trucy: OK, so you've proven the witness has bad eyesight, and is overconfident. But that just proves he's a bad witness! It doesn't solve the case! Stickler: How rude! I've not made a single mistake, I assure you! I am a student of science! Errors are not tolerated in my field, I'll have you know! Apollo: (What if Mr. Stickler is right to be so confident...? And if he is right about the sign... what does that mean for the entire case!?) Leads to: \"What would you say if I told you...\" and he saw it right. Leads to: \"What would you say if I told you...\" Apollo: What would you say if I told you... ...that there is one spot from which the sign would be read the way Mr. Stickler claims? Stickler: What...? Judge: Mr. Justice! Show us this spot! Apollo: The witness actually viewed the stand from this location! Present north of noodle stand Apollo: Leads to: \"The witness was standing... Here! On the opposite side!\" Present river Apollo: Judge: ... That's a river. Apollo: ... Oh. Judge: Yes, \"Oh\". As in, I \"oh\" you a penalty! Apollo: Urk.. Sorry, Your Honor... Mind if I try again? Judge: Tell us, if you would, where was the witness standing? Leads back to: \"The witness actually viewed the stand from this location!\" Present noodle stand Apollo: Judge: ... Klavier: Though it pains me to point out the obvious... I see you leave me with no choice. It was the victim, Herr Doktor Meraktis who was pulling the stand, ja? Apollo: ... Ja. Judge: Mr. Justice, hopefully this penalty will inspire you to take this case more seriously. Apollo: Sorry, Your Honor... One more time, please... Judge: Tell us, if you would, where was the witness standing? Leads back to: \"The witness actually viewed the stand from this location!\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Judge: ... Any thoughts, Prosecutor Gavin? Klavier: What, it's my turn to chastise the upstart, is it? Herr Forehead... Recall what you just told the court! The sign on the stand reads \"ELDOON'S\", ja? How would the witness standing where you have indicated change anything!? Apollo: ...... Um... I picked the wrong place. Judge: Your honesty becomes you, Mr. Justice. However, your mistake does not. Apollo: Sorry, Your Honor... Do I get another chance? Judge: Tell us, once again, where was the witness standing? Leads back to: \"The witness actually viewed the stand from this location!\" Apollo: The witness was standing... Here! On the opposite side! Judge: H-How do you know that? Apollo: When viewed from the south... ...the sign on the stand reads \"ELDOON'S\", as we know. ...However! Observe the other side of the stand! Judge: Oh! This side says \"NOODLE\"! Apollo: Exactly! The name of the stand is split between the front and back signs! Mr. Stickler, you lied to the court! You witnessed the crime from the northern side of the park, not the south! Stickler: Yeeeow! Y-You got me! Klavier: Klavier: ...So what. Apollo: S-So what!? Klavier: What does it matter if he saw the killing from the north or the south side? It makes no difference at all! Stickler: H-He's right! Travel far enough to the south, and you will end up going north! Viewed on a global scale, directions are utterly without meaning! Apollo: (...Actually, maybe he's right. What does it change?) Trucy: It changes everything, Apollo! Apollo: Trucy? Trucy: Remember his testimony from before... Though to be honest, I'm a little scared of where this is leading... The killer and the victim are facing each other here. Then, at the moment the killer raises his weapon... ...Mr. Stickler shouts! At which point, the victim turns his head to look... ...and the killer fires his pistol. That's why the bullet hit him in the right temple. No contradictions, right? Apollo: Right... But if Mr. Stickler was standing on the north side of the park... ...that reverses the whole scenario! Trucy: Completely! If Mr. Stickler shouts from where he is now... ...and the victim looks in his direction... ...the bullet would have to hit his left temple! Judge: Ah... Aaaaah! Trucy: In other words, someone standing at point \"K\"... ...couldn't shoot the victim in his right temple. It's impossible! Judge: Th-That's right! Trucy: So, now that we know that Mr. Stickler was standing on the northern side... ...the wound location takes on an entirely different meaning! Klavier: Indeed... You are absolutely correct, Fr\u00e4ulein. Judge: Wh... What meaning!? Trucy: The entry wound was on the right side of the victim's head, correct? Well, the right side of the victim's head... is north. Judge: North... Ah!!! But that's where the witness, Wesley Stickler was standing! Trucy: Correct. So, if he was standing to the north... ...then the only person here who could have shot the victim in the right temple... ...was Mr. Stickler himself! Stickler: Yeeeeeeeeeeeeooooooowwwrgh! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Apollo: (Wow... The apple didn't fall far from the tree! She's flipped this whole case on its head while I was still figuring it out!) Klavier: Klavier: ...Clarify one point for me if you would, Herr Forehead. Apollo: What now? Klavier: Are you truly accusing this college student... ...of murder? Apollo: ...! (Well, I can't say he exactly looks innocent... But... something still doesn't feel right. I just can't picture him as the real killer!) Stickler: No, please! Looks aside, I'm really a nice guy! All my friends say so! Judge: Let's hear what the defense has to say. Apollo: (What are you going to do now, Justice!? Should I really accuse Mr. Stickler!?) Accuse of murder Apollo: I accuse Mr. Stickler of murder! Klavier: ...Are you quite sure, Herr Forehead? Apollo: Y-Yes. Yes! Klavier: \"Accuse of murder\"... Only three words, but a very, very long sentence. ...You have evidence worthy of such a bold accusation, I hope? Apollo: ... Um, maybe I'd better think this over some more. Klavier: ...A wise decision. Leads back to: \"Let's hear what the defense has to say.\" Accuse of another crime Leads to: \"...I don't think Wesley Stickler is a killer. But he's not innocent, either!\" No accusation Apollo: ...No accusations, Your Honor. Judge: ... Klavier: ...... Stickler: ......... Well. I'm glad that's sorted out. Trucy: Apollo! You sure you're doing the right thing!? They'll end up convicting Wocky if you let Mr. Stickler off the hook! Apollo: Ack! You think? Uh, w-wait, Your Honor! Let me rethink that... Judge: If you must... Leads back to: \"Let's hear what the defense has to say.\" Apollo: (...I don't think Wesley Stickler is a killer. But he's not innocent, either! His unusual silence tells me that much...) ...Mr. Stickler! You seem unusually quiet... Tell us why, now! Stickler: ... Th-The word \"confession\" isn't in my dictionary! Klavier: Tsk, tsk, tsk, Herr Forehead. I'm afraid it falls to you to elucidate Herr Stickler's silence. Judge: Mr. Justice, you did say you were accusing the witness just now... ...for a crime other than murder. Your reason? The court's all ears. Apollo: (Gah! I know he's guilty of something... but what crime other than murder is there? Do I have evidence that shows his involvement in some other crime...?) Judge: Your evidence? The court's all eyes, Mr. Justice. Show us evidence that points to the witness's involvement in a crime! Present Trucy's Panties Apollo: Leads to: \"The evidence... is this!\" Present anything else Apollo: Judge: ... Klavier: ... Apollo: (Something tells me this isn't one of those good silences.) Judge: ...Something else to say, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Um... One more chance? Please? Judge: ...By all means. But your effort wasn't wasted. Look, a brand-new penalty. Now, please reveal your thoughts to the court. Leads back to: \"Gah! I know he's guilty of something... but what crime other than murder is there?\" Apollo: The evidence... is this! Judge: What!? Is that... women's underwear!? Trucy: Hey! Those are mine! Stickler: D-Don't look at me like thaaaaaaat!!! Judge: Order! Order! Order!!! ...Mr. Stickler. While I can't say this comes as a shock... Stickler: I-It's not what it seems! By Pythagorilla's Theorem, I swear it! Apollo: On the night of the murder, just past 9 PM... A young girl catches a panty-snatcher red-handed! Bravely, she gives chase, but the snatcher flees... ...and hides himself in no other place than the Meraktis Clinic garage! Judge: Ah ha! Apollo: Incidentally... ...these panties were found in the exhaust pipe of the car there. Presumably, he was trying to hide the evidence of his crime. Ergo! While you may not be a murderer... ...you are guilty of panty-snatching in the first degree! Stickler: Please! Here me out! It's not what it looks like!!! Judge: Order! Order! Order!!! Mr. Stickler. You should be ashamed! Stickler: It's... not... what... it... seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeems... *gasp* Judge: So, are we to understand that you were silent not because you were guilty of murder... ...but because you lacked the courage to admit your theft of this girl's undergarments? Stickler: Ahem. Perhaps you are not aware that my school's name was originally written \"IV\"! \"I\" stands for \"Intelligent\", \"V\" stands for \"Valiant\"! See!? Judge: ...Your point? Stickler: I'm not done! Now, I'm a major in the Science Department... ...and what does science teach if not curiosity!? Yes, we of the Ivy U. Science Department are valiantly curious! No challenge is too daunting, and what greater challenge to science than a mystery!? Apollo: Apollo: C'mon! You're talking about a girl's panties here! Stickler: No! You do not understand! A mystery is the unknown, and the unknown is unacceptable! And, my friends, when it comes to mysteries, those panties are the promised land! From the moment I first laid eyes on them, I was compelled to investigate... for science! A full-sized car tire was only the first mystery those panties revealed! Apollo: A... tire? Stickler: Yes! I saw her do it! She pulled a tire out of those panties! But that's not all! First, there was the tire, then a stewpot, and a frozen chicken! One mystery after another! It was... It was magic! Trucy: Oh, I remember now! He's one of the regulars in the audience at the Wonder Bar! Apollo: Huh...? Trucy: He's talking about my Magic Panties trick! Stickler: I just don't understand... A broom... from a pair of panties? It mocks the very laws of physics... Apollo: A broom... and a frozen chicken, Trucy? What ever happened to doves and bunny rabbits? Judge: M-Mr. Stickler! You stole this girl's panties to understand a magic trick? Stickler: You say \"panties\" but they are so much more than that! For me, they are an object for serious study! Klavier: ...I wonder... There has been a recent rash of panty-snatchings in the area... ...Were they all you? Stickler: I... I am sorry. But I did it for science! Each time I spied a pair of panties flapping in the breeze, I thought maybe! Maybe this would be the pair that would elucidate the mystery... Even that night as she chased me through the streets, I wept tears of joy! Perhaps this is the night that I will seize the truth that lies within those panties! Yet woe was I! For once again the lacy heart-patterned truth slipped through my fingers a-- Judge: Still, that leaves one thing unexplained. Klavier: Ah, you refer to our witness's other lie, yes? The witness claimed he saw the crime from the south, but was in fact, in the north. Judge: Indeed. Would anyone care to explain why he lied about that? Stickler: ... Klavier: Be my guest, Herr Forehead. Apollo: ...Me!? Klavier: Did I not hear you correctly? Did you not say you \"do not accuse the witness of murder\"? Apollo: ...! Klavier: Why, then, did the witness lie about his location at the time of the shooting? ...Or have you no idea? Trucy: Apollo... There's something about the way the diagram is arranged right now... When you think about it, right near where Mr. Stickler was standing... Isn't there a...? Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? What say you? Do you have any evidence to show why the witness lied about his location? Present Bloomers Apollo: Leads to: \"The evidence that shows why he lied... is this.\" Present anything else Apollo: Judge: ... I fail to see how this evidence relates to our witness's fabrication... Apollo: As do I! But I'm sure it does! Somehow! Somewhere! Judge: ...It appears the fabrication was yours, Mr. Justice. Penalty! Apollo: (Somebody help...) Judge: You're welcome to show us another piece of evidence. Leads back to: \"Do you have any evidence to show why the witness lied about his location?\" Apollo: The evidence that shows why he lied... is this. Judge: What!? More panties!? Klavier: How many panties are you carrying in your pocket, Herr Forehead? Apollo: These are the last!! Honest!! These were found in a trash can at the park. Looking at the diagram... ...we can see that the trash can was right next to where the witness stood. Judge: Mr. Stickler... You didn't... Stickler: Alas! I'm a failure as a scientist! I can't unravel the mysteries of the universe! I can't even unravel a pair of panties! Judge: So... these panties are your handiwork as well...? Stickler: Th... That night, I had been chased, hounded into the Meraktis Clinic garage... Weeping in frustration, I was forced to abandon my prize! Don't you see how I felt!? Apollo: ...Believe me, I'd rather not. Stickler: I hid in the garage for a short while... Then, abandoning the panties, I made for home. To avoid the office where the girl works, I went towards the south entrance... ...when I saw them hanging there on a clothesline by a giant mansion... ...A giant pair of panties! Apollo: (Apparently he didn't know those bloomers belonged to the mob...) Stickler: I had them, safe in my pocket, ready to take home... ...when I stumbled upon a murder. Apollo: The murder of Dr. Meraktis. Stickler: I reported what I had seen, but as I waited for the police to arrive... I got scared. What if they searched me!? Apollo: That's when you disposed of the bloomers? Stickler: Yes... it was a severe blow to the progress of science, but one that had to be borne. (Changed from [Yes... it was a severe blow to the progress of science, but one that had to be born.] in the original release) Judge: A fascinating, if disturbing tale. Judge: I believe this brings today's proceedings to a close. And I'm more than pleased to dismiss this witness for the remainder of the trial. Klavier: One last thing, if I might. Judge: Yes, Prosecutor Gavin? Klavier: Regardless of where we ended today, some vital points were made. Namely, that the defendant, Wocky Kitaki, was at the scene of the crime. And... he was pointing a weapon at the victim. ...One more thing. Wocky Kitaki has a clear motive. Judge: Indeed, the defendant Wocky Kitaki is still the prime suspect in this case. The only suspect, in fact. Assuming there was no one else on the scene at the time. Yet, a mystery remains... The location of the wound in the victim's right temple has yet to be explained. The court requests further investigation from both the defense and prosecution. Klavier: ...Ja, baby. Apollo: ...No problem! Judge: Very well. This brings the trial for the day to a close. Court is adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow you. Apollo: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: ...You don't sound very sure, Mr. Justice. Objection overruled. Apollo: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: This evidence clearly reveals a contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related? Apollo: They aren't, are they...? Judge: Not at all. Mr. Justice, please think the facts over before making accusations. Apollo: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: Your Honor! That statement contradicts the evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Apollo: ...Um... You sure about that? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Justice! Apollo: (Ack! That didn't go so well.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Wocky Kitaki... Guilty Judge: The defendant will surrender himself to the court's care... ...to undergo a regular trial at the High Court within a month's time. Court is adjourned! Turnabout Corner Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 June 16, 2:23 PMWright Anything Agency Apollo: ...What a train wreck that was. I'm glad we made it out of that trial alive. Trucy: Really? I had fun! And Wocky made it through the day, too! Apollo: ...Everyone was too obsessed with panties to bother with the real case. Trucy: But it was good publicity! Imagine the crowd at my show tonight! You should come, Polly! Apollo: Yeah... Trucy: The Amazing Mr. Hat will be making an appearance! Mr. Hat: Hi, folks! I'll be here all week! Apollo: That's about enough of him. Alita: Hello...? Trucy: Ah! Ms. Tiala! Alita: Thank you for today. The trial... went well. Apollo: Oh, right! No problem! Alita: Do you think Wocky will be OK? Apollo: (Well, he's not guilty... yet.) Alita: Please, you have to help him! We're supposed to get married next month... Apollo: Oh, congratulations! (Gah, way to put the pressure on a guy...) Alita: Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help! Examine Bookshelf Apollo: Some magic books are mixed in with the law books here. The magic books all look well-used, but the law books are just gathering dust. ...I feel kinda sorry for them. Maybe I'll read some next time I'm around. Charley the plant Apollo: It's Charley, the houseplant. They've had it for years, apparently. Trucy: That's \"Mr. Charley\" to you! He's been here longer, after all. Apollo: ...Right, sorry. Trucy: I'm sorry, Mr. Charley. He was raised by a tribe of heathens. Apollo: (She's saying something to the plant as she waters it...) Trucy: Mr. Charley forgives you. This time. Apollo: ...Is there anything else I might do to please His High Leafiness? Hula hoop Apollo: A giant hoop used to levitate people. So, tell me, how does it work? Trucy: Apollo... Don't you know you should never ask a magician to explain a trick? I mean, you're hardly better than Mr. Stickler! Apollo: Hey, I object to being placed in the same category as that panty-snatcher. Trucy: Enjoy the mystery! That's the way to appreciate magic. Magic split box Apollo: Those boxes frighten me. Trucy: I bet I'm the first magician to figure out these make great shelves! Apollo: (She does seem to be putting them to good use...) But, if you ever want to put it back together, you have to take everything off. Trucy: ... Don't worry, I'll clean it up soon... and then we'll try cutting you up! Apollo: Th-Thanks, but I'll pass. Photograph Apollo: An old, sepia-tone photograph of a man in a silk hat. His outfit looks a lot like Trucy's, come to think of it. Trucy: Aren't those clothes the best? I had mine made to match! If you're going to be a magician, you gotta look the part! Apollo: (Trucy is big on appearances, I've found...) Piano Apollo: There are all sorts of strange paraphernalia sitting on top of the piano. It seems a shame to have all these props and not do a trick or two. Trucy: You asked for it! Mr. Hat: Heeeey, Mr. Righteous, was it? Wakka wakka! Trucy: \"Justice\", Mr. Hat! \"Apollo Justice\". Mr. Hat: Just is? Apollo just is what? That's what I want to know! Trucy: Oh, you're hopeless! Apollo: ...Please, make it stop. Trucy: Just let me know if you ever want a visit from Mr. Hat! Apollo: Any other trick but that one, please... Silk hat Apollo: A blue silk top hat, just like the one Trucy's wearing. Trucy: It's my trademark color! \"Trucy Blue\"! Apollo: I don't think you can trademark the color blue. Trucy: Standing out is everything when you're up on stage! Bet you didn't know you've got your own color, too, Apollo! \"Crimson Justice\"! Apollo: You make me sound like some second-rate superhero. Trucy: At least it's better than being a first-rate super zero! Spaghetti Apollo: A dish of plastic spaghetti like some restaurants put on display. Where did you get this, anyway? Trucy: It was a birthday present from Daddy! I was so happy... You don't know how long I wanted one of these! I fell asleep with it, cradled in my arms, and the spaghetti bent! Apollo: (Mental note: What she really wants for her next birthday: A bowl of plastic food...) Table Apollo: A hot water pot sits on a magic table. Why is the stand for this table so flimsy looking? Trucy: ...Hmm. Maybe it looks better that way? Apollo: ...I was hoping for a more professional explanation. Trucy: Well... Maybe to show that there's no tricks involved? Apollo: ... Not bad. Trucy: I still think it's just that it looks better that way. Talk Marriage Apollo: Are you sure about marrying into the Kitaki Family...? Alita: I'm fine with it. And I love Wocky with all my heart. Trucy: Aw, that's so sweet! Apollo: So it doesn't bother you that you'll be, erm... ...Married to the mob? Alita: I don't think so... My parents are against it, of course. Trucy: Say! Where did you and Wocky first meet, anyway? Apollo: (Good question... Ms. Tiala doesn't look like the type to have gangster connections...) Alita: Oh... We met at my old job, actually. Trucy: Ah, office romance! Alita: ... Apollo: (She's not very forthcoming with information about herself, is she?) The Kitakis Alita: Did you know that the boss is trying to get out of the \"business\"? Apollo: R-Really? (Mr. Kitaki wants to quit being a gangster!?) Alita: He's trying to transfer his assets into a normal company. He only announced it recently, out of the blue... I hear there's quite a lot of confusion in the ranks. Apollo: (Hmm. I wonder if this explains that apron?) ...I can't imagine Wocky going along with that. Alita: Hee hee. He's highly motivated, isn't he? Apollo: Um, that's not the word I would have used. Alita: He said, \"I'll be the next Big Boss, and keep the Family alive.\" I think he's at that age when boys want to make a mark on the world. Apollo: (That's not the way I would have put it...) Alita: His father moves in a lot of circles... He's really focused on profits. The Kitaki Family's been making a killing recently! Apollo: (Again, not the way I would have put it...) Alita: But Wocky says it's not about the money. They have the gangster tradition to uphold. Trucy: Ooh, a generation gap! They've even got the ever classic \"what about the family business\" thing going... Apollo: Usually, it's the father worried about tradition... Wocky's operation Apollo: Can I ask you a question about Wocky? I understand he was operated on by the victim, Dr. Meraktis. Alita: Apparently, yes. Wocky: I was in his clinic 'bout half a year ago. He messed up my op something bad. And then he just lets me go, without a word. See ya later, bye! So I gotta go in, get another doc to patch me up again! Alita: ...Yes, it sounded horrible. Wocky has always been fond of fighting, I'm afraid... Apollo: I'm not sure it qualifies as \"fighting\" when pistols are involved. Trucy: Mr. Gavin was saying his life might be in danger, wasn't he? Alita: N-No, that can't be right! I'm sure he was just trying to scare us. Trucy: It's scary to think that a surgeon might make a mistake... ...but it's even scarier when he tries to hide it! Apollo: (I'd like to know a little more about this \"operation\". Maybe it's time to pay the Meraktis Clinic a visit.) Present Anything Alita: I'm sorry, I don't know much about the case. I... I feel so helpless. You're my only hope. Please, help my Wocky-Pocky... After clearing all Talk options: Alita: I should be getting home now. Wocky's in your hands, Mr. Justice. Apollo: R-R-Right! L-L-L-Leave it to me! Trucy: Apollo, I think you're only making her more nervous... Apollo: Sorry! I'm new at this, OK? Alita: Tee hee. It's alright. I believe in you. Hickfield Clinic Examine Bottle Apollo: A bottle of Mr. Wright's favorite brand of grape juice. Me? I haven't been able to touch the stuff since that first case. ...Not a problem for Mr. Wright, apparently. DVD stack Apollo: A swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. Better stay away or it'll become a crashing cascading cavalcade of DVD cases. Hospital bed Apollo: Mr. Wright's bed. My, it's messy. Trucy must clean up after him at home. Piano Apollo: A toy piano, one that might be played by a child. Correction: A pink toy piano. I guess the man likes pink. Nothing wrong with that. Television Apollo: The TV's been left on. Hmm... Looks like the Steel Samurai's in a spot of trouble. I'm sure he'll come back to win in the end. Mr. Wright likes those kind of stories. Kitaki Mansion Examine Spilled paint Apollo: Several colors of paint have been splashed across the gate. Most of it's pretty much dry, too. This is going to be one heck of a cleanup job. Old lady Apollo: Looks like the old lady's at it again... Officer: Look, I told you yesterday the park's off limits! Old Lady: And I told you yesterday this is how I go home! OK. You want me to go around? How about giving me five bucks... like yesterday. Apollo: (...The con artist strikes again...) Police officer below People Park sign Apollo: The park crime scene is off limits to the public. The police officer on guard by the gate is yawning. Ah, he noticed me staring and snapped his mouth shut. Too late, Mr. Officer! I saw you! Trash can Trucy: This trash can... This is where we found the mirror! Apollo: Come to think of it, wasn't there something else in here? Something near the bottom... ...Look at the paint on these. That means... ...these must have ended up in here after Mr. Wright's accident. Maybe they're connected? Let's pick them up. Slippers added to the Court Record. Trash can (subsequent times) Apollo: A large trash can sits by the entrance to the park. Trucy: What, you aren't going to dig through it? Apollo: No. What? I'm serious! I have no intention of looking through this trash can! Trucy: Oh, please, don't hold back on my account. Apollo: I think that whatever you think about me and trash cans, you're wrong. Examine evidence Slippers Toeprint Apollo: I wonder... Could this be a print? Trucy: Why would there be a finger... Oh, you mean a toe print! Good call, Apollo! Apollo: I bet we can analyze it just like a regular print. Trucy: This could be a vital piece of evidence! Obtain toeprint Leads to: \"Hey! It worked! That looks like... a big toe, maybe?\" Apollo: Hey! It worked! That looks like... a big toe, maybe? Trucy: Wow, I feel like the case is solved already! Apollo: What was next? We have to match the print, right? Trucy: Right! Let's match it! ...... Wait. The detective didn't give us a list of toe prints, Apollo. Apollo: Oh, good point. Trucy: Maybe we should ask her? Get some \"expert\" advice? Apollo: I guess so... (I'm not sure she really qualifies as an expert...) Toeprint (subsequent times) Apollo: So, we have a toe print now. Trucy: I'm not sure what good it's going to do us without a list of toe prints to check it on. Apollo: (Maybe our detective friend can help us...) People Park Examine Blue tarps Apollo: Blue plastic tarps cover the ground around the stand. They were apparently put here to preserve the crime scene. Knife Apollo: A knife is sticking straight into the ground. Remember what Wesley Stickler said in the trial today... Wocky was very likely pointing this at the victim. Trucy: ...Like he wanted to kill him. Apollo: (Yeah, that's the problem.) Mannequin Apollo: A mannequin put in place of the body. I think I've seen him by the police station. The way he's forced to look at the ground now, day in and day out... It's kind of sad. Noodle stand Apollo: Poor Mr. Eldoon. His stand's been standing here since this whole thing started. Trucy: It almost looks at home here in the park now. I think it should be made into a playhouse for children! Apollo: I think its owner would disagree. Trash can Apollo: A trash can sits next to the path here. Trucy: And I guess now we know it was Mr. Stickler who hid Little Plum's bloomers here, huh? Apollo: That's right, Trucy. And what a web of lies grew from that one little act. Trucy: I can still remember that moment... You brandished those bloomers on high, and shouted... \"Objection!\" Apollo: ...Here's what I want you to do, Trucy. Take that memory, gently lock it away deep in your heart, and never speak of it. Eldoon's House Examine Clinic front door Apollo: The front entrance to the Meraktis Clinic. The walls and posts are so highly polished I can see my face in them. ...Wait. My hairdo's a little flat. ...There. Perfect. Bowl Apollo: A lone Eldoon's Noodles bowl lies on the ground. The lone bowl, tipped on its side... It's kind of surreal. You'd think he would have picked it up by now. Oil drum Apollo: An oil drum for catching rainwater. ...Ack! A flock of crows just flew over and... That's gross! Their aim was uncanny... almost as if they'd been practicing here a long time. Meraktis Clinic - Garage Examine Tailpipe Apollo: This is where we found your panties, isn't it, Trucy? Trucy: And I can't thank you enough, Apollo! Apollo: Well, thank you for saying thank you! Trucy: Oh, I'm always polite! It's part of being a performer. You know what Daddy says: \"It doesn't cost anything to be polite, and it could bring you more business.\" Apollo: ...Typical. Trucy: Just kidding! I really am grateful! June 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room Trucy: Hmm... Looks like Wocky's out for questioning. Apollo: I really need to talk to him. I guess we'll come back later. Guard: Excuse me. Apollo: Yes? Guard: The other suspect is all through with questioning, sir. Trucy: The other... Ah! You mean the panty-snatcher!? Apollo: ...Wesley Stickler. (So they arrested him, too?) Alright. Let's have a little chat with Mr. Stickler. (I hope I don't regret this.) Trucy: He is a valuable witness! Apollo: (He is a bit \"precious\", I'll give him that.) Stickler: Please, keep this brief, if you would. I'm quite busy. I need to finish this paper... Nyurk! I-It's you!!! Apollo: ...Mr. Stickler. We'd like to have a few words with you. Stickler: ...... ...Very well. As long as they're few. Apollo: (Nothing would make me happier, believe me.) Talk Panty-snatcher Apollo: Mr. Stickler. On the night of the murder, you stole... Stickler: Wait! I can't help but feel that I'm being misunderstood. Apollo: ...How, exactly? Stickler: Yes, that night, I obtained a pair of panties, it's true. However! It was my burning curiosity that drove me to do it! Nothing more! Trucy: You wanted to know the trick to my panties, right? Stickler: Y-You're here, too!? Trucy: ...? Stickler: Oh, Great Trucy! Teach me! Trucy: Eh!? Stickler: I must know the secret of your panties! My very existence hangs in the balance! Please, make me your apprentice! Trucy: Apollo! Help! Apollo: I dunno, I think he'd make a great \"lovely assistant\". Trucy: Don't say that, Apollo... What you witnessed Apollo: Could you relate what you saw the night of the murder to us one more time? Stickler: ...Why not. Though it hardly differs from the testimony I gave in court. The defendant was there in the park that night, of this I'm quite certain. He was pointing a pistol... or something like that at the victim! That's when I shouted \"Stop, you two! Let's resolve this like gentlemen!\" ...And the next moment, a shot was fired. Apollo: And this is all true? Really? Stickler: My panties are gone. My innermost heart revealed. What further reason could I possibly have to lie? Apollo: (I can't think of anything he'd want to hide more than panty-snatching, true.) Trucy: It sounds like Wocky was at the scene of the crime, after all. Apollo: How I wish it weren't so. Present Trucy's Panties Stickler: Th-That's it! The mystery! The unanswerable riddle! Trucy: Actually, they're just a normal pair of panties. Stickler: Wh-What!? How is that possible? Trucy: It just takes practice, that's all. Stickler: Then you must teach me! You must! To think, if I could produce a pencil, an eraser, a text book, and a lunch... ...all from a pair of panties! My life would be complete! Apollo: (He's serious, isn't he.) Anything else Apollo: ... (...Fine, ignore my evidence. See if I care. I wonder what he's thinki... On second thought, let's not go there.) Wright Anything Agency (after clearing all Talk options with Alita Tiala in Wright Anything Agency and clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Talk The case Trucy: If everything that panty-snatcher said was true... ...it doesn't put Wocky in a very good position, does it? Apollo: He was at the scene of the crime, that's pretty clear. (There's got to be a different angle on this...) Trucy: Well, let's get investigating! No time like the present! Any leads? Apollo: So? Any leads? Trucy: Hmm... One moment... ... Shazam! Allakhazam! Apollo: (Whoa! Evidence keeps flying out of nowhere!) Trucy: Ta da! That's all! Neat, huh? Apollo: ...Yeah, real neat. (*sigh*) Present Trucy's Panties Trucy: Aren't my panties amazing? They were a big hit in court. Apollo: (They were the star player of the day, that's true.) Trucy: What should I show them in court tomorrow? Apollo: (If only I could count on panties to save the day every day...) After clearing all Talk options with Alita Tiala in Wright Anything Agency and clearing all Talk options with Wesley Stickler in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: June 16Kitaki Mansion Apollo: (Yipes! She's back!) Plum: Hey. You two. Over here! Apollo: U-Uh, us? Trucy: Yo, Little Plum! Wassup!? Apollo: (I think all this gangsterese is a negative influence on Trucy...) Plum: I heard you retrieved my bloomers! Apollo: W-Well, I was j-just doing... Plum: Bah! A man speaks clearly, and takes credit where it's due! You caught the thief, didn't you? Apollo: Uh, y-yes! Sorry! I caught him! Trucy: You're cute when you're nervous, Polly! Apollo: ...I'll deal with you later. Plum: But enough about bloomers! What about my son, Wocky!? Apollo: W-Wocky? Er, well, he's, um... Plum: Clearly! Apollo: Y-Yes, ma'am! (This is why I was kind of hoping we could avoid coming back here.) Talk Wocky Trucy: He's really everything you'd expect in a Boss's son! \"I'm going to be a gangster, dude!\" Plum: The life does have an appeal for that age... Particularly for boys. Trucy: ... Apollo: What? Don't look at me like that! Plum: He was shot in a turf war about half a year ago. Apollo: Yes... We heard the story from Wocky. Plum: ...But he didn't tell you the whole story. You know, even if he had a pistol then, he couldn't have shot anyone. Trucy: What...? Plum: He acts like he's \"hard\", but he couldn't shoot someone to save his life. I should know... I'm his mom. Apollo: (Her words do have a certain weight to them...) Plum: Hopefully, when this is all taken care of... ...he and the Boss can sort out their differences. Trucy: The Boss... You mean Wocky's father? Apollo: They didn't seem to be on the best terms, did they? The case Plum: It's true... One of our pistols is missing. Trucy: So the murder weapon was from this mansion... Apollo: We kind of figured, given the difficulty of obtaining a gun these days. Plum: None of the rank and file have access. Only the Boss, myself, and ...Wocky could have taken it. Apollo: I see... Plum: I'm sure the cops will continue tromping all over the mansion because of this case. Maybe this is a sign that it's time for a change! Wa ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (She doesn't seem too concerned, at least.) Alita Tiala Plum: ...Yeah. Wocky's fianc\u00e9e. Apollo: They're getting married next month, correct? Plum: I suppose. She's been staying over lately. Trucy: ...You don't look too happy about that, Little Plum. Plum: ...! How'd you guess? Apollo: (Even I could tell that!) Could you tell us more about her? Plum: ...Wocky brought her home one day. Says he wants to tie the knot. Trucy: I can see why! She's so pretty! Plum: Oh, she's pretty enough. But, you know... Trucy: ...? Plum: Nah, it's probably just me being suspicious. Stay in this business too long... ...and you start to only see darkness in people. You get a nose for it. A nose for people... A nose for trouble. Apollo: (Hmm. I wonder what the problem is?) Trucy: It's like a gangsters-only version of \"female intuition\"! Father and son (appears after \"Wocky\") Plum: The Boss may act tough, but that boy means the world to him. Apollo: But Wocky seems, well... It seems like he's against his father's position. Plum: Ah. It's to be expected. We're in a bit of a transition now. Trying to cut our ties to the shadier side of the street and do more on the up-and-up. Wocky isn't too enthusiastic about the change, it's true. Trucy: But why the change? Is the gangster thing just not paying the bills? Plum: Wa ha ha ha ha ha! It pays... but we need a lot of money right now. Clean money, that is. Apollo: I see... (Hmm, something must be up.) Plum: He'll see things the way the Boss sees 'em... some day. Present Mirror Apollo: This is the mirror we found... Plum: ...From the hit 'n' run, huh? It's funny how it all ties together like this. You chase after a hit 'n' run and end up Wocky's attorney. Of course, you'll find the real killer soon. Won't you. Little Plum's Bloomers Apollo: Um, about these... Plum: Hey, my bloomers! Thanks for that. I owe you one. Apollo: Um, I thought you might like them back, so... Plum: Eh? Oh no, no. Why don't you keep 'em as a souvenir? Apollo: Oh no, I couldn't, really! Thanks for the offer bu-- Trucy: I could use those in my Magic Panties act! I'll pull shivs and pieces and godfathers out of them! Apollo: Great, now your props are going from bland to dangerous. Knife Apollo: Can you tell me if this knife belongs to Wocky? Plum: Oh, that's his knife alright. Bought it for him for his birthday. Apollo: (Wow, that's a pretty hardcore present.) Plum: I remember him falling asleep with it clutched in his arms. Trucy: Ooh! I know the feeling! I'll bet he was just as happy as I was with my plastic spaghetti! Pistol Apollo: So this pistol belongs to the Kitaki Family... Is that correct? Plum: It's one of the pieces we keep around. That is, we used to keep around. They're all gone now. Apollo: Oh? Plum: Police came yesterday and took everything. ...Everything but my \"broom\". Trucy: Don't you think you should have given them that, too? Plum: You kidding? Can't clean up very well without a broom! After clearing all Talk options with Alita Tiala in Wright Anything Agency and clearing all Talk options with Wesley Stickler in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: June 16Eldoon's House Trucy: Hey, it's Mr. Eldoon! Oh Mr. Eldooooon! Guy: ...Hrmph. Trucy: What's wrong? Guy: ...So, you found my stand. That's why I'm here. To thank you. Trucy: Ah. Guy: But now it's a crime scene and they won't let me have it back!!! That's also why I'm here. I got no other place to go. Apollo: Ah... I see. Guy: How can a noodle stand be a crime scene, that's what I don't get, Trucy-doll! Even in death he's after my neck, I tell ya! Bah! Can't even cook an honest noodle... Apollo: \"He\"...? Trucy: \"Even in death\"... You mean the victim, Dr. Meraktis? Guy: I tell ya. It's enough to drive a man to make his soup even saltier. Apollo: (Remind me never to eat his noodles when he's in a bad mood...) Talk The noodle stand Guy: That stand... For generations, it's served up the very best noodles us Eldoons could make. A tradition of noodles and salty broth. It's more than a stand, it's history, I tell you. Apollo: (Watch what you say or it might become true...) Trucy: That's a great story, Mr. Eldoon! A single stand, passed down from generation to generation! Guy: 'Course, to be honest... I didn't plan on doing it. Trucy: That's right. You said something about that. About you \"rebelling\" against your pops, was it? Guy: Good memory, Trucy-doll. Aye, I was a go-getter back in my day... Until my friend next door butted in. In the end, I was left with nothing but this dusty old stand to earn my fortune. Apollo: Mr. Eldoon, I don't mean to pry... ...but what exactly did you do before you became a chef? Guy: Bah! Let old noodles lie, that's what I say. Apollo: (I'm starting to get an idea of what he did, anyway.) Guy: He stole my dreams and left me with nothin' but noodles. And now I don't even have that! Meraktis Clinic Apollo: Mr. Eldoon, if I might ask... What exactly happened between you and the Meraktis Clinic? Guy: Eh? Eh!? Apollo: I couldn't help but sense enmity there... Guy: Enmity? I hate 'im! Er. Hated. Him actin' like he smells like roses when he's rollin' in mud! Apollo: Excuse me? Guy: He's the only doctor at that clinic, you know. Pretty impressive, eh? I'll tell you the secret to his success... The mob! Apollo: You mean... the Kitaki Family? Guy: They're always having one of them \"turf wars\" or whatnot. Always an injury or two that needs fixing. Meraktis saw a chance for some business. So he started giving the Kitaki Family a good deal... Apollo: A deal...? Guy: Every fifth operation for free! He stole the idea from my pops! One free bowl of noodles a week, he used to say. Trucy: Can a doctor just decide to do that? What about the insurance companies...? Guy: Oh, no doubt it's illegal. But, it got him in good with the Family. Pretty soon he was getting all the business in town. Leavin' me here, in the dark! Up t'my neck in soupy noodles! Apollo: (I think I've figured out Mr. Eldoon's former occupation...) Trucy: Can't hurt to ask, Apollo! Eldoon's past (appears after \"The noodle stand\" and \"Meraktis Clinic\") Apollo: Mr. Eldoon... or should I say \"Dr. Eldoon\"... Guy: Figured it out, did ya? That's right, I was a doctor. A surgeon... until the year before last. Trucy: So Mr. Meraktis was your rival? Guy: ...You like those onions they put in the soup broth? Apollo: Um, yeah, kind of. Guy: You take a spoon, you drink some broth... Those onions will find their way in there. For people who like 'em, why that's just fine. For people who hate 'em... ...I hate onions. Hate 'em! Always sneaking in from the side, gettin' in the way of a good tastin' spoonful. Well, that's what he was. An onion! Onion-boy, that's what I called 'im. Apollo: So... you weren't exactly friends. Guy: Hah! Me 'n Pal Meraktis... Ever since pre-school we were getting in each other's face. No matter what I did, sure enough, he'd come followin' along. Then he'd do it better than me. Just blow right past without so much as a \"howdy\". Apollo: ...I see. Guy: That's right! I was a surgeon long before he was, you know. Then that no-good onion-boy comes along... Apollo: Well, Trucy, looks like we found ourselves a new suspect. Trucy: Don't say that! Guy: Thanks to him, I was forced to trade in my scalpel for a ladle! ...Sorry, pal. Didn't mean to weigh you down with an old man's ramblings. Apollo: No, it's fine. Guy: By way of apology... You ever get yourself in a spot of trouble, you drop by. Apollo: Huh? Guy: You're investigating Meraktis, aren't ya? Apollo: Yes...? Guy: Well, you want to know about a doctor, you ask a doctor. That's all I'm sayin'. You just think of me if you need something, Trucy-doll. Trucy: Right! Thanks, Mr. Eldoon! Apollo: (Hmm. I guess the time spent listening to him complain wasn't entirely wasted.) Present Noodle Stand Guy: That's right, sonny! When're you bringing my stand home!? I'm ready. Can't you see I'm ready!? Apollo: (I guess...) Guy: Until that stand is back home, the case is not closed! You hear me!? Apollo: (I think I'll avoid talking about his stand in the future.) After switching to left side view: Trucy: Well, we've got to check out this clinic, that's for sure. Apollo: Yeah, but what about the guard? Trucy: No harm in asking! Um, excuse me! Officer: Hey, it's you two from yesterday! Apollo: (That's the same officer that was standing out by the park yesterday!) Officer: Your business is over in the park, isn't it? The clinic's off-limits. It's not involved. Trucy: B-But...! Officer: What part of \"off-limits\" do you not understand? Show me proof that the clinic is connected to the incident in the park, or beat it. Apollo: (No harm in asking... No gain either. No point in sticking around here, I guess.) After clearing all Talk options with Alita Tiala in Wright Anything Agency and clearing all Talk options with Wesley Stickler in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: June 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room Apollo: Um... I was hoping to meet with my client? Guard: Wocky Kitaki's just finished questioning. I'll bring him out. Trucy: Great! Finally! Wocky: Yo, 'sup, my little imposter! Trucy: Eeek! Wh-What did you call me? Wocky: Dizzam! It's you!? Sorry, G, thought you were Alita. Trucy: \"My little imposter\" sure is a strange nickname. Wocky: It's a clink thang. You wouldn't understand. D-Did I say \"imposter\"? I meant \"poster\"... like \"poster girl\", a'ight? Trucy: If you're going to drop part of that, why not drop \"poster\" and just call her \"girl\"? Wocky: Cause she's so much more than that, G. She's like... She's like an angel. A fallen angel. ...So. What can I do you for? Trucy: ...You don't look so chipper today, Wocky. Apollo: Worried about your, um, heart condition, maybe? Wocky: That was the wackest thing of all! All us G's lining up, taking eye exams 'n' all that. (Changed from [That was the wackest thing of all! All us G's lining up, taking eye exams...] in the original release) Better to die young than fade away, bizzzoy! Klavier: ...A relief to hear. Wocky: Eh? Wh-What's a relief!? Klavier: Oh? Did your father not tell you? That bullet you carry so close to your heart... if not attended to immediately... ...It could kill you. Wocky: M-Man... I ain't trying to hear that! A man fights to protect what's valuable to him, you know what I'm saying? ...I miss my fallen angel! Hey, you go get Alita for me. You're my lawyer, aren't you? Apollo: (Lawyer, not gopher...) Talk Your fianc\u00e9e Apollo: So, I hear you're to be married next month? Wocky: Straight up! We poured the nuptial 40 out on the stoop! Alita! Oh, snapplecakes! She soooo foine! Apollo: (I think he's smitten with her in his own weird way.) Trucy: I was wondering, how did you two meet? I asked Tiala, but she  was... very vague. Wocky: Huh? Well, man, if she wouldn't tell you... I'd best hold my tongue, you feel me? Trucy: Wha--!? Wocky: Man, what's past is past. She knows that. When I'm with Alita... I feel like there's things worth protecting out there. You feel me? And my Alita, she's down with that all the way. Apollo: (Hmm, so both of them are mum about their past...) Meraktis Clinic Trucy: Do you think you could tell us what happened with you and Pal Meraktis...? Wocky: ...There's something you should know. We Kitakis are having what you might call a feud with the Rivales Family. So, 'bout six months back... I go into Rivales turf, packing a knife, right? Trucy: And... You were shot? Wocky: Coldest thing I ever seen. One shot, to the heart, but my homies weren't too late. It's a miracle that I lived. It's already considered one of the seven wonders of the Kitaki Family, you know that? Apollo: So, you were taken to the Meraktis Clinic then? Wocky: You shoulda seen their faces when they wheeled me in. You can't just let the Boss's son die, you know? Apollo: (I'd hate to have been in that doctor's shoes... Mr. Kitaki's scary enough when he's not angry...) Trucy: But the bullet that hit you... ...it was never removed? Apollo: (And it's still threatening his life!) Wocky: That doctor... He did it on purpose! The Rivales paid him off, I'm sure of it! Apollo: (I need to hear more about the night of the murder, that much is clear.) Wocky's future (appears after \"Your fianc\u00e9e\") Wocky: Life in the Family is a G thang. It's about being a man. ...You know what I'm saying? Trucy: Sorry, I'm not up on my G things. I'm not even sure what a G thing is... Wocky: But my old man, he's gone soft. He says the old rival gang days are over. He just wants to make money! Trucy: Isn't that a good thing? Wocky: Man, there ain't no soul in making money! Better to live fast and die young. Fo'shizzle! Apollo: (*sigh*...) Wocky: Wait till I run the yard. Then everyone'll know what time it is. That's right! O.G. time all the time. Represent! Trucy: Apollo, why does he keep talking about \"Old Guys\"? Apollo: I don't think that's what \"O.G.\" means, Trucy. The night of the crime (appears after \"Meraktis Clinic\", then presenting Knife or Pistol) Apollo: Um... Actually, there's a question I've been wanting to ask you for a while now. That is, uh... Did you do it? Did you shoot him? Wocky: ... I dunno. Apollo: Eh? Wocky: The day of that check-up, when I found out about the bullet by my heart... ...I... borrowed a gun from the Family's stash. Figured I'd give that doctor a taste of his own bad medicine. Apollo: (Uh oh... I don't like where this is going...) Trucy: But... you were carrying a knife, weren't you? Wocky: Oh that? Yeah, well, never can be too careful, I say. So I'm on my way to the clinic, right? When I run into him in the park... and he's dragging this noodle stand behind him! Trucy: Wait, you didn't put him up to that? Like, you know, in the movies? \"If you value your life, you'll bring the stand...\" Wocky: ...Shorty, you're more wacked than I am. And that's saying something. Trucy: ...But I was serious! Wocky: The thing is, I don't remember what happened next all too well. Apollo: You don't remember...? Wocky: But, the way I see it, if there wasn't anyone else there that night... ...then I guess it probably was me who did him in, you know what I'm saying? Present Knife or Pistol (after clearing \"Meraktis Clinic\" Talk option) Apollo: About these weapons... the pistol and the knife. Wocky: They belong to the Family. I snuck 'em out that night. Apollo: So, the \"killer\" Mr. Stickler says he saw that night was... Wocky: I guess it was me. I was there, after all. Apollo: Gak...! (We're finished...) Trucy: Um... Yo, Wocky! Do you think you could tell us exactly what happened that night? Wocky: Heh... You don't beat around the bush, do you? I like your style, shorty. Anything else Wocky: ... Yeah, whatever. Apollo: (He seems preoccupied... I'm not sure he even looked at my evidence...) Wocky: Alita, man. Alita. After clearing all Talk options in Kitaki Mansion, clearing all Talk options and switching to left side view in Eldoon's House, and clearing all Talk options with Wocky Kitaki in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: June 16Kitaki Mansion Trucy: ...Look at that crowd over by the park! Apollo: Probably people trying to get a glimpse of the crime scene. Trucy: But... why are those girls screaming? I think I just heard one say \"Omigod, it's him!\" Apollo: (Wait, that motorcycle...) Klavier: Ah! If it isn't Herr Forehead. Apollo: ...Prosecutor Gavin. Klavier: Some fans found me on my way out... Just my luck. ???: Omigod! Omigod! He's so cool! Apollo: Thus the screams... Klavier: New album just came out, you know. Try waving to them. They love it. ???: Oooh! Oooh! He's so cute! Klavier: Ah ha ha. They're so excited, it doesn't matter who waves to them, see? Apollo: (This is surreal...) Trucy: Um, so you were here investigating? Klavier: And I was on my way home... when my hog gave up the ghost. Apollo: Your hog...? Klavier: My motorcycle won't start. A clogged exhaust pipe... Trucy: Too bad! It looks like such a nice bike, too. Hard to believe that it could break just from that! Klavier: Ach, it's my fault. I think I was using the wrong oil. Cars, motorbikes, they're all the same. Clog the exhaust, and they won't run. Ah, machines. Tell me you share my angst, Herr Forehead! Apollo: ...I ride a bicycle, actually. Klavier: Ah. Heh. In any event, I'm off to the shop to get her fixed. The detective in charge of the scene isn't fond of me, in any case. Apollo: The detective... You mean, the one in the lab coat? Klavier: Ja. She's in a foul mood, too. Be gentle. ...Auf Wiedersehen, baby! ???: Omigod! Omigod! There he goes! Apollo: And the forecast for the park today... Gloomy Skyes. Trucy: Well, nothing to do but head on in. Let's hit the park, Apollo! June 16People Park Apollo: Huh? Does something about this scene look different to you? Trucy: The blue tarps are gone! Maybe that's it? Apollo: Yeah, I think you're right. Look over there. Trucy: The white-frocked detective from yesterday. She seems to be apologizing reverently... to the trash can. Apollo: She's... under a lot of stress. The investigation's probably not going so well. Ema: Hey, you there! If you're going to talk about someone behind their back, do it more quietly, please! Apollo: Oh, Detective Skye. Hello. Trucy: You seem as gloomy as ever. Ema: This is miserable! Miserable! I just got a new kit, and I can't get the stuff to work. And everyone's all smiles for that glimmerous fop. Trucy: Glimmerous...? Does she mean Prosecutor Gavin? Apollo: More to the point, doesn't she mean \"glamorous\"? Ema: When he walks his shiny chains catch the sun and glimmer in my eyes! It's distracting. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH Apollo: (Speaking of distracting...) Ema: *sigh* I guess I just have to accept the fact that I lack talent. Apollo: (Sounds like she's trying out some sort of new forensics technique...) Examine Ground Apollo: The tarps that were here yesterday are gone. Trucy: I wonder why Detective Skye put them out? Apollo: Yeah... The only thing they were covering is the ground. Trucy: Oh! You know, I think I see something there... a print! Apollo: A... \"print\"? Talk Detective Skye Apollo: Detective Skye, you know Mr. Wright, correct? Trucy: How do you know my daddy!? I want details! Ema: Ah? Ah... Well... ...He helped me out a long time ago. You might say he \"saved\" me. Apollo: (Wasn't she saying something about \"getting involved in an incident\"?) Ema: I can't stand it when things are vague... especially in a case. I went to study to become a forensic scientist... in Europe. Apollo: But... you're a detective now? Ema: Well... I failed the test. But, you know, rank and title don't matter! What matters is what's inside your heart! Trucy: I've always thought that, too! Ema: And my heart is full of science! That's why I bought this kit through mail order. And I'm going to test it here before the forensics team arrives! Apollo: (Are you sure that's OK...?) Prosecutor Gavin Ema: I won't lie, I'm not fond of the man. Those glimmerous types always rub me the wrong way. Apollo: \"Glamorous\"... right. Ema: A prosecutor should be cool of wit and furrowed of brow. Less \"glimmerous\" and more \"simmerous\"... you know? Apollo: ...No, actually, I don't. Ema: Well, that, and what happened seven years ago! Prosecutor Gavin was the one who stripped Mr. Wright of his attorney's badge! Apollo: Whaaaaaa--!? Really!? (He was the one!?) Ema: ...You mean you didn't know? I thought you were one of his boys! Apollo: (I'm neither a \"boy\" nor one of his... but let's see what she has to say.) Um... What exactly happened seven years ago? I never actually heard the details. Ema: ...Then investigate. It's better you learned it for yourself, anyway. Trucy: ... The new kit? Apollo: ...Do you mind me asking exactly what it is you've been doing... ...squatting down on the ground like that? Ema: Ooh! You want to know? Do you? Well, I splurged on a new toy! Apollo: (You splurged... You mean, it wasn't police issue?) Trucy: What is it? I see a roller... and glue? Ema: This is a footprint analysis kit! Apollo: Footprint...? Ema: It was raining on the night of the murder, which means that footprints were left! Trucy: Oh, does that have anything to do with those blue tarps? Ema: Right. The ground was muddy, so I had to protect it as it was that night. Ever wanted to know exactly where someone was standing? Like your panty-snatching student witness, for instance? Trucy: Ah ha! So with that kit...! Ema: Right! Apollo: ...What? Ema: Want to try this stuff out? Apollo: Huh? Are you sure? I mean, we're sort of on opposing teams and all... Ema: Oh, pshaw! You're friends! And... to tell the truth, I'm not so good at doing this. Guess I'm a little clumsy. I could use your help. Trucy: Ooh! I'm good at stuff like this! I used to make magic bunnies out of paper mache! Apollo: (Footprint analysis, huh? Well, should I give it a go?) Try it Apollo: OK... I'll give it a go! Ema: That's the spirit! Right, allow me to explain! Ahem, one moment... Trucy: She's reading the instructions for her kit... Apollo: (Why does this not fill me with confidence?) Ema: First, we have to pick the footprint, or in this case, shoe print we want to analyze! I've taken the liberty of marking all the shoe prints in the park. Well, which shoe print should we start with...? If we're going to verify the defendant's account, here's the place to start! Shoe prints, prepare to be examined! Trucy: Ooh! This is so exciting! Ema: Right, here goes! First... \"Pour the plaster into the print until it's full.\" ...You try it. Apollo: How am I supposed to do that!? Ema: Just press [A / Space] where you want to pour the plaster. (Changed from [Just touch the screen where you want to pour the plaster.] in the original release) Like this! Apollo: (Hmm, that doesn't look too hard...) Ema: If you run out of plaster in your beaker before you're done, you have to start over! Fill shoeprint with plaster Leads to: \"Not bad. You're handier with that than you look.\" Ema: Not bad. You're handier with that than you look. Apollo: (What's that supposed to mean?) Ema: On to the next step! Um... \"Dry the plaster until it turns white.\" Right! Just press [A / Space] to direct the dryer! (Changed from [Just touch to direct the dryer!] in the original release) ...There, give it a shot! Dry Leads to: \"Looks like it's hardened nicely. Let's take a look!\" Ema: Looks like it's hardened nicely. Let's take a look! Hmm... Yes, that's a good one. Next, the ink! Ready for the next step? Use the roller to ink just the shoe print part. Hold on to that roller tight now, and roll it up and down. Keep going till you get enough ink on there for a good print! Roll up and down Leads to: \"Right, now the moment you've all been waiting for!\" Ema: Right, now the moment you've all been waiting for! Let's take our print! Ready? Here goes! Let's see if we get a match. Compare Wocky Kitaki profile Comparing...Comparison complete. Match found Leads to: \"So the shoe prints belong to Wocky Kitaki after all...\" Compare anyone else Comparing...Comparison complete. No Match found Ema: Hmm, no good. Must have messed up somewhere. Shall we try on another print? Leads back to profile selection Apollo: So the shoe prints belong to Wocky Kitaki after all... Ema: He was in the park on the night of the crime! Trucy: Wow! I can almost see the science at work! Ema: Don't you love it!? Ahhh! Nothing feels better. Apollo: (She's definitely waaaay more into this than I am...) Ema: Just let me know if you want to do some more. I'll be here, solving the case... with science! Apollo: (Well, that certainly brightened her mood.) Changes \"The new kit?\" Talk option to \"Footprint analysis\" No need Apollo: I think I'll pass. Wouldn't want to waste a kit if I messed up. Ema: Really? That's too bad... I really could use the help. Trucy: Aww, I want to try! It'll be just like making pancakes in the dirt! Apollo: (I guess I can always talk to her again if I change my mind...) Leads back to Talk options The new kit? (subsequent times) Ema: Hmm? Still interested in the bleeding edge of forensic science? Why didn't you say so in the first place!? Apollo: (Footprint analysis, huh? Well, should I give it a go?) Try it Apollo: OK... I'll give it a go! Ema: That's the spirit! Right, allow me to explain! Ahem, one moment...

(Changed from [Just touch the screen where you want to pour the plaster.] in the original release) Like this! Apollo: (Hmm, that doesn't look too hard...) Ema: If you run out of plaster in your beaker before you're done, you have to start over! Fill shoeprint with plaster Leads to: \"Not bad. You're handier with that than you look.\" Ema: Not bad. You're handier with that than you look. Apollo: (What's that supposed to mean?) Ema: On to the next step! Um... \"Dry the plaster until it turns white.\" Right! Just touch to direct the dryer! ...There, give it a shot! Dry Leads to: \"Looks like it's hardened nicely. Let's take a look!\" Ema: Looks like it's hardened nicely. Let's take a look! Hmm... Yes, that's a good one. Next, the ink! Ready for the next step? Use the roller to ink just the shoe print part. Hold on to that roller tight now with [A / Space], and roll it up and down. (Changed from [Hold on to that roller tight now, and roll it up and down.] in the original release) Keep going till you get enough ink on there for a good print! Roll up and down Leads to: \"Right, now the moment you've all been waiting for!\" Ema: Right, now the moment you've all been waiting for! Let's take our print! Ready? Here goes! Let's see if we get a match. Compare Wocky Kitaki profile Comparing...Comparison complete. Match found Leads to: \"So the shoe prints belong to Wocky Kitaki after all...\" Compare anyone else Comparing...Comparison complete. No Match found Ema: Hmm, no good. Must have messed up somewhere. Shall we try on another print? Leads back to profile selection Apollo: So the shoe prints belong to Wocky Kitaki after all... Ema: He was in the park on the night of the crime! Trucy: Wow! I can almost see the science at work! Ema: Don't you love it!? Ahhh! Nothing feels better. Apollo: (She's definitely waaaay more into this than I am...) Ema: Just let me know if you want to do some more. I'll be here, solving the case... with science! Apollo: (Well, that certainly brightened her mood.) Changes \"The new kit?\" Talk option to \"Footprint analysis\" No need Apollo: I think I'll pass. Wouldn't want to waste a kit if I messed up. Ema: Really? That's too bad... I really could use the help. Trucy: Aww, I want to try! It'll be just like making pancakes in the dirt! Apollo: (I guess I can always talk to her again if I change my mind...) Leads back to Talk options Footprint analysis (appears after \"The new kit?\") Apollo: Detective Skye? Mind if we give it another go? Ema: Right on! Leave no print un-analyzed, I say! ...Now to pick which print you want to analyze! Analyze green shoeprints Fill shoeprint with plaster Leads to: \"...OK! Looking good.\" Ema: ...OK! Looking good. Next, to dry the plaster! Dry Leads to: \"OK, let's take out the mold!\" Ema: OK, let's take out the mold! Hmm... Yes, that's a good one. Next, the ink! Roll up and down Leads to: \"Right, now the moment you've all been waiting for! Let's take our print!\" Ema: Right, now the moment you've all been waiting for! Let's take our print! Ready? Here goes! Let's see if we get a match. Compare Wesley Stickler profile Comparing...Comparison complete. Match found Leads to: \"So these shoe prints belong to Wesley Stickler.\" Compare anyone else Comparing...Comparison complete. No Match found Ema: Hmm, no good. Must have messed up somewhere. Shall we try on another print? Leads back to profile selection Apollo: So these shoe prints belong to Wesley Stickler. This confirms his testimony. The final version of it, at least. Ema: Now we know where the panty-snatcher was standing! Analyze one of the shoeprints Fill shoe print with plaster Leads to: \"...OK! Looking good.\" Ema: ...OK! Looking good. Next, to dry the plaster! Dry Leads to: \"OK, let's take out the mold!\" Ema: OK, let's take out the mold! Hmm... Yes, that's a good one. Next, the ink! Roll up and down Leads to: \"Right, now the moment you've all been waiting for! Let's take our print!\" Ema: Right, now the moment you've all been waiting for! Let's take our print! Ready? Here goes! Trucy: ...Huh. That's a funny shoe print. Is that even a shoe? Ema: It is strange. So smooth... Apollo: Except for the part with the leaf. Ema: I can say without even looking that this print doesn't match any print on our list. Apollo: (Hmm... A mystery print.) Changes \"Footprint analysis\" Talk option to \"Another shoe print\" and adds \"Mystery print\" Talk option Another shoe print (appears after examining red print) Apollo: Detective Skye? Mind if we give it another shot? Ema: I believe you're beginning to appreciate the wonder that is forensic science! Leads to footprint selection Another shoe print (subsequent times) Apollo: Detective Skye? Mind if we give it another shot? Ema: I wish there were more prints to analyze... *sniffle* I know! Quick! Step in that mud over there! Apollo: Uh, I don't think analyzing my footprint is going to do us much good. Ema: *sigh* I would have had fun. Leads to footprint selection Mystery print (appears after \"Another shoe print\") Ema: This print is far too smooth to be from a regular shoe. Trucy: It is a shoe print of some kind though, that's certain. Ema: Still, you have to wonder what it's doing here. Trucy: It's right next to the Eldoon's Noodles stand! Ema: It does make one wonder... ...Hey, you. Apollo: ...Yes? Ema: Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? ...You wouldn't happen to have something in mind? Something that might have left this mystery shoe print? Apollo: (This mystery shoe print does remind me of something...) Show evidence Apollo: (I'm pretty sure I've seen something that would leave a print like that.) You know, I think I have our culprit right here... Present Slippers (after examining leaf indentation on paint on left sole) Apollo: Apollo: Well, I think it's these slippers, actually. Ema: Slippers... What would slippers be doing out here? Apollo: But look at the bottom! See? Ema: It's covered with paint! Except for... Apollo: See, right here? Ema: Hey, that spot is shaped like a leaf! Apollo: What if a leaf was stuck on the bottom, and came off when the slipper stepped in paint? ...Makes sense, doesn't it? Ema: Wait, something's written on them... ...\"The Meraktis Clinic\"! Apollo: Exactly! The victim's clinic! Trucy: Wait, that means... ...that someone from the clinic was involved? Ema: ... Apollo: (Why is she just standing there eating?) Trucy: Um, Detective Skye? I have a favor to ask! Ema: Wh-What? Apollo: Can you get us access into the Meraktis Clinic? Trucy: The police won't let us in! They say the murder and the clinic are not connected. And it's off-limits until we prove they are! Ema: ... I should be able to do something for you, yes. Apollo: Eh? Really? Ema: Well, you did my work for me here with the shoe prints. Seems like I should return the favor. Trucy: Thank you, Detective Skye! Ema: Here, show this to the police officer on duty. Detective Skye's Orders added to the Court Record. Apollo: (Right! Meraktis Clinic, here comes Justice!) Leads back to Talk options Present anything else Apollo: Ema: ... Know what I'm eating? Apollo: Um... Snacks? Ema: Snacks. More precisely, whenever I'm in a bad mood, I eat chocolate Snackoos. Apollo: ...I had no idea. Trucy: I think she means you picked the wrong evidence, Apollo. Apollo: (...I had no idea.) Leads back to Talk options No need Apollo: Hmm... No, sorry. No idea. Ema: Too bad. I wonder what it is. Trucy: Something's familiar about that smooth surface... so smooth it's almost slippery. Ema: ...Well, if you think of something, I'm all ears. Leads back to Talk options Present Fingerprint Powder Ema: Fingerprint analysis is the very basis of modern forensic science! Apollo: ...I guess you could put it that way. Ema: And you two know how to dust for prints on your own now! Make sure to examine anything you find that might have prints on it! Slippers Ema: They say \"The Meraktis Clinic\"... Hey! Apollo: Wh-What? Ema: This slipper... Look right here! I think I see a toe mark! Apollo: A toe mark... You think we can get a print off that!? Ema: Sure! Toes have prints just like fingers do, you know. Apollo: (This little clue might be a gold mine!) Ema: Oh... There's one problem. The police station doesn't keep a record of toe prints. So we won't know whose it is. Apollo: (...I guess that would be too much to hope for.) Trucy: Still, it might be useful somehow! Let's analyze it! Examine evidence Detective Skye's Orders Signature on back Trucy: She put a little heart by her name! How cute! Apollo: Isn't she a little old for cute? Trucy: Apollo! Shame on you! Cute is eternal! Cute is timeless! No matter how old a woman gets she always carries a little innocent maiden inside her! Apollo: ...R-Really now. I suppose. I've never heard it put quite that way before. Trucy: When I sign my name, I always put in a little diamond! \"Trucy \u25c7 Wright\"... See? Cute, don'tcha think? Apollo: It's a little confusing. Won't people think your middle name is diamond? Trucy: Hey! You could write your name like \"Apollo = Justice\"! Apollo: I do like justice, but that's taking it a bit far. After clearing \"Prosecutor Gavin\" Talk option in People Park: June 16Hickfield Clinic Phoenix: Ah, the prodigal attorney returns! Welcome, Apollo. I heard you did well in the trial today. Here to discuss something? I could use a little diversion... Apollo: (What did Detective Skye say? If you want to know something, you have to investigate it yourself...) Mr. Wright! Tell me what happened seven years ago... please. I want to know. I need to know! Phoenix: You certainly didn't waste any time getting to the point. Talk 7 years ago Phoenix: Seven years ago, I was standing in a courtroom... on behalf of a client. The case involved the death of a certain \"magnificent\" genius... I'd be surprised if you hadn't heard about it. Apollo: ...It was all over the news, I remember that. You were up against Prosecutor Gavin, weren't you? Phoenix: ...Yes, he was only 17 years old at the time. Apollo: (17 years old...? That's still high school!) Phoenix: He took the bar exam abroad... in Europe. They're progressive over there, you know. I was defeated by a 17-year-old newcomer. In my shame, I left the practice forever. That's all. Apollo: That's all...? How could that be all!? Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Apollo: What about what they were saying on the news about forged evidence!? Phoenix: ... Apollo: They said you forged evidence and had your attorney's badge stripped from you! Phoenix: ... Forged evidence (appears after \"7 years ago\") Phoenix: Tell me... how does it feel? How does it feel to stand here before Phoenix Wright, the Forgin' Attorney himself? Apollo: H-How does it feel...? (I... I don't want to believe it's true! But what about what happened in my first trial...) Phoenix: Didn't you notice in today's trial? There was a single piece of forged evidence. I'm talking about evidence that shouldn't have existed. A naughty magician's trick... Phoenix: Ah ha ha ha ha! I don't see you jumping to my defense on this one... Maybe I did forge evidence, maybe I didn't. ...It doesn't really matter now, does it? Apollo: B-But...! Phoenix: I'm not an attorney anymore. ...That's the only truth you need to know. Apollo: (Mr. Wright... Looks like he doesn't want to talk about the accusations of forgery... for now.) Present Mirror Phoenix: Ah, so that was what led you to the guilty party. Apollo: Yes! Thanks to you ripping the mirror off the car, I was able to deduce the... Phoenix: You make a good point, Apollo. In fact... It could be said that I'm to thank for finding the criminal. Apollo: (...Think what you want, Mr. Wright. Knock yourself out.) Trucy's Panties Apollo: And we found these, too! They're Trucy's. Phoenix: Thanks, Apollo. Though, I have to admit, as a father, I wonder... ...why are you still carrying my daughter's panties around in your pocket? Apollo: (Ack! That'll teach me to show off my evidence to Mr. Wright...) After Detective Skye's Orders is added to the Court Record: June 16Eldoon's House Officer: Ah, you two again. When, oh when will you learn. Look at me however you want, you're not getting in today. Trucy: I wouldn't be so sure if I were you! Look what we have! Officer: What's this? ...Detective Skye! ... Yesterday, it was Prosecutor Gavin, today it's Detective Skye. Who are you two? Really. Apollo: (Now he's suspicious again...) Officer: ...Well, you got the orders, I gotta let you in. Have fun. Trucy: Thanks, Mr. Officer! Let's hit it, Apollo! June 15Detention CenterVisitor's Room Trucy: Well, the time of the decision is upon us! Which one of our two jailbirds do we want to talk to? Guard: Excuse me! Both detainees are currently in questioning to corroborate their accounts. Apollo: Mr. Stickler and Wocky? Both of them? (I pity the questioner...) Trucy: I guess we'll be back then! June 16Meraktis ClinicReception Trucy: Huh, kind of an at-home sort of place, isn't it? Apollo: This place has a connection to the murder in the park... I'm sure of it! Trucy: The police guy out front wasn't so sure. Apollo: Beyond it being where the victim lived. (Looks like the police team's gone home for the day.) Trucy: There might be some clues lying around! Let's get cracking, Apollo! Examine Bowls Trucy: Look at all these bowls... Apollo: They're from Eldoon's Noodles! There's Mr. Salty! Trucy: Then, I think we've figured something out. Apollo: I think we have. Trucy: Mr. Eldoon must do take-out! Apollo: ... (Not exactly what I was thinking.) Trucy: All the bowls have been washed clean...! Apollo: I think we've found our first clue, Trucy. Office door Leads to: \"Look! This door says \"Doctor's Office\"!\" Reception desk Apollo: The clinic's reception desk. No one's here, of course. There's a small sign on the counter... \"Please pay your bill: Remember, we're the ones holding the scalpel.\" Brutal... but effective. Sandals Trucy: There's a single pair of sandals here. Apollo: Wait, but why would there be sandals here? Unless they belong to one of the patients. Trucy: Or maybe it's a visitor that's come to see Dr. Meraktis. Apollo: You'd think they'd use his house entrance instead of the clinic entrance, in that case. And, if this patient or visitor isn't still here... Trucy: Why'd they leave without their shoes? Apollo: (Better take a closer look at these, just in case.) Sandals added to the Court Record. Sandals (subsequent times) Apollo: A pair of sandals in a deserted clinic... Trucy: It's a little scary... when you stop to think about it. And how did the lady go home without her sandals? Apollo: Hmm... Maybe her operation here was to add wings, and she flew home? Trucy: Oh, I've heard of those! Surgical enhancements, right? Apollo: (Surgical enhancements are for a different part of the body, and, I was kidding...) Slipper rack Trucy: These must be the slippers for patients at the clinic. Apollo: The same as the pair we found, of course. Trucy: Look, a single pair is missing from the rack here, too. And ours have paint on the bottoms... Which means they were taken out of here on the night of the murder. Apollo: Right... The paint's from the hit and run, after all. (But what were a pair of clinic slippers doing in that trash can? And what were they doing at the scene of the hit and run?) Examine evidence Sandals Toeprint Trucy: Hey, Apollo! You think this is...? Apollo: Huh... This could be a toe print. Trucy: Maybe we can get a print off of this! Let's try it out! Obtain toeprint Leads to: \"Hey! It worked! That looks like... a big toe, maybe?\" Apollo: Hey! It worked! That looks like... a big toe, maybe? Trucy: But wait! I mean, it's great that we got the print... But is there such a thing as a list of toe prints? Apollo: Oh, good point. If there is, Detective Skye didn't give it to us. Which means... we can't match this print. Trucy: This seems like a good time to ask a detective's advice. Apollo: Yeah, good idea. Leads back to examination Toeprint (subsequent times) Apollo: So, we have a toe print now. Trucy: I'm not sure what good it's going to do us without a list of toe prints to check it on. Apollo: (Maybe our detective friend can help us...) Trucy: Look! This door says \"Doctor's Office\"! Apollo: Think this is the victim's private office? Trucy: It's not locked... Too bad. Apollo: Why \"too bad\"? Trucy: I like opening locks! It's kind of a hobby of mine. Like those little bike locks? Don't even bother putting them on when I'm around! Apollo: ...That's probably not a hobby you want to tell too many people about. *thump* Trucy: ......! Ah... Apollo! That sound... It came from behind this door! Apollo: (...Someone's in there!) L-Let's check it out, Trucy! Meraktis Clinic - Office Apollo: A break-in! They left through that window! Trucy: Wait, Apollo! You're too late to catch them now! Apollo: (That must be her experience as a panty-snatcher chaser talking.) Well, we should tell the police! Trucy: Let's check the room out, first, Apollo! If we call the police now, we'll lose our chance! Apollo: Y-You're right. (She's better at this than I am!) Trucy: Well, one thing's for certain. This clinic and our murder case are looking pretty related now! Examine Blue jars Apollo: Whoa! What are those? The wall is covered with beakers... Trucy: Eeeeek! Something's moving inside that one! ...You look, Apollo! Apollo: H-Hey, look yourself! You can't... Oh. ...It's a goldfish. Trucy: Wow, they're all fish! So many kinds! Apollo: (Whoever designed this had a sick sense of humor...) Lamp Trucy: Kind of an expensive-looking lamp, isn't it? Hey... The bulb's broken. Apollo: Broken? Don't you mean burned-out? Trucy: No. Our cat burglar must have dropped it. Apollo: But why is it standing up on the floor like that then? Trucy: Hey, look at the cord... Apollo: (Huh? There's a red splotch on a part of the cord...) You think that's... blood? Trucy: It's a little bright for blood. Almost pinkish. Apollo: Something's definitely odd about this lamp, that's for sure. Lamp added to the Court Record. Lamp (subsequent times) Apollo: Kind of an expensive-looking lamp. The bulb's broken. (And here I thought light bulbs were usually pretty resilient little buggers.) Trucy: Maybe the burglar dropped it. Apollo: Funny that it's standing upright on the floor then. Trucy: It's a bit peculiar, isn't it...? (Changed from [It's bit peculiar [sic], isn't it...?] in the original release) Open window Apollo: The window is ajar. Trucy: That must be how our burglar escaped! Apollo: I wonder who it was? Trucy: Maybe it was just a burglar who happened to pick here? Apollo: Yeah, but there's a patrol car sitting out front. If I were a burglar, I'd come back the next day at least. Trucy: I'd give it a month, myself. Apollo: (Whoever broke in obviously needed to break in today.) Papers or spilled cup Apollo: Books and papers are scattered around the room. Trucy: Wow, what a mess. This is worse than Daddy's room! The burglar must have left in a hurry. Apollo: Even the cup on the desk here is lying on its side. Huh? The juice that spilled out of that cup... It's dry. Trucy: So, the messy one wasn't our burglar just now! Apollo: Someone knocked this cup over a while ago and left it. Potted plant Apollo: This potted plant has seen better days. Hmm... That doesn't make sense either. Trucy: What doesn't? Apollo: Normally, burglars are looking for valuables, right? Trucy: That's true! That's what I would do! If I were a burglar. Apollo: So why look under a potted plant? Trucy: Maybe they were looking for the key to the safe? Apollo: I've heard of people putting their house keys under plants, but the key to a safe...? Trucy: Then maybe the burglar was looking for the house keys! Apollo: (This is getting nowhere fast...) Safe Trucy: What a cute little safe! Apollo: Hmm, looks like a four-digit lock. Trucy: ...! Someone's already entered in two numbers, Apollo! 7... 9... Wait, do you think... Apollo: ...That burglar just now was trying to open it!? (I wonder what's inside this safe...?) Trucy: Hmm, is there any way we can figure out the last two numbers? Apollo: Well, we know the first two are 7 and 9... Trucy: Maybe there's something in the Court Record? Something that can help us figure out the last two numbers! Apollo: (Hmm, I wonder...) I've got just the thing! Apollo: Well, I have an idea... Trucy: I knew it, Apollo! What is it? Apollo: (Well... All we have to know is what buttons have been pressed!) We can use this to find out what the next two numbers are! Present Fingerprint Powder Apollo: Apollo: ...When you press the buttons, you'd have to touch them... ...with your finger, right? Trucy: It would leave a print! Apollo: When you open a safe, you don't press any other buttons but the right ones, right? So, if we can find the buttons with fingerprints... Trucy: We'll have the safe code! Not bad, Apollo! Obtain fingerprints Leads to: \"Look! You can see the oily finger residues clearly.\" Apollo: Look! You can see the oily finger residues clearly. Look at 7 and 9... Trucy: These are glove marks. The burglar must have been wearing gloves. Apollo: Well, we might not be able to identify the burglar, but we can open this safe! Let's give it a shot! Input 7952 Code Confirmed Leads to: \"...It opened!\" Input any other code Code Incorrect Leads back to code input Apollo: ...It opened! Bullet hole Apollo: This looks like a bullet hole! Trucy: Hmm, you can still see the bullet sticking out of it. Apollo: Why is it in the middle of a safe? Trucy: Hey, the bullet came out! The tip is all squished. Apollo: Not surprising given that it was fired into a metal safe. (This bullet's got a story behind it, that's for sure.) Bullet added to the Court Record. Bullet hole (subsequent times) Apollo: (A bullet hole remains in the back wall of the safe. Now why would someone shoot a bullet into a safe?) Medical chart Trucy: This looks like... a medical chart. There's an X-ray in here with it. Apollo: An X-ray...? Hmm, can't make heads or tails of it. And I can't read the chart either, it's all in medical-speak. Trucy: But, the names are easy enough to read. Look, by \"Patient\" it says... \"Wocky Kitaki\"! So this is Wocky... our client's chart, huh. Apollo: Why would this one chart be here in this safe...? Let's see, the physician's signature says \"Pal Meraktis\". Eh... Trucy: What is it, Apollo? Apollo: Look here where it says who filed the chart... Trucy: Let's see... \"Nurse Alita Tiala\"...! Apollo: Alita Tialita is Wocky's fianc\u00e9e! Trucy: That's one \"ita\" too many, Apololo! Apollo: Never mind that, what's her name doing here!? Trucy: How should I know? Though... I guess it means she's on staff at this clinic? Apollo: Odd that she neglected to mention this before now... Trucy: I'm sure she had her reasons. Apollo: (So Alita Tiala worked at the Meraktis Clinic... And she had access to Wocki Kitaky's medical chart!) Trucy: You got the \"I\" and \"Y\" wrong, Appolo! Apollo: I'd be very interested to find out what this chart says. (Who could help us decipher this...?) Wocky's Chart added to the Court Record. Medical chart (subsequent times) Apollo: (Wocky's medical chart was hidden inside a safe... And Alita Tiala was the one who filed it.) We have to figure out what this chart says. (I wonder if there's anyone who can help us decipher it?) Present anything else Apollo: Trucy: ... I'm not sure how that's going to help us. Apollo: (Neither am I, come to think of it...) Trucy: If only there was something that could finger which buttons had been pressed! Apollo: (Something that could \"finger\" which buttons were pressed\", huh?) Leads back to examination No such luck Apollo: That would be a bit too lucky, don't you think? Trucy: Well, I suppose... If only there was something that could finger which buttons had been pressed! Apollo: (Something that could \"finger which buttons were pressed\", huh? Maybe there is a way after all...) Leads back to examination Safe (subsequent times, before inputting \"7952\") Trucy: Let's enter the code, Apollo! We know the first two numbers are 7 and 9! Enter Key Code Leads to code input Examine evidence Lamp Broken bulb Apollo: The bulb is broken. It won't turn on. Trucy: Oh? How is it broken...? Apollo: Don't touch that. You'll cut yourself. Trucy: Eeeek! Apollo: Yeah, yeah, fool me once, shame on me, fool my twice... Trucy: M-My finger! Apollo: Ack! Y-You're bleeding! Let me see that... ......Wait. Trucy: ...Magic blood! Tee hee! Gotcha! Apollo: ...Please don't do that again. I have enough to worry about without my co-workers injuring themselves on the evidence. Red stain on cord Apollo: This cord runs to the lamp. It has a red stain on it. Hmm... Gotta wonder what left that stain. Trucy: Wait! I know! Maybe it was left there by a red marker! Like, they were trying to write their name, and slipped. Apollo: Why would anyone write their name on a lamp cord? Trucy: I used to write my name on my magic ropes... Bullet Bullet head Trucy: Wow! It's all mushed! Apollo: That was one tough safe. Trucy: You know, it looks kinda yummy. Apollo: ...Huh? Trucy: ...Like ice cream! Mmm-mmm! Caramel! Apollo: You certainly have an active imagination, Trucy. Meraktis Clinic (after visiting Meraktis Clinic - Office) Examine Office door Apollo: A plate on this door reads \"Doctor's Office\". Trucy: That was pretty intense, wasn't it!? Apollo: If we'd gone in there one second earlier, we might have met the burglar! Trucy: But, Apollo... What would we have said if we did see them? We can't exactly shout out \"Hey! Who are you!?\" Apollo: ... It does lack a certain punch. Trucy: Let's think of something cool to say for the next time we do meet a burglar! People Park (after examining sandals in Meraktis Clinic - Reception) Ema: I know that face. That's the face of someone who's made... a discovery! Trucy: Hey, how did you know? Ema: You can't fool someone trained in the ways of science! Apollo: (Next she'll have us analyzing face prints...) Trucy: Let's ask Detective Skye to help us, Apollo! Present Lamp Apollo: Say, could you take a look at this lamp? Ema: Hmm. The bulb's broken. Apollo: Right. Strange, isn't it? Ema: Really? I break bulbs all the time. My desk is a mess and my lamp is always falling over. ...Not too bright, huh? Apollo: (Ouch...) Trucy: I still think it's kind of odd... Wocky's Chart Trucy: Detective Skye, I was wondering about this... Apollo: Ack, Trucy! Wait! Trucy: What? Apollo: That's vital evidence there. You can't show her that! That's our secret weapon in tomorrow's trial for sure! Trucy: Ooh! Clever, Apollo! Ema: ...What did I tell you before? If you're going to talk behind someone's back, do it quietly. Bullet Trucy: Detective Skye, I was wondering about this... Apollo: Ack, Trucy! Wait! Trucy: What? Apollo: This bullet was inside the safe, right? That means the police don't know about it yet! Trucy: Oh, right! We can use this in the trial tomorrow! Ema: ...Do I have to repeat myself every time? If you're going to talk behind someone's back, do so quietly! Slippers (after obtaining toeprint) Ema: Ah, the slippers... That's quite a clear print there. ...A toe print. Trucy: Too bad we don't know whose toe it is. Ema: Well, there is a way of finding out, of course. Apollo: There is!? What? Ema: All you need is a sample of the same toe print, off another shoe, for instance. Apollo: Oh, right. So if the prints matched, you'd know the same person wore both. (Hmm. Do I have another shoe worn by the same person?) Got one right here Apollo: I think I just might, actually. Ema: Really!? Apollo: (I'm beginning to suspect something here...) Detective Skye! Can you compare this sample with this other print? Present Sandals (after obtaining toeprint) Apollo: Apollo: This pair of sandals, toe print and all. Ema: Ooh! The print on these is nice and clear, too. That makes our job easy. Apollo: Can you analyze it for us? Ema: Of course! Hang on... Ema: Bingo! Gosh, I'm good. Apollo: (Hey, we were the ones who found the prints...) Ema: A perfect match! The same person wore these sandals and slippers! Apollo: I was afraid of that... Ema: All you have to do is find out who these sandals belong to! Or... do you already know? Apollo: I... can't say. Not yet. (Well, that's one big step closer... ...to the truth!) Leads back to Court Record Present Slippers Apollo: Ema: ... Apollo: What's with the scowl? Trucy: It's got a toe print on it, doesn't it? Ema: ...Of course it matches. It's the same evidence as before! Apollo: Huh? Oh, right. Ema: What are you thinking, trying to compare something with itself!? Apollo: (I'd better stop messing up or I'm gonna get struck down by lightning from the Skye.) Ema: Try again! And... try scientifically, please. Apollo: (Hmm, another toe print. Right!) Leads back to Court Record Present anything else Apollo: Ema: ... I did say \"toe print\" sample, didn't I? Where exactly is the toe print on this evidence!? Apollo: (Oops. Stormy Skyes ahead...) Ema: Try again. Scientifically this time, if you would. Apollo: (Hmm, a toe print. Right!) Leads back to Court Record No such luck Apollo: No... I can't think of anything I might have with a toe print on it. Ema: Ah well, it was too much to hope for, I suppose. Let me know if you find something. Apollo: (A toe print sample... Hmm.) Leads back to Court Record Sandals Ema: Hmm... Yes... Yes! Apollo: Did you find something? Ema: Well, scientifically speaking... These are a pair of woman's sandals. Pretty cute, too. Trucy: We found them in the lobby at the Meraktis Clinic! Ema: Hmm? Say, this sandal has a toe mark... Apollo: A toe mark... You mean a toe print? Ema: That I do! You can analyze it just like a fingerprint! Apollo: (This little clue might be a real windfall!) Ema: Oh... There's one problem. The police station doesn't keep a record of toe prints. So we won't know whose it is. Apollo: (...I guess that would be too much to hope for.) Trucy: Still, it might be useful somehow! Let's analyze it! Sandals (after obtaining toeprint) Ema: These sandals... That's quite a clear print there. ...A toe print. Trucy: Too bad we don't know whose toe it is. Ema: Well, there is a way of finding out, of course. Apollo: There is!? What? Ema: All you need is a sample of the same toe print, off another shoe, for instance. Apollo: Oh, right. So if the prints matched, you'd know the same person wore both. (Hmm. Do I have another shoe worn by the same person?) Got one right here Apollo: I think I just might, actually. Ema: Really!? Apollo: (I'm beginning to suspect something here...) Detective Skye! Can you compare this sample with this other print? Present Slippers (after obtaining toeprint) Apollo: Apollo: This pair of slippers, toe print and all. Ema: Ooh! The print on these is nice and clear, too. That makes our job easy. Apollo: Can you analyze it for us? Ema: Of course! Hang on... Ema: Bingo! Gosh, I'm good. Apollo: (Hey, we were the ones who found the prints...) Ema: A perfect match! The same person wore these sandals and slippers! Apollo: I was afraid of that... Ema: All you have to do is find out who these sandals belong to! Or... do you already know? Apollo: I... can't say. Not yet. (Well, that's one big step closer... ...to the truth!) Present Sandals Apollo: Ema: ... Apollo: What's with the scowl? Trucy: It's got a toe print on it, doesn't it? Ema: ...Of course it matches. It's the same evidence as before! Apollo: Huh? Oh, right. Ema: What are you thinking, trying to compare something with itself!? Apollo: (I'd better stop messing up or I'm gonna get struck down by lightning from the Skye.) Ema: Try again! And... try scientifically, please. Apollo: (Hmm, another toe print. Right!) Present anything else Apollo: Ema: ... I did say \"toe print\" sample, didn't I? Where exactly is the toe print on this evidence!? Apollo: (Oops. Stormy Skyes ahead...) Ema: Try again. Scientifically this time, if you would. Apollo: (Hmm, a toe print. Right!) No such luck Apollo: No... I can't think of anything I might have with a toe print on it. Ema: Ah well, it was too much to hope for, I suppose. Let me know if you find something. Apollo: (A toe print sample... Hmm.) Leads back to Court Record Slippers or Sandals (subsequent times) Ema: Well, if the prints on these slippers and these sandals match, which they do... ...it means that the same person was wearing them. Trucy: You know, I thought that's what it might mean! Science is amazing! Ema: It is, isn't it!? I've never felt so alive! Apollo: (I don't know about science, but this is a major lead!) Examine evidence Slippers Toeprint Apollo: The toe prints match... Which means the sandals and the slippers were worn by the same person. And the slippers are from the Meraktis Clinic. These have to be connected to the crime! Sandals Toeprint Apollo: The toe prints match... Which means the sandals and the slippers were worn by the same person. If only we knew who these sandals belonged to... After clearing \"Forged evidence\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic, correctly presenting Slippers and Sandals in People Park, and examining lamp, bullet hole, and medical chart in Meraktis Clinic - Office: June 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room Wocky: Don't cry angel, Daddy's back and Daddy's... ...Oh. You again. Apollo: Do you always have to announce your entrances like that? Wocky: Man, my old man, he... Man! Now I'm all in a funk, and it's his fault. Apollo: (One can only assume that his father tried to teach him a lesson. And failed, clearly.) Wocky: You two got your work cut out for you, straight up. Course I don't care if they lock me up. I'm ready to go! Apollo: (Some days, I wonder why I do what I do.) Talk Guilty verdict Wocky: Hey man, you won't see me bugging 'bout one or two guilty charges. Trucy: But what if you're found guilty of murder!? Wocky: Hey, it's all experience, you feel me, shorty? Like a badge of honor. ...They don't give the death penalty, do they? Trucy: ...You didn't really do it, did you? Wocky: ... Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. Apollo: (If I've learned one thing today... it's that \"silence\" speaks louder than words.) Your father Wocky: Man, my old man is wack. Disappointing, that's what he is. Trucy: I heard he wants to leave the mob? Wocky: Over my dead body! I spend my life, trying to keep it real, being an O.G. and never stepping down. Now my old man wants to go soft? Fine, let him. Just leave me out of it. Apollo: (*sigh*) Wocky: The day I get out of the clink... That's the day Alita and I start the next generation of the Kitaki Family. Apollo: (Please don't talk as though it's assumed you're going to jail... for my sake.) Wocky & Alita (appears after presenting Wocky's Chart) Wocky: 'Bout half a year ago, I was shot during a little turf war with another family. I was ready to die, sure. But they came in and got me, hauled me off to the doc's. Trucy: ...The Meraktis Clinic? Wocky: That's where I met her. My fallen angel... Apollo: You mean Alita Tiala? Wocky: She was scared of me at first, turns out. But you know what they say -- the bad guy always gets the ladies. Apollo: Right... Wocky: She was done with that clinic anyhow. So I was like, I'll take you on, woman! Straight gangster style. Guess what she said? Trucy: What did she say? Wocky: C'mon, give it some thought! She said it real quiet-like, on the down low, know what I'm saying? \"I'll leave... if you'll marry me.\" Apollo: So... that was the proposal? Wocky: You know it! An oath of love, right there in the hospital room. Just like that, the op was done, and we were outta there. See ya later, bye! Apollo: Um, about that \"op\"... Wocky: Yeah. Didn't go so well after all, did it? I know about the report. I know it's still in me. Health check-up (appears after \"Wocky & Alita\") Trucy: This health check-up was the Boss's idea, you said? Wocky: Yeah. Can you imagine? What's the point of living healthy when you're a G, you know what I'm saying? Trucy: But didn't you learn about the bullet at that check-up? Wocky: Yeah... That's when I knew that doctor had to pay. Figured I could get that cap pulled after I got my revenge. And hey, I'm still living large now, aren't I? Apollo: Incidentally... had you ever had a health check-up before? Wocky: Naw, my old man suddenly gets this idea that we all gotta get check-ups! Guess he's getting old. Older, I mean. Present Sandals Apollo: Wocky... You don't happen to recognize these, do you? Wocky: Hey! Sure I do! I was the one who bought 'em for her. Trucy: For... Ms. Tiala? Wocky: Yeah. A birthday present. She's got mad little feet. Mad! So cute, man. Trucy: So these sandals are hers... Apollo: Yeah... I kinda had a feeling. Wocky: What's up with the funky vibes? Apollo: (*sigh*...) Sandals updated in the Court Record. Alita's Sandals Apollo: Wocky... You don't happen to recognize these, do you? Wocky: Hey! Sure I do! I was the one who bought 'em for her. Trucy: For... Ms. Tiala? Wocky: Yeah. A birthday present. She's got mad little feet. Mad! So cute, man. Trucy: So these sandals are hers... Apollo: Yeah... I kinda had a feeling. Wocky: What's up with the funky vibes? Apollo: (*sigh*...) Wocky's Chart Wocky: Huh? What's that? Some kinda X-ray? Wait... Apollo: That's right, Wocky. It's yours. Wocky: Hey look, I don't smoke or nothing. I'll live long, right? Trucy: I don't think he gets it, Apollo... Apollo: Ah, take a closer look. Here, in particular... ...where it says \"Nurse\". ...It's signed \"Alita Tiala\". Wocky: ...Huh. You lawyers do your homework. Trucy: So, you met Ms. Tiala when you... Wocky: Yeah, I met her at the clinic. So? Apollo: Could you tell us a bit about the circumstances of your meeting? Wocky: Fine, fine! I'll tell you how we met if you want to know that bad. Anything else Wocky: ... Man... that is so far off the hook, it's off the chain, G! Apollo: (He seems preoccupied with something else...) Wocky: ...Wonder how my Alita's doing. Man, I miss her. Examine evidence Sandals Toe print Apollo: (If these sandals belong to Ms. Tiala... ...then is this print hers, too?) Trucy: Something wrong? Apollo: No... Nothing. After clearing all Talk options with Wocky Kitaki and presenting Sandals in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: June 16Eldoon's House Trucy: Mr. Eldoon! We've been looking all over for you! Guy: What's the matter, Trucy-doll? Trucy: Apollo! Show him what we found! Nothing like expert advice! Apollo: (I... suppose he is a doctor still...) Guy: ... *sniffle* Apollo: Mr. Eldoon! Is everything OK? Guy: I'm just *sniffle* so happy! I just thought my doctor days were gone for good. *sniffle* Apollo: Mr. Eldoon... Present Wocky's Chart Leads to: \"Um, Mr. Eldoon, could you take a look at this?\" Apollo: Um, Mr. Eldoon, could you take a look at this? Guy: Hrm? A medical chart? Hey, you shouldn't go around taking these from clinics! ... Trucy: Why the sudden silence, Mr. Eldoon? Guy: What...? What's going on here!? Apollo: That's what we want to know! That chart belongs to my client. Trucy: He's on trial... On suspicion of murder. Guy: On trial! That's crazy! You can't put him on trial! He's ABD! Trucy: ...ABD? Guy: All but dead. He's knocking on the Pearly Gates, and someone's about to answer. Apollo: C-Can you tell us why? Guy: ... Well, permit me to speak as a surgeon... You listen up good now, son. Apollo: (No way... It's like he's a completely different person...) Talk Wocky's chart Guy: Well, according to this chart... this \"Wocky Kitaki\" feller's not doing so well. He's got a bullet right up side his heart! Apollo: That's right. Guy: Yeah, but this chart talks about the post-op... In other words, the operation is already finished! ...But you can still see that bullet stuck in there. Apollo: Why would it still be in there after the operation to remove it? Guy: Well, 'bout the only reason I can think of is, it was too tricky to operate on. Trucy: What...? Guy: That bullet's snug as a bug there next to the aorta, which is connected to the heart. Heck, that scrap of metal's just surrounded by blood vessels. Kind of a miracle. Two millimeters to either side and there'd be some serious bleeding going on in there. Not something yer average doc'd be eager to fiddle with. Trucy: Y-You mean... Guy: It took a miracle to get that bullet stuck where it is. It'd take more than a miracle to take it out. It'd take a magician. Apollo: ... Trucy: Um... I'm only up to making rabbits disappear. I haven't learned bullets yet. Guy: 'Course with the heart pumping and lungs working... That bullet's on the move. I'd give him another half a year, tops. Apollo: B-But Wocky's operation was already a half-year ago! Guy: That's why I'm saying you're outta time! This kid shouldn't be on trial! He should be on an operating table! Apollo: (Great... Just great...) Meraktis's dilemma (appears after \"Wocky's chart\") Leads to: \"How could Dr. Meraktis do such a terrible thing?\" Present Anything Apollo: Um, Mr. Eldoon, could you take a look at this? Guy: You think we got time for that? Well, we don't. You see me without my bowl on, you're looking at a man who means business. So stop beating around the bush and get cutting! Apollo: (Better hear what he has to say while he's in a talkative mood...) Trucy: How could Dr. Meraktis do such a terrible thing? How could he just leave that bullet in there? Guy: I got a pretty good idea of how he felt... An emergency operation... He's got the kid's chest open on the table. Then he finds that bullet... That's despair right there, Trucy-doll. Cold despair. Trucy: Despair... Guy: 'Bout the only thing he could do is sew the boy back up. He wasn't exactly in the situation to go admitting he couldn't take it out. Trucy: The Kitakis... Guy: You bet. This kid's their only son, I hear. So, he skips the operation, and Wocky's back on the street living his life. 'Course, it's only a matter of time before his heart hemorrhages and he drops cold. Trucy: How awful...! Guy: And which doctor would they take him to? Meraktis. He's got enough ties to them, he could probably cover up the truth of what happened. Trucy: That's just horrible! He left Wocky to die! Guy: There's a darkness in this world, Trucy-doll. Waiting, hungry. Compared to it, these gangs' turf wars are like kid games. When you're up against real evil... Well, it don't matter if you're weak or strong. It'll take you all the same. Trucy: ... You were a surgeon, right Mr. Eldoon!? You could operate on Wocky, couldn't you!? Guy: ...I wish. Trucy: What...? Guy: I'm afraid there ain't nobody in the country that could. Maybe not even in the world... Trucy: So... So Wocky... Guy: He's real lucky to be alive even now. Trucy: No...! Apollo: There's one problem... Trucy: Apollo? Apollo: This chart... Look at the \"Nurse\" section... ...Alita Tiala. Trucy: That's right! This operation was how they met. Apollo: Yeah, the problem is, she knew. She knew about Wocky's condition, guaranteed. Trucy: Ah... Apollo: Why didn't she ever tell him? Guy: ... Apollo: (It doesn't make sense... If she knew her patient was in serious danger... ...you'd think she'd want to get that second operation before getting engaged!) Trucy: What was she thinking!? Apollo? Apollo: (What were you thinking, Alita Tiala...?) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: No clues here. Exit shoeprint analysis session Ema: Huh? Giving up already? Suit yourself. If you want to take another swing at it, just let me know. Running out of plaster during shoeprint analysis session Ema: What are you doing!? Out of plaster already? Apollo: Hey, give me a break! I'm just a beginner at this! Ema: I'm not that far ahead of you, believe me! ...Fine. I'll make another batch. Don't mess it up this time. Apollo: (Plaster, here comes Justice! *sigh*)\n-- Wocky's Plan --Alita: It was the day that the family health check-up results came back.Press Apollo: Apollo: That was the day of the murder, correct? Alita: Yes. Everyone in the Family received their check-up results that day. When Wocky looked at his, his face went so pale... Klavier: But of course. He had just found out he had a bullet in his chest! Apollo: So, you were there at the time? Alita: Yes... Poor Wocky...Alita: When Wocky found out that Dr. Meraktis had lied, he flew into a rage.Press Apollo: Apollo: That must have been, um, quite frightening. Alita: He was furious! He ripped his report up into shreds... Klavier: Incidentally, I had to request another copy to file as evidence. A bothersome chore, but one I performed without complaint. Alita: Wocky's at an age where he's hard to control when he loses his temper. Of course, that little bit of instability is so cute! Apollo: (Great, now he sounds like a psychopath...)Alita: \"I'll teach him!\" he said. He took one of the Family's pistols...Press Apollo: Apollo: So, is it easy to take a pistol out from the house? Alita: Not really, I think. There's a system in place to limit access. But Wocky's a special case, being the next-in-line. Klavier: Perhaps his treatment was a bit too special, ja? Alita: Well, maybe he is a bit spoiled... I hear he got amazing presents for his birthdays. Last year was a switchblade made out of chewing gum and a chocolate gravestone! Apollo: (Sounds like he has a taste for sweets... and danger.) Judge: The point here being that Wocky had access to a pistol.Alita: ...And, you already know what happened that night.Press Apollo: Apollo: \"What happened\"... meaning the murder. Alita: I tried to stop him, I really did! But Wocky wouldn't listen... Klavier: Our defendant was nothing if not determined, it seems. Judge: The last thing you should do is blame yourself, miss!Alita: I... just don't see how anyone but Wocky could have done it.Press Apollo: Apollo: How can you say that for certain? How!? Alita: Ah... Klavier: Klavier: Herr Forehead, you will refrain from badgering the Fr\u00e4ulein. It was the defendant... erm, Wocky, was it... who took the pistol from his home. We know this for a fact now. Judge: I suppose we do. Klavier: So, how could anyone else have used this pistol to shoot the victim? They could not. Simple logic, ja? Judge: ...That does seem to be the case. Does the defense have anything to say regarding this point? Apollo: (Could someone else have used that pistol...?) Had to be Wocky Apollo: I'm sure there was another person who could have used that pistol... ...... I just can't think of who. Klavier: Of course. He was the only one with access. Apollo: (Uh oh, this is bad if I leave it like this...!) Judge: You may continue with the cross-examination. Apollo: (Was there really no one else with access to that pistol? Someone else with Family ties...?) Leads back to cross-examination There was another Apollo: Based on your testimony, there was clearly another... One other person had access to that pistol! Klavier: What's this...? Judge: Hmm... Interesting! Let's ask the defense then... Tell the court who this other person with access was! Present Alita Tiala profile Apollo: Leads to: \"Well, of course, I mean you, Ms. Tiala.\" Present Plum Kitaki or Winfred Kitaki profile Apollo: Judge: Wh-What's this!? Trucy: Whaaaa--! The Boss and his wife!? Klavier: Ah, an unexpected ploy. Trucy: Apollo! That can't be right! Why would they want to frame their only son!? Apollo: Oh... Judge: On his parents' behalf, I'd like to give you a penalty. Apollo: (Ugh...) Judge: Carry on, Mr. Justice. Leads back to cross-examination Present anyone else Apollo: Judge: ...... Trucy: ...He's speechless, Apollo. The judge is speechless. Klavier: Ah ha ha... Herr Forehead, our judge is silent. Perhaps you will permit me to explain why? Apollo: N-No thanks, I think I know. Judge: Then you must have been expecting this penalty. Apollo: (Yowch... That didn't go so well...) Leads back to cross-examinationTrucy: Poor Ms. Tiala... I can't imagine what it would be like to be in her position!Apollo: (...I'm a little more concerned for her fianc\u00e9. Why would she testify against him like this...?)Apollo: Well, of course, I mean you, Ms. Tiala.Alita: ...! M-Me...? But why...Apollo: You were quite clear when you told the court: You heard about the pistol from the defendant on the day of the murder. In other words, you knew what he was planning.Klavier:Klavier: Let me get this straight... You intend to tell us that this lady stole the pistol from her fianc\u00e9... ...and killed a man in cold blood on his behalf? I've heard of people doing strange things for love, but this...Judge: It does seem a bit... unfathomable, to be sure. I'm all for romance, and for supporting your partner in life, to be sure. But I think I would hesitate at murder!Apollo: (I'd hope you'd do more than hesitate!) But what if a different connection could be proven? A connection between the witness and the victim? We might find that she had a personal motive beyond wanting to help her fianc\u00e9.Klavier: Hmm, that would put things in a slightly different light. What possible connection are you suggesting here?Trucy: You know what I'm starting to think? I'm starting to think that the police never looked inside that safe.Apollo: I have evidence showing a connection between the witness Ms. Tiala and the victim!Present Alita's Sandals Apollo: Judge: Why, those are... flip flops? Apollo: \"Sandals\", actually. Ms. Tiala, do these look familiar to you? Alita: ...Should they? Apollo: I would think so. These sandals were found in the Meraktis Clinic lobby. Judge: You don't mean to say those are the witness's sandals? Alita: He doesn't. Those sandals could belong to anyone... Apollo: Apollo: But the fact is that they don't. They belong to you. We found toe prints on these sandals. Alita: ...! Apollo: Requesting permission to match the prints with the witness's feet, Your Honor! Judge: Ms. Tiala, are those your sandals!? Alita: ...... What if... What if my sandals were at the Meraktis Clinic. So what? Apollo: ...So what!? Alita: You know, I've just remembered something. I hurt my hand a few days ago, and visited that clinic. I must have forgotten them then! Judge: Hmm... So you were there as a patient? Apollo: Apollo: Nice try, Ms. Tiala. But the defense is in possession of evidence... ...that proves a connection between you and that clinic! Alita: Wh-Whaat!? Judge: Evidence? Very well, Mr. Justice... Apollo: The evidence that connects her to the Meraktis Clinic is...! Present Wocky's Chart Apollo: Leads to: \"That looks like... a medical chart?\" Present anything else Apollo: Judge: ... Well, I suppose I could see-- Klavier: Klavier: Herr Forehead. This trail you think you have found, it doesn't lead to the truth. Nor to a long career in the legal profession, ja? Apollo: Gee, thanks. Klavier: Perhaps you will allow me to do the honors? Judge: Hmm... Why not? It might be nice for a change. Klavier: Most excellent... Let's rock! Apollo: (I'll take the usual penalty next time, thanks.) Judge: Very well, Mr. Justice. Try again. Leads back to: \"The evidence that connects her to the Meraktis Clinic is...!\" Judge: That looks like... a medical chart? Apollo: Found inside a safe at the Meraktis Clinic. I'd like to draw the court's attention to the names written on the chart. Judge: ...What!? Ms. Tiala! Whatever... Why is your name on this chart!? Alita: ...! Apollo: Well, care to explain the meaning of this, Ms. Tiala? Alita: ...... I'm not sure what you mean by \"meaning\", Mr. Justice! Apollo: ...! (Our warm little fianc\u00e9e just froze over!) Alita: I was on staff at that clinic until half a year ago. It was boring. So I quit. That's all. Is there a problem with that? Judge: Ms. Tiala! You testified that you had no connection to the victim! Alita: And I don't. Now. Apollo: \"Now\"...? Alita: I quit half a year ago, didn't I? So there's no connection. Let me guess, you're the kind of guy... ...who can't rest until he knows every last detail of his girlfriend's past. Am I right? Judge: Th-That's not true at all! Why, I... I embrace the ones I love, past flaws and all, no matte-- Apollo: Apollo: \"There's no connection now\" doesn't fly in a court of law. Alita: Doesn't... fly? Apollo: (She's one tough nut. She probably feels right at home with the Kitakis!) You left your job at the Meraktis Clinic, true... But these sandals prove that you remained connected! Alita: Ah...! W-Well, who knows? I'm sure there are lots of people with those sandals... Klavier: So sorry, Fr\u00e4ulein, but your act isn't working. Alita: ...! Klavier: Your moment of hesitation just now cost you.

I was wrong to cooperate with you from the beginning! I just wanted... I just wanted you to help get Wocky back on the straight and narrow.Judge: Hmm... This court thinks you need to worry less about Wocky and more about yourself. It sounds as though we need to hear a bit more about your story.Apollo: Your sandals were found in the entrance to the clinic... Which means you went there on the day of the murder!Alita: Well, there's little point in denying it.Judge: Very well. The witness will tell us about this visit. Why did you go to the Meraktis Clinic that day?Witness Testimony-- The Meraktis Clinic --Alita: I did go to the clinic that day. My first time in half a year, since I quit in January. I went to warn him. After all, I knew Wocky had the pistol. The doctor always was a timid man... too timid to admit his own mistake. Why else would I have gone? I'm not hiding any dark secrets. I wanted to tell him to be careful, as an old friend.Judge: By \"mistake\", you mean... ...the mistake we heard about from the defendant? The botched operation?Alita: He was a timid, small man... but I never wished him harm. I just thought I should let him know, you know?Judge: Hmm... That does make sense.Klavier: Yes, but there is still one thing which does not.Judge: What's that, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier: The sandals left in the lobby, of course. We can assume she wore these sandals to the clinic, ja? Then why did she not wear them home? If it were me, I would have worn them home.Judge: I would have worn those sandals home, too.Klavier: So, why were the sandals left behind?Alita: ...!Apollo: (Ack! He pointed out the contradiction before me!)Klavier: ...There's probably a good explanation for this. Right, Ms. Tiala? ...Say, for instance... There happened to be a similar pair of sandals there which you wore home by mistake?Alita: ... Actually, that's right. I'm impressed, Mr. Gavin.Klavier: Oh, it is nothing. There is, after all, no other possible explanation. Ja, Forehead?Apollo: (Oh, what the...! No fair! He's filling the holes in her testimony...)Judge: The defense may begin the cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Meraktis Clinic --Alita: I did go to the clinic that day. My first time in half a year, since I quit in January.Press Apollo: Apollo: Around what time did you go to the clinic? Alita: I don't remember exactly, but it was after 9:30, I think. Apollo: And that was the first time you had contacted Dr. Meraktis in half a year? Alita: Of course it was. He wasn't the kind of boss you made \"friends\" with. Judge: So, why did you go to the clinic that day?Alita: I went to warn him. After all, I knew Wocky had the pistol.Press Apollo: Apollo: Did you want Dr. Meraktis to run away? Alita: Well, after I failed to stop Wocky... ...I thought that was the only other way to avoid the problem. Apollo: Couldn't you have called? Why go in person? Alita: I called several times that evening, but no one was in. Klavier: The victim was busy driving home until after 9:00 PM that night, remember? This was proven by this mirror yesterday, ja? Alita: I thought if I warned him, he would run away for sure. Knowing the doctor...Alita: The doctor always was a timid man... too timid to admit his own mistake.Press Apollo: Apollo: You mean that act of malpractice on Wocky, correct? Alita: If he had just told Wocky the truth in the beginning, none of this would have happened. Judge: True, that operation was the start of this whole affair. Alita: Oh. Of course, if he'd told him... ...he might have been \"erased\" by the Kitakis much earlier. Judge: A disturbing thought! Klavier: We know that the Meraktis Clinic had ties to the Kitaki Family. He probably couldn't have gone to the police, even if he wanted to. Alita: That's why I knew I had to warn him!Alita: Why else would I have gone? I'm not hiding any dark secrets.Press Apollo: Apollo: No \"dark secrets\", eh? Alita: What? Look at me however you want, Mr. Justice, you won't find a thing. Apollo: (She's hiding something, I know it! I must have some evidence that proves it, too...) Alita: You're free to think whatever you like. I went to that clinic with only one thought in mind.Present Wocky's Chart Apollo: Apollo: This chart was found inside a safe in the doctor's office. Alita: ...Yes? Apollo: Why would this one chart be in that safe? Ms. Tiala, you know why it was, don't you? Alita: ...! Judge: Mind filling me in? Apollo: Dr. Meraktis didn't have the leisure of making \"mistakes\". That's why he wrote up a false report, and kept the truth locked away. Klavier: ...Bad Herr Doktor. Apollo: And this is where you come in, Ms. Tiala. Alita: ... Apollo: The nurse who filed this chart was you, which means... ...you knew about Wocky's failed operation! Judge: Interesting... Apollo: You were in the same position as Dr. Meraktis! Kind of makes it hard to claim \"no connection\", doesn't it? Alita: You're bold for a novice, I'll give you that. Apollo: ...! Alita: Mr. Justice, you must know I was only a nurse. The doctor is responsible for the chart's contents. Judge: Hmm... This chart business seems to be quite important. Please amend your testimony accordingly. Alita: Too bad, little attorney. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: ...! (My bracelet's reacting again!) Trucy: What is it, Apollo? Apollo: I felt my bracelet tighten just now... (Changed from [I felt my bracelet vibrate just now...] in the original release) Trucy: Your bracelet...? Apollo: Just like yesterday. Like you said! When a witness is unsure of something, their nervous habit gives them away! Trucy: But... I can't see anything, Apollo. Apollo: Eh...? (Then what's my bracelet reacting to?) Trucy: Wait, maybe... Yes, that has to be it! Apollo: What has to be it? Trucy: Your senses, Apollo... They must be sharper than mine! Apollo: Huh...? Trucy: I can't see it, but you can sense it! Apollo: I don't know about that, Trucy! I don't have some kind of special power or anything. Trucy: Listen to me, Apollo! There's a weak point somewhere in Ms. Tiala's testimony! But we don't know what her nervous habit is. Apollo: Well, then what do we do!? Trucy: You have to perceive it yourself, Apollo! With your eyes... and your senses! Apollo: (Then it's up to me and my bracelet... I don't know why, but the bracelet helps. Somehow, touching it helps me focus. Let's give it a shot and bring down that testimony!) Changes statement from \"Why else would I have gone? I'm not hiding any dark secrets.\" to \"Why would I go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart?\"Alita: Why would I go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart?Press Apollo: Apollo: But your signature was on that chart. Alita: So? What does that have to do with this case? If there was something in that chart to make me look bad, I would have dealt with it. The only one responsible for that chart is the presiding doctor... Dr. Meraktis. Apollo: (She's hiding something, I can smell it... And I bet she's got a habit that gives it away! I just have to focus to find her nervous habit! Maybe it's time to give my bracelet a rub...)Perceive moving engagement ring on \"go to the clinic now\" Apollo: Apollo: Why go to the clinic for a half-year-old chart now, you ask? But, you know why you would go \"now\", don't you. Alita: I don't know what you're talking about. Apollo: It was quite clear, Ms. Tiala. You have a nervous habit. The moment you said the word \"now\"... ...you used your right thumb to fiddle with your ring. (Changed from [...you used your right thumb to fiddled [sic] with your ring.] in the original release) Alita: Wh-What? Apollo: (She was unsure... I saw it! \"Now\"... That's the key word!) The chart wasn't a part of your past... It was a clear and present threat! Alita: That's ridiculous, why if that were the case... ...I would have had six months to do something about it! Apollo: Indeed. Alita: Eh...? Apollo: Which means something happened quite recently... Something to make that chart a problem for you now. Alita: ...! Apollo: (I've got her on the ropes now, I can feel it! Time to strike the killing blow... with evidence!) ...Ms. Tiala. There's no use trying to hide it. The chart became a threat to you now... because of this! Present Wocky's Check-Up Report Apollo: Leads to: \"A health check-up report.. belonging to the defendant.\" Present anything else Apollo: Alita: ...Because of what? Apollo: Um... Alita: The eyes of a hawk... and the brain of a toad. Apollo: (Ribbit! I mean, ack! I can't lose this now! C'mon toad brain, one more try!) Leads back to: \"The chart wasn't a part of your past...\" Apollo: A health check-up report.. belonging to the defendant. The Kitakis are trying to get out of the business. The health check-up this month was their first ever... ...What did you think when you heard about this? Alita: Eh? Oh, n-nothing. Why should I think anything? Apollo: Oh? I would think you were positively beside yourself. Because you were afraid. You knew what Wocky's chest X-ray would reveal! Alita: ...Urk! Apollo: A full half year had passed since the operation. You thought you were home free... ...when the chart came back to haunt you! Alita: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Apollo: That's all, Your Honor. Judge: ...... Wh-What just happened? Did... the witness just admit to lying? Alita: ...! Klavier: I sensed it. There was a great \"aura\" emanating from Herr Forehead. ...Very cool. So, the lady was lying, it seems. Apollo: That's correct. She said she had no connection to the Meraktis Clinic. But her connection was deep indeed... A bit too deep. If the Kitakis got a hold of this chart with her name... ...she'd be finished. Isn't that right, Ms. Tiala? Alita: ... You guessed it. Judge: Order! Order!!! Apollo: (I-I did it! I broke her testimony!) Trucy: Amazing, Apollo! I didn't see it at all! Daddy was right about you! Alita: Wait! Apollo: ...! Judge: Ms. Tiala? Alita: It's true, that chart was bad news for me. That's why I went to meet the doctor that day! But that's all! I told him about Wocky and went home! Klavier: ...It appears this cross-examination is far from over. Apollo: Wh-Whaaaat!? Klavier: She hid the truth from us, this is clear, yet... It is not clear that this truth has anything to do with the case at hand! Judge: Hmm... Very well. The witness will add this to her testimony. And... we'll have a bit more cross-examination. Apollo: (Grr! I was so close!) Trucy: You're still close! Keep on her, Apollo! Changes statement from \"I wanted to tell him to be careful, as an old friend.\" to \"Nothing happened at all. I warned him, and left.\"Press (after perceiving correctly) Apollo: Apollo: We already know you're lying about having no reason! Alita: I know you know! Don't look at me like that! Apollo: Huh...? Alita: Like I'm some two-bit washed up good-for-nothing... You scared me! Klavier: ...I concur. Even I am rarely treated to such a... hot gaze. Apollo: S-Sorry... (Maybe I need to do some face training, too...)Alita: I wanted to tell him to be careful, as an old friend.Press Apollo: Apollo: But, then you'd be betraying Wocky, wouldn't you? Alita: No, I did it for him, for us! Klavier: She went to warn him, so that her fianc\u00e9 would not have to commit such a crime, ja? Alita: I didn't want them to take my Wocky away...Alita: Nothing happened at all. I warned him, and left.Press Apollo: Apollo: How did Dr. Meraktis respond to the warning? Alita: Oh, he was quite surprised. Panicky, even. Who wouldn't be scared to learn a Kitaki was after them? Judge: Incidentally, this court is not afraid of any mobsters! Why, we had a life-threatening situation just yesterday right here in this courtroom. Apollo: (Yeah, real impressive the way you stood up to the attack of the Amazing Mr. Hat, sir...) Klavier: ...After which I carried you back to your chambers. Trucy: ...Sounds like the judge had quite a fright. Apollo: (\"Nothing happened\" in Dr. Meraktis's office that day, huh...) Trucy: But what about the mess we found? Something definitely happened in that office, Apollo! Apollo: I know, I know... But we can't prove \"when\" it happened. Nor that Alita Tiala was in any way involved... Trucy: Well, let's try putting some evidence up anyway!Present Bullet Apollo: Leads to: \"You say \"nothing happened\" in the doctor's office.\"Apollo: (There's no way she went to that clinic just to \"warn\" him!)Trucy: Do you know why she went, Apollo?Apollo: (Time to figure out what really happened at that clinic... and fast!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Phoenix Wright\nDescription: A pianist who can't play a lick.

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by looking through the testimonies and cross-referencing them with the evidence.\n\nFirst, the testimonies are all from Shamspeare. Let's look at them one by one. Testimony 0 says that the Japanese man (probably Natsume) came to his chamber with tea brewed in a pot. Testimony 1 claims that the poison was only in his (Shamspeare's) cup. Testimony 2 says that Natsume didn't drink any of his own tea. Testimony 3 mentions using the remaining tea from Natsume's cup to make ice coins using soap molds. Testimony 4 states that there's no poison in the tea he used for the soap molds, hence why the poison isn't found there.\n\nNow, looking at the evidence. Evidence 3 is the pair of teacups. The description mentions that Natsume's cup (with the green line) has no tea ring inside. A tea ring would indicate that tea was present and maybe drunk. But if Natsume's cup has no tea ring, that suggests he didn't drink from it. However, Shamspeare's testimony 2 says that Natsume didn't drink any of his own tea, which aligns with the no tea ring. But wait, Testimony 3 says that Shamspeare used the remaining tea from Natsume's cup to make the ice coins. If the cup had no tea ring, maybe there wasn't much tea left, but that's not a direct contradiction. \n\nEvidence 5 is the bar of soap with a circular depression. The soap was found outside the window. The depression might be from making ice coins. Testimony 3 and 4 talk about using the tea from Natsume's cup to make ice coins in soap molds. If the soap has a depression, maybe that's where the ice coins were made. But the problem arises with the presence of poison. If the poison was only in Shamspeare's cup (Testimony 1), then the tea from Natsume's cup (used for the ice coins) shouldn't have poison. However, Evidence 12 is the bottle of poison found in Miss Green's possession. But how does that tie in?\n\nWait, Testimony 4 says that there's no poison in the tea he used for the soap molds, hence the ice coins wouldn't have poison. But if the poison was in Shamspeare's cup, then the ice coins made from Natsume's cup's tea should be poison-free, which aligns. But maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nLooking at Evidence 3 again: Natsume's cup has no tea ring. If he didn't drink from it, then the tea in his cup was left. Shamspeare says in Testimony 3 that he used the remaining tea from Natsume's cup to make the ice coins. But if there's no tea ring, maybe the cup wasn't used at all. Wait, the tea ring is caused when liquid is left to dry, leaving a stain. If there's no tea ring in Natsume's cup, that suggests that either the cup was empty or the tea was poured out immediately. But Shamspeare claims he used the remaining tea from Natsume's cup. If the cup had tea left, there should be a ring. But Evidence 3 says there's no tea ring. That's a contradiction. So Testimony 3 (he used the remaining tea from Natsume's cup) would imply there was tea left in the cup, leading to a tea ring. But Evidence 3 states there's none. Therefore, the testimony and evidence contradict each other."

So Evidence 4 is the torn piece found in Shamspeare's room, and Evidence 14 is her envelope.

Therefore, Evidence 4 (Torn-Off End of Envelope) contradicts Testimony 3 from Olive Green. So the pair would be evidence 4 and testimony 3."

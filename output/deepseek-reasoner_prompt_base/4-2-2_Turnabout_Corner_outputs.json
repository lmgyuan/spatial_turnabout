But looking at the autopsy report (Evidence 11), the cause of death is a bullet to the right temple. So the testimony claims the bullet hit the forehead, but the evidence shows it was the temple. That's a contradiction. The location of the bullet wound doesn't match. So the evidence would be 11 (Autopsy Report) and testimony 4. \n\nWait, let me check other possibilities. Are there any other contradictions? Let's see Testimony 3 says the defendant had a pistol pointed at the victim. The Pistol (Evidence 14) was left at the scene with two rounds fired and fingerprints wiped. But the Knife (Evidence 10) has Wocky's prints. Hmm, not directly contradicting the testimony. Another angle: Testimony 4 mentions the bullet hit the forehead, but the autopsy says right temple. That's a direct conflict. The location of the wound is different. So the correct contradiction is between Evidence 11 and Testimony 4.\n"

    },
    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So, the user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.\n\nFirst, let's look at the testimonies given by Wesley Stickler (Testimony 0 to 4). His testimonies describe the events of the crime. He says that the killer raised a pistol, he told them to stop, the victim turned towards his voice and was shot, the defendant (Wocky) got scared, threw the pistol, and fled.\n\nNow, looking through the evidence. Let's see which one could conflict with his story. \n\nTestimony 3 says the defendant (Wocky) became frightened and tossed the pistol aside. But the Pistol (Evidence 14) has two rounds fired, and the fingerprints were wiped. If Wocky was the one who used the pistol, his fingerprints should be on it. But the Knife (Evidence 10) has Wocky's prints. However, the pistol's prints were wiped. If Stickler claims Wocky tossed the pistol, but the pistol's prints are wiped, that's a contradiction. Because if Wocky handled the pistol, his prints should be there unless he wiped them, which isn't mentioned in the testimony. But wait, the testimony says he tossed it aside, implying he didn't wipe it. But the evidence says the pistol's prints were wiped. So that's a contradiction.\n\nAnother angle: The Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) says the cause of death was a bullet to the right temple. The Pistol (14) had two rounds fired. But the Bullet (19) was found in the safe, squished. So maybe the bullet from the safe isn't the same as the one that killed Meraktis. But how does that relate to the testimony?\n\nWait, Testimony 2 says the victim turned towards Stickler's voice and a shot rang out. But the autopsy says the bullet was to the right temple. If Meraktis turned towards the voice, the shooter's position would affect the entry wound direction. Not sure if that's a contradiction here.\n\nLooking again at the Pistol (14): two rounds fired. The bullet in the safe (19) is one, and the other could be the fatal one. But the testimony says the defendant fired once, then fled. But if two shots were fired, maybe that contradicts the testimony? Not directly, unless the number of shots mentioned in testimony is different.\n\nWait, the testimonies don't specify the number of shots. Testimony 0 says the killer raised the pistol, Testimony 2 says a shot rang out when the victim turned. Then Testimony 4 says he tossed the pistol aside. The Pistol had two rounds fired, which might mean two shots. But the testimonies only mention one shot (the one that killed the victim). So if two shots were fired, that's a discrepancy. But the testimony might not mention the other shot. However, the contradiction might not be here.\n\nAnother possibility: The Slippers (Evidence 3) found in front of Kitaki Mansion have a big toe print. Alita's Sandals (16) also have a big toe print. Maybe indicating someone else was there. But how does that contradict the testimony? Stickler's testimony says Wocky is the killer, but if someone else's prints are on the slippers or sandals, maybe they were present. But the testimony doesn't address that directly.\n\nWait, the key contradiction could be about the fingerprints on the pistol. Testimony 4 says Wocky tossed the pistol, but the pistol (Evidence 14) has wiped fingerprints. If Wocky was the one who used it, his prints should be there unless he wiped them. But the testimony doesn't mention him wiping the prints; he just tossed it. Therefore, the fact that the pistol's prints were wiped contradicts the testimony that he tossed it without cleaning it. Alternatively, the Knife (10) has Wocky's prints, but the pistol doesn't. So why would the knife have his prints but not the pistol if he's the killer? That suggests maybe he didn't use the pistol. But the testimony says he used the pistol.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 says the defendant (Wocky) became frightened and tossed the pistol. But the pistol's prints were wiped. If he tossed it immediately, there's no time to wipe the prints. Therefore, the wiped prints on the pistol (Evidence 14) contradict Testimony 4, where he just tossed the pistol aside without wiping it. That seems like a contradiction. So the pair would be Evidence 14 (Pistol) and Testimony 4.\n\nWait, but let me check. Testimony 4: \"Tossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.\" So according to Stickler, Wocky threw the gun and ran. But the pistol's fingerprints were wiped. So if Wocky had just used the gun and tossed it, his prints should be on it. However, the evidence says the prints were wiped. So the contradiction is that the pistol shouldn't have wiped prints if he just tossed it. Therefore, Evidence 14 (Pistol) contradicts Testimony 4.\n\nYes, that's a solid contradiction. The testimony says the defendant (Wocky) tossed the pistol, which would leave his fingerprints, but the evidence states the fingerprints were wiped. Therefore, the existence of wiped prints on the pistol contradicts the testimony that he merely threw it without cleaning it.\n"

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies. Let me start by going through each testimony and checking against the evidence provided.\n\nTestimony 0: Stickler says he went to the supermarket that night. Hmm, not sure what evidence would contradict that. Let's check others.\n\nTestimony 1: He claims he must have dropped his cell phone on the way back. But Evidence 5 is the cell phone found under a car in the Meraktis Clinic garage. If he dropped it on his way back from the supermarket, why was it found in the clinic's garage? Maybe the location is different. But the testimony doesn't specify where \"on the way back\" was. Not sure yet.\n\nTestimony 2: He says he was walking through the park and witnessed the crime. The park might be People Park, where Alita was encountered. But the crime scene is the Meraktis Clinic? Or the noodle stand? The victim died pulling the noodle stand, which is probably at the crime scene. Let me check the map in Evidence 1. The map shows around Wright's office, but not sure about the park's location relative to the clinic. Maybe if the crime happened near the park, but the evidence locations are elsewhere.\n\nTestimony 3: He claims he saw the killer, victim, stand clearly. The stand's sign according to Testimony 4 says \"NOODLE\". But Evidence 12 (Noodle Stand) has a sign that reads \"ELDOON\". Wait, that's a contradiction! The testimony says the sign said \"NOODLE\", but the actual stand's sign is \"ELDOON\". So Testimony 4 is stating the sign said \"NOODLE\", but Evidence 12 says the sign is \"ELDOON\". That's a direct contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 4 is contradicted by Evidence 12. \n\nSo the evidence is 12 (Noodle Stand) and testimony is 4. Let me confirm. Yes, Testimony 4: \"It said 'NOODLE'\" vs. Evidence 12's sign reading \"ELDOON\". Definitely a contradiction. That would mean Stickler is lying about what he saw, which undermines his credibility.\n"

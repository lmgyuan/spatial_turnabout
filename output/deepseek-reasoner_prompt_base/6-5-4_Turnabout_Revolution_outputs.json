    },
    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through the testimonies and evidences one by one.\n\nFirst, the testimonies are all from Dhurke. Let me look at each one. Testimony 0 says he was struck by dizziness upon entering the tomb. Testimony 1 mentions he found himself with a bloody knife. Testimony 2 claims there was probably no third party in the tomb. Testimony 3 says he saw Inga dead in front of him. Testimony 4 is that he doesn't remember what happened in between. Testimony 5 states he has no motive because he's for a bloodless revolution. Testimony 6 he denies killing Inga, and 7 admits there's no evidence he didn't.\n\nNow, looking at the evidences. Let's check each for contradictions. The key is to find evidence that directly contradicts one of Dhurke's statements.\n\nEvidence 19 is the Pink Butterfly Pendant. It says the pendant is stained with the victim's blood and actually belongs to Amara. But wait, Dhurke's testimony 6 says he didn't kill Inga. However, the pendant being his and having blood might link him to the murder. Wait, the evidence says it's Amara's, though. Maybe not directly.\n\nEvidence 20 is a bloodstain from Amara's Tomb, which is Dhurke's blood. If Dhurke was there and his blood is present, but he claims not to have killed Inga. But his own testimony says he was there and found the body. So maybe that's not a contradiction.\n\nEvidence 23 is a photo of Dhurke and Amara 23 years ago. The caption mentions a Defiant Dragons logo on a book. If Dhurke's group was active back then, maybe his motive could be connected, but he says he has no motive. Hmm. Not sure if that's a direct contradiction.\n\nEvidence 15 is Inga's autopsy report: stabbed from behind, died around 3 PM. Testimony 3 says Dhurke found Inga dead. But how does that contradict? The time of death could be relevant. If there's evidence that someone else was present around that time, but Dhurke says no third party (Testimony 2). Wait, Testimony 2 says there was probably no third party. But if other evidence suggests a third party was present, that would contradict.\n\nLooking at Evidence 25: Ahlbi's Statement. At around 2 PM, Shah'do was startled by a firecracker, leading to Nayna losing her hat. If Inga died at 3 PM, but Ahlbi's statement is about 2 PM. Not directly related to the tomb.\n\nEvidence 24 is a Channeling Photo taken around 2 PM. If Inga died at 3 PM, maybe that's a timeline. But Dhurke's testimony about being in the tomb and the time of death. Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 15) says Inga died around 3 PM. Dhurke's Testimony 0 says he entered the tomb and got dizzy. If the murder happened at 3 PM, and Dhurke was there, but he claims no memory. However, if other evidence shows someone else was present, that would contradict Testimony 2.\n\nWait, Evidence 25's statement might relate to Nayna's movements. If Nayna was in the courtyard at 2 PM, but if she was involved in the murder at 3 PM, maybe. But how does that link to Dhurke's testimony? His Testimony 2 says no third party. If there's evidence someone else was there, like Nayna (Character 16, 31), who disappeared after Inga's death. But Evidence 25 says Shah'do spooked Nayna at 2 PM, so she was present then. If Inga died at 3 PM, maybe she could have been there. But Dhurke's testimony says no third party. So if Nayna was present, that's a contradiction. But where's the evidence?\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 19: the pendant is Amara's, but found at the scene. If Dhurke had it, but he didn't mention that. Not sure.\n\nWait, Evidence 20 is Dhurke's bloodstain. If he was injured, maybe that's why he had blood, but he said he found the body with a knife. If his blood is there, but he didn't mention being injured. Wait, but his testimony 0 says he was dizzy, maybe implying he was attacked. But the bloodstain is his, which might indicate he was there before. Hmm, but how does that contradict his testimony?\n\nWait, Testimony 2: Dhurke says no third party. If there's evidence that someone else was present, like Nayna (since her hat was taken by Shah'do), but that's at 2 PM. The murder was at 3 PM. Maybe not directly. Alternatively, Evidence 18 is a gemstone (Inga's button) in the incense burner. If someone else took it there, that could imply a third party. But Dhurke's Testimony 2 says no third party. So if the button was moved by someone else, that's a contradiction. But how is that linked?\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 23 (the photo with the Defiant Dragons book) might indicate that Amara was connected to the Defiant Dragons 23 years ago. If Dhurke's group is the Defiant Dragons, and Amara was part of it, maybe there's a motive. But Dhurke in Testimony 5 says he has no motive because they want a bloodless revolution. If Amara was his ally, but Inga was the Minister of Justice, maybe there's a motive. But this is more about motive than direct contradiction.\n\nWait, Testimony 5: Dhurke says he has no motive. But if Evidence 23 shows Amara with Defiant Dragons, and Inga was against them, perhaps Dhurke had a motive to kill Inga. So that would contradict his testimony. But the question is about a contradiction between evidence and testimony. So if the evidence shows a possible motive that Dhurke denies, then Evidence 23 contradicts Testimony 5. That could be a pair.\n\nBut let me check: Testimony 5: \"I don't have a motive for killing Inga. After all, me and my ilk seek a bloodless revolution.\" Evidence 23: Photo showing Amara (the previous queen) with Dhurke, and a book with Defiant Dragons logo. If Amara was part of the Defiant Dragons, then Inga (as Minister of Justice) might be opposing them. So Dhurke could have a motive to eliminate Inga. Therefore, Evidence 23 contradicts Testimony 5, implying Dhurke does have a motive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Evidence 19 (the pendant) being stained with blood and belonging to Amara. If Amara was channeled by someone, or if Dhurke had her pendant, maybe linking him to the crime. But Dhurke's testimony is that he didn't kill Inga, but if his pendant is there with blood, that's evidence against him. Wait, the evidence says the pendant is Amara's but stained with the victim's blood. So if Amara's pendant is at the scene, perhaps indicating she was there. But how does that contradict Dhurke's testimony? Unless Amara was channeled, but Ga'ran is the current queen who can channel. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 15: Inga's time of death is 3 PM. Testimony 3 says Dhurke found Inga dead. If the Channeling Photo (Evidence 24) was taken at 2 PM, showing a channeling rite, perhaps involving someone else. But not sure.\n\nWait, another angle. Testimony 2: Dhurke claims no third party was present. But Evidence 25 (Ahlbi's statement) says that at 2 PM, Shah'do spooked Nayna, causing her hat to be stolen. If Nayna was present in the area, perhaps she was in the tomb later. But the time of death is 3 PM. If Nayna disappeared after Inga's death (Evidence 16/31), maybe she was involved. Therefore, her presence would contradict Dhurke's Testimony 2. But how is that evidenced? The link is through Ahlbi's statement (Evidence 25) that Nayna was in the courtyard at 2 PM, and she later disappeared. If she was in the tomb at 3 PM, then she's a third party. So Testimony 2 says no third party, but Evidence 25 suggests Nayna was around. But that's a stretch since the time difference is an hour. Alternatively, maybe another evidence.\n\nWait, Evidence 19: the pendant is Amara's. If Amara was channeled by someone (like Ga'ran), and she was present, but Dhurke didn't mention that. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 20: bloodstain is Dhurke's. If he was injured and left blood, but he didn't mention being injured. His Testimony 0 says he felt dizzy upon entering, maybe implying he was attacked, but he didn't mention any injury. The bloodstain could indicate he was hurt, which he didn't explain, but his testimony 4 says he doesn't remember. So maybe not a direct contradiction.\n\nWait, going back. The key contradiction would be where evidence directly shows that something Dhurke said is false. For example, Testimony 2: \"The possibility of a third party being there in the tomb is probably nonexistent.\" If there's evidence that a third party was there, that would contradict.\n\nEvidence 18: Gemstone (Inga's button) found in the incense burner. If Inga was stabbed from behind (Evidence 15), maybe the button came off during a struggle. If the button was found in the incense burner, which is ashes, perhaps someone tried to hide it. If Dhurke didn't do that, then a third party might have. So if the button was moved, then a third party was present, contradicting Testimony 2. But how to link that? The gemstone is Inga's button, found in the ashes. If Dhurke killed Inga, he might have left the button there, but if someone else moved it, that's a third party. However, this requires assuming that Dhurke wouldn't have moved the button. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 25: Ahlbi's statement about Shah'do causing Nayna to lose her hat at 2 PM. If Nayna was present, and later at 3 PM, the time of Inga's death, she could have been in the tomb. If so, then Dhurke's Testimony 2 is false because Nayna was a third party. But the timing is an hour apart. Not sure if that's enough.\n\nWait, let's look at Evidence 23 again: the photo shows Amara holding a baby, with a Defiant Dragons book in the background. This implies that Amara was connected to the Defiant Dragons. If Dhurke is their leader, this could mean he had a motive related to Amara. So if Inga was against the Defiant Dragons, Dhurke might want to eliminate him. Thus, contradicting Testimony 5 where Dhurke claims no motive. So Evidence 23 contradicts Testimony 5. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 19 (the pendant) is stained with the victim's blood and belongs to Amara. If Amara was channeled by Ga'ran, but that's not clear. If the pendant was at the scene, maybe Amara (or someone channeling her) was present, making Dhurke's Testimony 2 about no third party incorrect. But this is speculative.\n\nWait, the key is to find a direct contradiction. Let's think of Testimony 2: no third party. If there's evidence that someone else was in the tomb, that would contradict. Evidence 18: Inga's button in the incense burner. If the killer moved the button there, but if Dhurke did it, that's possible. But if the button was moved after the murder, maybe by someone else. Alternatively, the Mysterious Bloodstain (Evidence 20) is Dhurke's blood. If he was there and bled, but he says he doesn't remember. But that's not a direct contradiction.\n\nWait, another angle. Testimony 3: Dhurke says he found Inga dead in front of him. But the autopsy report (Evidence 15) says Inga was stabbed from behind. If Dhurke found him lying dead, but the wound is from behind, that implies the attacker was behind Inga. If Dhurke was in front, maybe he couldn't have stabbed him from behind. Wait, but if Inga was stabbed from behind, then the attacker was behind him. So if Dhurke found Inga lying dead, and he had the knife, but the stab came from behind, maybe he couldn't have done it unless he attacked from behind. But if he was in front, then someone else did it. So perhaps the contradiction is between the stab wound's location (from behind) and Dhurke's presence in front. But how does that tie to evidence?\n\nWait, the autopsy report (Evidence 15) says Inga was stabbed from behind. Testimony 3 says Dhurke was standing over the body. If Dhurke was in front, then he couldn't have stabbed from behind, implying someone else did it. But Dhurke's testimony 2 says there was no third party. So if the evidence shows the stab was from behind, but Dhurke was in front, then the killer must have been someone else, contradicting his statement that there was no third party. Therefore, Evidence 15 (autopsy report) contradicts Testimony 2 (no third party).\n\nWait, but Testimony 2 is Dhurke's claim that no third party was present. If the stab came from behind, and Dhurke was in front, then the actual attacker would have to be behind Inga. Therefore, unless Dhurke moved around, which he doesn't mention, the attacker would be a third party. Thus, the autopsy report (Evidence 15) showing the stab from behind contradicts Dhurke's Testimony 2 that there was no third party.\n\nSo the contradiction is Evidence 15 (autopsy report stating Inga was stabbed from behind) and Testimony 2 (Dhurke claiming no third party). Because if Dhurke was the only one there, he would have had to stab Inga from behind, but he found himself in front of the body with the knife. The positioning doesn't add up unless there was someone else.\n"

    },
    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair. Let me start by going through the testimonies and the evidences to spot inconsistencies.\n\nFirst, looking at the testimonies. Testimony 3 from Rayfa says she had been gazing at the courtyard since about 2 PM and only saw her father (Inga) enter the tomb. She didn't see anyone else go in or out after that. The key point here is that Rayfa claims she didn't see anyone else entering or exiting the tomb after her father went in around 2:30 PM.\n\nNow, checking the evidences. Let's see if any evidence suggests someone else was present in the tomb around that time. Evidence 25 is Ahlbi's Statement, which mentions that around 2 PM, Shah'do (the dog) was startled by a firecracker, ran into the courtyard, spooked Nayna, and stole her hat. Wait, but that's at 2 PM, before Inga went to the tomb. Maybe not directly related.\n\nLooking at Evidence 23: Woman's Photo. The caption mentions a photo from 23 years ago showing Amara holding a baby, with a Defiant Dragons logo on a book in the background. Hmm, not sure how that connects.\n\nEvidence 19 is the Pink Butterfly Pendant, which is a locket found at the crime scene, actually belonging to Amara. If the pendant was found there, maybe Amara was present? But how does that contradict the testimony?\n\nWait, there's Evidence 24: Channeling Photo, a picture taken around 2 PM of the channeling rite. If there was a channeling happening at 2 PM, maybe someone was channeled. Also, Evidence 24's time is around 2 PM, same as Ahlbi's statement.\n\nWait, the testimony says Rayfa saw her father heading to the tomb at 2:30 PM. Then Testimony 5 says she saw no one else enter or exit after that. But Inga's autopsy report (Evidence 15) states time of death around 3 PM. So he was killed after entering the tomb. But if no one else entered or exited, how was he killed?\n\nBut maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let's check the evidence related to someone else being present. Evidence 25 (Ahlbi's Statement) mentions that around 2 PM, Shah'do ran into the courtyard and spooked Nayna. If Nayna was there, but Rayfa didn't mention seeing her... Wait, Testimony 3 says Rayfa was watching since 2 PM and only saw her father. But if Nayna was in the courtyard around 2 PM (as per Ahlbi's statement), then Rayfa's testimony that she saw no one else would contradict that. Because according to Ahlbi, Nayna was there. But wait, Testimony 3 is about people entering or exiting the tomb, not the courtyard. So maybe that's not the contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 25's time is around 2 PM, and Testimony 3 starts at 2 PM. If Rayfa says she was watching from 2 PM and saw only her father, but Ahlbi's statement says Shah'do spooked Nayna in the courtyard around 2 PM, which Rayfa should have seen. But the testimony says she only saw her father. So that would mean Rayfa didn't mention seeing Nayna or the dog, which could be a contradiction. But Evidence 25 is a testimony from Ahlbi, not physical evidence. Wait, the user asked for evidence and testimony contradiction. So if a piece of evidence (like a photo or document) contradicts a testimony.\n\nWait, Evidence 24 is a Channeling Photo taken around 2 PM. If that photo shows someone else in the tomb area, that would contradict Rayfa's Testimony 3 that she didn't see anyone else. Let me check Evidence 24's description: \"A picture taken at around 2 PM of the channeling rite.\" If the photo shows someone else at the tomb around 2 PM, but Rayfa says she didn't see anyone else, that's a contradiction. But the problem is the testimonies: Testimony 3 is about Rayfa watching from 2 PM onward and only seeing her father. If the photo shows that someone else was present at 2 PM, then Rayfa's testimony that she didn't see anyone else (since 2 PM) would be contradicted.\n\nBut Evidence 24 is a photo of the channeling rite. If the channeling rite involved someone else, like Amara being channeled, maybe that person was present. But Rayfa's testimony is about seeing people entering or exiting the tomb. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the channeling photo shows that someone else was present in the tomb area at 2 PM, which Rayfa didn't report.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Evidence 19 again. The Pink Butterfly Pendant is found at the crime scene, which actually belongs to Amara. If Amara was there, but Rayfa didn't see her, that could be a contradiction. But how? Unless the pendant implies that Amara was channeled into the tomb, but Rayfa's testimony didn't mention that.\n\nWait, Testimony 1: Rayfa saw her father go to the tomb at 2:30 PM. Testimony 5: No one else entered or exited after that. But if the autopsy report says time of death around 3 PM, then the killer must have been inside the tomb already. But how did they get in? Unless they were already there before Inga entered. But Rayfa's Testimony 3 says she was watching since 2 PM and only saw her father. So if someone else was already in the tomb before 2:30 PM, then Rayfa should have seen them entering. Unless they entered earlier. Wait, but Testimony 3 says she was watching since 2 PM and only saw her father. So if someone else entered the tomb before 2 PM, Rayfa wouldn't have seen them. But the murder happened at 3 PM. The killer would have to be inside the tomb already. But according to Testimony 5, Rayfa didn't see anyone else enter after her father, meaning the killer couldn't have entered after 2:30 PM. So the killer must have been inside before Inga arrived. But if the killer was already inside, how did they get there? Unless they were there before 2 PM.\n\nBut looking for contradictions between evidence and testimony. Let's see. Evidence 23 is a photo from 23 years ago, showing Amara with a baby and a book with the Defiant Dragons logo. The Defiant Dragons were active then, which might indicate that Amara was connected to them. If that's the case, but Ga'ran is the current queen who might have suppressed the Defiant Dragons, but that's more backstory.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 3 says Rayfa saw no one else entering the tomb since 2 PM. But Evidence 25 (Ahlbi's Statement) mentions that around 2 PM, Shah'do ran into the courtyard and caused a commotion with Nayna. If Nayna was in the courtyard, then Rayfa should have seen her, but Testimony 3 says she only saw her father. Wait, but Testimony 3 is about the courtyard? Let me check Testimony 0: Rayfa was gazing upon the courtyard from her veranda. Testimony 3 says she had been gazing since about 2 PM and only saw her father. So if Nayna was in the courtyard around 2 PM, Rayfa should have seen her, but according to her testimony, she didn't. However, Ahlbi's statement (Evidence 25) is about Shah'do spooking Nayna in the courtyard at around 2 PM, which would mean Nayna was present there. That would contradict Rayfa's Testimony 3 where she claims she saw only her father. So Evidence 25 (Ahlbi's Statement) contradicts Testimony 3 (Rayfa's claim of seeing only her father). But Evidence 25 is a statement, which is a testimony from Ahlbi. The user might consider testimonies as separate from evidence. Wait, the problem says \"evidences and testimonies\" are separate. So Evidence 25 is a piece of evidence (Ahlbi's Statement) that contradicts Rayfa's Testimony 3. So that would be the pair: Evidence 25 and Testimony 3.\n\nBut the user might want a different pair. Let me check again. The question is to find which evidence and testimony contradict. The answer should be one pair. Let me verify:\n\nTestimony 3: Rayfa says she was watching from 2 PM and only saw her father (Inga) entering the tomb. She saw no one else. \n\nEvidence 25: Ahlbi's Statement says that around 2 PM, Shah'do (the dog) ran into the courtyard, spooked Nayna, and stole her hat. So if this happened in the courtyard at around 2 PM, Rayfa, who was watching the courtyard, should have seen this. But her testimony says she only saw her father. Therefore, Evidence 25 contradicts Testimony 3 because Ahlbi's account suggests Nayna was in the courtyard around 2 PM, which Rayfa did not report seeing. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 25 and Testimony 3.\n"

    },
    "cot": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. They provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.\n\nFirst, I'll start by reviewing the testimonies to understand their claims. Testimony 3 from Nayna states: \"After Queen Amara's passing, Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran is the only spirit medium left.\" So according to this testimony, Ga'ran is the sole remaining spirit medium after Amara's death.\n\nNow, I need to check the evidences to see if any of them contradict this statement. Let's look through the evidence list. \n\nEvidence 23 is a photo described as showing Dhurke and Amara about 23 years ago, with Amara holding a baby. The caption mentions that one of the books in the background has the Defiant Dragons logo. The key point here is that the Defiant Dragons were formed after Amara's assassination. Wait, but if the photo is from 23 years ago and shows the Defiant Dragons' logo, that suggests the group existed before Amara's assassination. That might not directly relate to the testimony about spirit mediums, though.\n\nLooking further, Evidence 19 is the Pink Butterfly Pendant, which is a locket belonging to Amara. Evidence 20 is a bloodstain from Amara's Tomb that's Dhurke's blood. Not directly related to the testimony. \n\nEvidence 24 is a Channeling Photo taken around 2 PM. Evidence 25 is Ahlbi's statement about Shah'do spooking Nayna. Hmm. \n\nWait, the testimony claims Ga'ran is the only medium left. But if there's evidence showing another medium, that would contradict it. Let me check the evidence again. \n\nEvidence 1 is the Founder's Orb, which mentions that only the queen knows the founder's real name. Evidence 23: the photo of Dhurke and Amara, with the Defiant Dragons logo on a book. But the Defiant Dragons formed after Amara's assassination. Wait, the photo is from 23 years ago, which is before Amara's assassination. So the Defiant Dragons' logo being present in a book from that time would mean the group existed earlier, which contradicts the statement that they formed after her assassination. But how does this relate to the testimony?\n\nWait, the testimony in question is about Ga'ran being the only spirit medium left. But if there's evidence that Amara was alive when the Defiant Dragons were formed, maybe that's a different contradiction. Alternatively, maybe Evidence 24 (Channeling Photo) shows someone else channeling. Let me check Evidence 24: \"A picture taken at around 2 PM of the channeling rite.\" If the channeling photo shows Maya Fey or someone else performing a channeling after Amara's death, that would contradict Nayna's testimony that Ga'ran is the only medium left. But according to the description of Evidence 24, it's just a photo of the channeling rite. Without more info, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, Evidence 26 is Amara's Assassination File. If that file indicates that Amara was actually alive after her supposed assassination, that could mean she's still a spirit medium, contradicting the testimony. But the testimony says after Amara's passing, so if Amara is dead, then Ga'ran is the only one. However, perhaps another medium exists. For example, Maya Fey is a spirit medium in training. But the testimony says \"here in Khura'in,\" so maybe Maya is from Kurain Village, which is different. Wait, the testimony says \"Only members of the royal family can learn the art of spirit channeling here in Khura'in.\" So Maya, being from Kurain, might not count if she's not part of the Khura'in royalty. But the testimony also says that if you think a medium is the culprit, it would have to be Maya Fey (Testimony 4). That seems conflicting, but let's focus on Testimony 3.\n\nWait, Testimony 3 says after Amara's death, Ga'ran is the only medium left. However, Evidence 23's photo shows Amara holding a baby 23 years ago, and the Defiant Dragons formed after her assassination. If Amara was assassinated, then she's dead. But maybe Amara is still alive? Let me check. Evidence 19 mentions a locket belonging to Amara, found at the crime scene. Evidence 20 is Dhurke's blood. Evidence 26 is the assassination file. If Amara was assassinated, but the photo in Evidence 23 is from 23 years ago, and the Defiant Dragons formed after her assassination, that might not directly contradict the testimony. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps Evidence 24 (Channeling Photo) shows someone else channeling. Let me check the time: the photo was taken around 2 PM. If the channeling was done by someone other than Ga'ran after Amara's death, that would contradict Testimony 3. For example, if the photo shows Maya Fey channeling, but the testimony says only Ga'ran can do it. But the testimonies mention that Maya Fey is a possible culprit (Testimony 4), implying she can channel. But Testimony 2 says only royal family members can learn channeling in Khura'in. Maya is from Kurain, so perhaps she's an exception. However, the testimony in question (Testimony 3) says Ga'ran is the only one left. If Maya can channel, then Testimony 3 is contradicted. But the problem is that Maya is from Kurain, not Khura'in's royal family. \n\nWait, but Evidence 27: Dhurke's Law Book, which establishes the Defense Culpability Act in the queen's name. Not directly related. \n\nLooking back at Evidence 23: The photo shows Amara holding a baby, and a book with the Defiant Dragons logo. The Defiant Dragons were formed after Amara's assassination. But the photo is from 23 years ago, which would mean that the Defiant Dragons existed before Amara's assassination, which contradicts the statement that they formed after. So that's a contradiction between Evidence 23 and the description of the Defiant Dragons. But how does that relate to the testimonies? Wait, the user is asking for a contradiction between evidence and testimony, not evidence and another evidence's description. \n\nWait, the testimonies are from Nayna. Testimony 3: After Queen Amara's passing, Ga'ran is the only spirit medium left. If Evidence 23 shows that Amara was alive 23 years ago and the Defiant Dragons (formed after her assassination) have a logo in the photo, that would imply that Amara was alive when the Defiant Dragons existed. But if the Defiant Dragons were formed after her assassination, then the presence of their logo in a photo from 23 years ago (when Amara was alive) is a contradiction. However, this is a contradiction within the evidence itself, not between evidence and testimony.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Evidence 24 (Channeling Photo) shows a channeling that occurred after Amara's death, performed by someone other than Ga'ran. For example, if the photo shows Amara being channeled, that would mean someone else (like Maya) did it, contradicting the testimony. But without more info on the photo's content, it's hard to say. \n\nWait, looking at the characters list, Character 12 is Maya Fey, who is training in Khura'in and can channel the dead. Character 27 (from Phoenix's perspective) also mentions Maya can channel. So Maya's existence as a spirit medium in Khura'in would contradict Nayna's Testimony 3, which says Ga'ran is the only medium left. However, the testimony says \"here in Khura'in,\" and Maya is from Kurain but training there. But the testimony says \"only members of the royal family can learn\" in Khura'in. So if Maya is a foreigner, perhaps she's an exception, but according to Testimony 4, Nayna suggests Maya could be the culprit if a medium is involved. So that implies Maya is considered a possible medium in Khura'in, which would mean Ga'ran isn't the only one. Hence, Testimony 3 is contradicted by the existence of Maya as a medium in Khura'in. But how does the evidence come into play here?\n\nThe evidence that would support Maya being a medium is perhaps her character descriptions (Characters 12 and 27), but the user is asking for evidence from the Evidences list. Let's check the evidences again. Evidence 24 is a Channeling Photo taken around 2 PM. If that photo shows Maya channeling, then it directly contradicts Testimony 3. But the evidence description doesn't specify who is in the photo. However, Evidence 25 is Ahlbi's statement about Shah'do spooking Nayna and stealing her hat at around 2 PM. The timing coincides with the photo in Evidence 24. If the channeling photo is of Maya performing a channeling at 2 PM, that would mean she did it, contradicting Testimony 3. But the evidence description doesn't specify. Alternatively, perhaps the Channeling Photo (Evidence 24) is of Ga'ran, which wouldn't contradict. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider Evidence 19: the Pink Butterfly Pendant, which is actually Amara's. If Amara is dead, but her pendant is found, perhaps that's not a contradiction. \n\nWait, Evidence 26 is Amara's Assassination File, which would confirm she's dead. So Testimony 3 says after her death, only Ga'ran is left. But if there's evidence that someone else can channel, like Maya, then that contradicts. But the evidence needed is from the Evidences list. \n\nLooking at Evidence 24 again: the Channeling Photo. If this photo shows a channeling that occurred after Amara's death (which it does, as the time of the photo is around 2 PM, and Inga's autopsy report (Evidence 15) states he died at 3 PM. Wait, Inga's time of death is 3 PM, and the channeling photo is at 2 PM. But the assassination of Amara happened in the past. So if the photo is recent and shows a channeling by someone other than Ga'ran, that would contradict Testimony 3. But without knowing who is in the photo, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, Evidence 23: the Woman's Photo. The caption says Amara is holding a baby, and one of the books has the Defiant Dragons logo. The Defiant Dragons were formed after Amara's assassination, but the photo is from 23 years ago. This is a contradiction because if the Defiant Dragons formed after her death, the logo shouldn't be present in a photo taken before her death. However, the testimony in question is about spirit mediums, not the Defiant Dragons. So this might not be the right pair. \n\nWait, another angle: Testimony 3 claims Ga'ran is the only medium left after Amara's death. Evidence 19 is the Pink Butterfly Pendant, which is a locket belonging to Amara. If Amara's spirit is channeled by someone else, that would imply another medium exists. But the pendant itself doesn't indicate that. \n\nWait, Evidence 24: the Channeling Photo. If the photo was taken at 2 PM on the day of Inga's death (which is at 3 PM), and if the channeling was performed by someone other than Ga'ran (like Maya), that would contradict the testimony. But how do we know who is in the photo? The user might expect that the photo shows Amara's channeling, which would require a medium. But if Amara is dead, then someone must have channeled her. If the photo shows Amara being channeled, then the medium could be Ga'ran, which doesn't contradict. Alternatively, if it's someone else, like Maya, then it does. But without explicit info, this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, Evidence 3: Study Photo. Atishon saw Datz fleeing the scene. The book stained with coffee. Not related. \n\nEvidence 5: Research Notes on the Song of Ceremony and the box containing the Founder's Orb. Maybe related to the Founder's Orb's secrets, but not directly to mediums. \n\nWait, Evidence 1: Founder's Orb. Heating it revealed a statue, and only the queen knows the founder's real name. If the queen (Ga'ran) is the only one who knows, but the Founder's Orb's secret is known by someone else, that might contradict. Not directly related to the testimony. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. The testimony is Nayna stating that after Amara's death, only Ga'ran is left as a medium. The contradiction would be evidence showing that another medium exists. \n\nLooking at the characters, Maya Fey (Character 12 and 27) is a spirit medium in Khura'in. But according to Testimony 2, only royal family members can learn channeling there. However, Maya is from Kurain, not Khura'in royalty, but she's training there. So perhaps she's an exception. If there's evidence that Maya can channel, that would contradict Testimony 3. But where is that evidence? \n\nThe evidences list includes Evidence 24: Channeling Photo. If that photo shows Maya channeling, then it's a contradiction. But the evidence description doesn't specify. However, if we consider that the photo is part of the case, and in the game's context, perhaps the photo is of Maya channeling Amara. If so, then that would mean Maya is a medium in Khura'in, contradicting Testimony 3. \n\nBut since the user hasn't provided explicit details beyond the evidence descriptions, I need to rely on the given info. The evidence's description for Evidence 24 is just a photo of the channeling rite. Without more info, it's hard to confirm. \n\nWait, looking back at Evidence 23: the Woman's Photo (Amara holding a baby) with the Defiant Dragons logo in the background. The Defiant Dragons were formed after Amara's assassination, but the photo is from 23 years ago, implying the group existed before her death. This contradicts the established fact that the Defiant Dragons formed after her assassination. However, this contradiction is between Evidence 23 and the character description of Dhurke (Character 4 and 23), which states he's the leader of the Defiant Dragons formed after Amara's assassination. Therefore, Evidence 23 contradicts the character's backstory, which would imply that the Defiant Dragons existed before Amara's death. But how does this relate to the testimonies?\n\nThe testimony in question (Testimony 3) is about mediums, not the Defiant Dragons. So perhaps this isn't the right pair. \n\nAlternatively, Evidence 19: the Pink Butterfly Pendant is actually Amara's, but it's stained with the victim's blood. If Amara is dead, how is her pendant at the crime scene? Perhaps it was channeled, implying someone channeled her. But the testimony says Ga'ran is the only medium. So if the pendant is present, maybe Ga'ran channeled Amara, which doesn't contradict. Alternatively, if someone else did, like Maya, then it's a contradiction. But the evidence alone doesn't specify who channeled her. \n\nWait, another angle. Testimony 3 says Ga'ran is the only medium left after Amara's death. Evidence 24 is a Channeling Photo taken at around 2 PM. If the channeling was of Amara, then the medium must be Ga'ran. But if the photo shows someone else channeling, like Maya, that's a contradiction. However, without explicit info, this is a stretch. \n\nWait, Evidence 26: Amara's Assassination File. If this file reveals that Amara wasn't actually assassinated, then she might still be alive, making her a living medium, contradicting Testimony 3. But the testimony says \"after Queen Amara's passing,\" so if Amara is alive, the testimony is false. However, the evidence description doesn't state that Amara survived; it's just a file about her assassination. \n\nAlternatively, Evidence 18: Gemstone, which is Inga's button found in ashes. Not directly relevant. \n\nHmm. Let's approach this systematically. The key is to find a testimony that makes a claim that is directly contradicted by a piece of evidence. \n\nTestimony 3: After Amara's death, only Ga'ran is a medium. \n\nIf there's evidence that another medium exists, like Maya, then that's a contradiction. But where is that evidence? The characters mention Maya can channel, but the evidence needed is from the list. \n\nEvidence 24: Channeling Photo. If this photo is of Maya channeling, then it's a contradiction. But the evidence description doesn't say that. However, considering the context of the game (if this is from Ace Attorney), the Channeling Photo might involve Maya. But without explicit info, I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, Evidence 23: the photo showing Amara holding a baby, with the Defiant Dragons' logo. If the Defiant Dragons formed after her death, but the photo is from 23 years ago (when she was alive), that implies the group existed before, which contradicts their formation timing. But this contradiction is between evidence and character backstory, not testimony. \n\nWait, another thought: Testimony 3 says Ga'ran is the only medium left. But Evidence 19's pendant is Amara's, and if Amara's spirit was channeled, then a medium must have done it. If the channeling happened after Amara's death, and the medium was someone other than Ga'ran, like Maya, then that contradicts the testimony. But the pendant's presence doesn't confirm channeling. \n\nWait, Evidence 20: Mysterious Bloodstain from Dhurke. Not directly related. \n\nEvidence 25: Ahlbi's Statement about Shah'do spooking Nayna. This might relate to the channeling photo's timing, but not directly to mediums. \n\nAt this point, I might be overcomplicating. Let's focus on the most direct contradiction. Testimony 3 claims Ga'ran is the only medium after Amara's death. Evidence 23's photo shows Amara holding a baby, and a book with the Defiant Dragons' logo. The Defiant Dragons were formed after Amara's assassination. However, the photo is from 23 years ago, which would be before Amara's assassination. This suggests the Defiant Dragons existed before her death, contradicting their formation story. But how does this relate to the testimony? \n\nAlternatively, the photo in Evidence 23 shows Amara alive, and if the Defiant Dragons were formed after her death, then their logo in the photo (from before her death) is a contradiction. But again, not directly related to the testimony about mediums. \n\nWait, maybe the key is in the Defiant Dragons' logo. The photo shows a book with their logo from 23 years ago. If the Defiant Dragons were formed after Amara's assassination, which happened, say, 20 years ago, then the logo existing 23 years ago is impossible. So this evidence contradicts the established backstory of the Defiant Dragons. However, the testimony in question is about mediums, not the Defiant Dragons. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct pair is Evidence 23 and Testimony 3. Wait, no. Testimony 3 is about mediums. The contradiction would be if Evidence 23 shows that Amara was alive after her supposed death, but that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, Evidence 24's Channeling Photo and Testimony 3. If the photo shows a channeling by someone other than Ga'ran after Amara's death, then it's a contradiction. But without knowing who is in the photo, this is speculative. \n\nWait, looking at the testimonies again: Testimony 4 from Nayna says, \"If you believe a medium to be the culprit, it would have to be that young lass Maya Fey.\" This implies that Maya is a medium in Khura'in, which would contradict Testimony 3 that says only Ga'ran is left. But Testimony 4 is a separate testimony. However, the user is asking for a pair of evidence and testimony. So if there's evidence that Maya is a medium, that would contradict Testimony 3. \n\nThe character descriptions for Maya (Character 12 and 27) state she can channel, but the user wants evidence from the Evidences list. \n\nEvidence 24: Channeling Photo. If this photo shows Maya channeling, then it's evidence contradicting Testimony 3. But the evidence description doesn't specify. However, considering the context of the game (if this is from \"Spirit of Justice\"), the channeling photo might be of Maya. In the game, Maya does channel someone during the case, which would mean she's a medium in Khura'in, thus contradicting Nayna's Testimony 3. \n\nTherefore, the pair would be Evidence 24 (Channeling Photo) and Testimony 3. But the evidence's description doesn't explicitly state that. However, in the game's context, this is likely the intended contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, Evidence 23's photo shows Amara alive with the Defiant Dragons' logo, which formed after her death, implying she was alive when they existed, contradicting their formation. But this doesn't relate to the testimony about mediums. \n\nAnother angle: Testimony 3 says Ga'ran is the only medium left. Evidence 1: Founder's Orb states that only the queen knows the founder's real name. If the queen is Ga'ran, but the Founder's Orb's secret is known by someone else (like Amara), that might imply another medium exists. But this is a stretch. \n\nHmm. The most logical contradiction based on the given data is between Evidence 23 (the photo showing the Defiant Dragons' logo before Amara's assassination) and the character description stating the Defiant Dragons formed after. But the user asks for evidence and testimony. \n\nWait, another thought: Testimony 3 says Ga'ran is the only medium left after Amara's death. However, Evidence 23's photo caption mentions that the Defiant Dragons were formed after Amara's assassination. But the photo is from 23 years ago, which would be before her assassination. If the Defiant Dragons formed after, then the logo in the photo is an anachronism. But this contradiction is between the evidence and the character's backstory, not testimony. \n\nPerhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the evidence list again for anything related to Amara being alive. \n\nEvidence 19: the Pink Butterfly Pendant is Amara's. If she's dead, her pendant could be in the tomb, but if the pendant was found elsewhere, maybe it was moved by someone. Not directly a contradiction. \n\nEvidence 20: Dhurke's bloodstain. Not related. \n\nEvidence 26: Amara's Assassination File. Confirms her death. \n\nEvidence 24: Channeling Photo. If this is of Amara being channeled, then the medium would have to be Ga'ran, per Testimony 3. But if the channeling is recent and the medium is someone else, that's a contradiction. \n\nIn the game, the channeling photo is likely of Amara being channeled by Maya, which would contradict Nayna's Testimony 3. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 24 (Channeling Photo) and Testimony 3. \n\nAlternatively, if the photo shows Ga'ran channeling, then no contradiction. But if it shows someone else, like Maya, then yes. \n\nGiven the game's storyline, in the case where this evidence and testimony appear, the contradiction is between the Channeling Photo (Evidence 24) showing Maya channeling Amara, thus proving that another medium exists, contradicting Testimony 3. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"evidence\": 24, \"testimony\": 3}.\n"

    },
    "cot": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair. Let's start by looking at the testimonies provided by Amara and the evidences listed.\n\nAmara has several testimonies. Testimony 3 says, \"Minister Inga was the sole victim. There was no other spirit to channel until he was dead.\" But looking at the evidence, there's Evidence 20: Mysterious Bloodstain, which is Dhurke's blood found in the tomb. If Dhurke's blood was there, that suggests he was injured or present at the scene. However, Dhurke's Corpse Photo (Evidence 29) states he was shot three times and died more than three days before. Wait, but Inga's time of death is 3 PM (Evidence 15). If Dhurke was already dead for three days, he couldn't have been there when Inga was killed. So how does his blood get there unless someone else brought it?\n\nBut Amara's testimony claims Inga was the sole victim, implying no one else died there. But if Dhurke's blood is present, maybe he was there before he died. Wait, but Dhurke's death time is more than three days prior. So if Inga died three days after Dhurke, then when Inga was killed, Dhurke was already dead. So the bloodstain from Dhurke would have to be from before his death. But how does that relate to Inga's murder?\n\nAlternatively, maybe Amara's testimony that Inga was the sole victim contradicts the fact that Dhurke's blood is found at the scene. But Dhurke's death was a separate incident. Wait, but Amara's testimony is about Inga's murder. If she says there was no other spirit to channel until Inga died, but Dhurke was already dead, so his spirit should have been available. But maybe the contradiction is that if Dhurke's blood was found at the tomb where Inga was killed, that suggests Dhurke was there, but he was already dead. Therefore, Amara's testimony that Inga was the sole victim (so no other deaths) is contradicted by the presence of Dhurke's blood, which would mean he was injured there, but his death occurred earlier. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, looking at Evidence 19: Pink Butterfly Pendant. It says it's a locket found at the crime scene, actually belongs to Amara, and is stained with the victim's blood. The victim here would be Inga. But if Amara's pendant is there, that connects her to the scene. However, her testimony claims she wasn't near the tomb after the murder. But if her pendant is found there, that contradicts her statement. Wait, let me check the testimonies again.\n\nTestimony 1: Amara says she wasn't anywhere near the tomb following the murder. But Evidence 19 is her pendant found at the crime scene. So that would directly contradict her testimony. So maybe Evidence 19 and Testimony 1?\n\nBut wait, Evidence 19 says the pendant is stained with the victim's blood (Inga's?), but the description says it's a locket found at the crime scene. So if Amara claims she wasn't there, but her pendant is found there, that's a contradiction. So that would pair Evidence 19 with Testimony 1.\n\nBut let me check other possibilities. Testimony 3: Inga was the sole victim. But Dhurke's blood (Evidence 20) is present. But Dhurke was killed three days prior, so his blood would have been there before Inga's death. But Amara's testimony about Inga being the sole victim might not directly contradict that, unless the bloodstain implies another victim. But Dhurke's death was separate, so maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 4: Amara says her husband Dhurke is the killer, but he has fled. But Evidence 29 shows Dhurke's corpse photo, meaning he was already dead. So if he was dead, he couldn't have fled. So that would be a contradiction between Testimony 4 and Evidence 29. Because if Dhurke was already dead for three days, he couldn't have killed Inga and then fled. So that's another possible contradiction.\n\nYes, that seems like a solid contradiction. Amara claims Dhurke is the killer and fled, but the autopsy report (Evidence 29) shows he died more than three days prior. Inga's time of death is 3 PM on the day in question. If Dhurke died three days before that, he couldn't have been alive to kill Inga and then flee. Therefore, Testimony 4 contradicts Evidence 29. So the pair would be Evidence 29 and Testimony 4.\n"

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies from what looks like a Phoenix Wright or Ace Attorney game scenario. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. They want just one pair in a JSON format.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The testimonies are from Amara, who is claiming that there's no evidence proving she killed Inga or that she was at the crime scene. The key here is to find evidence that directly places her at the scene or links her to the murder, thereby contradicting her statements.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, Testimony 3 states: \"There is nothing to prove I was even at the scene of the crime.\" So I need to find evidence that shows Amara was present at the crime scene.\n\nNow, looking through the evidence list. Let's see:\n\nEvidence 23: Woman's Photo. The description says it's a photo of Dhurke and Amara from 23 years ago. The caption mentions Amara holding a baby, and in the background, a book with the Defiant Dragons logo. But how does this relate to the crime scene?\n\nEvidence 19: Pink Butterfly Pendant. It's a pendant found at the crime scene, initially thought to belong to Dhurke but actually belongs to Amara. If this pendant was found at the crime scene, that directly places Amara there, contradicting her testimony that there's no proof she was there. The bloodstain on it is Dhurke's, but the pendant itself is hers. So her pendant being at the scene would mean she was present, right?\n\nBut wait, the pendant's description says it's stained with the victim's blood. The victim here is Inga, since the testimony is about his murder. Wait, Evidence 19: The pendant is stained with the victim's blood (Inga's?) and is a locket found at the crime scene. If Amara's pendant is there with Inga's blood, that directly links her to the murder. Then Testimony 3, which says she wasn't at the scene, is contradicted by her pendant being found there.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 20: Mysterious Bloodstain. It's Dhurke's blood, but that might not link Amara. Evidence 19 is more direct because the pendant belongs to her, so its presence at the scene proves she was there. So Evidence 19 contradicts Testimony 3.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 4 says Dhurke could have committed the crime while being channeled by Maya. But if there's evidence showing that Amara was channeled instead, but I don't see that. Let me check the other evidences.\n\nWait, Evidence 24: Channeling Photo taken around 2 PM. If the channeling was happening at 2 PM, and Inga's time of death is 3 PM (Evidence 15), maybe that's relevant. But how does that connect to Amara?\n\nWait, the main contradiction is Amara claiming she wasn't at the scene. The pendant (Evidence 19) is hers and was found there. So that's the contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 19 contradicts Testimony 3. But I need to check the exact wording. Testimony 3: \"There is nothing to prove I was even at the scene of the crime.\" The pendant is evidence that she was there. So that's the pair.\n"

    },
    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the task is to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies provided. The user wants just one pair, so I need to check each testimony against the evidence to see where there's a conflict.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the testimonies given by Nahyuta. There are six of them. Testimony 0 says he couldn't stay silent when the queen was suspected. Testimony 1 is him confessing to killing Inga. Testimony 2 says Inga had to die for Khura'in's future. Testimony 3 calls it divine judgment on someone who tried to assassinate the monarch. Testimony 4 mentions his mother covering for him. Testimony 5 talks about being reunited with his mother 15 years ago when Dhurke abducted her.\n\nNow, looking at the evidence. Let's go through each one. Evidence 19 is the Pink Butterfly Pendant, which is a locket found at the crime scene. It's supposed to belong to Amara, but it's stained with Dhurke's blood. Wait, but the autopsy report for Inga (Evidence 15) says he was stabbed from behind, time of death around 3 PM. Then there's the photo of Amara holding a baby with a Defiant Dragons book in the background (Evidence 23). That might relate to Testimony 5, where Nahyuta says Dhurke abducted Amara 15 years ago. But how does that conflict?\n\nTestimony 5 says Nahyuta was reunited with his mother 15 years ago when Dhurke abducted her. But Evidence 23 shows a photo from 23 years ago with Amara holding a baby and a Defiant Dragons book. The Defiant Dragons are led by Dhurke. Wait, if the photo is from 23 years ago, that's way before the 15 years mentioned in Testimony 5. So if the Defiant Dragons existed 23 years ago, but according to Nahyuta's testimony, the abduction happened 15 years ago, that might be a contradiction. Because the Defiant Dragons would have been active earlier, which could mean that Dhurke was already involved with Amara back then, maybe not as an abduction but something else. But how does that directly contradict the testimony?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 4 where Nahyuta says his mother was covering for him. If Queen Ga'ran is the current queen, but Amara is the previous queen, and Amara is his mother (since Testimony 5 says his mother is Queen Amara), then Ga'ran might not be his mother. But the testimonies mention \"Her Eminence\" which might refer to Ga'ran. Wait, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 1 is Nahyuta claiming he killed Inga. But looking at evidence related to Inga's murder. The autopsy report (Evidence 15) says time of death around 3 PM. The Tomb Crime Photo (17) shows stabbed with a knife. Then there's the Gemstone (18), which is Inga's button in the incense burner. The Pink Butterfly Pendant (19) is stained with Dhurke's blood. Also, Evidence 20 is a bloodstain that's Dhurke's. If Dhurke was dead more than three days (Evidence 29: Corpse Photo), then how could his blood be at the crime scene where Inga was killed? Wait, Inga's time of death is 3 PM, but Dhurke was already dead for more than three days. That's a problem. Because if Dhurke was dead, he couldn't have been there to leave blood. But the pendant is his, and the blood is his. So that would suggest that Dhurke was present at the scene, but he was already dead. Therefore, someone else must have used his pendant. But how does this relate to the testimonies?\n\nNahyuta's Testimony 1: \"I killed Inga.\" But if Dhurke's blood is at the scene, and he was dead before Inga's murder, then perhaps the real killer is someone else. So if Nahyuta is claiming he did it, but evidence shows Dhurke's blood there (which shouldn't be possible if Dhurke was already dead), that could be a contradiction. Wait, but Evidence 29 says Dhurke's corpse photo shows he was dead more than three days before the current time. The timeline here depends on when Inga was killed. If Inga died three days after Dhurke, then Dhurke's blood couldn't be there. So if Nahyuta says he killed Inga, but the evidence shows that Dhurke's blood (from a dead person) was present, that would mean Nahyuta's testimony is false. Because how could Dhurke's blood be there if he was already dead? Unless the blood was from before his death, but the bloodstain was wiped (Evidence 20) and found at the tomb, which is the crime scene. So if Dhurke was already dead, his blood at the scene would mean he couldn't have been there, so someone else must have brought the blood there. But the pendant (Evidence 19) is Amara's but has Dhurke's blood. Maybe this is a clue that Amara was involved, but she's the previous queen. Alternatively, the contradiction could be that Nahyuta claims he killed Inga, but the evidence points to Dhurke's involvement, who was already dead. Therefore, Nahyuta's confession is false because the evidence implicates someone else (or a dead person).\n\nWait, but in the testimony, Testimony 1 is Nahyuta confessing. If the evidence shows that Dhurke's blood is present at the crime scene, but Dhurke was already dead, then Nahyuta's confession is a lie. Because the real killer would have had to plant Dhurke's blood. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (Nahyuta's confession) and Evidence 20 (Dhurke's bloodstain), which suggests someone else was involved. But wait, the exact evidence is the Mysterious Bloodstain (20) which is Dhurke's blood. If Dhurke was dead before Inga's murder, then his blood couldn't be there unless it was planted. So if Nahyuta says he did it, but the bloodstain is from Dhurke, that's a contradiction because Dhurke was already dead. Therefore, Testimony 1 is contradicted by Evidence 20. But wait, Evidence 19 is the pendant with Dhurke's blood. Let me check: Evidence 19 says the pendant is stained with the victim's blood (Inga's?) but actually it's Amara's. Wait, no, the description says: \"Stained with the victim's blood. A locket found at the crime scene. It actually belongs to Amara.\" Wait, the victim here would be Inga, right? So the pendant has Inga's blood? Or Dhurke's? The description says \"Stained with the victim's blood. A locket found at the crime scene. It actually belongs to Amara.\" Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me read again. Evidence 19: \"Pink Butterfly Pendant... Stained with the victim's blood. A locket found at the crime scene. It actually belongs to Amara.\" Wait, but the victim here is Inga. So the pendant has Inga's blood but belongs to Amara. But Evidence 20 is a bloodstain that's Dhurke's. So if Dhurke was dead, his blood at the scene suggests that someone else brought it there. So if Nahyuta claims to have killed Inga, but the blood evidence points to Dhurke (who was dead), that's a contradiction. Therefore, the testimony (Testimony 1) is contradicted by Evidence 20 (Dhurke's bloodstain), because Dhurke couldn't have been there. Alternatively, Evidence 19's blood is Dhurke's. Let me check again: Evidence 19 says \"Stained with the victim's blood. A locket found at the crime scene. It actually belongs to Amara.\" Wait, maybe the victim here is Dhurke? But Inga is the victim of the murder in question. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify the evidence numbers:\n\nEvidence 19: Pink Butterfly Pendant... Stained with the victim's blood. A locket found at the crime scene. It actually belongs to Amara. So the victim here is Inga, since the crime scene is Inga's murder. So the pendant is Amara's, but has Inga's blood? Or is it Dhurke's blood? Wait, looking back: Evidence 19's full description: \"A pendant adorned with a pink butterfly. Seems it belongs to Dhurke. Stained with the victim's blood. A locket found at the crime scene. It actually belongs to Amara.\" Wait, there's a contradiction in the description. It says \"Seems it belongs to Dhurke\" but \"It actually belongs to Amara.\" And it's stained with the victim's (Inga's) blood. So, the pendant is Amara's, but was thought to be Dhurke's, and has Inga's blood. But how does that connect? If the pendant is Amara's, but found at Inga's murder scene with Inga's blood, then perhaps Amara was there. But Amara is the previous queen. However, if the blood on the pendant is Inga's, then that doesn't directly contradict Nahyuta's testimony. Alternatively, Evidence 20 is a bloodstain that's Dhurke's. If Dhurke was dead before Inga's murder, then his blood at the scene would imply that someone else planted it. So if Nahyuta claims to have killed Inga, but the presence of Dhurke's blood (from a dead person) suggests someone else was involved, then that's a contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 1 (Nahyuta confessing) is contradicted by Evidence 20 (Dhurke's bloodstain), because Dhurke couldn't have been there, so the real killer is someone else. But how does that directly tie to the testimony? Alternatively, maybe another testimony. Let me check Testimony 5: Nahyuta says he was reunited with his mother 15 years ago when Dhurke abducted her. But Evidence 23 is a photo from 23 years ago showing Amara holding a baby, with a Defiant Dragons book. If the Defiant Dragons existed 23 years ago, but Dhurke abducted Amara 15 years ago, that might not be a direct contradiction. Wait, perhaps the Defiant Dragons were formed after the abduction? Not sure. Alternatively, if the Defiant Dragons were already active 23 years ago, then Dhurke was leading them then, which would be before the abduction 15 years ago. But that's not necessarily a contradiction. Maybe the photo shows that Amara was with Dhurke 23 years ago, which would mean that the abduction story in Testimony 5 is false. Because if Amara was already with Dhurke 23 years ago, then Nahyuta's claim that Dhurke abducted her 15 years ago is a lie. Therefore, Testimony 5 is contradicted by Evidence 23. That would be the pair: Evidence 23 and Testimony 5. Because the photo shows Amara with Dhurke 23 years ago, implying a connection earlier than the 15-year-ago abduction Nahyuta mentions. So if the Defiant Dragons existed back then (as seen in the book in the photo), then Dhurke and Amara were together 23 years ago, which contradicts the testimony that Dhurke abducted her 15 years ago. Because the abduction would have happened later, but they were already together earlier. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 23 and Testimony 5.\n"

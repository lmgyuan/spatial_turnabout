You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response_json": {
      "evidence": 13,
      "testimony": 4
    },
    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through the testimonies and evidences one by one.\n\nTestimony 3 from Gossip says: \"I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!\" So Gossip claims that when he entered the room, he saw the Reaper (Barok van Zieks) holding the gun, standing over the victim.\n\nNow, looking at the evidences. Evidence 7 is the Revolver, the murder weapon found at the scene. But if the Reaper was holding the gun, why was it left at the scene? Wait, maybe there's more. Let's check other evidences.\n\nEvidence 16 is Gregson's Pocket Watch. The description says that after winding it, it started ticking again. But the watch was found cracked and stopped. If the watch stopped at the time of death, maybe the time of death can be determined. But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) states that the time of death couldn't be accurately estimated. Hmm, but how does that relate to the testimony?\n\nWait, Testimony 1 by Venus says they heard a big bang less than a minute after the Reaper went in. The Revolver is the gun used, but Evidence 14 is the Venus Firecracker, which goes off like a gunshot. Maybe the bang they heard was the firecracker, not the actual gunshot. So the testimony about hearing a bang might be contradicted by the firecracker evidence. But Testimony 1's person is Venus, who sells the firecrackers. Maybe she's lying or mistaken about the source of the bang.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 says the Reaper was holding the gun, but Evidence 17 is Inspector's Identification, which was confiscated by de Rousseau and de Rossi. Wait, that might not be directly related. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at Testimony 3: Gossip claims he saw the Reaper with the gun. But the Revolver (Evidence 7) was found at the scene. If the Reaper was holding it, why leave it there? Unless he was framed. But maybe there's another angle. The testimony says he was holding the gun, but the actual murder weapon might have been a different one. Wait, no. The Revolver is stated as the murder weapon.\n\nWait, another angle: Testimony 4 by Gossip says he slipped and got blood on his hand, then wiped it on the floor. But Evidence 13 is the Noticeboard with a bloody handprint on the back. If Gossip wiped the blood on the floor, then the handprint on the noticeboard might be his. That could contradict his testimony about where he wiped the blood. But how does that relate to the evidence? If the handprint is on the noticeboard, but he said he wiped it on the floor, that's a contradiction. So Evidence 13 (Noticeboard with bloody handprint) contradicts Testimony 4 (wiped on floor). But I need to check if that's the case.\n\nWait, Testimony 4: \"I slipped over and got blood on my hand, so I quickly wiped it off on the floor.\" If he wiped it on the floor, then the blood should be there. But Evidence 13's noticeboard has a bloody handprint on the back. So the handprint on the noticeboard would be from Gossip, which contradicts his testimony that he wiped it on the floor. Therefore, the evidence shows the handprint is on the noticeboard, but he claims to have wiped it on the floor. That's a contradiction. So Evidence 13 and Testimony 4 contradict each other. But is there another pair?\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 (Gossip seeing Reaper with gun) and Evidence 17 (Inspector's Identification). Wait, Evidence 17 is Gregson's ID, which was confiscated by de Rousseau and de Rossi. If Gregson's ID was confiscated, how did he have it at the scene? Or maybe that's not relevant. Alternatively, maybe the confiscated ID is a fake, but that's not directly conflicting with Testimony 3.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 says Reaper was holding the gun, but Evidence 6 (Candelabrum) has a candle with the top blown off, which might suggest an explosion or another source of the bang. But the Revolver is the murder weapon. Hmm.\n\nWait, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 3 (Reaper holding gun) and the fact that the Revolver (Evidence 7) was found at the scene. If the Reaper had the gun, he would have taken it, but it was left there. But that's not necessarily a contradiction because maybe he dropped it. Alternatively, if the Revolver was found at the scene, then the Reaper might have been holding it, but that's not a contradiction. So maybe not.\n\nWait, another angle: Testimony 0 by Gossip says they saw everything from start to finish. But Testimony 2 by Sandwich says Gossip couldn't wait to go see what happened, implying that maybe Gossip wasn't there from the start. But that's between testimonies, not evidence and testimony.\n\nWait, what about the timing? Testimony 1 says the bang was less than a minute after Reaper went in. But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) says time of death can't be determined. If the testimony is about the timing, but the evidence can't confirm the time, that's not a direct contradiction.\n\nWait, going back to the handprint. If Gossip wiped the blood on the floor (Testimony 4), then the noticeboard's handprint (Evidence 13) must be from someone else. But if Gossip's handprint is on the noticeboard, then he's lying about where he wiped the blood. So Evidence 13 (bloody handprint on noticeboard) contradicts Testimony 4 (wiped on floor). That seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Revolver (Evidence 7) contradicts Testimony 3. If the Revolver was found at the scene, then the Reaper would have had to leave it there. But Testimony 3 says he was holding it. So if he left it, that's possible. So maybe no contradiction there.\n\nAnother possibility: Testimony 3 says the Reaper was holding the gun, but Evidence 14 (Venus Firecracker) makes a bang like a gunshot. So maybe the actual shot was from the firecracker, and the Revolver wasn't fired. But that's a stretch. If the Revolver is the murder weapon, then the firecracker's sound is a distraction. But how does that contradict testimony?\n\nAlternatively, the passport (Evidence 21) shows Gregson was supposed to travel to France the next day. If he was planning to leave, maybe he had a motive, but not sure how that contradicts testimony.\n\nWait, the key contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 13. Gossip says he wiped blood on the floor, but the Noticeboard has a bloody handprint. Therefore, the evidence contradicts his testimony. So the answer should be evidence 13 and testimony 4."

Wait, maybe Sandwich is related to that?\n\nTestimony 4: Gossip again blaming the Reaper. Not directly related to evidence. Testimony 5: Sandwich says the detective died when they heard the gunshot. But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) states that time of death couldn't be accurately determined. So if Sandwich claims the death happened exactly when the gunshot was heard, but the autopsy says the time isn't clear, that's a contradiction. However, the Revolver (Evidence 7) is the murder weapon, but maybe the Venus Firecracker (Evidence 14) which sounds like a gunshot. So if the gunshot they heard was actually the firecracker, then the actual time of death could be different. But how does that relate to the testimony?\n\nWait, Testimony 5 says \"the detective still died when we heard the gunshot.\" If the murder was not by a gunshot but another method, or if the gunshot sound was a firecracker, then the time of death might not match. Let's check the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11): death was instant from a bullet at close range. So the cause of death is a gunshot. But the time of death couldn't be determined. So if the testimony claims the death was at the time of the gunshot, but the autopsy can't confirm the time, maybe that's not a direct contradiction. Hmm. Alternatively, if the gunshot sound they heard was a firecracker (Evidence 14), then the actual time of death could be different. So if they heard the firecracker, which sounds like a gunshot, but the actual murder happened earlier or later, then the testimony would be wrong. But how does that tie to the evidence?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 3 from Sandwich: he claims to be just a bystander, but maybe there's evidence linking him. Evidence 15: Photograph of the Victim shows the body with a red hairpiece. Maybe Sandwich is involved in placing the hairpiece? Or perhaps Evidence 9: Framed Photograph of Mrs. Vigil found at the scene. If Sandwich is related to the Vigils, but he's claiming to be a bystander. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nWait, the Evidence 26: Small Component is a part from Judge Jigoku's cabin, which is the crown of Gregson's pocket watch (Evidence 16). If the pocket watch was found to have a missing part that's in Jigoku's cabin, maybe that connects to someone else's testimony. But how?\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 5 from Sandwich says the detective died when they heard the gunshot. But if the actual time of death was different because the watch (Evidence 16) stopped, and the component (Evidence 26) is part of the watch, maybe the watch stopped at a different time. For example, if the pocket watch was broken when the murder happened, and the time it shows is incorrect. But the autopsy can't determine the time, so maybe the watch's time is a clue. But I'm not sure how that directly contradicts the testimony.\n\nLet's go back to Testimony 0: Gossip says he just wiped his hand on the noticeboard (Evidence 13). But the noticeboard has a bloody handprint. If he just wiped his hand, maybe implying it was his own hand, but if the handprint is bloody, perhaps he's lying about how the blood got there. So Evidence 13's description of a bloody handprint contradicts Testimony 0 where he claims he just wiped his hand, which might not account for blood. So that would be a contradiction. Then the pair would be Evidence 13 and Testimony 0. But the user instructions say to output the evidence number and testimony number. Evidence 13 is \"Noticeboard\" and Testimony 0. So that would be {\"evidence\": 13, \"testimony\": 0}.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there's a more direct contradiction. For example, Testimony 5 from Sandwich: \"the detective still died when we heard the gunshot.\" If the gunshot was a firecracker (Evidence 14), then the actual time of death might not be when the gunshot was heard. So the testimony claims the death was at the time of the gunshot, but if the gunshot sound was a firecracker, then the real time could be different. However, the autopsy report says the cause was a bullet. So maybe the firecracker was a distraction. But how does that directly contradict? The testimony is about the timing, not the cause. The autopsy report says time can't be determined, so the testimony's assertion about the timing can't be verified, but not necessarily contradicted.\n\nAlternatively, the Revolver (Evidence 7) is the murder weapon. If the gun was fired, but the firecracker (Evidence 14) also made a noise, maybe there were two sounds. But the testimonies mention hearing a gunshot, which they attribute to the murder. If the firecracker was set off at the same time, perhaps creating an alibi. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at Testimony 5 again: \"I c-can't see how this changes anything anyway. The detective still died w-when we heard the gunshot.\" If the murder was committed without a gunshot (e.g., the bullet was fired earlier and the sound was a firecracker), but the autopsy says death was from a bullet. So the contradiction here would be that the time of death was when the gunshot was heard, but maybe the actual bullet was fired earlier, and the sound was a firecracker. But how to link that with evidence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the candelabrum (Evidence 6) has a candle top blown off, which could indicate an explosion, possibly from the firecracker. If the firecracker was used to mimic a gunshot, then the actual murder happened without a loud noise, but the firecracker was used to make people think it was a gunshot. Then, the testimony about hearing the gunshot at the time of death would be incorrect because the gunshot (the actual murder) was silent, and the firecracker was the noise. But the autopsy says the cause was a bullet, so the murder was a gunshot. This is getting a bit convoluted.\n\nLet me think again. The most straightforward contradiction seems to be Testimony 0 (Gossip) and Evidence 13 (Noticeboard with bloody handprint). Gossip claims he just wiped his hand on the noticeboard, but the evidence shows a bloody handprint. So if he only wiped his hand, the handprint shouldn't be bloody unless he was involved in the crime. Therefore, the evidence contradicts his testimony. That would be the pair: Evidence 13 and Testimony 0.\n\nAnother possible pair: Testimony 3 (Sandwich) says he's just a bystander, but maybe a piece of evidence links him. Evidence 15 is a photograph of the victim with a red hairpiece. But I don't see a direct link. Alternatively, Evidence 9 is a framed photograph of Mrs. Vigil found at the scene. If Sandwich is related to the Vigils, maybe, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the component (Evidence 26) is part of the pocket watch (Evidence 16). If the pocket watch was found in the crime scene and the component was in Judge Jigoku's cabin, that might link Jigoku to the crime. But how does that contradict a testimony?\n\nHmm. Let's recheck all testimonies:\n\nTestimony 5: Sandwich says the detective died when they heard the gunshot. If the pocket watch (Evidence 16) stopped at a certain time, and the component (Evidence 26) is part of it, maybe the watch stopped earlier, indicating the time of death was before the gunshot sound (firecracker). So the actual time of death was when the watch stopped, which is earlier than the gunshot. Therefore, Testimony 5's claim that death was at the time of the gunshot is contradicted by the watch's time. But the autopsy says time can't be determined. However, if the watch was broken due to the component missing, maybe the time on the watch is unreliable. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the component (Evidence 26) is the crown of the pocket watch. If the watch was wound up (Evidence 16 says it started ticking again after being wound), and the component was found in Jigoku's cabin, that could mean someone tampered with the watch. But how does this tie to a testimony?\n\nPerhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 13. The testimony says \"I just wiped my hand on it\" (the noticeboard), but the evidence has a bloody handprint. So if Gossip is claiming he just wiped his hand, but the handprint is bloody, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 13 contradicts Testimony 0."

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the given testimonies. Let me start by going through each testimony and checking the evidence for inconsistencies.\n\nTestimony 3 is from De Rousseau: \"Zere might 'ave been a little tussle, but we did 'im no 'arm. And ze next mornin', we let 'im go.\" They claim they didn't harm the person and let him go the next morning.\n\nLooking at the evidence, maybe something shows that the person was harmed or not released. Evidence 5 is the Red Hairpiece, which is Gregson's. Evidence 11 is the Autopsy Report stating death by a close-range bullet. If the testimonies say they let him go unharmed, but Gregson ended up dead, that's a contradiction. Wait, but Testimony 0 says they took him prisoner. Then, Testimony 3 says they let him go. But if he was killed, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the murder weapon is the Revolver (Evidence 7), and Gregson's Autopsy Report (11) shows he was shot. So if De Rousseau claims they let him go, but Gregson was found dead at the scene, that's a contradiction. But how does the evidence directly contradict the testimony?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Revolver (7) being found at the scene contradicts their claim of not harming him. But Testimony 3 says they let him go. If Gregson was found dead in the same place they kept him, then they didn't let him go. But the testimonies mention letting him go the next morning. If the crime scene is where they kept him, and he's dead there, then the testimony is false.\n\nWait, but let's look at other evidence. The Policeman Figurine (8) has a key-like shaft. Maybe that's related to the room where they kept him. The Dismissal Notice (4) is about Mr. Vigil. Not sure. Evidence 17 is Gregson's Identification, which they confiscated. So they took his ID, as per Testimony 2. Then Testimony 3 says they let him go. But if he was found dead in the same place, that contradicts letting him go. But maybe the evidence that shows he was still there is the crime scene itself. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the Autopsy Report (11) says death was from a bullet shot at close range, which contradicts their statement of not harming him. So if they claim they didn't harm him, but he was shot, that's a contradiction. So the Autopsy Report (11) would contradict Testimony 3. Let me check the testimony again. Testimony 3 says \"we did 'im no 'arm.\" But the autopsy shows he was shot. Therefore, the evidence of the Autopsy Report (11) contradicts Testimony 3.\n\nBut wait, is there a more direct contradiction? Let me check other testimonies. Testimony 4 from De Rossi: \"He tried to escape, but the capo put-a the collare on him and dragged him back...\" So there was a struggle, but Testimony 3 says no harm. Maybe the Revolver (7) being the murder weapon, but how does that tie to the testimony?\n\nWait, the Revolver is the murder weapon found at the scene. If they let him go, how did he end up dead there? Unless they actually killed him. So Testimony 3's claim that they let him go is contradicted by the fact that he was found dead at the scene where they held him. But which evidence directly shows that he was killed there?\n\nThe Crime Scene Floor Plan (12) shows the body was found in the same room where they kept him. So if they let him go, he shouldn't be there. But maybe the evidence that shows he was killed there is the crime scene itself. However, I need to pair an evidence with a testimony.\n\nAlternatively, the Autopsy Report (11) says death was instant from a close-range bullet. If they let him go, then someone else killed him, but if the Revolver (7) is their weapon, then maybe. But the testimonies don't mention a gun. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 says they let him go the next morning, but the Passport (21) was issued the day before his body was found. If he was supposed to travel to France but couldn't because he was killed, that might tie in. But not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the key evidence is the Policeman Figurine (8), which when twisted releases a key-like shaft. If that's a key to the room, but they said they let him go, but the key is still there, that might not contradict. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 17 is Gregson's Identification, which they confiscated. If they let him go, he would have his ID back. But Testimony 3 says they let him go, but Evidence 17 shows they kept his ID. Wait, Testimony 2 says they took his ID and shut him in the room. So if they let him go, they should have returned his ID. But Evidence 17 is his ID, which was confiscated. So if they let him go but didn't return his ID, that's a contradiction. But the testimony doesn't mention returning the ID. So maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, Testimony 3 says they let him go, but if he was found dead in the same room, then they didn't let him go. The Crime Scene Floor Plan (12) is the plan of the room where the body was found. So if the body was found there, they didn't let him go. But the testimony says they let him go. So the evidence that the body was found in the room (Evidence 12) contradicts Testimony 3.\n\nBut Evidence 12 is just the floor plan. The Autopsy Report (11) also shows he was killed there. Alternatively, the Dismissal Notice (4) is about Mr. Vigil, which might not relate. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 says they let him go, but Evidence 15 is the Photograph of the Victim showing Gregson's body in the room. So that contradicts their claim. But which evidence number is that?\n\nLooking back, Evidence 15: \"A photographic print of the victim, Inspector Gregson. His body appears to be tightly curled up and there's a red hairpiece on his head.\" If the photo shows his body at the scene, which is the same place they held him, then letting him go is a lie. But I'm not sure if that's the evidence to use. Alternatively, the fact that his body was found there.\n\nWait, but the testimonies are from De Rousseau and De Rossi about taking him prisoner and letting him go. The contradiction is that they claim to have let him go, but he was found dead in their hideout. So the evidence showing the body was found there would contradict the testimony. But which evidence is that? The Crime Scene Floor Plan (12) is the plan of the room where the body was found, which is their hideout. So if they let him go, he shouldn't be there. Therefore, Evidence 12 contradicts Testimony 3.\n\nAlternatively, the Autopsy Report (11) confirms he died there. But the key contradiction is the location of the body. Therefore, the Floor Plan (12) would contradict their testimony of letting him go. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the Revolver (7) being the murder weapon found there suggests he was killed there, so they didn't let him go. But how to pair this.\n\nWait, perhaps the key contradiction is that they claim to have let him go, but the body was found in the same room. So the Floor Plan (12) shows the room where he was held and where the body was found. Therefore, Testimony 3 is contradicted by Evidence 12. But the user might expect another answer.\n\nAlternatively, the Dismissal Notice (4) is about Mr. Vigil, not Gregson. So that's not relevant.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 3 says they let him go the next morning, but the Passport (21) was issued the day before the body was found, implying he was supposed to leave but didn't. However, the timing might not directly contradict.\n\nWait, maybe Evidence 16: Gregson's Pocket Watch. It's cracked and stopped. If they let him go the next morning, the watch would still be working unless it was broken during the tussle. But the watch was cracked, which could indicate a struggle, contradicting \"no harm\". But Testimony 3 says there was a little tussle but no harm. So the broken watch (16) could indicate harm, contradicting the testimony. But the watch's glass is cracked. But the testimony says \"did 'im no 'arm\". If the watch was damaged during the tussle, that's harm to his property, but maybe not directly to him. However, the key point is that they claim to have not harmed him, but he ended up dead. So the Autopsy Report (11) showing he was shot at close range contradicts their claim of not harming him. Therefore, Evidence 11 contradicts Testimony 3.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The testimony states they did him no harm and let him go, but the autopsy shows he was killed by a bullet, which is harm. Therefore, the Autopsy Report (11) contradicts Testimony 3."

    },
    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all given. Let me start by going through the testimonies and see if any of them can be contradicted by the evidence.\n\nTestimony 0 is from De Rousseau, saying the man who claimed to be an inspector that day was definitely not \"this man.\" The \"this man\" might refer to Inspector Gregson. But looking at the evidence, maybe Evidence 17 is Inspector Gregson's ID, which was confiscated by De Rousseau and De Rossi. So if they have his ID, they would know what he looks like. If the testimony says the man wasn't Gregson, but the ID is his, maybe there's a contradiction here. Wait, but Testimony 0 and 1 might be about someone impersonating Gregson. Let me check the evidence again.\n\nEvidence 17: Inspector's Identification. It's Gregson's official warrant card, confiscated by De Rousseau and De Rossi. So if they had his ID, they might have taken it from him. But Testimony 0 says the man claiming to be an inspector that day was not Gregson. But if Gregson's ID was with them, maybe they took it, which would imply that the real Gregson wasn't there. But then, maybe the person impersonating Gregson was using the ID. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nLooking at Testimony 2: Gossip says he never leaves Fresno Street and has no interest in the Red-Headed League. The Red-Headed League is connected to Evidence 1 (the article) and Evidence 16 (the fraudsters De Rousseau and De Rossi). If there's evidence that Gossip was involved with the Red-Headed League, that would contradict his testimony. But Evidence 1 is about the article, and maybe Evidence 16 (the Red-Headed League swindle). But I don't see evidence directly linking Gossip to that. \n\nTestimony 3 and 4 are from Boone, who rented the room where the body was found. He says he's alone in the world with no kinfolk. But Evidence 9 is a framed photograph of Mrs. Vigil in her younger years found at the crime scene. If Boone has a photo of Mrs. Vigil, maybe he's connected to her, contradicting his claim of having no kin. But Mrs. Vigil is looking for her missing husband, Daley Vigil. Wait, Daley Vigil is the former chief warder of Barclay Prison. If the photograph in the crime scene is Mrs. Vigil's, and Boone is the one renting the room, that might suggest a connection. So Boone's testimony 4 says he has no kin, but the photo (Evidence 9) is there, implying he's connected to Mrs. Vigil. That could be a contradiction.\n\nSo, Testimony 4 (Gossip/Boone saying he has no kin) vs Evidence 9 (Framed Photograph of Mrs. Vigil). If Boone is the one who rented the room (Testimony 3), and the photo was found there, then he's either connected to her or the photo was placed by someone else. But if the photo is in his room, that contradicts his statement of having no family. Therefore, Evidence 9 contradicts Testimony 4. \n\nWait, but the name of Evidence 9 is \"Framed Photograph\" which is of Mrs. Vigil in her younger years. If Boone has this photo, and he says he has no kin, that's a contradiction because the photo could imply a relation. So, the testimony is Testimony 4: \"I've no kinfolk or nothing. Why would I be involved in something like that?\" But the evidence is a photo of Mrs. Vigil in his room. Therefore, the presence of the photo suggests a connection, contradicting his claim of no kin. \n\nTherefore, the pair would be Evidence 9 and Testimony 4. But wait, the Testimony 4 is attributed to Gossip/Boone. Since Testimony 3 is Boone, Testimony 4 is also Boone (since it's the same person). So if Boone says he has no kin, but there's a photo of Mrs. Vigil (who is looking for her husband, Daley Vigil), maybe Boone is Daley Vigil. Because Daley Vigil is missing, but if Boone is him, then the photo is of his wife, which would mean he does have kin, contradicting his testimony. Alternatively, maybe the photo was left by someone else. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 18: Commemorative Photograph taken at the Great Waterloo Hotel with Professor Mikotoba and Judge Jigoku. Maybe not related.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 5 from Gossip/Boone: \"Do I look like I could carry off a disguise with a face like this?\" If there's evidence that he did use a disguise. For example, the Red Hairpiece (Evidence 5) found at the crime scene. But if Gossip/Boone has a distinctive face, but the hairpiece could be part of a disguise, maybe. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, going back to Testimony 0 and 1. De Rousseau and De Rossi both say that the man claiming to be an inspector (Gregson) wasn't the real one. But Evidence 17 is Gregson's ID, which was confiscated by them. So perhaps the real Gregson's ID was taken, implying that the man they saw was impersonating Gregson. But the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says Gregson died from a bullet shot. So if the real Gregson was killed, then the person they met earlier with his ID was an imposter. But how does that contradict their testimonies? Their testimonies say the man wasn't Gregson, which would be true if they took his ID. So maybe that's not a contradiction.\n\nAnother thought: Testimony 2, Gossip says he never leaves Fresno Street and isn't interested in the Red-Headed League. But perhaps there's evidence linking him to the League. Evidence 1 is the Red-Headed League article. Maybe if there's evidence that Gossip was involved, but I don't see that. Alternatively, Evidence 14: Venus Firecracker, which goes off like a gunshot. If the crime scene had a firecracker used to mimic a gunshot, and Venus is the seller, maybe. But Testimony 2 is Gossip's. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3: Boone rents the room where the body was found. Evidence 12 is the crime scene floor plan. But not directly contradicting. Evidence 6: Candelabrum with a candle top blown off. Maybe related to the firecracker? If the firecracker was used to create the sound of a gunshot, and the candelabrum's candle was damaged by it. But how does that relate to testimony?\n\nWait, back to Testimony 4 and Evidence 9. If Boone (who rented the room) has a photo of Mrs. Vigil, who is looking for her missing husband, then maybe Boone is Daley Vigil, which would mean he's lying about having no kin. If that's the case, then Evidence 9 (the photo) contradicts Testimony 4 (no kin). So the pair would be Evidence 9 and Testimony 4. But let's check the numbers. Testimony 4 is index 4, which is \"I've no kinfolk or nothing...\" by Gossip/Boone. Evidence 9 is the Framed Photograph of Mrs. Vigil. So yes, this seems like a solid contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be {\"evidence\": 9, \"testimony\": 4}."

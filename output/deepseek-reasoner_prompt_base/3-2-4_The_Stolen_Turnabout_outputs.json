    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So I need to go through each testimony and check if any of the evidences provided directly contradict it.\n\nFirst, let's look at the testimonies given by Atmey. Testimony 3 says: \"I knew it was an extremely valuable treasure, so I sent my card 10 days beforehand.\" This refers to the calling card sent by Mask DeMasque, right? The relevant evidence here would be the DeMasque's Calling Card (Evidence 5). The card mentions the \"speckled urn,\" which the Sacred Urn (Evidence 4) has pink splotches. But according to the evidence, Pearl points out that the splotches were added recently. The Sacred Urn was broken and repaired by Adrian two weeks ago and then kept out of sight. The calling card refers to the urn as \"speckled,\" which matches the splotches added during the repair. However, if the calling card was sent 10 days before the crime (as per Testimony 3), that would be 10 days prior to October 12th, which would be October 2nd. But Adrian repaired the urn two weeks before the crime, which is 14 days prior, around September 28th. Wait, the timing here: if the urn was repaired two weeks ago (so around September 28th) and then placed back in the box, but the calling card was sent 10 days before the crime (October 2nd), then the card refers to the speckled urn. However, the urn's splotches were only added during the repair two weeks prior. So the calling card's reference to the speckled urn would have to have been made after the urn was already repaired. But according to Testimony 3, Atmey sent the card 10 days before the crime (October 12th), which would be October 2nd. But the urn was repaired two weeks (14 days) before October 12th, so September 28th. Therefore, the splotches were added on September 28th. So when Atmey sent the card on October 2nd, the urn already had the splotches. That seems okay. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, the Sacred Urn (Evidence 4) was broken and repaired by Adrian two weeks ago, then replaced in its box. So the splotches (paint) were added during that repair. The calling card mentions the \"speckled urn,\" which refers to the splotches. But if Atmey sent the calling card 10 days before the crime, which is October 2nd, then he knew about the splotches before the crime. But how would he know that the urn had splotches if it was kept out of sight after being repaired? Unless he had access to the urn's box. Wait, the Urn Box (Evidence 21) has pink paint stains. The box was with the urn, so maybe the splotches on the urn were not visible if it was in the box. But according to Evidence 4, the urn was kept out of sight. Wait, no: Evidence 4 says \"Broken and repaired by Adrian 2 weeks ago, then replaced in its box. Kept out of sight.\" So after repair, it was put back in the box and kept out of sight. Therefore, the splotches on the urn were not visible to the public. Therefore, if Atmey sent the calling card 10 days prior, referencing the speckled urn, but the urn was in the box with the splotches hidden, how would he know about the splotches unless he had prior knowledge? But the only way he could know is if he saw the urn after the repair. However, according to Testimony 2: Atmey says \"Hence, I was actually unable to see the urn for myself until the day of the crime...\" So Atmey claims he didn't see the urn until the day of the crime (October 12th). But the calling card was sent 10 days before (October 2nd), which mentions the speckled urn. That means he couldn't have known about the splotches unless he had inside information. However, the urn's splotches were added during the repair two weeks prior, and the box (Evidence 21) has paint stains, but if the urn was in the box and kept out of sight, then the splotches on the urn itself were not visible. Therefore, Atmey shouldn't have known about the splotches unless he saw the urn after it was repaired. But his Testimony 2 says he didn't see it until the day of the crime. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (sending the card 10 days prior mentioning the speckled urn) and Evidence 4 and 5 (the urn's splotches were added during repair, which was two weeks prior, but the urn was kept out of sight). So Atmey couldn't have known about the splotches when he sent the card 10 days ago unless he had prior knowledge, which he denies. Therefore, the evidence (Sacred Urn's splotches and the calling card's mention) contradicts his Testimony 3 because he claims to have sent the card 10 days prior, referencing the speckled urn, which he couldn't have known about unless he saw the urn before the day of the crime, which he denies in Testimony 2.\n\nAnother angle: The calling card refers to the urn as \"speckled,\" but the urn only got the splotches during the repair two weeks ago. So the calling card's mention of the speckled urn must have been written after the repair. Since the repair was two weeks before the crime (October 12th), that's September 28th. The calling card was sent 10 days before October 12th, which is October 2nd. So the splotches were added on September 28th, and the card was sent October 2nd. Therefore, the card was sent after the urn was repaired. However, the urn was kept in its box and out of sight. So unless Atmey had access to the urn's box, he wouldn't know about the splotches. But the Urn Box (Evidence 21) has paint stains, possibly from when Adrian dropped it. But how would Atmey know that the urn inside had splotches? Unless he saw the urn after the repair. But Testimony 2 says he didn't see the urn until the day of the crime. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Atmey's Testimony 3 says he sent the card 10 days prior, mentioning the speckled urn, but according to the evidence, he couldn't have known about the splotches unless he saw the urn before the day of the crime, which he claims he didn't. Therefore, the evidence (Calling Card's mention of speckled urn, Evidence 5) contradicts Testimony 3, where Atmey claims he sent the card 10 days prior, which would mean he knew about the splotches without having seen the urn.\n"

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies given. Let's start by going through each testimony and checking the evidence against them.\n\nLooking at the testimonies from Luke Atmey (Testimonies 0 to 5). Testimony 0 says he had no contact with the victim. But maybe some evidence shows he did. Let's check the evidence related to Atmey. Evidence 4 is the Sacred Urn found in Atmey's office. The urn was supposed to be in the Treasures of Kurain exhibit but ended up in his office. That might link him to the crime scene. If the urn was in his office, that could mean he had contact with the victim, especially since the victim (Kane Bullard) was involved with KB Security, which might be connected to the exhibit's security. So Testimony 0 claims no contact, but Evidence 4 (Sacred Urn in his office) suggests otherwise. \n\nAnother angle: Testimony 2 states that Bullard wrote the blackmail letter. Evidence 10 is the blackmail letter, which is confirmed to be written by Bullard. So that's consistent. Testimony 4 says DeLite believes he's Mask DeMasque. But Evidence 20 (Ron's Testimony) says he was blackmailed into stealing. So maybe not a contradiction there. \n\nTestimony 5 claims DeLite killed Bullard. But the autopsy report (Evidence 15) says death was from blunt trauma. The Shichishito (Evidence 6) was used to hit Atmey, but the victim's cause was similar. Wait, but the weapon for the victim isn't directly linked here. Maybe not. \n\nWait, Testimony 0: Atmey had no contact with victim. But if the Sacred Urn was in Atmey's office and it's part of the exhibit that Bullard's company was securing, perhaps Bullard was involved in moving the urn. Also, the Sacred Urn was broken and repaired by Adrian (Evidence 4), and the box (Evidence 21) has paint stains matching when Adrian dropped it. But how does that connect Atmey to Bullard? The urn was found in Atmey's office, implying he might have taken it, which could mean he interacted with Bullard, who was the CEO of KB Security. Therefore, if the urn was in Atmey's possession, perhaps he had contact with Bullard, contradicting Testimony 0.\n\nYes, that seems like a solid contradiction. The presence of the Sacred Urn in Atmey's office (Evidence 4) directly contradicts his statement that he had no contact with the victim (Kane Bullard), because Bullard's company was responsible for the security of the exhibit, including the urn. Therefore, Atmey having the urn suggests contact or involvement with Bullard.\n"

So either could be used, but maybe the correct one is Evidence 17. Also, the testimonies are numbered 0 and 1. Testimony 1 is the one stating their relationship was only the contest. So the contradiction would be between Evidence 17 (or 29) and Testimony 1. The user wants the evidence number and testimony number. Evidence 17 is the first instance of the Family Photo.

    },
    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by understanding the characters, evidences, and testimonies provided.\n\nFirst, the testimonies given are all from von Karma (Testimony 0 to 4). They talk about Gusto and Frost's collaboration. Specifically, Testimony 2 says they worked together until the day before the finals, and Testimony 4 states their cooperation lasted through the semifinals, then they were on their own for finals.\n\nNow, looking at the evidences. Let's see if any evidence contradicts this. Evidence 14 is \"Semifinal Entries: Frost's and Gusto's creations had different designs, but tasted the same.\" Wait, if they worked together through the semifinals, their creations should have been collaborative. But Evidence 14 says their semifinal entries had different designs but same taste. That suggests they might have worked together (same taste) but different designs. But von Karma's testimony (Testimony 2 and 4) says they cooperated until the day before finals, which would include semifinals. But semifinals entries having different designs might contradict that they worked together through semifinals. Because if they were collaborating, their semifinal entries would presumably be similar in both design and taste. However, the testimony says they cooperated through the semifinals, but the evidence shows their semifinal entries had different designs. That could imply a contradiction. Wait, but Testimony 3 says Gusto had poor design sense and Frost was a novice at baking. So maybe they split the work: Frost did design, Gusto the taste. So in semifinals, they worked together, hence same taste (Gusto's part) but different designs (Frost's part? Or maybe the designs were different but the taste was same because Gusto handled that). But wait, the semifinal entries are from Frost and Gusto individually. If they were collaborating, why would their entries have different designs but same taste? That suggests that even though they were working together, their individual entries shared the taste (maybe using the same recipe) but different designs. But according to the testimonies, they worked together until the day before finals. So maybe during semifinals, they each submitted their own entries but collaborated, hence same taste. However, that's possible. So where's the contradiction?\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 14's semifinal entries being different in design but same taste might contradict Testimony 2 and 4. Because if they were working together through semifinals, perhaps their entries would be more aligned. But the testimony says they cooperated through semifinals, which would imply that their entries were a joint effort, but the evidence shows they submitted separate entries with different designs but same taste. That might be a contradiction. If they were working together, maybe they should have the same entry, but the contest rules might allow separate entries. Wait, the Contest Rules (Evidence 4) might clarify, but we don't have the exact rules here. But the testimonies say that for the finals, they were on their own. So during semifinals, they worked together, but perhaps each still submitted individual entries. But how would that work? Maybe they shared the baking (taste) but each did their own design. So their semifinal entries would have same taste (Gusto's work) but different designs (Frost's work). Then Evidence 14's statement that semifinal entries had different designs but same taste would align with that. So maybe no contradiction here.\n\nWait, but Testimony 2 says \"Until the day before the finals, they worked on their desserts together.\" So their desserts (plural) were worked on together. But semifinals would have their individual entries. Hmm. Maybe the contradiction is that the testimony says they worked together until the day before finals (which would include the finals preparation), but the semifinal entries were individual. But the evidence says that the semifinal entries had same taste but different designs. If they worked together, perhaps their entries would have both same taste and same design. Or maybe they collaborated on both, but each entry was under one person's name. But if they were working together, why would the entries have different designs? That's possible if each took charge of design, but shared the taste. So maybe no contradiction here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another evidence contradicts a testimony. Let's check other testimonies and evidences.\n\nLooking at Testimony 3: \"Why? Because Gusto had poor design sense, and Frost was a novice at baking.\" So they teamed up to complement each other's weaknesses. So Frost handled design, Gusto handled baking. Therefore, in the semifinals, their entries would have Frost's designs (different for each entry) and Gusto's taste (same). Which aligns with Evidence 14. So that's consistent. So no contradiction there.\n\nWait, so that would mean their cooperation led to each entry having good design (Frost) and good taste (Gusto), but since they were separate entries, perhaps each entry was submitted under their own names but they helped each other. So the semifinal entries having different designs but same taste would make sense. Thus, Testimony 2 and 4 don't contradict Evidence 14. So maybe not that pair.\n\nLet me check other possibilities. For example, Testimony 4 says their cooperation lasted through the semifinals. Then for the finals, they were on their own. But Evidence 14 is about semifinal entries. If they worked together through semifinals, then their entries would have been a collaboration, but Evidence 14 says they had different designs. If they were collaborating, maybe their entries would be similar. But according to the testimony, they worked together until the day before finals. So perhaps the semifinals were before that. Wait, Testimony 2 says \"Until the day before the finals, they worked on their desserts together.\" So the finals are the next day. So during the time leading up to finals, they worked together, but for semifinals, which were earlier, maybe they did collaborate. Hmm. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify the timeline.\n\nSemifinals would be before the finals. So if they worked together up until the day before finals, that would include the semifinals period. But their semifinal entries were submitted earlier, right? So the semifinal entries would have been created during their collaboration. So the fact that their semifinal entries have different designs but same taste would support that they split the work: Frost did design, Gusto did taste. So each entry has Frost's design and Gusto's taste. But since they are two different entries (Frost's and Gusto's), each would have their own design but same taste. That makes sense. So the evidence and testimony here align. So no contradiction.\n\nLet me check another angle. Looking at Evidence 17: Family Photo showing Frost, Gusto, and their sons. Gusto's son visited his father daily up through the semifinal. Maybe Testimony 3 says they worked together because Gusto had poor design sense. If Gusto's son was visiting up through semifinal, perhaps that's connected. Not sure.\n\nAnother possible contradiction: Testimony 4 says they were on their own for finals. If Evidence 13 (Ms. Scone's Statement) says Frost's sculptures in the finals were \"scrumptious\" except the lyre was salty. If Frost was a novice at baking (per Testimony 3), but in finals he's on his own, but his sculptures were scrumptious except for the lyre. Maybe that's conflicting, but not directly. Because maybe he improved, or perhaps someone helped him. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's check Evidence 16: Victim's Blood found in the fountain but not at the crime scene. Maybe connected to the murder location. Not sure how that contradicts testimonies.\n\nAnother thought: Evidence 34 (Gemini Case Analysis) says sugar composition matches the pale blue liquid in Frost's room 18 years ago. This seems related to the IS-7 incident, but not directly to the testimonies given.\n\nLooking back, maybe another testimony and evidence pair. Let's look at Testimony 2: \"Until the day before the finals, they worked on their desserts together.\" If they worked together until the day before finals, then their desserts for finals would be individual. But if the finals entries were individual, then the fact that they worked together until the day before could mean they were preparing together for finals. But that's allowed. So no contradiction here.\n\nWait, another possibility: Testimony 4 says \"For the finals, they were on their own.\" But if Evidence 14 is about semifinals, which they collaborated on, then no contradiction. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nLooking at Evidence 17: Family Photo shows Gusto's son visited up through semifinal. Testimony 2 and 4 talk about Gusto and Frost's collaboration. Not sure if connected.\n\nWait, perhaps Evidence 14 (Semifinal Entries: different designs, same taste) and Testimony 2 (they worked together until day before finals). If they worked together on their desserts until the day before finals, which includes semifinals, but semifinal entries are different designs but same taste, that's consistent with them collaborating (Gusto handling taste, Frost design). So no contradiction here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Testimony 3 says Frost was a novice at baking. If Evidence 14 says semifinal entries had same taste (which would be Gusto's work, as he's good at taste), then that's consistent. So Testimony 3 and Evidence 14 align.\n\nHmm. Maybe another pair. Let's consider Testimony 1: \"Last night, when I interrogated Gusto, he told me about his connection with Frost.\" But Evidence 17 says Gusto's son visited him up through semifinal. If Gusto and Frost were collaborators, maybe their sons are related. But not directly a contradiction.\n\nWait, let's check Evidence 25: Poison Gas Ingredients. If the gas was produced by mixing two substances, perhaps related to the murder method. But testimonies don't mention poison gas.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 28: Salt Lamp (photo from IS-7 Incident) with Frost's blood. If the murder weapon in this case is the same, maybe connecting to past events. But testimonies here are about Gusto and Frost's collaboration.\n\nWait, perhaps Testimony 2 and 4 are contradicted by Evidence 17? Wait, Evidence 17 is a family photo showing Gusto's son visited up through semifinal. If they were working together through semifinals, maybe the son's visits are connected. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's check Evidence 26: Ultimate Cookbook, same as Evidence 15. It's about creating a cure for taste disorders. Maybe if someone had a taste disorder, but testimonies don't mention that.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 4 says cooperation lasted through semifinals. Evidence 14 is semifinal entries. If they worked together, their entries should be similar. But the evidence says different designs, same taste. If they were working together, perhaps the entries would be the same. But if each had their own entry, then even collaborating, they could have different designs but same taste. So that's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is elsewhere. Let's think about the key points. The user asks for a single pair where evidence and testimony contradict each other.\n\nWait, another thought: Testimony 2 says they worked on their desserts together until the day before finals. Evidence 14 says semifinal entries (which would be before finals) had different designs but same taste. If they were working together on their desserts, then their semifinal entries (which are their desserts) would be collaborative efforts, but the evidence shows they were different in design. But if they were collaborating, maybe their entries would be the same. However, if each had to submit their own entry, then perhaps they shared the taste (same) but individual designs. So Testimony 2 says they worked together on their desserts (plural), meaning each of their desserts. So they helped each other on both design and taste. But the evidence says different designs. So if they worked together on design, why different designs? That's a contradiction. Because if they worked together, their designs would be similar, but the evidence shows different.\n\nSo Testimony 2 says they worked together on their desserts until the day before finals. If that's the case, their semifinal entries (which are their desserts) would have been made together, implying same designs. But Evidence 14 says different designs. Therefore, this is a contradiction.\n\nSo the pair would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 2.\n\nWait, but Testimony 3 explains that Gusto had poor design sense and Frost was a novice at baking. So Frost did design, Gusto did baking. Therefore, for their individual semifinal entries, Frost would handle the design (different for each) and Gusto the taste (same). That's what Evidence 14 says: different designs (because Frost designed each entry) but same taste (Gusto's work). But Testimony 2 says they worked on their desserts together. So even though each entry is under their own name, they collaborated on both entries. So the design for Frost's entry would be by Frost, and Gusto's entry design by Frost as well? But then the designs would be different? But why? Because each entry is different. For example, Frost submits his own design with Gusto's taste, and Gusto's entry has a different design (maybe Frost helped him, but Gusto has poor design sense). Wait, that's confusing. If they worked together, perhaps Frost designed both entries, leading to different designs but same taste. But then Testimony 2 says they worked together on their desserts, meaning both entries. So the fact that the designs are different but taste same is consistent with their collaboration. Because Frost handles design, so each entry's design is different, but Gusto handles taste, so same. Thus, no contradiction.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of another angle. If the testimonies say they worked together through semifinals, but the evidence says semifinal entries were different designs but same taste, this might imply that they shared the taste (Gusto's work) but not the design (Frost's individual work). But Testimony 2 says they worked together on their desserts. So if they worked together, the design would be a joint effort. But the evidence says different designs. That's a contradiction. Because if they worked together on both entries' designs, the designs should be similar or the same. But they are different. Therefore, the testimony that they worked together on their desserts (including design) is contradicted by the evidence showing different designs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the testimony is referring to working together on the baking aspect, not the design. But Testimony 3 says Frost was a novice at baking, so Gusto handled that. So the collaboration was Frost doing design, Gusto doing taste. Therefore, their entries would have different designs (since each entry is their own) but same taste (since Gusto did the taste for both). So Evidence 14 aligns with this. Therefore, no contradiction.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nWait, another possibility: Evidence 17 is a family photo showing Gusto's son visited up through semifinal. Testimony 1 says von Karma interrogated Gusto last night and he told him about his connection with Frost. If Gusto's son was visiting during semifinals, but the cooperation between Gusto and Frost ended at semifinals (Testimony 4), maybe the son's visits are related. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 24: Luminous Cloth lost 18 years ago and found in fountain. Testimonies don't mention this, so not directly contradicting.\n\nWait, perhaps Testimony 4 says they were on their own for the finals. But Evidence 13 (Ms. Scone's Statement) says Frost's sculptures in the finals were scrumptious except the lyre was salty. If Frost was a novice baker, how did his finals entry taste good except for one part? Maybe he had help, contradicting Testimony 4. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 25 (Poison Gas Ingredients) might connect to how the murder was committed, but testimonies here are about the collaboration.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing the key contradiction here. Let's think again. The main testimonies are about Gusto and Frost's collaboration. The key evidence related to that is Evidence 14 (Semifinal Entries: different designs, same taste) and Evidence 17 (Family Photo with Gusto's son visiting up through semifinal).\n\nIf Testimony 4 says their cooperation lasted through semifinals, then after that, they were on their own. Evidence 14 shows that in semifinals, their entries had same taste, implying collaboration. So no contradiction. Testimony 4 and Evidence 14 align.\n\nWait, but Testimony 2 says \"Until the day before the finals, they worked on their desserts together.\" If the finals are the next day, then the day before finals would be after the semifinals. But semifinals would have already concluded. So maybe the cooperation continued into preparing for finals, but the semifinals entries were done earlier. So the semifinal entries were made during their collaboration. Thus, the same taste (collaboration) but different designs (each did their own design). That still fits.\n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 14. Testimony 2 says they worked together until the day before finals, implying they were collaborating on their desserts up to that point. But the semifinals would have occurred before that. If the semifinal entries were made during their collaboration, but their entries have different designs, that suggests they worked on their own designs while collaborating. So no contradiction. Because collaboration doesn't necessarily mean identical designs, just working together. For example, Frost helps Gusto with design, and Gusto helps Frost with taste. So their own entries would have different designs (Frost's entry by Frost, Gusto's entry with Frost's help) but same taste (Gusto's work). So different designs but same taste. Hence, no contradiction.\n\nThis is getting a bit too deep. Maybe the actual contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 14. Testimony 4 says \"For the finals, they were on their own.\" But Evidence 14 is about semifinals. So if during semifinals they were collaborating, then the different designs but same taste aligns. No contradiction here.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for another pair.\n\nWait, Evidence 28 is a photo of the murder weapon from the IS-7 Incident, a salt lamp with Frost's blood. Testimony 0-4 are about Gusto and Frost's connection. Not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 7: Salt Lamp in Scone's room stained with victim's blood. If the murder weapon is Scone's salt lamp, but testimonies don't mention her.\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let's check Testimony 3: \"Why? Because Gusto had poor design sense, and Frost was a novice at baking.\" So they teamed up. Evidence 14 shows that in semifinals, their entries had same taste (Gusto's work) and different designs (Frost's work). That's consistent. So no contradiction.\n\nAnother angle: Evidence 34 (Gemini Case Analysis) shows sugar matches Frost's room 18 years ago. Maybe connecting to past events, but testimonies don't address that.\n\nHmm. I'm struggling to find a clear contradiction. Maybe I need to look again.\n\nWait, Testimony 2 says \"Until the day before the finals, they worked on their desserts together.\" Evidence 14: \"Frost's and Gusto's creations had different designs, but tasted the same.\" If they worked together on their desserts (plural), meaning both Frost's and Gusto's entries, then the designs would be collaborative. But Evidence 14 says different designs, which implies they worked separately on designs. This could be a contradiction because Testimony 2 says they worked together, but the designs are different, suggesting they didn't collaborate on design. Therefore, Testimony 2 (saying they worked together on desserts) is contradicted by Evidence 14 (different designs). Because if they worked together, the designs should be similar or the same. But they are different. Hence, contradiction.\n\nSo the pair would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 2.\n\nBut wait, Testimony 3 explains that Gusto had poor design sense, so Frost handled design. So in their collaboration, Frost would design both entries. But why would the designs be different? Because each entry is for a different person. For example, Frost's entry has his own design, Gusto's entry has a design by Frost as well, but different from Frost's entry. That's possible. So their collaboration involves Frost designing both entries, but making them different. Thus, the different designs are due to Frost's work, and same taste due to Gusto's work. Therefore, no contradiction.\n\nBut Testimony 2 says they worked on their desserts together. So both Frost and Gusto worked on both desserts. So Frost's dessert would have his design and Gusto's taste, and Gusto's dessert would have Frost's design (since Gusto can't design well) and Gusto's taste. So both entries have same taste (Gusto) and different designs (Frost made two different designs). Therefore, Evidence 14 aligns with Testimony 2. So no contradiction.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm stuck here. Let's try to find another pair.\n\nLooking at Evidence 31: Ceramic Fragment from a teapot. Testimony 3 mentions Frost was a novice at baking, perhaps unrelated.\n\nWait, Evidence 30: Teapot designed by Paul Halique, Judy Bound's possession. But Testimony 3 is about Gusto and Frost's collaboration. Not directly related.\n\nWait, Evidence 3: Mr. Tangaroa's Teapot with his fingerprints. But testimonies are about Gusto and Frost.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 4 says they were on their own for finals. If during finals, Frost's entry had salty lyre (Evidence 13), which might indicate he didn't collaborate, which aligns. No contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 14. Testimony 2 says they worked together until the day before finals, but Evidence 14 shows that in semifinals (which are before finals), their entries had different designs. If they worked together, their entries would have been a joint effort, hence same designs. But they are different. So this is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, if they worked together, but each took charge of their own entry's design, then different designs but same taste is possible. So no contradiction.\n\nI think the intended answer is Evidence 14 contradicts Testimony 2 or 4. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe user asks to output one pair. Based on the given data, the most likely contradiction is between Testimony 2 (they worked together until day before finals) and Evidence 14 (semifinal entries had different designs but same taste). The testimony suggests they worked together on their desserts, which would include design and taste. But Evidence 14 shows that the designs were different, which implies they worked separately on design. Therefore, contradicting the testimony that they worked together.\n\nThus, the JSON answer would be {\"evidence\": 14, \"testimony\": 2}."

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by going through the testimonies and evidences provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the testimonies from Kate. Testimony 0 says that 18 years after Monsieur Master was arrested, she bought back the mansion. Then Testimony 1 mentions she decided to manage it as an art gallery to maintain it. Testimony 2 says she collected Pierre Hoquet's works from all over. Testimony 4 states she prepared replicas of the sculptures in the Winter Palace based on photos she took.\n\nNow looking at the evidences. Evidence 21 is the Winter Wing Photo, which shows statues matching those made by the victim (Artie Frost) eighteen years ago. Evidence 12 is Mr. Frost's Room, a photo of his sculptures taken by Judy Bound and Detective Badd. \n\nWait, if Kate's Testimony 4 says she prepared replicas based on her own photos, but Evidence 21 shows that the statues in the Winter Wing match those made by Frost 18 years ago. So if Frost made the original sculptures, and Kate made replicas based on her photos, but the Winter Wing statues are Frost's originals, that would be a contradiction. Because if Frost's sculptures are the originals, then Kate's replicas would be based on her photos, but if the Winter Wing statues (which are supposed to be her replicas) are actually Frost's originals, that contradicts her statement. Alternatively, maybe the Winter Wing statues are the replicas, but the evidence shows they match Frost's originals exactly, which might imply they are the same, not replicas. So if Kate claims she made replicas, but the evidence shows the statues are the originals by Frost, that's a contradiction.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 4 says Kate prepared replicas based on her photos. But Evidence 21 is a photo of statues matching Frost's from 18 years ago. If Frost's sculptures were destroyed or lost, and Kate's replicas are based on photos, but the Winter Wing statues (which are supposed to be replicas) are actually Frost's original works, that would mean she didn't make replicas but used the originals. So her testimony about making replicas contradicts the evidence showing the statues are original Frost works.\n\nSo the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (Kate saying she made replicas based on her photos) and Evidence 21 (Winter Wing Photo showing statues matching Frost's original works from 18 years ago). Therefore, if the statues in the Winter Wing are actually Frost's originals, Kate's claim of creating replicas would be false."

    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair, so I need to look through all the testimonies and see which one conflicts with any of the evidence provided.\n\nFirst, I'll start by reviewing the testimonies. Let's look at Gusto's testimonies since he has several. Testimony 0 says that Frost and Gusto cooperated until the finals, with Gusto handling flavor and Frost design. Testimony 1 and 2 mention that for the finals, Gusto wanted to challenge the master (probably Tangaroa) on his own, so he made his entry alone. Testimony 4 adds that the finals weren't much different from the semifinals except for not cooperating with Frost. \n\nNow, looking at the evidence. Evidence 14 is the Semifinal Entries, which states that Frost's and Gusto's creations had different designs but tasted the same. This makes sense if they were cooperating in the semifinals\u2014since Frost did design and Gusto did flavor, their semifinal entries would have different designs (since Frost is responsible for that) but same taste (Gusto's work). But in the finals, according to Gusto's testimony (Testimony 2 and 4), he made his entry alone. However, if the finals weren't much different from the semifinals except for the cooperation, but Gusto's own entry would now have both design and flavor done by himself. But wait, there's evidence that in the semifinals, their entries tasted the same. However, if in the finals, Gusto's entry was made alone, perhaps the flavor would be different? But how does that contradict?\n\nWait, looking at Testimony 4: \"Aside from not cooperating with Sir Frost, the finals weren't much different from the semifinals.\" So in the semifinals, they cooperated (as per Testimony 0), leading to same taste (Evidence 14). In the finals, Gusto worked alone. If the finals weren't much different except for cooperation, but Gusto's testimony says he did his own, then perhaps the taste would be different. But how does that contradict with any evidence?\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 2 where Gusto claims he made his own entry completely alone, and Evidence 14 which says that in the semifinals, their entries had same taste. But Testimony 2 is about the finals. Wait, Evidence 14 is about the semifinal entries. The semifinal entries had same taste because they were cooperating. Then in the finals, if Gusto made his own, then the taste would be different. But there's no evidence about the finals' taste. Hmm.\n\nWait, another angle: Testimony 4 says the finals weren't much different from the semifinals except for not cooperating. But in the semifinals, their entries had same taste (Evidence 14). If the finals were similar except for not cooperating, that suggests that in the finals, Gusto's entry would have a different design (since he's not working with Frost) but same flavor. But if he's making it on his own, the flavor could be different. But how does this contradict?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a contradiction between Testimony 2 and Evidence 14. Wait, Testimony 2: \"I helped Sir Frost make his entry, but I made mine completely on my own.\" Wait, Testimony 2 is from Gusto. Wait, if in the semifinals, they cooperated (Testimony 0), but in the finals, he made his own. Then Evidence 14 is about the semifinals. So maybe Testimony 2 is about the finals. Then there's no direct contradiction here.\n\nWait, maybe looking elsewhere. Let's check other testimonies. Testimony 5: Gusto says Frost's son and his own attended the same school. Evidence 17 is a family photo of Frost, Gusto, and their sons. That seems consistent. Not a contradiction.\n\nAnother possibility: Testimony 3 says if the flavor wasn't good enough, it's his own lack of training. But if in the semifinals, they tasted the same (Evidence 14), but since Gusto was handling flavor, then maybe that's consistent. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at Evidence 14 again: semifinal entries had different designs but same taste. Testimony 0 says they cooperated (Frost design, Gusto flavor). So in the semifinals, their entries had different designs (since Frost did design) but same taste (Gusto's work). That makes sense. Then in the finals, Gusto went solo. So his entry would have both design and flavor by himself. If the finals' entries were different in design and taste, but the problem is that Testimony 4 says the finals weren't much different from the semifinals except for the cooperation. So if the semifinal entries had same taste but different designs, then in the finals, if Gusto is doing both, then his entry's taste and design would be his own. But how does that contradict any evidence? Maybe there's no direct contradiction here.\n\nWait, looking at Evidence 13: Ms. Scone's Statement says that Frost's sculptures in the finals were \"scrumptious\" except for the lyre, which was salty. That might tie into something else. But how?\n\nAnother angle: Evidence 34 (Gemini Case Analysis) says that the sugar composition matches that from Frost's room 18 years ago and the fountain. If Gusto's semifinal entries had same taste (same sugar content?), maybe that connects. But not sure.\n\nWait, let's think again. The user wants a contradiction between a testimony and an evidence. So which testimony says something that is proven false by an evidence?\n\nLooking at Testimony 2: \"I helped Sir Frost make his entry, but I made mine completely on my own.\" If this is about the finals, then Gusto is saying he made his own entry alone. But Evidence 14 is about the semifinal entries. Wait, no. So if in the semifinals, they cooperated (Testimony 0), and the semifinal entries had same taste (Evidence 14). Then in the finals, Gusto made his own entry (Testimony 2). But Evidence 14 is about the semifinals, not the finals. So no contradiction here.\n\nWait, what about Testimony 4: \"Aside from not cooperating with Sir Frost, the finals weren't much different from the semifinals.\" So in the semifinals, they cooperated (design by Frost, flavor by Gusto), entries had same taste. In the finals, Gusto made his own entry. If the finals weren't much different, then perhaps the entries in the finals would have similar structure. But if in the finals, Gusto made his own, maybe the design and flavor would be different. But how does that contradict any evidence?\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's check the evidence again. Evidence 8: Fake Confections are Scone's, which are fake models covered in cream. Evidence 7: Salt lamp with victim's blood. Maybe that's part of the murder weapon. But how does that tie to testimonies?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 14 (Semifinal Entries: Frost's and Gusto's creations had different designs, but tasted the same). Testimony 0: Gusto says they cooperated until the finals. He handled flavor, Frost design. So in the semifinals, their entries would have different designs (Frost's work) but same taste (Gusto's flavor). That's exactly what Evidence 14 says. So no contradiction here.\n\nTestimony 2: Gusto says he helped Frost make his entry but made his own completely. If this is about the finals, then Frost's entry would have been helped by Gusto, but Gusto's own entry was solo. But how does that contradict any evidence? Unless there's evidence that Frost's entry in the finals had Gusto's help, but I don't see that.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at Testimony 1: Gusto says he wanted to challenge the master with his own skills in the finals. So he made his own entry. If the finals' entries were made by Gusto alone, then maybe the taste would differ. But where's the evidence contradicting that?\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 14 says that in the semifinals, their entries tasted the same. So if in the semifinals, they worked together (Testimony 0), then that's consistent. No contradiction there.\n\nWait, maybe Testimony 4: \"the finals weren't much different from the semifinals.\" If in the semifinals, the entries had same taste, but different designs. If in the finals, the entries (from Gusto and Frost?) had different designs but perhaps same taste? But if Gusto was working alone in the finals, maybe his entry's taste would be different. But there's no evidence about the finals' taste. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another testimony. Testimony 5: Frost's son and Gusto's son attended the same school. Evidence 17 (Family Photo) shows Frost, Gusto, and their sons. So that's consistent. No contradiction.\n\nWait, what about Testimony 3: \"If the flavor of my entry wasn't good enough, my own lack of training was to blame.\" But if in the semifinals, the entries tasted the same (Evidence 14), which implies that Gusto's flavor was good enough. So maybe if in the finals, he did it alone and it wasn't good, that's his fault. But this doesn't contradict anything.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's check the evidence again. Evidence 14 is about semifinal entries. Testimony 0 says they cooperated until the finals. So semifinals were cooperative, finals were solo. Evidence 14's data is about the semifinals, which aligns with Testimony 0. So no conflict there.\n\nWait, Testimony 2: \"I helped Sir Frost make his entry, but I made mine completely on my own.\" If this is about the semifinals, then that would contradict Evidence 14. Because if in the semifinals, Gusto made his own entry alone, then their entries should have different tastes. But Evidence 14 says semifinal entries had same taste. But Testimony 0 says they cooperated until the finals, so in the semifinals, they worked together. So Testimony 2 must be about the finals, which is when they stopped cooperating. Therefore, in the finals, Gusto made his own entry. But Evidence 14 is about the semifinals, so no contradiction here.\n\nWait, but Testimony 2 says \"helped Sir Frost make his entry\", implying that in the finals, Frost had his own entry which Gusto helped with, while Gusto's own entry was made alone. But if they were in the finals, perhaps they each had their own entries, and Gusto helped Frost but made his own. But how does that contradict?\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the entries in the finals. If Gusto helped Frost with his entry, but Frost's entry in the finals had a salty lyre (Evidence 13 from Scone's statement), which was salty. Maybe that's related. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 25: Poison Gas Ingredients. Red Ubiquium and white Asphyxion mixed. But I don't see a testimony that contradicts that.\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 14. Testimony 4: \"the finals weren't much different from the semifinals except for not cooperating.\" So in the semifinals, they cooperated, leading to same taste (Evidence 14). In the finals, they didn't cooperate, so if the structure was similar, then the entries would have different tastes. But there's no evidence about the finals' taste. Unless Evidence 13 mentions the finals' taste. Evidence 13: Ms. Scone's statement that Frost's sculptures in the finals were scrumptious except the lyre was salty. So Frost's entry in the finals had a salty lyre. But if Gusto was handling flavor in the semifinals, then in the finals, Frost would have to handle his own flavor, which might lead to different tastes. But that's not a direct contradiction with any testimony.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Testimony 2 says Gusto made his entry completely on his own. If in the semifinals, he helped Frost and made his own, but in the semifinals, their entries had same taste, then Testimony 0 and 2 would conflict. Wait, Testimony 0: \"cooperated until the finals.\" So in the semifinals, they cooperated. Testimony 2 says he helped Frost but made his own entry. If Testimony 2 is about the semifinals, then that contradicts Evidence 14 (semifinal entries had same taste). Because if Gusto made his own entry in the semifinals, then their entries' tastes would differ, but Evidence 14 says they were the same. But Testimony 0 says they cooperated until the finals, so Testimony 2 must be about the finals, not the semifinals. So in the finals, he helped Frost but made his own. That wouldn't affect the semifinal entries. Therefore, no contradiction here.\n\nWait, but Testimony 2's person is Gusto. Let me check again. Testimony 0: Gusto says they cooperated until the finals. Testimony 2: \"I helped Sir Frost make his entry, but I made mine completely on my own.\" If this is about the semifinals, that contradicts Evidence 14 (same taste). But if Testimony 2 is about the finals, then there's no conflict. So how do we know which time period Testimony 2 refers to?\n\nLooking at the context of the testimonies. Testimonies 0-5 are all from Gusto. Testimony 0: cooperated until finals. Testimony 1: for the finals, wanted to challenge master. Testimony 2: helped Frost make his entry, but made mine alone. Testimony 3: if flavor wasn't good, his fault. Testimony 4: finals not much different except cooperation. Testimony 5: their sons attended same school.\n\nSo Testimony 2 is part of the sequence about the finals. Therefore, Gusto is talking about the finals here. So in the finals, he helped Frost with his entry but made his own. Then in the finals, Frost's entry would have design by Frost and flavor by Gusto (since he helped), but Gusto's own entry would be his own design and flavor. But if that's the case, then Frost's entry in the finals would have the same flavor as Gusto's entry (if Gusto was handling the flavor for Frost's entry). But according to Evidence 13 (Scone's statement), Frost's entry's lyre was salty. If Gusto was handling the flavor for Frost's entry, why would it be salty? Unless there was a mistake or sabotage. But how does that tie into contradiction?\n\nAlternatively, if Gusto claims he made his own entry completely on his own in the finals (Testimony 2), then his entry's taste would be his own. But if in the semifinals, their entries had same taste (Evidence 14), and in the finals, the flavor would differ. But there's no evidence about the finals' taste. However, Evidence 13 mentions the finals' entries. Scone says Frost's entry (the victim's) had a salty lyre, but others were scrumptious. If Frost's entry was made with Gusto's help (Testimony 2), then the flavor should be good (as per Gusto's expertise), but part of it was salty. That could imply something went wrong, but it's not a direct contradiction.\n\nHmm. I'm struggling to find a direct contradiction. Let's think differently. What about the fingerprints? Evidence 5: Frame Finger Marks with no prints. Evidence 27: same. Maybe a testimony that someone touched something but left no prints. But which testimony?\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 3: Mr. Tangaroa's teapot with his fingerprints. Testimony from someone who says they didn't touch it. But not sure.\n\nWait, maybe looking at the testimonies and evidence related to the same person. For example, Carmelo Gusto's testimonies. Let's focus on that.\n\nTestimony 0: Cooperated until finals. Evidence 14: semifinal entries had same taste. So that's consistent.\n\nTestimony 2: In the finals, he made his entry alone. So no contradiction here.\n\nWait, what about Testimony 4: \"Aside from not cooperating with Sir Frost, the finals weren't much different from the semifinals.\" So in the semifinals, they cooperated (same taste), in the finals, they didn't, but otherwise similar. If the process was similar, then the entries would be similar except for cooperation. But if they didn't cooperate in the finals, then Frost's entry would have his own flavor and design, and Gusto's entry would be his own. So their entries would have different designs and flavors. But how does that contradict any evidence?\n\nWait, but the victim's entry (Frost's) in the finals had a salty lyre (Evidence 13). If Frost was responsible for his own flavor in the finals (since Gusto wasn't helping), then the salty lyre makes sense. But if Gusto helped him (Testimony 2 says he helped Frost make his entry), then the flavor would have Gusto's input, leading to a good taste. But the lyre was salty. So perhaps this indicates that Gusto didn't help Frost, contradicting Testimony 2. But this is a stretch. Because Scone's statement (Evidence 13) is about the taste of Frost's entry in the finals. If Gusto helped Frost with the flavor, then why is part of it salty? Maybe that's a contradiction between Testimony 2 and Evidence 13. But the user wants evidence and testimony numbers. Let's check: Testimony 2 is Gusto's statement that he helped Frost make his entry (the finals). Evidence 13 is Scone's statement that Frost's entry's lyre was salty. If Gusto was helping with flavor, then the lyre shouldn't be salty. So this could be a contradiction. But Evidence 13 is from Scone, not Gusto. So the contradiction is between Gusto's Testimony 2 and Scone's statement (Evidence 13). But the user's question is about which evidence and testimony contradict each other, regardless of the person. So if Testimony 2 (Gusto) says he helped Frost, but Evidence 13 says part of Frost's entry was salty, that could indicate Gusto didn't help with flavor. But this is a possible contradiction.\n\nBut wait, Testimony 2 is from Gusto, and Evidence 13 is from Scone. The user is looking for a testimony and evidence that contradict each other, regardless of the person. So if Gusto claims he helped Frost with his entry (flavor), but the entry had a salty part (Evidence 13), that could be a contradiction. Because if Gusto was handling the flavor, the entry should not have a salty part. But maybe the salty part was intentional. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking back, maybe there's a more direct contradiction. Let's check Evidence 14 again: semifinal entries had different designs but same taste. Testimony 0: Gusto says they cooperated (he did flavor, Frost design). So that's consistent. No contradiction.\n\nWhat about Testimony 2: Gusto says he made his own entry completely on his own (in the finals). But if in the semifinals, the entries had same taste (Evidence 14), that's because he handled the flavor. But in the finals, if he made his own entry, the taste would be his own. However, there's no evidence about the finals' taste. Unless Evidence 14 also refers to the finals, but no. Evidence 14 is specifically about semifinal entries.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's check another angle. Evidence 34 (Gemini Case Analysis Results) says sugar composition matches that from Frost's room 18 years ago and the fountain. But how does that relate to testimonies?\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 17: Family photo of Frost, Gusto, and their sons. Gusto's son visited daily through semifinal. Testimony 5: their sons attended same school. No contradiction.\n\nWait, Evidence 14: semifinal entries had same taste. Testimony 0: Gusto handled flavor. So that's consistent. No contradiction.\n\nWait, Testimony 2: Gusto says he made his own entry completely on his own. If this is about the semifinals, then that would contradict Evidence 14. But Testimony 0 says they cooperated until the finals, so Testimony 2 must be about the finals. So no contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 14. Testimony 4 says the finals weren't much different from the semifinals except for not cooperating. So in the semifinals, entries had same taste (Evidence 14), but in the finals, since they didn't cooperate, their entries' flavors would be different. But if Testimony 4 claims the finals weren't different, that would imply the flavors were the same, which contradicts the fact that they didn't cooperate. So if the flavors were different, but Testimony 4 says the finals weren't much different, that could be a contradiction. But how does that tie to evidence?\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 4 says the finals were similar to the semifinals except for cooperation. In the semifinals, entries had same taste (Evidence 14). If the finals were similar, then the entries would have same taste, but they didn't cooperate. That's a contradiction because if they didn't cooperate, their entries' flavors should be different. But there's no evidence about the finals' taste. Therefore, this isn't a direct contradiction with evidence.\n\nI'm going in circles here. Let's try another approach. The user wants one pair. Let me look for a testimony that directly states something that is proven false by an evidence.\n\nFor example, if a testimony says \"I was not at the scene\", but an evidence places them there. But in the given data, perhaps Testimony 2 and Evidence 14.\n\nWait, Testimony 2: \"I helped Sir Frost make his entry, but I made mine completely on my own.\" If this is about the semifinals, then Gusto's own entry would have been made by himself, leading to different taste from Frost's. But Evidence 14 says semifinal entries had same taste. Therefore, if Testimony 2 is about the semifinals, it contradicts Evidence 14. But Testimony 0 says they cooperated until the finals. So Testimony 2 must be about the finals, not the semifinals. Therefore, no contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, if Testimony 2 is about the semifinals, then contradiction. But according to Testimony 0, they cooperated until the finals, meaning they cooperated in the semifinals. Therefore, Testimony 2's help to Frost and making his own entry must refer to the finals. Hence, no contradiction.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for another pair. Let's check other testimonies and evidence.\n\nTestimony 1: Gusto wanted to challenge the master with his own skills in the finals. Evidence 8: Fake Confections by Scone. Not directly related.\n\nEvidence 16: Victim's blood in fountain, not at crime scene. Testimonies about where the murder happened?\n\nEvidence 7: Salt lamp with victim's blood. Testimony from someone about the murder weapon. Maybe someone claims the weapon was something else.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3: Gusto blames himself if the flavor wasn't good. Evidence 14 says semifinal entries had same taste. If the flavor was good, then Testimony 3 is not contradicted. Not helpful.\n\nWait, another angle. Evidence 14 says semifinal entries had same taste, which implies Gusto's work. But Testimony 3 says if the flavor wasn't good, it's his fault. But since semifinal entries were same taste, perhaps that means the flavor was good. But Testimony 3 is hypothetical. No contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 14. Because Testimony 2 says Gusto made his entry completely on his own, implying that in the finals, the taste would be different from Frost's. But there's no evidence about the finals' taste. Alternatively, if Testimony 2 is about the semifinals, then it contradicts Evidence 14, but Testimony 0 says they cooperated until finals. Therefore, Testimony 2 must be about the finals. No contradiction.\n\nI'm really not finding it. Maybe I should look for another pair. Let's think about the teapot. Evidence 3: Mr. Tangaroa's teapot with his fingerprints. Evidence 30: Teapot designed by Halique, Judy Bound's possession. So the teapot in Evidence 3 has Tangaroa's fingerprints, but it's Bound's possession. Maybe someone's testimony says something about who used the teapot. But there's no testimony from Tangaroa or Bound about it.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony from Judy Bound? Wait, the testimonies provided are only from Gusto. The user provided testimonies 0-5, all from Gusto. So other characters' testimonies are not listed here. So maybe the contradiction is among Gusto's testimonies and evidence.\n\nWait, the user provided testimonies 0-5, all from Gusto. So other testimonies from other characters are not part of the given data. Therefore, the contradiction must be between one of Gusto's testimonies and an evidence.\n\nLet me focus again. Testimony 2: Gusto says he made his own entry completely on his own. If this is about the semifinals, it contradicts Evidence 14. But according to Testimony 0, they cooperated until the finals. So semifinals were cooperative. Therefore, Testimony 2 must be about the finals, no contradiction.\n\nTestimony 4: finals weren't much different except cooperation. If in the semifinals, the entries had same taste, and the finals were similar, then in the finals, entries would also have same taste. But since they didn't cooperate, Gusto's entry's taste would be his own, possibly different. But how does this contradict evidence?\n\nWait, if the finals were not much different from the semifinals (Testimony 4), but in the semifinals, entries had same taste (Evidence 14), then in the finals, entries should also have same taste. But if they didn't cooperate, that's impossible. Therefore, Testimony 4 contradicts Evidence 14. Because Testimony 4 claims the finals were similar to the semifinals (same process, just without cooperation), but in the semifinals, the same taste was due to cooperation. Without cooperation, the taste would differ, making the finals different, contradicting Testimony 4.\n\nBut how does that contradict the evidence? Evidence 14 is about the semifinal entries. Testimony 4 is about the finals being similar. The contradiction would be logical, but not directly with evidence unless there's evidence about the finals' entries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a testimony that directly states something that is proven false by evidence. For example, if Gusto says in the semifinals he made his own entry, but evidence shows they had same taste. But Testimony 0 says they cooperated until the finals, which aligns with Evidence 14. So no contradiction.\n\nWait, I'm really stuck. Let's try to see if any evidence and testimony have conflicting information. Let's list out the possibilities:\n\nEvidence 14: Semifinal entries had same taste.\nTestimony 0: Cooperated until finals (so semifinals were cooperative, leading to same taste). No contradiction.\n\nTestimony 2: Made his own entry (finals), no contradiction with Evidence 14.\n\nTestimony 4: Finals not much different from semifinals except cooperation. If the only difference is cooperation, then in the finals, their entries would have different designs (since Frost is not helping) but same taste (if Gusto continued doing flavor alone). But Evidence 14 says in the semifinals, designs were different but taste same. So if in the finals, the taste was same, but designs different, then Testimony 4's statement is true. But there's no evidence about finals' taste. Therefore, no contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 14. Testimony 4 says the finals weren't different from semifinals except for cooperation. In the semifinals, entries had same taste (Evidence 14). If in the finals, they didn't cooperate, then the entries would have different tastes, making the finals different from semifinals, contradicting Testimony 4. But this is a logical deduction, not a direct evidence contradiction. The user wants a direct contradiction between a testimony and an evidence.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear answer, I'll make an educated guess. The most likely pair is Testimony 2 (Gusto claiming he made his entry completely on his own) conflicting with Evidence 14 (semifinal entries had same taste). But Testimony 2 is about the finals, so no. Alternatively, maybe Testimony 4 and Evidence 14. If Testimony 4 says the finals were similar to semifinals except cooperation, but in the semifinals, entries had same taste due to cooperation. In the finals, without cooperation, the taste would differ, but Testimony 4 claims they weren't much different, which could contradict. But since there's no evidence about the finals' taste, this is indirect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Testimony 2 and Evidence 14. If Gusto claims he made his entry alone in the finals, but Evidence 14 says semifinals entries had same taste. But that's not a direct contradiction. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Testimony 2 says he helped Frost make his entry, but made his own. If this is about the semifinals, then it contradicts Evidence 14. But Testimony 0 says they cooperated until the finals. Therefore, Testimony 2 must be about the finals. So no contradiction. \n\nAfter reviewing, I think the correct answer is Testimony 2 (Gusto's) and Evidence 14. But I'm not entirely sure. However, given the options, this seems plausible. But maybe another pair. \n\nWait, Testimony 4 says \"the finals weren't much different from the semifinals except for not cooperating with Sir Frost.\" If the semifinals had entries with same taste (Evidence 14), but in the finals, since they didn't cooperate, the taste would be different. Therefore, the finals were different in taste, contradicting Testimony 4. But there's no evidence about finals' taste, so this is not directly contradicted by evidence. \n\nHmm. Maybe there's another pair. Let's check Evidence 17: Family Photo of Frost, Gusto, and their sons. Testimony 5: Frost's son and Gusto's son attended same school. These are consistent. \n\nWait, another angle. Evidence 34 (Gemini Case Analysis) mentions sugar detected matches that from Frost's room 18 years ago. If Gusto's testimony about his son visiting up to the semifinal (Evidence 17) is relevant, but I don't see a contradiction. \n\nI'm really stuck. The most likely candidate I can think of is Testimony 2 (Gusto's statement about making his own entry) and Evidence 14 (semifinal entries' same taste), but only if Testimony 2 refers to the semifinals, which it doesn't. So perhaps the actual answer is Testimony 4 and Evidence 14. Because Testimony 4 says the finals weren't much different except cooperation, but in the semifinals, the entries had same taste due to cooperation. If in the finals, they didn't cooperate, the taste would be different, making the finals different, contradicting Testimony 4. But without evidence about the finals' taste, this is indirect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 14. Testimony 0 says they cooperated until the finals, with Gusto handling flavor. Evidence 14 says semifinal entries had same taste, which aligns. So no contradiction. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user wants one pair. The answer is likely {\"evidence\": 14, \"testimony\": 4}. Because Testimony 4 says finals weren't much different except cooperation, but Evidence 14 shows that in the semifinals, same taste. If the finals were not different except cooperation, then the taste would still be same, which isn't possible without cooperation. Hence, contradiction. So if the finals' entries tasted different due to lack of cooperation, then Testimony 4 is contradicted by the fact that in the semifinals, cooperation led to same taste. But this is a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, the real answer is Testimony 2 and Evidence 14. But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with Evidence 14 and Testimony 4. So {\"evidence\": 14, \"testimony\": 4}."

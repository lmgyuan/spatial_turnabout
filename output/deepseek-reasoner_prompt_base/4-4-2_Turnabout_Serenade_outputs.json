    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of Lamiroir's testimonies. Let me go through each testimony and check against the evidence provided.\n\nTestimony 3 says Lamiroir went backstage for just a moment after her performance. But looking at the evidence, Evidence 6 is the Key Ring found in the victim's left hand. The key ring holds keys to a guitar case and a motorcycle. Wait, how does that relate? Hmm, maybe another evidence. Evidence 3 is the Investigation Request, which mentions restricting info to police and related parties. Not sure.\n\nTestimony 2 states she did not return backstage after the second set. But wait, Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance. Wait, the second set might be part of the performance. Let me check. The concert might have multiple sets. If her performance was part of the second set, then Testimony 2 says she didn't return backstage after the second set, but Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance. That could be a contradiction if her performance was in the second set. So she says she didn't return backstage after the second set (Testimony 2) but also says she went backstage after her performance (Testimony 3). If her performance was during the second set, then Testimony 2 and 3 would contradict. But how does evidence tie in?\n\nWait, maybe the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim in Lamiroir's room. If she went backstage (her dressing room) after her performance, she might have seen something. But in Testimony 4, she says she saw nothing because the body was behind a wall. But Evidence 10 (Diagram) says the crime scene was her dressing room, and from the door, the victim was blocked by items. So when she went backstage, she might have entered her room, but the body was blocked. But how does that contradict?\n\nWait, let's look at Evidence 5: Revolver belonging to LeTouse. If the murder weapon was his own revolver, maybe that's relevant. But how does that tie to a testimony?\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance. But Evidence 8 (Autopsy Report) says time of death was 9:00-9:30 PM. If her performance ended at a time that would mean she was backstage during the time of death, then maybe her presence contradicts her not seeing anything. But Testimony 4 says she saw nothing because the body was blocked.\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Testimony 2. But the question is about evidence contradicting testimony. So perhaps one of the testimonies is contradicted by evidence. Let me check each testimony against evidence.\n\nTestimony 0: \"I saw nothing.\" Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) shows smeared writing in blood next to the victim's right hand. If Lamiroir was there, she might have seen that. But according to Testimony 4, she says she saw nothing because the body was behind a wall. So maybe not.\n\nTestimony 3: She went backstage after her performance. Evidence 10 (Diagram) says the crime scene was her dressing room, and when looking from the door, the victim was blocked by items. If she went into her dressing room, she might have seen something. But according to Testimony 4, she didn't see the body. But the key here is, if she entered her dressing room, she would have been at the crime scene around the time of death. The autopsy report says time of death is 9:00-9:30 PM. If her performance ended around that time, she would have been there when the murder happened. But how does that contradict her testimony?\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance. But Evidence 12 is the Headset with a 30-foot range. Maybe the headset's range could have allowed communication, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance. Evidence 14 is the Forum Diagram, which might show the layout of the coliseum. If her dressing room is in a location that would require her to pass through the crime scene, or if the diagram shows that going backstage would have put her in the vicinity of the crime scene. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Testimony 6: She was led to Gavin's dressing room. Evidence 17 is Gavin's Guitar, which was burned. But not sure.\n\nWait, Testimony 2: \"I did not return backstage after the second set.\" Testimony 3: \"When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment...\" If the second set includes her performance, then Testimony 2 and 3 contradict each other. But the question is about evidence contradicting testimony. So perhaps one of these testimonies is contradicted by evidence.\n\nWait, Evidence 10 (Diagram) says the crime scene was her dressing room. If she went backstage (to her dressing room) after her performance, but the victim was there, then the time of death (9:00-9:30 PM) would coincide with when she was there. But if she says she didn't see anything because the body was blocked (Testimony 4), but the evidence (Crime Photo) shows the victim in a position where she might have seen the blood writing. However, the diagram says from the door, the victim was blocked by items. So maybe she couldn't see the body. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: The Revolver (Evidence 5) is LeTouse's own gun. If he was shot with his own gun, maybe that's a clue. But how does that relate to testimony?\n\nWait, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 3 (she went backstage after performance) and Evidence 6 (Key Ring in victim's hand). The Key Ring has keys to a motorcycle and guitar case. If LeTouse was holding the keys when he died, but Lamiroir went backstage after her performance, maybe she could have taken the keys or been present when he was killed. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 15 (Igniter) is identical to the one in Gavin's Guitar (Evidence 17). If the igniter was triggered by the remote (Evidence 13), which has a 30-foot range. The Headset (Evidence 12) also has a 30-foot range. Maybe the use of the remote trigger relates to the timing of the crime. But how does that connect to Lamiroir's testimony?\n\nWait, Testimony 3 says she went backstage for a moment after her performance. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 8) says time of death 9:00-9:30 PM. If her performance ended around that time, she would have been there during the murder. If the crime scene was her dressing room, she might have been present. But she claims she didn't see anything because the body was behind a wall. However, Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) shows the victim in her room with blood writing. If she was there, maybe she should have heard the gunshot or seen something else. But her Testimony 0 says she saw nothing, which might be contradicted by evidence showing the body was in her room. Wait, but the Diagram (Evidence 10) mentions that from the door, the victim was blocked by items. So maybe she didn't see the body. But maybe the key is that she entered the room, but the Key Ring (Evidence 6) was in the victim's hand. If she was there, perhaps she could have taken the keys, but there's no direct contradiction here.\n\nWait, another angle: The Brooch (Evidence 4) belongs to Lamiroir and was found at the crime scene. If she went backstage (her room), she might have left the brooch there. But that's not a contradiction with her testimony. She says she went backstage, so finding her brooch there is normal.\n\nHmm. Let's think again. The question is to find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts a specific testimony. Let's look for contradictions.\n\nTestimony 2: \"I did not return backstage after the second set.\" But Testimony 3: \"I went backstage after my performance.\" If the second set is her performance, then these two testimonies contradict each other. However, the user is asking for evidence contradicting testimony, not testimony contradicting another testimony.\n\nLooking at Evidence 3: Investigation Request restricts info. Not relevant. Evidence 6: Key Ring. Maybe the keys are to a motorcycle and guitar case. If the victim was holding them, and the murderer needed access to those items, perhaps. But not directly related to Lamiroir's testimony.\n\nWait, Testimony 5: \"I saw bullet holes in the wall and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot.\" But Evidence 10 (Diagram) says that when observing from the door, the victim was blocked by items. So if she saw bullet holes, that's possible, but the Diagram says bullet holes were on the wall where the door was. So she could have seen the bullet holes from the door even if the body was hidden. So that's not a contradiction.\n\nWait, Testimony 3: She went backstage after her performance. Evidence 12 (Headset) has a 30-foot range. If she was wearing the headset, and the crime happened in her dressing room, maybe someone could have communicated via the headset. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 11 (Video Tape) of Lamiroir's performance. If the video shows her leaving the stage at a certain time, conflicting with her testimony about when she went backstage. But without details on the video, hard to say.\n\nWait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 8) says time of death 9:00-9:30 PM. If her performance ended at, say, 9:00 PM, and she went backstage immediately, that's within the time frame. So she was there during the time of death. If the murder happened then, she might have been present. But she claims she didn't see the body (Testimony 4) because it was blocked. But the Diagram (Evidence 10) supports that she couldn't see the body from the door. So no contradiction there.\n\nHmm. Maybe the contradiction is in Testimony 3 and Evidence 8. If she went backstage after her performance, which ended at a certain time, and the time of death is 9:00-9:30, maybe she was there during the murder. But unless the evidence specifically states that she couldn't have been there at that time, which I don't see.\n\nWait, another possibility: The Revolver (Evidence 5) is LeTouse's own gun. If he was shot with his own gun, perhaps implying that the killer took it from him. But how does that contradict testimony?\n\nAlternatively, the Key Ring (Evidence 6) in the victim's left hand. If Lamiroir went backstage, maybe she should have noticed the keys, but she claims she saw nothing. But the keys were in his hand, which was next to the blood writing (Crime Photo 9). If she entered the room, maybe she would have seen the keys or the blood writing. But according to the Diagram (Evidence 10), from the door, the victim's body was blocked by items, so she might not have seen the keys or the blood. Therefore, no contradiction.\n\nWait, Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance. Evidence 14 (Forum Diagram) might show the layout of the coliseum. If the Forum Diagram shows that the backstage area is separate from the dressing rooms, or if there's a detail that her going backstage would require passing through certain areas where the crime occurred. But without specific details on the diagram, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, the Remote Trigger (Evidence 13) and Igniter (Evidence 15) are connected. The trigger works within 30 feet, same as the Headset (Evidence 12). If the igniter was used to start a fire, maybe during the concert. But how does this relate to Lamiroir's testimony?\n\nWait, the Brooch (Evidence 4) belongs to Lamiroir and was found at the crime scene. If she went backstage, she might have dropped it there, which is consistent. No contradiction.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance, but Evidence 3 (Investigation Request) restricts information to police and related parties. Maybe she shouldn't have been allowed backstage, but that's a stretch.\n\nWait, Testimony 7 says she wasn't told the details when she was in Gavin's room. Evidence 3 (Investigation Request) restricts info, so that's consistent.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the evidence again. Evidence 9's caption mentions smeared writing in blood. If Lamiroir was in the room after the murder, maybe she could have seen that writing. But she claims she saw nothing (Testimony 4). However, the Diagram (Evidence 10) says the victim was blocked from sight when viewed from the door. So she might not have seen the body or the blood writing. So no contradiction here.\n\nWait, the Key Ring (Evidence 6) was found in the victim's left hand. If Lamiroir went backstage, perhaps she should have seen the keys, but according to the Diagram, she couldn't see the body. So maybe she didn't. But this isn't a contradiction.\n\nLet me think again. The user wants one pair where evidence contradicts testimony. Which one is the most direct?\n\nMaybe Testimony 3 (she went backstage after her performance) and Evidence 10 (Diagram of the crime scene). The Diagram shows that from the door, the victim was blocked by items, but if she entered the room, she might have had to move around those items, potentially seeing the body. But her Testimony 4 says she didn't see the body. However, Evidence 10 supports that she couldn't see it from the door. So maybe that's not a contradiction.\n\nWait, Testimony 3 says she went backstage for just a moment. The Key Ring (Evidence 6) is in the victim's hand. If the victim was clutching the keys when he died, and she was there, maybe she could have taken them, but there's no evidence she did. So this isn't a contradiction.\n\nWait, the Brooch (Evidence 4) was found at the crime scene and belongs to Lamiroir. If she went backstage, she might have dropped it there, which is possible. But that's not a contradiction with her testimony.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 2: \"I did not return backstage after the second set.\" Testimony 3: \"I went backstage after my performance.\" If the second set is the same as her performance, then these testimonies conflict. But the user is looking for evidence that contradicts a testimony, not internal contradictions.\n\nAh! Evidence 11 is the Video Tape of Lamiroir's performance. If the video shows that after her performance, she did go backstage, which aligns with Testimony 3, but contradicts Testimony 2 if the second set is when she performed. However, the problem is we don't know the content of the video. But the user might assume that the Video Tape (Evidence 11) would show her leaving the stage and going backstage, thus confirming Testimony 3 but contradicting Testimony 2. But since we don't have explicit details, maybe this is a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Testimony 3 (\"I went backstage after my performance\") is contradicted by Evidence 8 (Autopsy Report time of death 9:00-9:30 PM) if her performance ended after 9:30, meaning she couldn't have been there during the time of death. But we don't know the timing of her performance.\n\nWait, let's think about the timeline. If the murder happened between 9-9:30 PM, and she went backstage after her performance, which ended at, say, 9:15 PM, then she was there during the time of death. But there's no evidence that directly states the time of her performance. However, the concert's structure might have multiple sets. For example, the second set could end before 9 PM, and her performance was in the second set. Then, Testimony 2 says she didn't return backstage after the second set, but Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance (which was part of the second set). That would mean she did return backstage after the second set, contradicting Testimony 2. But this is a contradiction between testimonies, not evidence.\n\nBut the user wants evidence contradicting testimony. The key might be Evidence 6 (Key Ring) and Testimony 3. If she went backstage, she might have had access to the keys, but there's no direct contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the Remote Trigger (Evidence 13) and Headset (Evidence 12) both have 30-foot ranges. If someone triggered the igniter (Evidence 15) using the remote from 30 feet away, maybe Lamiroir was in the vicinity. But how does this relate to her testimony?\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (she went backstage after her performance) and Evidence 10 (Diagram) which shows two bullet holes on the door's wall. If she was in the room after the shooting, she should have noticed the bullet holes. But Testimony 5 says she saw the bullet holes and knew LeTouse was shot. Wait, Testimony 5 says she saw the bullet holes, which aligns with Evidence 10. So no contradiction there.\n\nHmm. I'm struggling to find a direct contradiction. Let me try another approach. Let's look for a testimony that is factually impossible given the evidence.\n\nFor example, Lamiroir says she didn't return backstage after the second set (Testimony 2), but there's evidence she was there. If Evidence 4 (Brooch) was found at the crime scene (her room), and she had to have been there to leave it. But she says she didn't return after the second set. However, if the second set is before the murder, and she returned later, maybe during a different time, that's possible. But the Brooch could have been there before.\n\nAlternatively, if the Brooch was found at the crime scene (her room) and she claims she didn't return after the second set, but the Brooch was left there after, that contradicts. But without knowing when she lost the Brooch, it's unclear.\n\nWait, Evidence 4 says the Brooch belongs to Lamiroir and was found at the crime scene. If she wasn't there after the second set (Testimony 2), how did her Brooch end up there? Unless someone else took it there. But this could be a possible contradiction. Testimony 2 says she didn't return after the second set, but her Brooch is in her room (crime scene). If the murder happened after the second set, then she must have returned to leave the Brooch, contradicting Testimony 2. But the Brooch could have been there before. Not necessarily.\n\nAlternatively, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 8) says time of death 9:00-9:30. If the second set ended before 9 PM, and she didn't return after that, but the murder happened in her room during 9-9:30, then she couldn't have been there. But if she went backstage after her performance (Testimony 3), which was part of the second set, and the second set ended at, say, 8:45 PM, then she went backstage at 8:45, and the murder happened at 9 PM. So she wasn't there during the murder. But this requires timeline assumptions.\n\nI'm not making progress. Let me look for the most likely answer from the game's context, as this seems like a scenario from a specific case. In the game \"Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney,\" the case with Lamiroir and the Borginian cocoon involves a contradiction where Lamiroir's testimony about not returning backstage is contradicted by evidence showing she was there. Specifically, she claims she didn't return after the second set, but evidence like the Brooch or the Key Ring might place her there. However, the correct contradiction in that case is usually between her Testimony 2 (not returning after second set) and the fact that she went backstage after her performance (Testimony 3), which was part of the second set. But this is testimony vs testimony. However, if the performance was part of the second set, then Testimony 2 and 3 contradict each other. But the question requires evidence contradicting testimony. \n\nWait, maybe the Mixing Board (Evidence 7) allows music to be played in separate tracks. If the performance was pre-recorded, then she might not have been on stage, but this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, the Headset (Evidence 12) with a 30-foot range. If she was wearing it and the crime happened in her room, which is more than 30 feet away, perhaps her headset wouldn't work, but this is a stretch.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem, the answer likely is Testimony 2 (\"I did not return backstage after the second set\") contradicted by Evidence 3 (Investigation Request), but I don't see how. \n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 (\"I went backstage after my performance\") and Evidence 14 (Forum Diagram) which might show that backstage access was impossible at that time. But again, without details on the diagram, it's hard.\n\nWait, the Revolver (Evidence 5) is LeTouse's own gun. If the murder happened with his gun, it suggests he was killed by someone who took his gun. If Lamiroir was there, she could have seen the gun, but she claims she saw nothing. But according to the Diagram, the body was hidden, so she might not have seen it. So no contradiction.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe the answer is Testimony 3 (went backstage) and Evidence 6 (Key Ring in victim's hand). If she went backstage, she might have seen the keys, but she says she saw nothing. But according to the Diagram, she couldn't see the body. So maybe this isn't a contradiction. \n\nWait, the Key Ring was found in the victim's left hand, and the Crime Photo shows smeared writing in blood next to his right hand. If she entered the room, she might have seen the blood writing, but Testimony 4 says she didn't see the body. But the Diagram says from the door, the victim was blocked. So she might not have seen the blood writing. \n\nPerhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 8 (Autopsy time of death). If she went backstage after her performance, which ended at 9 PM, and the time of death is 9:00-9:30, she was there during the murder. But she claims she didn't see anything, which might be possible if the murder happened after she left. But without knowing the exact time, it's not a direct contradiction.\n\nIn the game, the actual contradiction is that Lamiroir's testimony about not returning backstage after the second set is contradicted by the fact that she did return to her dressing room (crime scene) after her performance, which was part of the second set. This is highlighted by the Brooch being found there, showing she was present. So the evidence would be the Brooch (4) and Testimony 2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Testimony 2 says she didn't return backstage after the second set, but the Brooch (Evidence 4) was found in the crime scene (her dressing room), which she would have had to have been there to leave it. Therefore, the evidence contradicts her testimony.\n"

    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.\n\nFirst, let me go through the testimonies given by Ema. There are six of them. Testimony 5 says, \"From the state of the crime scene, I conclude the shooter was blind.\" The key point here is that the shooter is claimed to be blind. \n\nNow, looking at the evidence list, I need to find evidence that would contradict the idea that the shooter was blind. Let's see. The evidence related to the crime scene includes the Revolver (Evidence 5), which is the murder weapon belonging to LeTouse. Then there's the Crime Photo (Evidence 9), which mentions the victim was shot in the shoulder and there's smeared writing in blood next to his right hand. The Diagram (Evidence 10) shows bullet holes on the wall where the door was. \n\nBut the key contradiction might come from Testimony 5's assertion that the shooter was blind. If the shooter was blind, how would they be able to aim accurately? But wait, maybe there's evidence that suggests the shooter didn't need to see. Alternatively, maybe the evidence shows that the shooter had to have sight. \n\nLooking at Evidence 15: Igniter found at the crime scene, which is triggered by a remote within 30 feet. Also, the Switch \u2192 Remote Trigger (Evidence 13) triggers an igniter within 30 feet. The Headset (Evidence 12) has a 30-foot range. Hmm, perhaps the use of a remote trigger could mean the shooter didn't need to be present, but that's not directly related to blindness.\n\nWait, Testimony 5 says the shooter was blind. But if the shooter was blind, how could they have written something in blood? The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) mentions smeared writing in blood next to the victim's right hand. If the victim (LeTouse) was the one who wrote it, maybe. But if the shooter wrote it, being blind would make that difficult. Alternatively, maybe the writing was left by the victim. But the testimony is about the shooter being blind, not the victim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bullets' placement. The Diagram (Evidence 10) says two bullet holes were found on the wall where the door was. If the shooter was blind, maybe the bullet holes' positions would be random, but maybe the evidence suggests precise shooting, which a blind person couldn't do. However, that's a bit speculative.\n\nWait, another angle: Evidence 5 is the Revolver, which is a high-caliber revolver belonging to LeTouse. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 8) says death was due to a gunshot wound. If the shooter was blind, they might have had to be close to the victim to hit them. But the crime scene might show that the shooter was at a distance. Alternatively, maybe the bullet holes in the wall (from the Diagram) suggest that shots were fired from a certain position, which would require sight to aim. But how does that directly contradict the shooter being blind?\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Testimony 3 by Ema: \"Machi practically left his signature at the scene.\" Machi is blind (Character 5). If Ema is saying that the shooter was blind (Testimony 5), and the signature left is Machi's, then maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) and some evidence that shows the shooter couldn't be blind. But perhaps there's a direct contradiction here. Wait, let's check the evidences again.\n\nEvidence 15: Igniter at the crime scene, which is triggered by the Remote Trigger (Evidence 13). If the murder was committed using the revolver (Evidence 5), then maybe the shooter had to aim. But if the shooter was blind, how? Alternatively, maybe the Revolver's ownership is LeTouse's, but the shooter took it. But that's not a direct contradiction.\n\nWait, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) and Evidence 9 (Crime Photo). The Crime Photo's caption says the victim's face was turned to the left, and there's smeared writing in blood next to his right hand. If the victim wrote that, maybe the writing is a clue. But if the shooter was blind, perhaps the way the crime was committed required sight, like the placement of the bullets. Alternatively, the Revolver's use would require seeing to aim, but a blind person could fire at close range.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, Evidence 2 is the Lyrics Sheet. The lyrics of Lamiroir's ballad might have some clues. But how does that relate to Testimony 5?\n\nWait, Testimony 0 says Ema thinks Machi stole the body because of some lyrics. Machi is blind. Testimony 3 says Machi left his signature. So Ema is accusing Machi, who is blind. Then Testimony 5 says the shooter was blind. So if Machi is the shooter, then the shooter being blind is consistent. But maybe some evidence contradicts that the shooter was blind.\n\nWait, the Revolver (Evidence 5) is the murder weapon. If the shooter was blind, could they have accurately shot the victim? Maybe the bullet holes in the wall (Diagram, Evidence 10) show that the shooter missed twice, hitting the door's wall. If the shooter was blind, perhaps they fired randomly, but the victim was hit once. But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 8) says death was from a gunshot wound. If the victim was hit once, but two bullet holes are in the wall, then maybe the shooter fired three shots: two missed into the wall, one hit. But a blind person might have trouble aiming. However, if the shooter was in close proximity, maybe they could hit the victim even without sight.\n\nAlternatively, the smeared writing in blood (Crime Photo, Evidence 9). If the shooter wrote that, being blind would make it difficult. But if the victim wrote it, then it's not related to the shooter's blindness. But Testimony 5 is about the shooter being blind, not the victim. So maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nWait, Evidence 6: Key Ring found in the victim's left hand. Holds keys to a guitar case and a motorcycle. If the shooter was blind, maybe they wouldn't be able to drive a motorcycle, but that's not directly related. \n\nAnother angle: The Igniter (Evidence 15) is triggered by a remote. If the murder was done via some remote device, perhaps the shooter didn't need to be present, which would contradict the shooter being blind. But Testimony 5 is about the shooter being blind, not their presence. \n\nWait, the Headset (Evidence 12) has a 30-foot range. If the shooter used the headset, maybe they were coordinating, but that's not directly related. \n\nAlternatively, the Revolver belongs to LeTouse, who was the victim. So the shooter took his gun. If LeTouse was the interpreter (Character 3), maybe there's another angle here.\n\nWait, Testimony 5 says the shooter was blind. If the shooter was blind, how would they know where to shoot? Unless they were in close proximity. But the crime scene's diagram (Evidence 10) says the victim was blocked from sight by items when observed from the door. So if the shooter entered the room, maybe they were close. But again, this is speculative.\n\nPerhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) and Evidence 9 (the smeared writing in blood). If the shooter wrote the message, being blind would make it hard to write. However, if the message was written by the victim (LeTouse), then it's not related. But the testimony is about the shooter's blindness, not the victim. \n\nAlternatively, Evidence 5 is the Revolver belonging to LeTouse. If the shooter used LeTouse's own gun, maybe they took it from him. But how does that relate to being blind?\n\nWait, the Key Ring (Evidence 6) has keys to a guitar case. Daryan Crescend (Character 7) is a guitarist. If the keys are to his guitar case, maybe Daryan is involved. But this might not relate directly.\n\nAlternatively, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 8) says time of death 9:00-9:30 PM. If there's evidence about where the blind person was at that time, but that's not provided here.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. The problem is to find a testimony and evidence that directly contradict each other. The user wants only one pair.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, Testimony 5: shooter was blind. If the shooter was blind, then perhaps the way the crime was committed would require sight. For example, the Revolver (Evidence 5) is a high-caliber revolver. Using such a gun accurately might require sight. But a blind person could fire it at close range.\n\nAlternatively, the two bullet holes in the wall (Evidence 10) indicate that the shooter fired multiple shots. If they were blind, maybe they fired randomly, but the victim was hit once. However, that doesn't necessarily contradict the testimony; it could support it.\n\nWait, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) mentions that the victim was shot in the shoulder. If the shooter aimed for the shoulder, that could require some precision, which a blind person might not have. But maybe they were close enough that even a blind person could hit the shoulder.\n\nAlternatively, the Lyrics Sheet (Evidence 2) could have lyrics that hint at something related to sight, but I don't have the details here.\n\nWait, the Borginian Newspaper (Evidence 16) doesn't mention the lyrics of Lamiroir's ballad. The Replica (Evidence 18) is related to a cure for incuritis. The Newspaper Article (Evidence 19) talks about the Chief Justice's son having incuritis. Maybe this is a red herring.\n\nAlternatively, the Headset (Evidence 12) with a 30-foot range. If the shooter used the headset, but was blind, they might need audio cues. But this doesn't directly contradict.\n\nWait, the Diagram (Evidence 10) says the victim was blocked from sight by items. If the shooter was in the room and couldn't see the victim because of the items, but was blind, then maybe they wouldn't be affected by the visual obstruction. That could support the shooter being blind. But that's not a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the Revolver's ownership: LeTouse's gun. If the shooter took the gun from LeTouse, maybe a struggle occurred, but a blind person might have difficulty overpowering someone. But that's speculative.\n\nWait, the Brooch (Evidence 4) belongs to Lamiroir. Found at the crime scene. Maybe Lamiroir was there, but not directly related.\n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) and the fact that the Revolver (Evidence 5) was used. If the Revolver requires sight to use effectively, but the shooter is blind. But how to confirm that?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 3: \"Machi practically left his signature at the scene.\" Machi is blind (Character 5). If Ema is saying that Machi left his signature (Testimony 3), and the shooter was blind (Testimony 5), then the contradiction might not be there. But if there's evidence that Machi couldn't have done it, but the testimony says he did. But the question is about contradiction between evidence and testimony.\n\nWait, let's look at Evidence 5: Revolver belonging to LeTouse. If the shooter was blind (Machi), but the Revolver is LeTouse's, then perhaps the shooter took the gun. But that's not a contradiction. \n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) and Evidence 9 (Crime Photo's smeared writing). If the writing was done by the shooter, being blind would make it difficult to write. But if the writing was done by the victim, then it's not related. The caption says the writing is next to the victim's right hand, implying he wrote it. So the shooter's blindness isn't related to the writing. Therefore, this isn't a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the Key Ring (Evidence 6) was found in the victim's left hand. If the victim was holding it, perhaps he was trying to point to something. But again, not directly related.\n\nHmm. Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) and Evidence 15 (Igniter) and Evidence 13 (Remote Trigger). If the igniter was triggered remotely, maybe the shooter didn't need to be present, thus not needing to be blind. But Testimony 5 is about the shooter's blindness, not their presence.\n\nAlternatively, the Revolver (Evidence 5) being used as the murder weapon. If the shooter was blind, they might not be able to reload the revolver, but that's a stretch.\n\nWait, the Video Tape (Evidence 11) is a recording of Lamiroir's performance. If during the performance, the shooter was elsewhere, but that's unclear without details.\n\nAlternatively, the Mixing Board (Evidence 7) allows separate tracks. If the crime involved audio manipulation, but not sure.\n\nWait, the Remote Trigger (Evidence 13) has a 30-foot range, same as the Headset. If the shooter used the remote trigger from 30 feet away, but was blind, they might need to rely on sound or other cues. But this isn't a direct contradiction.\n\nAnother angle: The two bullet holes on the wall (Evidence 10) and the Revolver. If the Revolver holds six bullets, and three were fired (two in the wall, one in the victim), but a blind person might fire randomly. However, the Autopsy Report says death was from a gunshot wound, which could be one shot. But how does this contradict the testimony?\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) and the fact that the victim was shot in the shoulder (Crime Photo, Evidence 9). If the shooter aimed for the shoulder, which requires precision, a blind person couldn't do that. So the evidence of the precise wound contradicts the testimony that the shooter was blind. But if the shooter was at close range, even a blind person could hit the shoulder. \n\nAlternatively, the smeared writing in blood. If the shooter wrote it, being blind would make smearing more likely, but that's not a direct contradiction. The writing could be smeared for other reasons.\n\nHmm, I'm struggling a bit. Let's recap. The user wants one pair where evidence contradicts testimony. \n\nTestimony 5: Shooter was blind. If there's evidence showing that the shooter must have had sight, that's the contradiction. \n\nEvidence 9's crime photo mentions the victim was shot in the shoulder, which might require aiming. If the shooter was blind, how could they aim? But if the shot was at close range, maybe they didn't need to aim. \n\nAlternatively, the Diagram (Evidence 10) shows that from the door, the victim was blocked by items. So the shooter had to enter the room and get around the items, which a blind person might not be able to navigate. So the shooter had to see to navigate around the items. Thus, Evidence 10 contradicts Testimony 5.\n\nSo, the Diagram (Evidence 10) shows the victim was blocked from view by items when entering the room. If the shooter entered the room and had to navigate around the items to shoot the victim, that would require sight. Therefore, a blind shooter couldn't have done that. Hence, Evidence 10 contradicts Testimony 5.\n\nWait, but the testimony says the shooter was blind based on the crime scene's state. The Diagram's caption says the victim was blocked from sight by items when observed from the door. If the shooter was inside the room, maybe they didn't need to navigate around the items. For example, if the shooter was already inside the room, they could be near the victim. \n\nAlternatively, the two bullet holes on the wall where the door was (Evidence 10). If the shooter fired through the door, which was closed, and the bullets hit the wall, but the victim was inside, perhaps the shooter fired from outside the door. But a blind person couldn't aim through a closed door. So the shooter must have seen the victim through the door to fire accurately. But if the victim was blocked from sight, maybe the shooter couldn't see him, so they fired blindly. Which would support that the shooter was blind. Wait, but the bullets hit the wall where the door was. Maybe the shooter fired through the door, not seeing the victim. If the shooter was blind, they might fire randomly, hitting the door/wall. But the victim was hit once. So the shooter being blind could explain the missed shots. But how does that contradict?\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe there's a more direct contradiction. Let's look at Testimony 5: shooter was blind. Evidence 15: Igniter found at the crime scene, which is identical to the one in Gavin's guitar. The igniter is triggered by a remote (Evidence 13). If the murder was committed using the igniter (which creates a flame), perhaps the actual cause of death wasn't the gunshot. But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 8) says death was from a gunshot. So maybe the fire was a distraction. But how does this relate to the shooter's blindness?\n\nAlternatively, the Revolver (Evidence 5) is the murder weapon. If the shooter used the revolver, and was blind, they might have left fingerprints or other evidence. But the Key Ring (Evidence 6) was found in the victim's hand. \n\nWait, another thought: The crime scene's layout (Diagram, Evidence 10) shows the victim was blocked from view by items when entering. If the shooter entered and had to move around the items to get a clear shot, a blind person wouldn't be able to navigate around the items. Thus, the shooter must have been sighted, contradicting Testimony 5. So Evidence 10 contradicts Testimony 5.\n\nBut the Diagram's caption says \"Observing from the door, the victim was blocked from sight by items.\" So if the shooter came through the door, they couldn't see the victim, implying they fired blindly. But the shooter being blind would align with that. So maybe Testimony 5 is supported by Evidence 10, not contradicted.\n\nAlternatively, if the shooter was inside the room, they could be next to the victim. So the shooter didn't need to navigate around the items. But then, how did they get in? If the shooter was already inside, perhaps they were hiding, which requires sight. But a blind person could be in the room without needing to navigate.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the correct contradiction is between Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) and Evidence 9's smeared writing. If the shooter wrote the message, being blind makes it hard, but if the victim wrote it, then no. But the testimony is about the shooter, not the victim.\n\nAlternatively, the Brooch (Evidence 4) belonging to Lamiroir found at the scene. If Lamiroir was present, but she's not blind. But not directly related.\n\nWait, another angle: The Headset (Evidence 12) with a 30-foot range. If the shooter used the headset to communicate, but being blind, they might rely on audio cues. But again, not a contradiction.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement, the user wants only one pair. Let me try to recall the Ace Attorney cases. This seems to be from the case with Machi Tobaye, where the contradiction is that Machi is blind but the crime required sight. For example, writing in blood or using a gun. But in this case, the Revolver is the murder weapon. If the shooter was blind, they couldn't have aimed properly. However, in the game, the contradiction is often between the assertion that the shooter was blind and the need to perform an action that requires sight.\n\nIn the game, the contradiction is usually between the assertion that the shooter was blind and the fact that the crime required precise actions. For example, the victim was shot from a distance, which a blind person couldn't do. Or the positioning of the body.\n\nLooking at Evidence 10's Diagram: two bullet holes on the wall where the door was. If the shooter fired through the door, which was closed, they couldn't see the victim, so they fired blindly. But if the shooter was blind, they might fire randomly, which fits. But the victim was hit, which could be luck. However, the Autopsy Report says the victim was shot in the shoulder. If the shooter was firing blindly through the door, the bullet that hit the victim's shoulder could be a lucky shot. So that doesn't contradict.\n\nAlternatively, the fact that the victim was shot in the shoulder suggests precise aiming, which a blind person couldn't do. But if the shooter was close, even a blind person could hit the shoulder. \n\nWait, another thought: The Revolver's ownership is LeTouse's. If LeTouse was the victim, maybe he was shot with his own gun. If the shooter took the gun from him, perhaps there was a struggle. A blind person might not be able to overpower LeTouse to take the gun. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the Key Ring (Evidence 6) was found in the victim's left hand. The keys are to a guitar case and motorcycle. If the shooter needed to use the motorcycle, but a blind person couldn't drive. But that's not directly related to the shooting.\n\nHmm. Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) and Evidence 15 (Igniter) and Evidence 13 (Remote Trigger). If the shooter used the remote trigger to set off the igniter, which requires pressing a button, which a blind person could do. But the murder was committed with the revolver, not the igniter. So that's not directly related.\n\nWait, the Revolver is the murder weapon. If the shooter was blind, they couldn't have loaded the gun, but that's not necessarily true. Blind people can load guns by touch.\n\nI'm stuck. Let me think about the possible contradictions in the game. In the actual case (Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, case 3), the contradiction is that Machi, who is blind, couldn't have fired the gun accurately. The crime scene had two bullet holes in the door, and the victim was shot once. The contradiction arises because the shots were fired through the door, and the killer needed to know where the victim was, implying they could see. But since Machi is blind, he couldn't have known where to shoot. Therefore, the evidence of the bullet holes in the door (Diagram, Evidence 10) contradicts the testimony that the shooter was blind.\n\nSo in this case, the Diagram (Evidence 10) shows two bullet holes on the wall where the door was. This suggests that the shooter fired through the door, but couldn't see the victim (as they were blocked by items). However, the shooter fired three times: two missed (hitting the door's wall), and one hit the victim. But if the shooter was blind, they wouldn't know where to aim, hence the missed shots. However, if the shooter was sighted, they would have aimed better. Wait, but if the shooter couldn't see the victim, even a sighted person would miss. So perhaps the contradiction is that the shots were fired from outside the room, through the door, implying the shooter couldn't see the victim, but the testimony says the shooter was blind. But that's not a direct contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is that the shooter must have been able to see to fire through the door, but the testimony says they were blind. Therefore, Evidence 10 (Diagram with bullet holes on the door's wall) contradicts Testimony 5 (shooter was blind). Because firing through the door without seeing the victim would require the shooter to know the victim's position, which a blind person couldn't. But the shooter could have heard the victim's position. \n\nWait, in the game, the actual contradiction is that the shots were fired in a way that required the shooter to know the victim's position, which a blind person couldn't. Therefore, the evidence of the bullet holes' placement contradicts the testimony that the shooter was blind.\n\nIn this context, the Diagram (Evidence 10) showing bullet holes on the wall where the door was indicates that the shooter fired from outside the room, through the closed door. The victim was inside, blocked from view. A blind person couldn't know where to shoot, but if the shooter was sighted, they could have known the layout and fired accordingly. Therefore, Evidence 10 contradicts Testimony 5.\n\nSo the correct pair is Evidence 10 and Testimony 5.\n"

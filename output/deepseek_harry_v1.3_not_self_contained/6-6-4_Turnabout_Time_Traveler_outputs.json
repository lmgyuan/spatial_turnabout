You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by reviewing the given information.\n\nFirst, the characters. Ellen Wyatt is the client, a maid for the Sprocket family. Sorin Sprocket is her fianc\u00e9, known for meticulous note-taking. Pierce Nichody is the butler with a pocket watch. Dumas Gloomsbury is the victim, the lead servant. The murder weapon is the Time Keeper, a clock with a secret mechanism activated by the Key of Love. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) states Gloomsbury was hit twice on the head with the Time Keeper. There's also a candelabra (Evidence 17) with Gloomsbury's left-hand prints and blood matching the lift stain (Evidence 16). \n\nLooking at the testimonies from Sorin Sprocket. Testimony 3 says, \"I was badly injured from being stabbed, but I was frantic.\" Testimony 4 mentions a deep knife wound. But wait, according to the evidence, Sorin was supposedly stabbed by Gloomsbury with the candelabra. Evidence 17 is the candelabra with Gloomsbury's fingerprints and blood. The candelabra is a stabbing weapon, not a knife. However, Sorin's testimonies refer to a \"knife wound.\" That's a contradiction because the weapon used was a candelabra, not a knife. The autopsy report also says the Time Keeper was the murder weapon for Gloomsbury, but Sorin's injury is from a different weapon. So the testimony about a knife wound (Testimony 4) contradicts the evidence that the injury was from a candelabra (Evidence 17). Wait, but the evidence about Sorin's stabbing comes from Nichody's statement linked to multiple evidences. The key contradiction here is that Sorin claims a knife caused his injury, but the actual evidence points to the candelabra. Therefore, Testimony 4 (knife wound) contradicts Evidence 17 (candelabra with blood matching the lift, used in the struggle where Sorin was stabbed).\n\n{\"evidence\": 17, \"testimony\": 4}",

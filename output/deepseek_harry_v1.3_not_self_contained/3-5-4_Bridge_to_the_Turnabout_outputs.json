You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user wants to know which evidence and testimony contradict each other. They provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The answer should be in a JSON format at the end, but first I need to think through the contradictions.\n\nLooking at the testimonies first. Testimony 6 from Iris says, \"By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.\" According to the evidence, specifically Evidence 7 (Weather Data), the snow was from 7 PM to around 10:50 PM. The murder happened around 11 PM, as Bikini saw the murder at that time. So if the murder was at 11 PM, the snow had already stopped by 10:50 PM. Wait, but Iris's testimony says the snow had stopped when the murder took place. Wait, no\u2014the testimony says the snow had already stopped by the time the murder happened. Let me check the timing again.\n\nWait, the weather data says snow from 7 PM to 10:50 PM. Lightning was from 10 PM to 11 PM. The murder was at 11 PM according to Bikini. So the murder occurred after the snow stopped. So Iris's testimony 6 is saying that when the murder took place (11 PM), the snow had already stopped. But according to the evidence, the snow stopped around 10:50 PM. So that's correct. Wait, but maybe there's another contradiction.\n\nWait, no. The testimony and the weather data here actually align. The snow stopped before the murder. So maybe another testimony and evidence?\n\nLooking at other testimonies. Testimony 3: Iris says she dragged the body across Dusky Bridge. Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo) shows tracks from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. But wait, if she dragged the body across the bridge, maybe there should be tracks there. But maybe the tracks photo shows something conflicting. Alternatively, the weather data's snow timing: if the snow stopped at 10:50 PM, then dragging the body across the bridge after that would leave tracks in the snow that had already stopped. But if the snow was still falling, tracks might get covered. Hmm, not sure. Let me check the other testimonies.\n\nTestimony 4: Iris used the snowmobile to carry the body back. But maybe the snowmobile tracks would be visible. However, the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows tracks from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If she used the snowmobile, maybe the tracks would be different? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was found near Dusky Bridge, which has blood. If Iris dragged the body, maybe that's where the blood came from. But how does that contradict her testimony?\n\nLooking at Testimony 5: Iris used the Shichishito to alter the wound. However, Evidence 9 (Victim's Staff) says the actual murder weapon was the staff with a hidden sword, while the Shichishito (Evidence 10) was the apparent murder weapon but not the actual one. So Iris's testimony about using the Shichishito to alter the wound matches with the fact that the Shichishito was not the real murder weapon. But that doesn't directly contradict unless the timing or something else conflicts.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 6 says the snow had stopped when the murder took place. According to Bikini's statement in Evidence 7, the murder was around 11 PM. The snow stopped at 10:50 PM. So the testimony and evidence here agree. So that's not a contradiction.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, maybe Iris's Testimony 6 says the snow had already stopped, but the murder took place during the time when there was lightning (up to 11 PM). The lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. So the snow stopped at 10:50 PM, and the murder was at 11 PM. So the testimony is correct. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe another contradiction. Let's look at Testimony 3: \"I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge.\" But Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo) shows tracks from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If she dragged the body across the bridge, wouldn't there be tracks on the bridge? But if the bridge was on fire (as per Larry's Sketch, Evidence 15), maybe the tracks were destroyed? Or perhaps the bridge was destroyed by the fire, making dragging the body across impossible. Wait, the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM, causing a fire that lasted around 30 minutes. So the bridge was on fire from 10:45 until about 11:15 PM. If Iris dragged the body across Dusky Bridge after the murder (which was at 11 PM), then the bridge would still be on fire. But how could she drag a body across a burning bridge? That seems impossible, which would contradict her testimony. So Testimony 3 (dragging the body across Dusky Bridge) would contradict the fact that the bridge was on fire at 10:45 PM, which would have made crossing impossible around 11 PM when the murder occurred.\n\nWait, the fire started at 10:45 PM and took 30 minutes to go out. So from 10:45 to approximately 11:15 PM, the bridge was on fire. If Iris was moving the body after the murder (which happened at 11 PM), then the bridge was still burning. So she couldn't have crossed it. Therefore, Testimony 3 (dragging the body across Dusky Bridge) would be contradicted by the Weather Data (Evidence 7) which states that the bridge was struck by lightning and caught fire at 10:45 PM, burning for 30 minutes. Therefore, at 11 PM and later, the bridge was on fire, making it impossible to cross. Therefore, Iris's Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 7 (Weather Data) because she claims to have crossed the bridge after the murder when it was on fire.\n\nSo the correct pair would be Evidence 7 (Weather Data) and Testimony 3.\n\n{\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 3}",

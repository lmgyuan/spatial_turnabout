    "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair. Let me go through the testimonies and evidences carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the testimonies by Tigre. Testimony 2 says he set up a meeting with Glen Elg at his office, Tender Lender. But Testimony 3 says he waited but Glen never showed. Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 20 is Glen's Calendar, which has a note on Dec 3rd (the day of the incident) saying \"Meet with The Tiger\". Since Tigre is known as \"The Tiger\", this suggests that Glen did plan to meet him. But according to Tigre's testimony, Glen didn't show up. \n\nBut wait, the victim died at Tres Bien between 1:30 and 2:30 PM (Evidence 10). The meeting with Tigre was supposed to be at Tender Lender. If Glen was at Tres Bien during the time of his death, he couldn't have gone to Tender Lender. However, there's Evidence 24: Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender. This implies that someone from Tres Bien was at Tender Lender, possibly linking Tigre there. Also, Evidence 6 is the small bottle (victim's ear medicine) found in the kitchen with Tigre's fingerprints. If Tigre claims he never went to Tres Bien (Testimony 4), but his fingerprints are on the bottle there, that's a contradiction. \n\nSo, Testimony 4 by Tigre says he's never been to Tres Bien. But Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) has his fingerprints, proving he was there. That's a direct contradiction. That must be the pair.\n\n{\"evidence\": 6, \"testimony\": 4}",

You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies provided. Let's start by going through each testimony and checking against the evidence.\n\nFirst, looking at the testimonies from Tigre. Testimony 0 says he loaned Elg 100,000 dollars. Evidence 3 is the sports paper with a doodle that says 'MC Bomber' pointing to 100,000 crossed out, and Tigre mentions he paid for an operation. Wait, Evidence 23 is MC Bomber, which is a virus program by Glen Elg. Also, the magazine clipping (Evidence 2) mentions that \"I\" (Phoenix?) was trounced and client found guilty. But maybe that's not directly related here.\n\nTestimony 7 from Tigre: \"I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!\" But looking at Evidence 23 (MC Bomber), it's a computer virus worth millions. Also, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) has a note to meet \"The Tiger\", which is Tigre's nickname. If Glen had created a virus worth millions, Tigre might have a motive beyond the 100k loan. Also, Evidence 27 (Viola's Medical Papers) shows Tigre paid 1 million for surgery. The repair bill (25) also shows he paid 15k to Cadaverini. So Tigre had financial obligations beyond just the 100k loan. \n\nWait, in Testimony 7, Tigre claims his only motive was the 100k. But if Glen had a virus worth millions (Evidence 23), Tigre might want that for profit. So Evidence 23 contradicts Testimony 7, because Tigre had a bigger motive than just the 100k. Alternatively, Evidence 27 shows he needed a million, which the lottery ticket (14) was half a million. But maybe the MC Bomber is more relevant here. \n\nWait, in Testimony 4, Tigre says Glen won the lottery (half a million), which is Evidence 14. But then in Testimony 6, he says thanks to Maggey, his business with Glen was over. But Evidence 23's MC Bomber is worth millions, so if Tigre knew about that, he'd have a bigger motive. So the contradiction would be Tigre's claim that he only wanted the 100k (Testimony 7) versus the existence of the MC Bomber (Evidence 23) which is worth millions. Therefore, Tigre had another reason to kill Glen to obtain the virus. So Evidence 23 contradicts Testimony 7.\n\n{\"evidence\": 23, \"testimony\": 7}",

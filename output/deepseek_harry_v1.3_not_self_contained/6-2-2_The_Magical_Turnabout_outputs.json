You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts which testimony. Let's start by reviewing the testimonies and the evidences provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the testimonies. Testimony 3 is from Bonny, saying: \"I-It was in the script... and I really wanted to see it... but I couldn't because of the accident.\" The script here probably refers to the fire trick. So Bonny is stating that the fire trick was in the script, but she couldn't see it because of the accident.\n\nNow looking at the evidences. Evidence 7 is the Show Script, which is Bonny's script. The description says that the fire trick was canceled due to the incident. The script's note about the fire trick is mentioned multiple times, and the fact that the fire trick was canceled would mean it wasn't actually performed. \n\nSo if the script (Evidence 7) says the fire trick was canceled, but Bonny's testimony (Testimony 3) claims it was in the script and she wanted to see it but couldn't because of the accident, there's a contradiction here. Because if the script had the fire trick canceled, then it wouldn't have been part of the actual performance, so Bonny's statement that it was in the script and she wanted to see it might not align. Wait, no\u2014the script originally had the fire trick, but it was canceled due to the incident. So maybe Bonny is referring to the script including the fire trick, which was then canceled. But the script's current state (as per Evidence 7) says the fire trick was canceled. So perhaps the contradiction is that Bonny says it was in the script and she wanted to see it, but the script now shows that the fire trick was canceled. Wait, but if the script originally included the fire trick but was canceled, then Bonny's statement could still be truthful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at another contradiction. Let's check other testimonies and evidences. Testimony 5 from Bonny: \"Yeah... Way too busy to have the chance to kill Mr. Reus...\" But the fingerprinting results (Evidence 3) mention that Betty's fingerprints were found on the top (probably the coffin?), along with the victim and Bonny. But Trucy's prints are missing. However, this might not directly contradict Bonny's testimony about being busy. \n\nAnother angle: Testimony 0 from Betty: \"I had business in the understage passage because of the upcoming trick.\" The Stage Diagram (Evidence 1) shows the understage passage. But I need to see if any evidence contradicts this. Maybe Evidence 11 (Stage Lift #2) shows that Trucy had to move the lift because it was already up, which could relate to the understage passage. But not sure.\n\nWait, let's get back to Testimony 3 and Evidence 7. The Show Script (Evidence 7) states that the fire trick was canceled due to the incident. However, in Testimony 3, Bonny says \"It was in the script... I really wanted to see it... but couldn't because of the accident.\" If the script had the fire trick but it was canceled, then maybe the fact that the fire bucket (Evidence 4) is empty and dusty indicates that they weren't prepared, contradicting the script's note to have the fire bucket ready. But the testimony here is about Bonny wanting to see it but couldn't due to the accident, which is the incident. Maybe the contradiction is that the script says the fire trick was canceled, so Bonny shouldn't have expected to see it. But if the script originally included it but was canceled, then Bonny's statement still makes sense. Hmm. Wait, the Show Script (Evidence 7) says the fire trick was canceled, so the script no longer includes it. But Bonny is saying that it was in the script. That would be a contradiction. Because if the script was modified to cancel the fire trick, then Bonny's script (Evidence 7) would not have the fire trick. But Bonny's testimony (Testimony 3) claims it was in the script. Therefore, that's a contradiction. So Evidence 7 (Show Script) contradicts Testimony 3 (Bonny's statement that the fire trick was in the script and she wanted to see it). Because the script now shows the fire trick was canceled, meaning it wasn't part of the actual performance. Therefore, Bonny's testimony that the fire trick was in the script would be false if the script was updated to remove it. But wait, the description of Evidence 7 says \"Bonny's script. The fire trick was canceled due to the incident.\" So the original script might have included the fire trick, but after the incident, it was canceled. However, the testimony is from Bonny, who says \"It was in the script... but I couldn't because of the accident.\" So maybe there's a discrepancy here. If the fire trick was canceled due to the incident, then the accident (which is the murder) caused the cancellation. But if Bonny is saying that the fire trick was in the script and she couldn't see it because of the accident, but the script itself was changed to cancel the trick because of the incident, which would mean that the script no longer includes the fire trick. Therefore, Bonny's statement that it was in the script would be contradicted by the current script (Evidence 7) showing it was canceled. Thus, the contradiction is between Evidence 7 and Testimony 3. So the correct answer is evidence 7 and testimony 3. Let me check again. Evidence 7 is the Show Script, which says the fire trick was canceled. Testimony 3 from Bonny says the fire trick was in the script. So the script as per evidence 7 no longer includes the fire trick (it was canceled), so Bonny's testimony that it was in the script is contradicted. Therefore, the pair is evidence 7 and testimony 3.\n\n{\"evidence\": 7, \"testimony\": 3}",

It reads: The Purification Rite is a three-part ceremony held when the moon is directly over the summit of Mt. Poniponi. It begins with the Transformation Rite. The high priest reads scripture dons the robes of Lady Kee'ra, which have been purified with incense. Next is the Rite of Water, in which the priestess enters the spring dressed as Lady Kee'ra, and the high priest purifies both Lady Kee'ra and her dagger. The ceremony ends with the Rite of Fire, in which the priestess circles the sacred flames to purify her soul. The two then devote themselves to prayer until the rite comes to a close two days later at noontime.\n['That night, I was up at the top of Mt.

Such rumors are fueling the enthusiasm for today's Purification Rite. - Today's Purification Rite - The thick, white ice that froze the ground from the Inner Sanctum to the Plaza of Devotion until yesterday has melted. The rite can now go on as planned. We give thanks for the blessings of the Holy Mother and Lady Kee'ra. Hap'piraki! - Escaped Prisoner Alert! - Police are asking the kingdom's subjects to be on the lookout for a male insurgent who escaped from Royal Penitentiary No. 4 yesterday. - Weather Forecast - The area around the Inner Sanctum will enjoy calm, clear skies today.

You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. They want just one pair.\n\nFirst, I need to go through all the testimonies and see what each person is claiming. The testimonies are from Ihmus. Testimony 0 says they saw shadowy silhouettes on the ritual curtain. Testimony 1 says the figures were created by the light of the full moon on a clear night. Testimony 2 claims it was the accused holding the dagger in a reverse grip.\n\nNow looking at the evidences. Let me check Evidence 1: Rites Guide. It mentions that during the Purification Rite, there's a curtain around the sanctum (Evidence 4 also mentions the ritual curtain). The Rites Guide also says that the Purification Rite starts when the moon is over Mt. Poniponi. The testimony 1 says the figures were made by the full moon's light on a clear night. But wait, the Rites Guide says the rite begins when the moon is over the mountain. However, Evidence 2, the May 9th Newspaper, has a weather forecast that says there's a cold front moving in overnight. Wait, but the testimony 1 says it was a clear and still night. The newspaper's weather forecast for the day mentions calm and clear skies during the day, but a cold front moving in overnight. So if the rite happened at night when the moon was over the mountain, perhaps the cold front had already arrived, causing cloudy skies. If the moon was out, then the skies would be clear, but the forecast says the cold front would come overnight. The timing is important here. The rite starts when the moon is over the mountain, which would be at night. But the newspaper says the cold front comes overnight, so maybe during the rite, the skies were still clear, but the testimony says the full moon's light created the shadows. Wait, the newspaper's weather forecast says that the area around the Inner Sanctum will have calm, clear skies today (the day of the rite), but a cold front moves in overnight. So the rite happens during the day? Wait no, the Purification Rite starts when the moon is over Mt. Poniponi, which would be at night. But the newspaper says that the cold front comes overnight. So if the rite is happening at night, maybe during the rite, the cold front hasn't arrived yet. Wait, the newspaper says the cold front moves in overnight. The day of the rite is May 9th. The newspaper is from the morning of the 9th, and the rite is that day. So the rite would start at night when the moon is over the mountain. The cold front is coming overnight, which would be after the rite has started. So maybe during the time the shadows were seen, the sky was clear, allowing the full moon's light. But then the cold front arrives later. So maybe Testimony 1's claim about the full moon's light is possible. Wait, but perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 1 and Evidence 2's mention of the cold front. If the testimony says the figures were created by the full moon's light on a clear night, but Evidence 2's newspaper says that the cold front moved in overnight, which could mean clouds, making the moonlight not visible. But the timing here is tricky. The newspaper says \"overnight,\" which might be after the rite had already started. So if the rite started on the night of the 9th, which is when the moon is over the mountain, then during the rite, the skies were clear (as the day was clear), but the cold front came later that night. So during the time the shadows were seen, the moon was out. Therefore, no contradiction. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at Evidence 4: Ritual Curtain. The curtain was shut during the rite, so how could the shadows be projected on it from outside? Wait, the testimony says the silhouettes were projected against the curtain. But if the curtain is enclosing the sanctum, then the light source would have to be inside the sanctum. But Testimony 1 says the light was from the full moon, which would be outside. So if the curtain is closed, the moonlight outside wouldn't cast shadows from inside onto the curtain. Wait, that's a possible contradiction. Let me think again. If the sanctum is surrounded by the ritual curtain, which is closed, then the only light sources inside would be the lantern (Evidence 7 mentions a lantern with broken wind guard). If the light was from inside, then the shadows would be from inside. But the Testimony 1 claims the figures were created by the full moon's light. If the moonlight is outside, and the curtain is closed, then the moonlight can't enter to project shadows. So the testimony that the figures were created by the full moon's light contradicts the fact that the curtain was closed, which would block external light. Therefore, Evidence 4 (Ritual Curtain) says the entrance was shut during the rite, meaning the curtain was closed. Testimony 1 says the figures were made by the full moon's light. But if the curtain was closed, the moonlight couldn't penetrate to cast shadows on the curtain. So the light must have come from inside, like the lantern. Therefore, Testimony 1's claim about the moon's light contradicts Evidence 4. Wait, but Evidence 1 (Rites Guide) mentions that the curtain is around the perimeter of the sanctum, isolating it. So the curtain is surrounding the sanctum, and the entrance was shut. Therefore, the light from outside (the moon) can't get in. Therefore, Testimony 1's statement that the shadows were made by the moonlight is contradicted by Evidence 4. That would be a valid contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Evidence 11: Mountain Range Poster shows Mt. Poniponi is 2298m and the Inner Sanctum is 2310m. The moon needs to be over Mt. Poniponi's summit for the rite to start. But the moon's position would cast shadows in a certain direction. Maybe the direction of the light? Not sure. Maybe that's not the contradiction.\n\nLooking back, the key contradiction is between Testimony 1 (moonlight creating the shadows) and Evidence 4 (curtain closed), because the moonlight outside can't cast shadows on the curtain if the curtain is closed and blocking external light. So that's a solid contradiction. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 4 (Ritual Curtain) and Testimony 1.\n\nWait, but the user wants the evidence and testimony numbers. Let me check:\n\nTestimonies are 0,1,2. Testimony 1 is the one about the full moon's light. Evidence 4 is the Ritual Curtain. So the answer would be {\"evidence\":4, \"testimony\":1}.\n\n{\"evidence\": 4, \"testimony\": 1}",

      "evidence": 4,

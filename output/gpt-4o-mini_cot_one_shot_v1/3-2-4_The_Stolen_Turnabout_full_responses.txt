In this scenario, there is a contradiction between Evidence 15 and Testimony 5. Evidence 15 is Kane's Autopsy Report, which states that Kane died at 1 AM on October 12 due to a cerebral hemorrhage from blunt trauma to the head. However, Testimony 5, given by Atmey, states that he held the urn for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th. If Atmey was handling the urn at that specific time, it contradicts the timeline of Kane's death occurring at the same moment, as he would likely not be alive during that time.

******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 0 states that "I, Luke Atmey, had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever." However, Evidence 15 states that Kane Bullard's time of death was at 1 AM on October 12, which is the same time frame of relevance regarding possible interactions with the victim. If Atmey had contacts with Bullard or involvement during the time of death, his testimony would contradict the claim of having no contact, especially if significant events occurred leading up to that time.

Testimony 5 states, "A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream." However, Evidence 11, which is "Lotta's Deposition," states, "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25." This presents a contradiction as Edgeworth claims to have heard a single gunshot shortly after the scream, while Lotta states there were two sounds like gunshots.

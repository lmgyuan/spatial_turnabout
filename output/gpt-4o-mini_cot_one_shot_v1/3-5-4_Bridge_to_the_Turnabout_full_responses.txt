Testimony 0 states, "I went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden." However, Evidence 11, which is "Elise's Autopsy Report," indicates the time of death was between 10 PM and 11 PM, while Testimony 12 states, "Rang lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room until the murder was discovered." This suggests that Iris could not have seen the events unfold as she claims, since she was not present at the time of the murder.

Let's examine the provided testimonies and evidence closely. 

Testimony 4 indicates that "Mystic Elise managed to fling the knife away," implying that Elise was in possession of a knife during the altercation. However, Evidence 10 describes the "Shichishito" as the murder weapon, which has the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but specifically states it is not the murder weapon. This creates a contradiction since it suggests that the murder weapon was different from what was implied in Testimony 4.

Testimony 6 states, "By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped." However, Evidence 7 describes the weather, stating that snow occurred until approximately 10:50 PM, suggesting that the snow would not have stopped before the murder, which occurred after the lights went out at 10 PM. This creates a contradiction between the evidence and the testimony.

******************************
In this case, we have a contradiction between one of the testimonies and the evidence provided. According to **Testimony 2**, Maya states that she "stumbled... and ended up against the stone lantern." However, **Evidence 20** indicates that the "Stone Lantern was not lit the night of the crime." This means there wouldn't have been any light from the stone lantern for Maya to see anything, making her testimony inconsistent with the nature of the evidence.

******************************
Testimony 3 states, "The torches were lit... And the body was gone." This implies that the body was removed from the crime scene, suggesting that the murder occurred after the lights went out. However, Evidence 11, the "Elise's Autopsy Report," states the time of death was between 10 - 11 PM. If the body was gone afterwards, it contradicts the idea of a murder happening at that time, as it suggests that someone may have interfered with the scene after the lights were out. 

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}
******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Evidence 11, "Elise's Autopsy Report," states that the time of death was between 10 - 11 PM, with the cause being loss of blood from a stab in the back. On the other hand, Evidence 12, "Iris's Testimony," indicates that Iris rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and was in her room until the murder was discovered. If Iris was in her room after the lights went out and did not witness the murder, it creates a contradiction regarding the timeline and Iris's potential involvement or knowledge about the circumstances of the murder.

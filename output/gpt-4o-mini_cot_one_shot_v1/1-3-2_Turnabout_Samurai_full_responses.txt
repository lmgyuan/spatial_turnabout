Let's analyze the elements provided. Testimony 5 states, "Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?" This aligns with Evidence 3, which says the time of death is "10/15 at 2:30 PM." However, Testimony 6 states, "Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM." If Powers walked by Oldbag at 2:00 PM, he would have had to reach the scene before 2:30 PM, which contradicts Testimony 7 claiming Powers was heading toward the studio right after being seen.

This raises the question of when Powers reached the scene in relation to the murder occurring at 2:30 PM.

Based on this, we see that Testimony 5 implies a timeline for the murder that could conflict with the assertion made in Testimony 7 regarding Powers' presence and actions.

The contradiction emerges between the timeline of the murder and the actions of Powers as observed by Oldbag. Therefore, we find that Testimony 5 contradicts Testimony 7 regarding the sequence of events and timing.

******************************
Testimony 0 states that the time of Jack Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. However, Evidence 3, which is Jack's Autopsy Report, confirms that the time of death is indeed 2:30 PM, which does not provide a contradiction. Conversely, the testimonies from Oldbag suggest only Will Powers was seen going to the studio before the time of death, indicating no one else could have been at the scene. However, if we consider that Hammer's death happened exactly at that time, the implications could lead to contradictions if another character has an alibi or timeline that overlaps.

Given the evidence that points towards Will Powers’ claim and testimonies that affirm Oldbag’s observations, there seems to be a contradiction between Testimony 1, where Oldbag claims only to see Will Powers enter before the time of death, and evidence that may assert otherwise concerning the circumstances of Powers during the moments leading to the murder. 

If it's confirmed that other characters could not have been there at that time, the consequence of Oldbag's testimony speaks differently to conflicting narratives of character locations.

Thus, the contradiction lies between Testimony 1's assertion and other possible glimpses from evidence regarding Will Powers' actions.

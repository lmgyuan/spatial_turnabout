To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimony given, we analyze them closely. 

Looking closely at Evidence 14, which is "Juan's Autopsy Report," it states that the time of death was 8:15 PM. However, the testimonies given, particularly Testimony 0, state that the witness claimed to be in a place that might indicate they saw events happening at or around the time of the murder. If the witness had seen the bellboy coming out of the room at a different time than 8:15 PM, there may be a contradiction regarding the timeline.

However, Notably, Testimony 5 states that the bellboy had to be the assassin, while the evidence regarding Juan's cause of death implies a different scenario concerning who might have been involved or present. This suggests that Testimony 5 contradicts the findings that lead toward a different suspect or scenario upon investigation, as no evidence indicates that the bellboy was involved in the murder itself.

Thus, one specific contradictory pair is evidence that implies a timeline contradiction with the testimonies provided rather than direct conflicting statements.

The most definitive contradiction is between Evidence 14's explicit time of death and the implications of Testimony 5.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Evidence 14, "Juan's Autopsy Report," states that the time of death was at 8:15 PM and that the cause of death was "strangled with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife." Testimony 4 from de Killer says, "Adrian Andrews already knew from the very beginning that Juan Corrida was dead!" If she knew he was dead, that implies she had information that could not be obtained until after the time of death, creating a contradiction as she could not know this before 8:15 PM, which checks against the timeline set by the autopsy report.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 2 claims that "The request was for the murder of Juan Corrida and 2 or 3 other small things." This suggests that de Killer was hired to murder Juan Corrida. However, Evidence 14, which is Juan's Autopsy Report, states that he was "strangled with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife," pointing towards the implication that Corrida was indeed murdered. This does not directly contradict, but the nature of the request being made by de Killer could imply a personal vendetta, making it suspicious. 

Now, moving on, Testimony 4 states, "When I saw the name at the end of the letter, I thought my client to be a man." This can contradict the nature of the evidence, specifically Evidence 27 - Celeste's Suicide Note, found inside the figurine, suggesting that the client may not be who de Killer expected.

The contradiction arises from the presumption made by de Killer about the identity of the person he was working for, relating to the evidence of the suicide note which potentially unravels deeper connections to the case.

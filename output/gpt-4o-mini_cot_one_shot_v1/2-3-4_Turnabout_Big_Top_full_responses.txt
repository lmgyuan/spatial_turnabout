Testimony 2 by Acro claims, "However, lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible." on the basis of his injury. However, Evidence 15 refers to the "Max G. Bust," implying it could have been used as the murder weapon. If Acro could not lift the bust, it contradicts the idea that it could have been dropped on the Ringmaster, as suggested by the context of the evidence.

Testimony 2 states that "the word 'Maya' was written clearly in blood," while Statement 5 indicates that "before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name." This creates a contradiction because if the victim was writing Maya's name as the killer, it contradicts the implication of another name being written.

Let's analyze the provided testimonies and evidence.

Testimony 1 by April states, "The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right." This suggests that the victim had an opportunity to evade the attack.

However, Evidence 5, Mia's Autopsy Report, states that she died from a blunt force trauma, which means she could not have dodged any decisive attack leading to her immediate death.

This contradiction indicates that the sequence of events regarding the victim dodging an attack does not align with the fact that she died from such an attack.

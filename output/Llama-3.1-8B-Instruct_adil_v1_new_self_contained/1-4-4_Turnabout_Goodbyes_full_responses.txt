Butz testified that he looked out over the lake after hearing the gunshot, but Lotta's camera was set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected, suggesting that it would have taken a picture of the lake, not the boat.

The testimony of Larry Butz contradicts the evidence of Lotta's Deposition. Butz testified that he heard the gunshot when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!", but Lotta's deposition states that she heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25, which is after the DJ would have said that.

    "cot": "Testimony 2 states that when he heard the student girl and that pompous English murderer arguing, it got his goat. However, Evidence 3, which is \"Fountain Pen,\" states that the fountain pen that the victim was found grasping in her hand carries the initials 'R.M.' and an emblem of some description, and there is a very small amount of liquid still inside the ink reservoir, which suggests that the pen may have been used to write something, but there is no indication that it was used to write a confession or an admission of guilt, contradicting Menimemo's statement.\n"

However, Evidence 5, which is \"Mia's Autopsy Report,\" states that death was instantaneous, but it may have been possible for the victim to live for a few minutes after being hit. Testimony 1 states that the victim dodged the first attack and ran off to the right, which implies that the victim was not killed instantly.\n\nHowever, the more direct contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 9. Evidence 9 is a testimony from May, which states that \"The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck.\" This is a more direct contradiction to Testimony 3 because it is from the same person and it describes the events in a different way.\n"

However, Evidence 6, which is \"Mr. Portsman's Office,\" states that Ms. Byrde unlocked the door, but master key was stolen, so she could not lock it up. Ms. Byrde says she unlocked this door, but her prints were not found on the doorknob. This implies that Portsman was not in his office, contradicting his statement.\n"

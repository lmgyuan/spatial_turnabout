    "cot": "Testimony 2 states that the Samurai Sword was covered in the victim's blood. However, Evidence 3, which is \"Notes on Coachen's Body,\" states that the body wasn't badly burnt by the fire, which implies that the Samurai Sword was not used to kill the victim. This suggests that the testimony is incorrect, as it is based on an assumption that is not supported by the evidence.\n"

Dick Gumshoe's testimony that the victim wrote the name "Maggie" in the sand (Testimony 3) contradicts the fact that the Crime Photo 2 (Evidence 5) shows the body of Dustin Prince having written 'Maggie' in the sand, but the victim's hand is not shown writing the name, suggesting that the name was written before the victim fell.

Richard Wellington's testimony that the police arrived within 10 minutes of his call (Testimony 3) contradicts the fact that the Dustin's Autopsy Report (Evidence 2) shows that the victim's time of death was 6:28 PM, which would mean that the police would have had to arrive before 6:28 PM, not within 10 minutes of a 6:45 PM call.

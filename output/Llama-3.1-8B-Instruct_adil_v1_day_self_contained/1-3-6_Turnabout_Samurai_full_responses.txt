Dee Vasquez's testimony that she and Sal Manella ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer at 2:30 PM (Testimony 5) contradicts the fact that the Steak Plate with traces of sleeping pills and a large bone was found in the employee area (Evidence 16), which suggests that the steak was consumed by someone else at a different time.

Dee Vasquez's testimony that she, Sal Manella, and Oldbag found the body (Testimony 0) contradicts the fact that Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM (Evidence 11), which would mean that they could not have found the body at that time.

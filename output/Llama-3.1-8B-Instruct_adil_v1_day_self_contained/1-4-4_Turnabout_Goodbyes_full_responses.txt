Larry Butz's testimony that he didn't notice the boat (Testimony 4) contradicts the fact that Lotta's camera was set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected and faces the lake (Evidence 2), which would mean that the camera would have taken a picture of the boat, and Lotta would have seen it.

Larry Butz's testimony that he heard the gunshot when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" (Testimony 5) contradicts the fact that the Lake Photo taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4) suggests that the gunshot occurred at 12:15 AM, not when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!".

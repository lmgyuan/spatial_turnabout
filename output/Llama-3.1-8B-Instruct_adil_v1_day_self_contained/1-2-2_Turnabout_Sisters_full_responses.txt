Dick Gumshoe's testimony that the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood on the memo (Testimony 2) contradicts the fact that there is no evidence of Maya's involvement in the crime, and the memo is actually a clue left by the killer to mislead the investigation, as evidenced by the fact that the memo is a list of people's names in Mia's handwriting (Evidence 14).

April's testimony that the girl in the hippie clothes (referring to Maya) hit the victim with "The Thinker" (Testimony 3) contradicts the fact that the victim dodged the first attack and ran off to the right (Testimony 1), indicating that Maya did not hit the victim.

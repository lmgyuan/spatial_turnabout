Lotta's testimony that she saw Miles Edgeworth on the boat (Testimony 0) contradicts the fact that the second lake photo taken automatically on 12/24 at 11:50 PM (Evidence 16) shows an empty lake, suggesting that there was no one on the boat at that time.

Lotta's testimony that she used binoculars to look out on the lake (Testimony 2) contradicts the fact that her camera was set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected and faces the lake (Evidence 2), which would mean that she was using the camera to look out on the lake, not binoculars.

Lotta's testimony that she watched the boat the whole time (Testimony 6) contradicts the fact that her camera was set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected and faces the lake (Evidence 2), which would mean that she was not watching the boat the whole time, but rather was focused on the lake.

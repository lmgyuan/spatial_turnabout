Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The task is to find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony. Let me start by going through each testimony and see if any of the provided evidence conflicts with it.

First, looking at the testimonies by Gumshoe (Testimonies 0 to 4). Testimony 3 states: "His pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces." The key point here is that Mask☆DeMasque targets the most valuable items. Now, looking at the evidences, Evidence 4 is the Sacred Urn. The description says it's supposedly priceless but looks like a plain pot and has no monetary value. If Mask☆DeMasque only steals the most precious art, why would he target something with no monetary value? That seems contradictory. 

Additionally, Evidence 2 mentions the Treasure Exhibit Poster, which lists the Sacred Urn as a displayed item. But the contradiction here is between Gumshoe's claim about targeting precious items and the actual value of the Urn (as per Evidence 4). So the testimony about targeting the most precious pieces (Testimony 3) is contradicted by Evidence 4, which states the Urn has no monetary value, making it not a "precious art piece" in terms of worth. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 4 and Testimony 3. But wait, I need to check the evidence numbers again. 

Wait, the user wants the evidence number and testimony number. Testimony 3 is indeed the one about targeting the most precious pieces. Evidence 4 is the Sacred Urn. So this pair contradicts because the Urn isn't actually valuable, conflicting with the thief's M.O. But let me check if there's another possible contradiction.

Another possibility: Testimony 2 says this was the fifth heist, and he sent a card to Lordly Tailor. Evidence 2 is the Treasure Exhibit Poster, which shows the Sacred Urn is at Lordly Tailor. But maybe that's not a contradiction. The contradiction is more about the target's value. So I think the strongest contradiction is between Testimony 3 (targets most precious) and Evidence 4 (urn has no monetary value). However, Evidence 2's poster says the Urn is part of the exhibit, so maybe the testimony is about the target being the Urn, but the Urn isn't valuable. Therefore, the evidence that the Urn isn't valuable (Evidence 4) contradicts Testimony 3's claim that he only goes after the most precious art. That's the contradiction.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So, I need to look through each testimony and check if any of the evidence directly contradicts it.

Looking at the testimonies first. The testimonies are all from Atmey (Character 7). Testimony 0 says the time was approximately 1 AM. Testimony 3 says he was knocked out and when he awoke, the thief was gone. Then Testimony 4 states that thirty minutes later, he called the police. So, if the time of the incident was around 1 AM, adding thirty minutes would mean he called the police at around 1:30 AM.

Now checking the evidences. Evidence 7 is the Camera Data, which says the warehouse camera went off at around 1 AM. Evidence 19 is the Buzzer Record, which indicates the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM. Evidence 15, the Autopsy Report, states Kane Bullard's time of death was 10/12 at 1 AM. 

Wait, but the key contradiction might be with Testimony 4. Atmey claims he called the police thirty minutes after being knocked out, which would be 1:30 AM. However, the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) shows the buzzer in the CEO's office was activated at 1:02 AM. If Atmey was unconscious until 1:30, how could the buzzer have been pressed at 1:02? Unless he's lying about the timeline. That seems like a contradiction. Because if he was knocked out at 1 AM, woke up later, and then called the police 30 minutes after the incident, that would mean the call was around 1:30. But the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM, which is during the time he was supposed to be unconscious. So Atmey couldn't have pressed the buzzer himself if he was out cold until 1:30. Therefore, Testimony 4 (saying he called 30 minutes later) and Evidence 19 (buzzer at 1:02) might contradict. Wait, but Testimony 4 is about the time he called the police, not the buzzer. Let me check again.

Alternatively, Testimony 0 says the crime happened around 1 AM. But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 15) states the time of death was exactly 1 AM. If the camera went off at 1 AM (Evidence 7), and the buzzer at 1:02, then the timeline might conflict with Atmey's account. Wait, perhaps the problem is with Testimony 4: he says he called the police 30 minutes after being knocked out. If he was knocked out at 1 AM, then 30 minutes later would be 1:30 AM. But the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) shows the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM. That's only 2 minutes after the incident. So if Atmey was unconscious until 1:30, how could the buzzer have been pressed at 1:02? Unless someone else pressed it. But maybe that's not the contradiction. Alternatively, the Camera Data (Evidence 7) says the warehouse camera went off at around 1 AM, which aligns with the time Atmey mentioned. But maybe another angle: the time of death is 1 AM, which is the same time as the camera going off. However, Atmey was attacked at 1 AM and then the buzzer at 1:02. If Atmey was knocked out at 1 AM, then the buzzer being pressed at 1:02 would be while he was unconscious. But how would that tie in? Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 where he says when he awoke, the thief was gone, implying he was unconscious for a while. But the buzzer was pressed at 1:02, which is just 2 minutes after the crime. That could mean the timeline is impossible. For example, Atmey says he was knocked out at 1 AM and didn't wake up until 30 minutes later (1:30), but the buzzer was pressed at 1:02, which would be during his unconsciousness. Therefore, if the buzzer was pressed by someone else, but perhaps Atmey's testimony about the timeline is conflicting. The contradiction here is that if Atmey was unconscious from 1 AM to 1:30 AM, he couldn't have pressed the buzzer at 1:02. But the buzzer record shows it was pressed at 1:02, which contradicts his statement about being unconscious until 1:30. Wait, but the buzzer is in the CEO's office. So maybe the person who pressed it was the killer, which is Kane Bullard's murderer. But the key point is that according to Atmey's testimony, he was knocked out at 1 AM and called the police 30 minutes later (1:30). But the buzzer went off at 1:02. If he was unconscious, then how does that fit? The contradiction might be between Testimony 4 (calling police at 1:30) and Evidence 19 (buzzer at 1:02), but I need to see the exact details. Let me check the evidence again. 

Evidence 19: Buzzer Record says the buzzer went off once at 1:02 AM. The buzzer is connected to the basement Security Guard Office. If Atmey was in the CEO's office, pressing the buzzer would alert the guards. But according to his testimony, he was unconscious from 1 AM until he woke up and called the police 30 minutes later. So if the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM, that's during the time he was supposed to be unconscious. However, perhaps he was the one who pressed the buzzer, which would contradict his testimony. Therefore, the evidence (19) and testimony (4) contradict because he couldn't have pressed the buzzer at 1:02 if he was unconscious until 1:30. Alternatively, maybe Testimony 3 says he was unconscious until he awoke and then called the police. If the buzzer was pressed at 1:02, that's only 2 minutes after the crime, meaning he was only unconscious for a short time. But he said he was unconscious until he awoke and then called the police 30 minutes later. So 30 minutes after the incident (1 AM + 30 minutes = 1:30), but the buzzer was pressed at 1:02. So if he called at 1:30, but the buzzer was pressed at 1:02, that's possible. Wait, maybe that's not a contradiction. Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, the key might be the time of the crime. The Camera Data (Evidence 7) says the warehouse camera went off at around 1 AM. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 15) says Kane died at 1 AM. Atmey's Testimony 0 says the crime happened at approximately 1 AM. So that aligns. But Testimony 4 says he called the police 30 minutes later. So that would be 1:30 AM. However, the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) says the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM. If Atmey was unconscious from 1 AM until he woke up, then pressed the buzzer at 1:02, that would mean he was only out for 2 minutes, which contradicts Testimony 4 where he says he called 30 minutes later. Wait, Testimony 4 says he used an emergency phone to notify the police thirty minutes later. So the notification was at 1:30 AM. But the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) shows that the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM, which is only two minutes after the crime. That could imply that someone else pressed the buzzer, which would be possible. But how does that contradict Atmey's testimony? Unless Atmey's testimony about being unconscious until 1:30 AM is conflicting with the buzzer being pressed at 1:02 AM. Because if he was unconscious, he couldn't have pressed the buzzer, but if the buzzer was pressed, someone else must have done it. But that's not a contradiction unless Atmey's testimony says he was the only one there. Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that according to Atmey's testimony, he was knocked out and when he awoke, the thief was gone, implying that the thief left immediately. However, the buzzer was pressed at 1:02, which is two minutes after the crime. If the thief left immediately, who pressed the buzzer? But maybe that's not the contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the time when Atmey called the police is conflicting with other evidence. Let me check again.

Wait, the key is that Testimony 4 says he called the police thirty minutes after the incident (1 AM + 30 minutes = 1:30 AM). But Evidence 19 (Buzzer Record) shows the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM. If Atmey was knocked out and only woke up at 1:30 AM, then he couldn't have pressed the buzzer at 1:02. But if the buzzer was pressed by someone else, that's possible, but how does that contradict his testimony? Unless his testimony implies that no one else was there. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the buzzer in the CEO's office was pressed at 1:02 AM, but according to Atmey's testimony, he was the only one there (since the thief left). But the buzzer was pressed, so someone must have been there. That could be a contradiction. Wait, but the testimony doesn't explicitly say he was alone. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at another angle. The Shichishito (Evidence 6) mentions that DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the head. But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 15) says Kane died from a cerebral hemorrhage due to blunt trauma to the head. Maybe the murder weapon was the Shichishito. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Another possibility: Testimony 2 says Atmey was struck on the head as he began to turn. The Shichishito (Evidence 6) wasn't bent before the crime. If the sword was used to hit him, maybe it was bent, which would be evidence. But the evidence says it wasn't bent before the crime but doesn't mention after. Not sure.

Wait, let's go back to the initial thought. The most straightforward contradiction is between Atmey's Testimony 4 (calling police 30 minutes later, implying he was out until 1:30) and the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) which shows activity at 1:02. If he was unconscious until 1:30, he couldn't have pressed the buzzer at 1:02. Therefore, if the buzzer was pressed by him, that's a contradiction. But Testimony 4 is about calling the police, not about the buzzer. However, if the buzzer was pressed at 1:02, that would suggest that he was conscious then, contradicting his claim of being out for 30 minutes. So the contradiction is between his claim of being unconscious from 1 AM to 1:30 AM and the buzzer being pressed at 1:02 AM. Therefore, the testimony (Testimony 4) and Evidence 19 (Buzzer Record) contradict each other. Because Testimony 4 says he called the police 30 minutes after the incident (so at 1:30), which would mean he was unconscious until then. But the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM, which is during the time he was supposedly unconscious. Therefore, he must have been awake by then, which contradicts his testimony. So the pair would be Evidence 19 and Testimony 4.

{"evidence": 19, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me go through the testimonies and evidences one by one.

First, looking at the testimonies from Atmey. Testimony 5 says he put his back to the wall and the thief's blow landed on his third eye (forehead, I guess). The evidence related to this would be Evidence 6, the Shichishito, which mentions that DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head. Wait, that's a contradiction. If Atmey claims he was hit on the forehead (third eye), but the evidence says the blow was to the back of the head, then they can't both be true. So Evidence 6 contradicts Testimony 5. That seems like the pair. Let me check if there's another possible contradiction, but this one stands out. Another possibility could be the camera data, but I don't see a direct contradiction there. The key point here is the location of the injury. Atmey says front, evidence says back. So the answer should be evidence 6 and testimony 5.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of Ron's testimonies. Let's go through each testimony and check against the evidence.

Testimony 0: Ron says he's Mask☆DeMasque. But maybe some evidence shows someone else is? Not sure yet.

Testimony 3: Ron claims he went to the crime scene in costume. Evidence 4 is the Sacred Urn, which is described as looking like a plain pot with no monetary value. Wait, Mask☆DeMasque steals valuable art. If the urn isn't valuable, why would he target it? That might contradict his motive as the thief. But which testimony does that relate to? Testimony 3 is about being at the scene. Hmm.

Testimony 4: Ron points to a photo (maybe Evidence 9 or 13). Evidence 16 is a newspaper clipping where the guard in the photo is Ron. That might suggest he was a guard during the first heist, which could conflict if he's claiming to be the thief. But the testimony here says "Look! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!" If the photo is from the first heist and he was the guard, then him being in the photo as the thief would be a contradiction. Wait, Evidence 16's detail says the guard in the photo is Ron. So if the testimony is about a photo where he's Mask☆DeMasque, but the photo actually shows him as a guard, that's a contradiction. Testimony 4 refers to the photo, which might be Evidence 13 (publicity photo of Mask☆DeMasque) but Evidence 16's clipping shows Ron as the guard. If Ron is pointing to the publicity photo (Evidence 13) as proof he's the thief, but Evidence 16 shows he was a guard in the first heist, maybe he's actually the guard, not the thief. However, the problem here is that the testimony and evidence are from different events. Alternatively, looking at Evidence 12: Key Card found in Ron's wallet that opens the CEO's office and leaves a record. The Key Card's use would be recorded. If Ron used it, then the record would show when he entered. Let's check the time of the crime. The CEO's Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) shows the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM, same night as the camera data (Evidence 7) at 1 AM. The Key Card (Evidence 12) leaves a record when used. If Ron's Testimony 3 says he was at the crime scene that night (presumably using the key card to enter), but the Key Card's record would show his entry. However, maybe if he used the key card, the record would place him there, but other evidence contradicts the timing. Wait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 15) says time of death was 1 AM. The Camera Data (Evidence 7) shows the warehouse camera went off at 1 AM. The Buzzer in the CEO's office (Evidence 19) was activated at 1:02 AM. If Ron used the Key Card to enter the CEO's office, which is where the body was found (Evidence 12), then his presence there would be recorded. But his Testimony 3 says he was at the crime scene (maybe the exhibit location?), but the key card's use would place him in the CEO's office, which is a different location. Wait, the body was found in the CEO's safe (Character 12, Kane Bullard's body in his safe). So if Ron used the key card to enter the CEO's office, that's where the murder happened. But Ron is testifying about stealing the urn, which is part of the exhibit. The Sacred Urn's box (Evidence 21) has pink paint stains, which came from when Adrian Andrews (Character 4) dropped it two weeks prior. The crime of stealing the urn would be at the Lordly Tailor (from Evidence 2). However, the murder of Kane Bullard is in the CEO's office. If Ron's testimonies are about being Mask☆DeMasque and stealing the urn, but the key card evidence (Evidence 12) shows he was in the CEO's office (murder location) at 1:02 AM, which is around the time of death (1 AM), that could create a contradiction. Because if he was at the CEO's office at 1:02 AM, he couldn't be at the exhibit stealing the urn at the same time. Wait, but the camera data (Evidence 7) shows the warehouse camera went off at 1 AM. The Sacred Urn was stolen from the exhibit, which might be a different location. So if Ron claims he was at the crime scene (the exhibit) stealing the urn, but the Key Card's record shows he was at the CEO's office (murder scene) at 1:02 AM, that would be a contradiction. Let me check the testimonies again. Testimony 3: "I donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!" The 'scene of the crime' here refers to where the urn was stolen (the exhibit), but the Key Card (Evidence 12) shows he was at the CEO's office (murder scene). But the Sacred Urn is part of the Treasures of Kurain Exhibit (Evidence 2) at Lordly Tailor. The murder is in the KB Security CEO's office. So if Ron was at the CEO's office at 1:02 AM, he couldn't be stealing the urn from Lordly Tailor at the same time. Unless the times are different. The camera data (Evidence 7) at the warehouse (maybe the exhibit location?) went off at 1 AM. The murder was at 1 AM, and the buzzer in the CEO's office at 1:02 AM. So if Ron was in two places at once, that's impossible. Therefore, Testimony 3 (says he was at the crime scene, i.e., the exhibit) is contradicted by Evidence 12 (Key Card used at CEO's office) and Evidence 19 (buzzer at 1:02 AM). But how is this linked directly? The Key Card's use would have a record. So if Ron used the Key Card to enter the CEO's office, which is where Kane Bullard was killed, then he was present there around 1:02 AM, which is shortly after the murder (time of death 1 AM). So if he was there, he couldn't be at the exhibit stealing the urn at the same time. Therefore, Testimony 3 (says he was at the crime scene of the urn theft) is contradicted by Evidence 12 and 19, which place him at the murder scene. But the problem here is the crime scenes are two different places. Alternatively, maybe another contradiction. Let's look at Testimony 4: "Look! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!" Referring to the Security Camera Photo (Evidence 9) which shows the storeroom entrance. But if the photo is from the night of the crime, and Ron was in the CEO's office, then maybe the photo shows someone else. Wait, but Evidence 16's Newspaper Clipping mentions that in the first heist, the guard in the photo is Ron. If Ron is claiming to be in a photo as Mask☆DeMasque (Testimony 4), but the actual photo (Evidence 16) shows him as a guard, not the thief, that's a contradiction. So Testimony 4 (Ron points to the photo as proof he's the thief) but Evidence 16 shows that in the first heist's photo, he was a guard. So that's a contradiction between Testimony 4 and Evidence 16. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 16 and Testimony 4. Let me confirm. Evidence 16: Newspaper Clipping about first heist, guard in photo is Ron. Testimony 4: Ron says "Look! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!" (implying he's Mask☆DeMasque in the photo). But Evidence 16 shows that in the first heist's photo, Ron was the guard, not the thief. Therefore, the photo he's referring to (if it's the one from the first heist) shows him as a guard, contradicting his claim that he's the thief in the photo. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 16 and Testimony 4. So the JSON answer would be {"evidence": 16, "testimony":4}.

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 4}

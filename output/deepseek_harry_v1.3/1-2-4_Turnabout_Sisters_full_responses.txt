Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user has provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Let's start by understanding each component.

First, I'll look at the testimonies given by Redd White (Character 7). His testimonies are from Testimony 0 to 9. Let's go through them to see the sequence of events he's describing. 

In Testimony 4, he says he saw a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair. Then in Testimony 7, he mentions the victim ran away and the man gave chase. Testimony 8 states the victim ran to the left, and the man chased her. Finally, Testimony 9 describes the fatal impact.

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 9 is the "May Testimony," which says, "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." Wait, here the victim ran to the right, but in Testimony 8, White claims she ran to the left. That's a direct contradiction in the direction the victim fled. 

Additionally, the Floor Plans (Evidence 8) mention that the stand is blocked from view looking from the office, which might affect the visibility of the witness, but the key contradiction here is between the direction of the victim's movement. Since Evidence 9 (May Testimony) states right, and Testimony 8 says left, those two contradict each other. 

So the correct pair should be Evidence 9 and Testimony 8. But wait, Evidence 9 is labeled as May Testimony, which is from April May (Character 4). But the testimony in question is from Redd White. However, the question is asking for a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony. 

Wait, Evidence 9's description is the May Testimony, which says the victim ran to the right. Testimony 8 by White says the victim ran to the left. So that's a direct contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 9 (May's Testimony) and Testimony 8 (White's statement) contradict each other regarding the direction the victim ran. 

But in the list of testimonies, Testimony 8 is by White. So the pair would be evidence 9 and testimony 8. Let me confirm the numbers. 

Looking back: Evidence 9 is "May Testimony" with the description stating the victim ran to the right. Testimony 8 by White says the victim ran to the left. Yes, that's the contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be {"evidence": 9, "testimony": 8}.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 8}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through the testimonies and the evidence provided.

First, looking at the testimonies given by Redd White (Character 7). Testimonies 0 to 6 are all from him. For example, Testimony 1 says "When you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left." Then Testimony 3 says "Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right." Testimony 4 claims the killer chased her and delivered the final blow. Testimony 6 states "You hit her twice!" So according to White's account, the victim was hit twiceâ€”once after running left and then again after running right.

Now, looking at the evidence. The autopsy report (Evidence 5) says the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, and death was instantaneous. Wait, but there's a contradiction here. The testimony claims two blows, but the autopsy says one fatal blow. That's a direct contradiction. So the testimony that says the victim was hit twice (Testimony 6) would conflict with the autopsy report (Evidence 5) which states a single blow.

Wait, but Evidence 5's description has a slight inconsistency. The first part says "single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous." Then the second part says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Hmm, maybe that's a typo or error. But the key point is that the cause of death is a single strike, not two. So if White's testimony is that the killer hit her twice, that contradicts the autopsy's conclusion of a single blow. Therefore, Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report) contradicts Testimony 6 (White's claim of two hits).

But wait, let me double-check. The testimony in question is Testimony 6: "You see? You hit her twice!" So if the autopsy says it was a single blow, then that's a contradiction. Therefore, the correct pair would be Evidence 5 and Testimony 6. But wait, another possible contradiction is with the floor plans. Let me check other possibilities.

Another angle: The Floor Plans (Evidence 8) mention that the stand is blocked from view looking from the office. If the witness (April May or Redd White) claims to have seen the murder, but the floor plans show the stand was blocked from view, that could contradict their ability to witness the event. For example, if their testimony says they saw the murder happen near the stand, but the floor plans show they couldn't see it. Let's look at Testimony 5: "That is what Miss May saw." If May's testimony (Testimony 9, which says the victim dodged and ran right, then was caught and struck) is based on her seeing the events, but the floor plan indicates the stand was blocking the view, that could be a contradiction. For example, if the murder happened behind the stand, the witness couldn't have seen it. So perhaps Evidence 8 (Floor Plans) contradicts Testimony 9 (May Testimony) or Testimony 0 where White says Miss May's testimony was correct.

Alternatively, let's check Testimony 9 (May Testimony) which is "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." If the floor plan shows that the stand blocked the view from the office, then May's ability to see that might be impossible. However, Testimony 9 is from April May, not White. But in the testimonies listed, Testimony 0 to 6 are all by White. The Testimony 9 (May Testimony) is separate, but the user's provided testimonies are from 0 to 6 (all White's). Wait, no. The user lists Testimonies 0 to 6 under Testimonies, each with their own Testimony number. Testimony 0 is by White, Testimony 1 by White, etc. So Testimony 0 is White saying "Miss May's testimony was correct... as was mine!" So he's supporting May's testimony. Then in Testimony 9 (if it's part of the list), but looking back, the user lists Testimonies 0 to 6. Wait, no. The user's list of Testimonies is from Testimony 0 to Testimony 6. Then in the Evidences, there's Evidence 9 called May Testimony. So Evidence 9 is a written testimony from April May, which says the victim dodged and ran to the right. So perhaps White's testimony (Testimony 3 and 4) says she ran to the right after running left, but if the floor plan (Evidence 8) shows that the view was blocked, then their ability to see the victim run right would be impossible. For example, if the stand was blocking the view to the right, then the witness couldn't have seen that part. So if the testimony says they saw her run right, but the floor plan shows that area was blocked, that would be a contradiction. So Evidence 8 (Floor Plans) contradicts Testimony 3 (White says she ran to the right). Because if the stand blocks the view, then White couldn't have seen her run to the right. Alternatively, maybe the receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before, which could relate to the Glass Shards (Evidence 2). Maybe the glass light stand was broken during the murder, which is why there are shards, but the receipt's date shows it was purchased before. Not sure how that contradicts a testimony.

Alternatively, looking at White's Testimony 1: "When you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left." Testimony 3: "Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right." Testimony 4: "You chased her, and delivered the final blow." So according to White, the victim was struck twice. But the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says "single blunt force trauma" and "Death was instantaneous." So that's a contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 6 (White's claim of two hits) contradicts Evidence 5 (single blow). So the correct pair would be Evidence 5 and Testimony 6.

But wait, in the autopsy report's description, there's a conflict. The first line says "Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous." Then the second line says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." That seems contradictory. But the key point is the cause being a single blow, which would contradict the testimony of two blows. So the contradiction is between Testimony 6 (two hits) and Evidence 5 (single cause of death). Therefore, the answer should be {"evidence": 5, "testimony": 6}.

Alternatively, another possibility: The Wiretap (Evidence 7) found in April May's hotel room. If White says that May's testimony is correct (Testimony 0), but there's a wiretap, maybe indicating that White was listening in and thus knows what May saw. But I don't see a direct contradiction here.

Another angle: The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a glass light stand, and the Receipt (Evidence 3) shows purchase the day before. If the light stand was broken during the murder, but the receipt's date matches, perhaps indicating it was bought and then broken. Not sure how that contradicts a testimony.

Wait, the Thinker (Evidence 1) is the murder weapon, a clock statue with gears removed. If the murder was done with a single blow, that aligns with the autopsy. But White's testimony says two blows. So that's another point of contradiction. But the main contradiction is the number of blows.

Therefore, the correct answer should be Evidence 5 (Autopsy Report) and Testimony 6 (White's "You hit her twice!").

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 6}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair. Let me go through the testimonies and the evidences step by step.

First, looking at the testimonies. The person giving these is Redd White (Character 7). His testimonies are from Testimony 0 to 5. Let's summarize them:

Testimony 0: He looked at the other window when he heard something fall.
Testimony 1: He saw a light stand on the floor when he looked.
Testimony 2: He saw Mia run to the left.
Testimony 3: The killer attacked her, she dodged.
Testimony 4: She ran for the door.
Testimony 5: The killer struck her with a single blow.

Now, the key points here are about the sequence of events. According to Redd White's testimonies, Mia dodged an attack, ran to the left, then towards the door, and was struck down. But the evidence might contradict this.

Looking at the evidences, Evidence 9 is the May Testimony which says "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." Wait, that's different. In Testimony 3 and 4, Redd White says Mia ran to the left and then towards the door, but the May Testimony (Evidence 9) states she ran to the right. So there's a contradiction in the direction Mia ran after dodging. That's a direct contradiction between Testimony 2 (where Mia runs left) and Evidence 9 (says right). But wait, Testimony 2 is from White, Testimony 3 and 4 are also part of his account. Evidence 9 is April May's testimony. Wait, but the user is asking for an evidence and a testimony that contradict each other. So if Redd White's Testimony 2 says Mia ran left, but Evidence 9 (May's Testimony) says she ran right, then that's a contradiction. But Evidence 9 is labeled as May Testimony, which is from April May (Character 4). So that's the conflict. 

Alternatively, maybe another angle. Let me check the autopsy report. Evidence 5: Mia's Autopsy Report says cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, death instantaneous. But in Testimony 5, White says she was struck once, "Thwap!" which aligns. However, wait, there's a discrepancy in the autopsy report's description. It says "Death was instantaneous. Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Wait, that's conflicting within the autopsy report itself? Hmm, but maybe that's not the issue here. The user wants contradictions between evidence and testimony.

Another possible contradiction: Evidence 8 is the Floor Plans, which state that the stand (where the Thinker statue is) is blocked from view. So if White claims he saw the attack, but the floor plans show the stand was blocked from view, maybe he couldn't have seen the attack. Let's see. Testimony 0 and 1: He heard something fall (maybe the glass shards from the light stand?) and saw the light stand on the floor. Then Testimony 2 onwards about the attack. If the floor plan (Evidence 8) shows that the stand (murder weapon location?) was blocked from view, then maybe his testimony about seeing the attack is impossible. So if the attack happened near the stand, which was blocked, he couldn't have witnessed it. So Testimony 3, 4, 5 (about the attack sequence) would be contradicted by Evidence 8. 

So which is the correct contradiction? Let me check:

Testimony 3: "The killer attacked her... but she dodged." Testimony 4: "She turned, and ran for the door!" So according to White, he saw this happen. But the Floor Plans (Evidence 8) say that the stand is blocked from view when looking from the office. If the murder happened in the office, and the stand is blocked, then White couldn't have seen the attack. But wait, White is an eye witness. If the stand's location was blocked, perhaps his view of the murder (which involved the statue) was obstructed. Therefore, his testimony about seeing the attack would be impossible, contradicting the floor plan evidence. So Evidence 8 (Floor Plans) contradicts Testimony 3, 4, 5, perhaps. But the user wants only one pair. Which testimony is the best fit?

Alternatively, Evidence 1: The Thinker statue is a clock with gears removed. The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from the light stand. The broken light stand was in the room. White's Testimony 1 says he saw a light stand on the floor when he looked. That aligns with the evidence. But the Thinker statue is the murder weapon. So maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Wait, in the May Testimony (Evidence 9), she says the victim ran to the right, but White's testimony (Testimony 2) says she ran to the left. So Evidence 9 (May's Testimony) contradicts Testimony 2 (White's testimony about direction). So that would be Evidence 9 and Testimony 2. But Evidence 9 is "May Testimony", which is from April May (Character 4), so her account vs. White's.

But the user is looking for evidence and testimony that contradict. So the pair would be Evidence 9 and Testimony 2. So {"evidence":9, "testimony":2}.

Alternatively, the floor plans (Evidence 8) contradict White's ability to see the attack. For instance, if the stand (the Thinker statue) is blocked from view, then Testimony 3 (about seeing the attack) would be impossible. So the contradiction here is between Evidence 8 and Testimony 3. Let me check:

Testimony 3: White says the killer attacked, Mia dodged. If the area where the attack happened was blocked from view, then White couldn't have seen it, making his testimony false. So Evidence 8 (Floor Plans) contradicts Testimony 3 (White's testimony about the attack).

That seems like a solid contradiction. So the answer would be Evidence 8 and Testimony 3.

But wait, let's confirm. The Floor Plans say "the stand is blocked from view looking from the office." So if White was in the office, then he couldn't see the stand area. But where was White during the event? The problem statement says he's an eye witness, but maybe he was in a different location. Hmm, the details are a bit unclear. But according to the evidence, the floor plans show that the stand is blocked from view when looking from the office. If the murder happened near the stand, then anyone in the office couldn't see that area. If White was in the office, then his testimonies about seeing the attack (Testimonies 2-5) are impossible. So if he claims to have witnessed the attack from the office, but the stand area is blocked, then his testimony is contradicted by the floor plans.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 8 (Floor Plans) and Testimony 3 (White's testimony about seeing the attack). Alternatively, maybe Testimony 0 and 1 where he says he saw the light stand. If the light stand was in the area blocked from view, then he couldn't have seen it. But the receipt (Evidence 3) shows the light stand was purchased the day before, and the glass shards (Evidence 2) are from it. So perhaps the light stand was in the office, not the blocked area. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the key contradiction is in the direction Mia ran. May Testimony (Evidence 9) says she ran to the right, while White's Testimony 2 says left. So that's a direct contradiction. So the pair would be Evidence 9 and Testimony 2. That's straightforward. But let's check the numbers: Evidence 9 is "May Testimony", which is Testimony 9 in the evidence list. Testimony 2 is "Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!" by White. So the contradiction is between Evidence 9 (May's Testimony stating she ran right) and Testimony 2 (White's Testimony that she ran left). Therefore, this pair would be {"evidence":9, "testimony":2}.

Alternatively, there's another angle. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) says death was instantaneous from a single blow. But Testimony 5 says "Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!" which matches. But the autopsy report also says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." That's a contradiction within the autopsy report itself. But the user is looking for evidence and testimony contradictions. So that's not relevant here.

Another possible angle: The Thinker statue (Evidence 1) is the murder weapon. The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from the light stand. So perhaps the murder weapon was the Thinker, but the light stand was broken. White's testimony says the light stand was on the floor (Testimony 1). But the murder was committed with the statue, not the light stand. But this doesn't directly contradict.

Alternatively, the wiretap (Evidence 7) in April May's room. If there's a wiretap, maybe her testimony is unreliable, but that's not a direct contradiction.

Hmm. The most direct contradiction seems to be between the direction Mia ran: May's Testimony (Evidence 9) says right, White's Testimony 2 says left. So {"evidence":9, "testimony":2}.

Alternatively, the floor plans (Evidence 8) and White's ability to see the attack. If the floor plans indicate that the stand (murder weapon location) is blocked from view, then White couldn't have seen the attack, contradicting his testimonies about witnessing it. So the key testimony would be Testimony 3, where he describes the attack. Therefore, Evidence 8 contradicts Testimony 3.

Which one is the correct answer? Let's check the given data again.

Evidence 9: May Testimony - states Mia ran to the right after dodging.

Testimony 2: White's testimony - Mia ran to the left.

So Evidence 9 and Testimony 2 directly contradict each other regarding the direction Mia ran. That's a clear contradiction. So the answer should be {"evidence":9, "testimony":2}.

But wait, in the given data, Testimony 3 is "The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged." Testimony 4 says she ran for the door. So Testimony 2 is about running left, Testimony 4 about running to the door. The direction of left vs. right is a clear contradiction between White and May's testimonies. So that's a solid pair.

Therefore, the correct answer is evidence 9 and testimony 2.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 2}
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair. Let's start by looking through the testimonies and see if any of them clash with the evidence provided.

First, let's list out the testimonies. Testimony 3 is from Redd White (Character 7) where he says, "That is when I saw this glass light stand." The testimony is linked to when he entered the Fey & Co. Law Offices to place the wiretap. 

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 2 is Glass Shards, described as the broken remains of a glass light stand, broken beyond recognition. Evidence 3 is a Receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder. Also, the Floor Plans (Evidence 8) mention that the stand is blocked from view.

Wait, if the glass light stand was purchased the day before the murder (Evidence 3), but according to Testimony 0 from White, he entered the office the week before the murder (which was in September, murder on 9/5). Wait, the receipt's date is the day before the murder, which would be September 4th. But White's Testimony 0 says it was the beginning of September, the week before the murder. So, if the light stand was purchased on the 4th, and White placed the wiretap a week before the murder (which would be around August 29th or so), then he couldn't have seen the glass light stand at that time because it wasn't purchased until the 4th. That would be a contradiction. 

But wait, Testimony 3 is part of Testimonies 0-3, which are part of a sequence. Let me check:

Testimony 0: White says it was the beginning of September, week before the murder (murder on 9/5, so week before would be around August 29-September 1). 

Testimony 1: He entered Fey & Co. 

Testimony 2: To place the wiretap.

Testimony 3: Then he saw the glass light stand.

But the receipt (Evidence 3) shows the light stand was bought the day before the murder (September 4). So if White was in the office a week earlier, the light stand wasn't there yet. Therefore, his testimony about seeing the glass light stand during that visit contradicts the receipt's purchase date. Therefore, the glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a stand purchased on the 4th, so when White was there the week before, the stand wasn't there. Hence, his Testimony 3 about seeing it then is impossible. 

So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (White seeing the glass stand during his earlier visit) and Evidence 3 (receipt showing purchase the day before the murder). Wait, but the question asks for the evidence and testimony that contradict. Evidence 2 is the glass shards, which are the broken remains. But the receipt (Evidence 3) shows the purchase date. So maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (White saw the stand during his week-before visit) and Evidence 3 (the stand wasn't purchased until the day before the murder). So the receipt (Evidence 3) contradicts Testimony 3. Alternatively, the glass shards (Evidence 2) are from the stand that was broken, which was purchased the day before. So White couldn't have seen it a week earlier. Therefore, the pair would be Testimony 3 (which says he saw the glass light stand) and Evidence 3 (the receipt showing purchase date the day before). Because if he was there a week before the murder, the stand wasn't purchased yet, so he couldn't have seen it. Therefore, Evidence 3 and Testimony 3 contradict. 

So the answer should be evidence 3 and testimony 3. Let me confirm. Testimony 3 is White stating he saw the glass light stand when he placed the wiretap a week prior. But the receipt (Evidence 3) shows it was bought the day before the murder. Therefore, when White was there a week earlier, the stand wasn't there. Hence, he couldn't have seen it. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 3 and Testimony 3. But looking back, Evidence 2 is the glass shards. But the key here is the purchase date. So the receipt (Evidence 3) is the one that shows when the stand was purchased, which is after White's visit. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 3. That's the pair.

{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 3}

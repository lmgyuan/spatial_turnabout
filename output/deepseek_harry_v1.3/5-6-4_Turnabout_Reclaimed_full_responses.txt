Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by going through the evidence and testimonies one by one.

First, the testimonies from Crab. Testimony 3 says that during cleaning, the pool water is drained. Testimony 5 adds that the pool is only drained when being cleaned. Then, Testimony 6 mentions that without water, the orca might die. So the idea is that draining the pool is part of the cleaning process, but they have to keep the orca safe, probably by moving her elsewhere.

Now looking at the evidence. Evidence 3 is the Orca Pool Diagram, which mentions that the pool is about 65 feet deep. But wait, Evidence 12 (Shipley's Data) has some updated info. It says the estimated time of death was between 12:00 and 10:00 AM on July 20th. Also, the cause of death is a contusion from head trauma, thought to be from a 65-ft fall into the pool. The ceiling to pool bottom is 100 ft. Wait, that's conflicting. If the pool is 65 feet deep, but the ceiling to pool bottom is 100 ft, how does that work?

Wait, maybe the diagram in Evidence 3 says the pool is 65 feet deep, but in the updated data in Evidence 12, the ceiling to the pool bottom is 100 ft. So if the victim fell from the ceiling (maybe a higher floor?) into the pool, the fall would be 100 ft. But if the pool was drained during cleaning (as per Testimony 3), then the water wouldn't be there to cushion the fall. But the cause of death is a 65-ft fall. Hmm, maybe there's a contradiction here.

Wait, Testimony 3 says that during cleaning, the pool water is drained. But Evidence 12 states that the death was due to a 65-ft fall into the pool, which would require water to be present. If the pool was drained (no water), then falling into an empty pool from 65 feet would cause the injuries. But the testimony says that during cleaning, the water is drained. So if the death happened during the cleaning time, the pool would be empty, but the cause of death is a fall into the pool (implying water). That's a contradiction.

Wait, let me check the timeline. The estimated time of death is between 12:00 and 10:00 AM. Wait, that seems reversed. Wait, the original time was under investigation, then updated to "from 12:00 to 10:00 AM on July 20th". That must be a typo, maybe it's 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM? But regardless, the cleaning was scheduled for the early morning hours of July 20th (Testimony 0), and during that time the pool was being drained (Testimony 3). So if Shipley died during the cleaning, the pool would be drained (no water), but the cause of death is a fall from 65 feet, which would be into an empty pool. However, the evidence in Shipley's Data (Evidence 12) mentions that the death was thought to be from a 65-ft fall into the pool, which would require water to be present. If the pool was drained (no water), then the fall would be onto a dry pool floor, leading to different injuries. Therefore, the presence of water (as per the cause of death) contradicts the testimony that the pool was drained during cleaning (which would mean no water). So the contradiction is between Evidence 12 (which suggests a fall into the pool with water) and Testimony 3 (which states the pool was drained during cleaning, implying no water at the time of death).

Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all given. Let me start by going through the testimonies and see which ones might conflict with the evidence.

Looking at the testimonies provided by Rimes. Testimony 3 says that Orla killed the captain by bashing him thirty feet high and making him slam into the water. The evidence mentions the Orca Pool Diagram (Evidence 3) which states the pool is about 65 feet deep. Also, Shipley's Data (Evidence 12) says the cause of death was a contusion from head trauma, thought to be from a 65-ft fall into the pool. Wait, if the pool is 65 feet deep, but the testimony says thirty feet high, that's a contradiction. Because a fall from 30 feet into a 65-foot pool would result in a 30-foot fall, but the evidence suggests the fatal fall was 65 feet. So if the pool's depth is 65 feet, but the height from which he fell was 30, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe the height from the ceiling? Evidence 12 also mentions the ceiling to pool bottom is 100 feet. So if the victim fell from the ceiling, that's 100 feet. But the estimated cause was a 65-ft fall. Hmm. Maybe the pool's structure. The diagram (Evidence 3) shows the pool is partitioned by a tall glass. The Skull Rock (Evidence 16) was moved from the show pool, and the victim struck it when he fell. 

Wait, Testimony 3 by Rimes claims Orla bashed him thirty feet high, leading to the fatal slam. But according to Shipley's Data (Evidence 12), the death was from a 65-ft fall, which might correspond to falling from the second floor into the pool. The Orca Pool Diagram (Evidence 3) shows the pool's cross-section with 1st and 2nd floors. If the pool is 65 feet deep, and the second floor's viewing area is higher up, maybe the fall height from there is 65 feet. So if Rimes is saying thirty feet, but the evidence shows a 65-ft fall, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 3 (Rimes) says 30 feet, but Evidence 12 states the cause was a 65-ft fall. That's a direct contradiction between the testimony and the evidence. So the pair would be Evidence 12 and Testimony 3. But looking at the evidence list, Evidence 12 is Shipley's Data, which gives the estimated time of death and cause. Yes, so the contradiction is between Rimes's Testimony 3 (30 feet) and the evidence stating the fall was 65 feet. Therefore, they contradict each other.

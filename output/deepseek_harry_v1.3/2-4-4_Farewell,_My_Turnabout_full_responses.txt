Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So the user is asking for one pair where the evidence and testimony don't match up. Let me start by going through the testimonies and seeing which ones might have inconsistencies with the evidence provided.

Looking at the testimonies from Will Powers (Testimonies 0 to 5), he mentions seeing a bellboy come out of Juan Corrida's room. He says the bellboy was empty-handed, which he found strange. Then he concludes the bellboy must be the assassin. 

Now, checking the evidence list. Evidence 30 is the Bellboy's Uniform, which was retrieved from De Killer's hideout. The details mention that one of its special buttons is missing. Then, Evidence 16 is the Jammin' Ninja's Button, found in Engarde's hakama, covered in Corrida's blood. 

Wait, but how does that connect to Powers' testimony? Let's see. The key here is the bellboy's uniform missing a button. If the button from the uniform was found in Engarde's clothing, that suggests that the bellboy (De Killer) had an encounter where the button was ripped off. But Powers says the bellboy came out empty-handed. However, if the button was missing from the uniform, maybe the bellboy was actually carrying something or involved in a struggle that caused the button to come off. But according to Testimony 4, Powers says the bellboy was empty-handed. However, the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) was found next to the victim. It's empty, but has Corrida's fingerprints. Wait, but the bellboy might have carried something else, like the knife (Evidence 15) which has Engarde's fingerprints. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up here.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 4 where Powers says the bellboy came out empty-handed. But Evidence 30 (Bellboy's Uniform) is missing a button, and Evidence 16 (the button) was found in Engarde's hakama. So if the button was missing from the uniform, and the button was found in Engarde's possession, that suggests that the bellboy (De Killer) had an interaction with Engarde where the button was lost. But Powers claims the bellboy was empty-handed. Wait, but the button being missing from the uniform would mean that when the bellboy left the room, he might have already lost the button. But Powers didn't mention anything about the bellboy's uniform missing a button or anything like that. However, the contradiction here is that Powers says the bellboy was empty-handed, but if De Killer (as the bellboy) was moving the guitar case or other items, maybe he wasn't empty-handed. Wait, the Guitar Case was found next to the victim, empty. But if the bellboy was the one who took the contents, then he would have carried something. However, the Guitar Case is empty, so maybe he didn't carry anything. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another angle. The Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record the victim's room from 8 PM for 1 hour. The murder happened at 8:15 PM. The camera was in a stuffed bear (Evidence 23), and Engarde bought an identical bear (Evidence 24). The Video Tape (Evidence 29) from De Killer's hideout might have footage from the camera. If the bellboy (De Killer) was in the room, but the spy camera was recording, perhaps the footage contradicts Powers' testimony about the bellboy's actions. But how does that directly contradict?

Alternatively, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows a smashed vase with water on the carpet. The Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has water on the lid. If the vase was smashed, the water from the vase would have gotten on the guitar case. But Powers says the bellboy came out empty-handed, but maybe he was carrying the vase or something else. But the Guitar Case was already there. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's go back to the key contradiction. Testimony 4 by Powers states that the bellboy came out empty-handed, which he found strange. But Evidence 30 (Bellboy's Uniform) is missing a button, and that button (Evidence 16) was found in Engarde's hakama. This suggests that the bellboy (De Killer) had an encounter with Engarde, leading to the button being torn off. Therefore, if the bellboy had lost the button during the murder, then when Powers saw him leaving the room, the uniform should have been missing the button. However, Powers didn't mention noticing a missing button, but that's not necessarily a contradiction. Alternatively, perhaps the fact that the button was found in Engarde's possession implies that the bellboy (De Killer) was in contact with Engarde, which contradicts the idea that the bellboy was just leaving the room empty-handed. Wait, but how does that directly contradict the testimony?

Alternatively, looking at the Radio Transceiver (Evidence 4) which is from De Killer. The Transceiver allows communication over distances. If the bellboy (De Killer) was using the transceiver, perhaps he was in contact with someone else, which might not align with Powers' testimony about him being empty-handed. But that's a stretch.

Another angle: The Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) is in Engarde's clothing. But the button is from Corrida's costume. If the bellboy was the killer, how did the button get into Engarde's clothes? That might suggest that Engarde was involved, which could be a contradiction if Powers is blaming the bellboy. But this is more about the connection between Engarde and the murder, not directly contradicting the testimony.

Wait, maybe the key contradiction is in Testimony 4 where Powers says the bellboy was empty-handed. But the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) was found empty next to the victim. If the bellboy took the guitar, then he would have been carrying the guitar case. But the case was found empty, so maybe the bellboy left it there. Wait, but Powers saw the bellboy leaving the room empty-handed. If the guitar case was already there, then the bellboy didn't carry it out. So that might not be a contradiction. Hmm.

Alternatively, the Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints. But the bellboy (De Killer) is the assassin, so how did Engarde's fingerprints get on the knife? That would suggest Engarde's involvement, but that's a separate issue. The contradiction here is between testimony and evidence, not between two evidences.

Wait, perhaps the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording during the murder. If the camera was in the stuffed bear, which was in the victim's room, then the footage would show the real killer. If the footage shows De Killer (as the bellboy) committing the murder, that would support Powers' testimony. But if the footage contradicts the timing or presence, maybe that's a contradiction. But since the Video Tape (Evidence 29) is from De Killer's hideout and contents are unknown, we can't say for sure. 

Alternatively, the fact that the bellboy's uniform (Evidence 30) is missing a button, and that button is found in Engarde's clothing (Evidence 16) implies that Engarde encountered the bellboy. However, Powers' testimony says the bellboy came out of Corrida's room, which would be the crime scene. If Engarde was in his own room (as per the hotel guidemap, Evidence 6: north of the path is Engarde, south is Corrida), then how did the button get into Engarde's hakama? That suggests that the bellboy went to Engarde's room after the murder, which Powers didn't mention. But Powers only saw the bellboy leaving Corrida's room. So if the button was found in Engarde's room, that would mean the bellboy went there, which Powers didn't testify about. But this is more of a connection rather than a direct contradiction.

Wait, maybe the key is in the bellboy's uniform missing a button (Evidence 30) and the button found in Engarde's clothing (Evidence 16). If the bellboy (De Killer) was in Engarde's room and lost the button there, but Powers only saw him leaving Corrida's room. So the contradiction would be that Powers says the bellboy left Corrida's room empty-handed, but the button in Engarde's room suggests the bellboy went there, which Powers didn't mention. However, the testimony is about seeing the bellboy leave Corrida's room, not about where he went afterward. So maybe that's not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, let's consider Testimony 3 where Powers says the bellboy seemed out of place. But the Bellboy's Uniform (Evidence 30) is from De Killer, who is a professional assassin. A real bellboy would have all buttons intact, but De Killer's uniform is missing one. So if Powers saw the bellboy and noticed something off (like a missing button), but he didn't mention it. However, Testimony 3 just says the bellboy seemed out of place, which could align with the missing button. Not necessarily a contradiction.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (Powers says the bellboy came out empty-handed) and Evidence 7 (Guitar Case found empty). If the bellboy took something, but the case was empty, that would mean he didn't take anything. But maybe the Guitar Case was supposed to have something, and the bellboy took it. But the case is empty, so if the bellboy took the contents, then he would have been carrying them. However, Powers says he was empty-handed. That could be a contradiction. For example, if the Guitar Case was supposed to have a guitar, but it's empty, then the bellboy took the guitar. But Powers saw him empty-handed. Therefore, this would contradict: if the bellboy took the guitar, he should have been carrying it, but Powers says he wasn't. However, the Guitar Case is empty and has water on the lid, which might be from the smashed vase (Evidence 9). So maybe the contents were already gone before the bellboy arrived. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has Andrews' fingerprints. The Magazine Clipping (Evidence 11) suggests a relationship between Corrida and A.A. (Adrian Andrews). But how does that relate to the testimony? Maybe not directly.

Wait, another approach: the testimonies from Powers (Testimony 4) claim the bellboy came out empty-handed, which is strange. But the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording the room. If the camera's footage shows the bellboy carrying something, that would contradict Powers' testimony. However, the Video Tape (Evidence 29) is in De Killer's possession, so we don't know the contents. But the user might not have access to that yet. So perhaps this is not the right path.

Wait, let me check the Guitar Case again. Evidence 7 says it's empty, with water on the lid. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) mentions the guitar case is open on the floor next to the victim, along with a smashed vase that stained the carpet with water. So the water on the guitar case's lid might be from the vase. The case is empty. If the bellboy took the guitar, he would have had to carry it, but Powers says he was empty-handed. Therefore, if the guitar was supposed to be in the case, but it's empty, and the bellboy didn't carry it, that suggests the guitar was already missing. But how does that contradict the testimony? Maybe the presence of the empty case suggests the guitar was taken, but Powers didn't see anyone carrying it. But the murderer (De Killer) might have used the guitar as a weapon or something else. Alternatively, the Knife (Evidence 15) is the murder weapon, which has Engarde's prints. So the bellboy didn't use the knife, but the actual killer (Engarde) did. But that's a different contradiction.

Alternatively, considering the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) states the cause of death was strangulation with a scarf and then stabbed. The Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints. So the killer used the knife, which belongs to Engarde. But the testimonies point to the bellboy as the assassin. However, De Killer is known to leave a calling card (Shelly de Killer, Evidence 13), and the Picture Card (Evidence 18) was found next to the victim, carried by Andrews. So the real assassin is De Killer, but the knife has Engarde's prints. This suggests that Engarde was involved, but the contradiction here is between the evidence (knife with Engarde's prints) and the testimony (Powers blaming the bellboy). But the user is asking for a specific evidence-testimony pair.

Hmm. The key contradiction might be that Powers says the bellboy was the assassin (Testimony 5), but the Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, implicating him. However, the knife being in the crime scene with Engarde's prints could mean that Engarde was involved, contradicting Powers' conclusion. But that's more of a contradiction between evidence and the testimony's conclusion rather than a specific statement.

Alternatively, Testimony 4 says the bellboy came out empty-handed, which is strange. But the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) is empty. If the bellboy was supposed to take something (like the guitar), but the case is empty and he wasn't carrying anything, that's not a contradiction. Unless there was something else he should have been carrying. 

Wait, the Pistol (Evidence 28) was retrieved from De Killer's hideout, which was used to shoot Franziska. But this doesn't directly relate to the testimonies.

Let me try to focus again. The user wants one pair where evidence and testimony contradict. The answer should be in JSON format. 

Looking back, Testimony 4 by Powers: "I thought it was kinda strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed!" So he's saying the bellboy had no items when he exited. But Evidence 30 (Bellboy's Uniform) mentions that one of its special buttons is missing. The Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) is found in Engarde's hakama, covered in blood. This suggests that the button from the bellboy's uniform was torn off during a struggle and ended up in Engarde's clothing. Therefore, when Powers saw the bellboy, the uniform should have been missing a button. However, Powers didn't mention noticing a missing button, but instead thought it was strange he was empty-handed. The contradiction here is that the bellboy's uniform was missing a button (as per Evidence 30), but Powers' testimony about the bellboy's appearance doesn't account for that. However, Testimony 3 says "the bellboy did seem kinda out of place," which could imply he noticed something odd like a missing button. But the key contradiction might be between Testimony 4 (empty-handed) and the fact that the button was missing, implying the bellboy was involved in a struggle and thus not just casually leaving. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the Security Lady (Character 3) is Wendy Oldbag, and Juan's Autograph (Evidence 10) is addressed to "Wendy," implying she might have a connection to Corrida. But this doesn't relate directly to Powers' testimony.

Wait, maybe the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording during the murder. If the camera was in the stuffed bear (Evidence 23) in the victim's room, and the Video Tape (Evidence 29) from De Killer's hideout contains footage that shows the real killer, which could be De Killer (bellboy), then that supports Powers' testimony. But without seeing the tape, this is speculative. However, if the Spy Camera was active and the footage exists, then the testimony could be corroborated. But again, not a direct contradiction.

Another angle: The Figurine (Evidence 25) has a hollow inside with Celeste's Suicide Note (Evidence 27). Only Corrida and Andrews know how to open it. If the bellboy (De Killer) had no connection to the figurine, but the note inside incriminates Engarde, this ties Engarde to the murder. But how does this contradict the testimony?

Alternatively, the Radio Transceiver (Evidence 4) was used by De Killer. If the Transceiver was used to communicate, perhaps someone else was involved. But Powers' testimony doesn't mention this.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here. Let me try to list possible contradictions:

1. Testimony 4 (bellboy empty-handed) vs. Evidence 30 (Bellboy's Uniform missing a button) and Evidence 16 (button found in Engarde's clothes). If the bellboy's uniform was missing a button when Powers saw him, but Powers didn't mention it, that could be a contradiction. But Testimony 3 says the bellboy seemed out of place, which might cover that. Not sure.

2. Testimony 5 (Powers concludes bellboy is assassin) vs. Evidence 15 (Knife with Engarde's prints). The knife's prints suggest Engarde's involvement, contradicting the conclusion that the bellboy did it. But the testimony is Powers' opinion, not a factual statement. The real assassin could be De Killer (bellboy) working for Engarde. So maybe not a direct contradiction.

3. Testimony 4 (bellboy empty-handed) vs. Evidence 7 (Guitar Case empty). If the Guitar Case was supposed to have something, but the bellboy didn't carry it, that could mean he took the contents. But if the case was already empty, then he didn't take anything. Not a direct contradiction.

Wait, the Guitar Case has water on the lid. The Crime Photo mentions a smashed vase with water on the carpet. The water on the Guitar Case's lid could be from the vase. So the case was already empty when the vase was smashed, which happened during the murder. Therefore, the bellboy didn't take anything from the case, which aligns with Testimony 4. So no contradiction there.

Another possibility: The Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record from 8 PM. The murder happened at 8:15 PM. The Video Tape (Evidence 29) might show the real killer. If the camera was in the room, then the footage would show who entered. But if the bellboy (De Killer) was recorded entering or leaving, that would support Powers' testimony. However, if the footage shows someone else, like Engarde, that would contradict. But without knowing the tape's content, this is uncertain. But since the user has to choose from existing evidence, maybe the Spy Camera's existence contradicts the testimony. For example, if the camera was in the room, but Powers didn't mention it. But that's not a direct contradiction.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (Powers saw the bellboy come out of Corrida's room) and the Hotel Guidemap (Evidence 6). The Guidemap states that the viola hall is to the east, with Engarde's room to the north and Corrida's to the south. If Powers was in the hallway going to the bathroom, his location might affect his ability to see Corrida's room. But that's more about the layout and alibi, not evidence-testimony contradiction.

Alternatively, the Transmitter (Evidence 22) sends the spy camera's footage. If the camera was active, the Transmitter would have sent the data, which could have been received by someone else. But how does this relate to the testimonies?

I'm struggling here. Let me try to think of the most straightforward contradiction. The button from the bellboy's uniform (Evidence 30 missing button, Evidence 16 found in Engarde's clothes) suggests that the bellboy (De Killer) was in Engarde's room. But according to the Hotel Guidemap (Evidence 6), Engarde's room is north of the path. Powers says he saw the bellboy coming out of Corrida's room (south). Therefore, the button being in Engarde's room implies the bellboy went there after. But Powers only testifies about seeing him leave Corrida's room, not about going to Engarde's. This isn't a direct contradiction but a missing part of the testimony.

Wait, maybe the key is that the bellboy's uniform (Evidence 30) is missing a button, which is found in Engarde's hakama (Evidence 16). So the bellboy must have been in contact with Engarde, losing the button there. But Powers' testimony claims the bellboy was coming out of Corrida's room, not Engarde's. Therefore, if the button was found in Engarde's room, the bellboy must have gone there, which Powers didn't mention. But the testimony doesn't say where the bellboy went after leaving Corrida's room. So it's possible he went to Engarde's room afterward, which isn't covered in the testimony. Thus, no direct contradiction.

Alternatively, the Security Lady is Wendy Oldbag (Character 3), and the Autograph (Evidence 10) is addressed to her. If she was in the area, maybe she saw something. But not related to Powers' testimony.

Wait, going back to the beginning. The user is asking for one pair where evidence contradicts testimony. Let me look at each testimony and evidence again.

Testimony 4 by Powers: He thought it was strange the bellboy came out empty-handed. 

Evidence 30: Bellboy's Uniform missing a button. 

If the bellboy was supposed to have a complete uniform, but one button was missing, that could be why Powers thought he was out of place (Testimony 3). But Testimony 4 is about being empty-handed. The missing button isn't directly related to carrying items. 

However, the button found in Engarde's clothing (Evidence 16) suggests the bellboy was there. But Powers didn't mention the bellboy going to Engarde's room. However, the testimony is about leaving Corrida's room, not about subsequent movements.

Another angle: The knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints. If the bellboy (De Killer) was the assassin, why does the knife have Engarde's prints? That suggests Engarde handled the knife, contradicting the testimony that the bellboy was the killer. But the testimony is from Powers concluding the bellboy is the assassin, but the evidence points to Engarde. This is a contradiction between testimony 5 (bellboy is assassin) and evidence 15 (knife with Engarde's prints). But the user might need to link a specific evidence and testimony.

So, Testimony 5: "Yeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!" (Powers concludes the bellboy is the killer). Evidence 15: Knife with Engarde's prints. This directly contradicts because the murder weapon has Engarde's prints, not the bellboy's. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 15. But the user might need to confirm if that's the case.

Alternatively, De Killer is a professional assassin who uses his own methods, so he might have framed Engarde by planting his prints on the knife. But that's a possible explanation, not a contradiction. The direct contradiction is that the knife has Engarde's prints, implying he did it, but Powers says the bellboy did it. So the evidence (15) contradicts testimony (5). 

Yes, that makes sense. The knife with Engarde's prints contradicts Powers' testimony that the bellboy was the assassin. Therefore, the pair would be evidence 15 and testimony 5. 

But wait, Shelly de Killer (Character 13) is known to leave a card, which was found (Evidence 18: Picture Card), but it was carried by Andrews. Maybe the real killer is De Killer, who used Engarde's knife, hence the prints. So the contradiction is that the knife has Engarde's prints, but the testimony says the bellboy (De Killer) did it. Therefore, the evidence and testimony contradict each other because the murder weapon points to Engarde, not the bellboy.

{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user is asking which evidence and testimony from the given list contradict each other. They want just one pair in a JSON format at the end.

First, I need to go through each testimony provided by de Killer and check the evidence list to see if any of them clash. The testimonies are from de Killer, who's the assassin, so his statements might be trying to frame someone else or cover his tracks.

Looking at Testimony 2: "My client did it to frame another for the crime." De Killer is claiming that his client (Adrian Andrews, based on Testimony 0) planted evidence to frame someone else. Now, the key here is to find evidence that shows that someone else's client (maybe Matt Engarde) actually planted evidence, which would contradict de Killer's statement.

Looking at the evidence list:

Evidence 15: Knife with Engarde's fingerprints. If the knife was planted by Adrian to frame Engarde, but the knife has Engarde's fingerprints, that might support de Killer's claim. However, another angle is if the evidence shows that Engarde had the opportunity to plant something, which could contradict de Killer's assertion that his client (Adrian) did the framing.

Wait, but de Killer's client is Adrian according to Testimony 0. Wait, Testimony 0 says "Adrian Andrews is my client." Wait, but earlier in the characters, Shelly de Killer is the assassin. Wait, in the setup, de Killer is testifying that his client (Adrian) framed another. But according to the case, in the game, de Killer's actual client is Matt Engarde. But maybe in this scenario, the testimonies are part of the game's plot where de Killer is lying. Let me check.

Wait, the testimonies are labeled as coming from de Killer. Testimony 0: de Killer says "Adrian Andrews is my client." But in the actual game, de Killer's client is Matt Engarde. So there's a contradiction here. However, the user is presenting this scenario as given, so I need to work within the given data.

Assuming that in this scenario, de Killer is claiming Adrian is his client, but perhaps that's a lie. However, the user's question is about evidence and testimony contradicting each other based on the provided info, not external knowledge.

Looking at Testimony 2: de Killer states that his client (Adrian) framed another. But Evidence 15 is the knife with Engarde's fingerprints. If Adrian was framing Engarde, then the presence of Engarde's fingerprints on the knife would support that. But maybe there's another angle. Wait, the knife's description says it's engraved with "Gatewater" which is the hotel. If Engarde was the one who bought the stuffed bear (Evidence 24), maybe he set up the spy camera. But how does that contradict Testimony 2?

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says that planting the knife and button is what de Killer refers to as breaking the rules. So de Killer's client (Adrian) planted the knife (with Engarde's prints) and the button (Evidence 16) in Engarde's hakama. But if the knife actually has Engarde's prints, that could indicate he handled it. However, if the knife was planted by Adrian, how did Engarde's prints get on it? Unless Adrian somehow obtained Engarde's fingerprints, which might not be possible. So if the knife has Engarde's prints, that would suggest he used it, contradicting the testimony that Adrian planted it. But if Adrian planted the knife with Engarde's prints, that's possible if she framed him. So maybe that's not the contradiction.

Wait, the testimony says that Adrian planted the knife and button to frame another. But if the knife has Engarde's fingerprints, that would support that she framed him. So maybe that's not a contradiction. Then perhaps another evidence.

Looking at Evidence 25: Figurine. It's a wooden puzzle that only Corrida and Andrews know how to open. Inside is Celeste's suicide note (Evidence 27) which tells of Engarde's misdeeds. If Adrian had access to the figurine, she might have known about the note. But how does this relate to the testimonies?

Testimony 4: de Killer says that Adrian already knew Corrida was dead when she pretended to discover the body. The evidence that might contradict this is if there's something showing she couldn't have known. But perhaps the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) which was recording the room from 8 PM. If the spy camera was set by Engarde (as per the receipt Evidence 24), then the footage might show the actual murderer. If the footage shows Adrian entering the room after the murder, that could support de Killer's claim. But the testimony is that she knew he was dead when she entered, which might align with the camera footage. Hmm.

Alternatively, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) says the cause of death was strangulation and then stabbing. If the crime scene photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim in a samurai outfit with a stab wound, but the actual cause was strangulation first. Maybe the stabbing was post-mortem. If the knife with Engarde's prints was used post-mortem, that could mean the real killer was someone else. But how does that relate to the testimony?

Wait, Testimony 5 and 6: de Killer says Adrian planted the knife and button, which broke the rules. But if the knife has Engarde's fingerprints, that could be part of the framing. But if there's evidence that the knife couldn't have been planted by Adrian, that would contradict the testimony. For example, if the knife was obtained from a place only Engarde had access to. The knife's description says it's engraved "Gatewater," which might be from the hotel. If Engarde was staying at the hotel (as per the map in Evidence 6), maybe he had access. But that's circumstantial.

Alternatively, the Video Tape (Evidence 29) from de Killer's hideout. If the video shows Adrian planting the evidence, that would support the testimony. But since the contents are unknown, maybe not helpful here.

Wait, looking at Evidence 30: Bellboy's Uniform from de Killer's hideout, missing a button. If the Jammin' Ninja's button (Evidence 16) is the missing one, that would link de Killer to the crime, not Adrian. So if de Killer's testimony says Adrian planted the button, but the button is from his own uniform, that's a contradiction. Let me check:

Evidence 16: Jammin' Ninja's Button, found in Engarde's hakama. If the button is from the Bellboy's Uniform (Evidence 30) which de Killer wore, then the button in Engarde's clothing was planted by de Killer, not Adrian. That would contradict Testimony 5 where de Killer claims Adrian planted the button. So Evidence 30 (Bellboy's Uniform missing a button) and Testimony 5 (Adrian planted the button) contradict each other because the button actually comes from de Killer's uniform, indicating he was involved, not Adrian.

{"evidence": 30, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by looking at the testimonies, especially from Shelly de Killer.

Testimony 3 says that one of the requests was to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews. The relevant evidence here might be the Figurine (Evidence 25) which is a wooden bear-shaped puzzle that only Corrida and Andrews know how to open. Also, there's the Credit Card Receipt (24) showing Engarde bought a stuffed bear, and the stuffed bear (23) with the spy camera.

Wait, de Killer's testimony says he was supposed to find the figurine and give it to Andrews. But according to Evidence 25, the figurine is a puzzle that only Corrida and Andrews know how to open. If de Killer was supposed to retrieve it, maybe there's a contradiction here. But wait, the client could have instructed him to get it even if he couldn't open it. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 3: Press Conference Ticket mentions that the Nickel Samurai (Engarde) was to confess something after the stage show. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Wait, let's look at the testimonies again. Testimony 3 says de Killer's client asked him to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian. But Evidence 25 states that the figurine can only be opened by Corrida and Andrews. If de Killer's client was someone else, like Engarde, how would he know about the figurine? But maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Wait, Evidence 27 is Celeste's Suicide Note found inside the figurine, which tells of Engarde's misdeeds. So if de Killer was supposed to get the figurine and give it to Andrews, but the note inside implicates Engarde, maybe the client is Engarde, which would be odd because why would he want to give evidence against himself to Andrews? That could be a contradiction. Alternatively, if de Killer's client was someone else, like Andrews, but the testimonies mention the client's name at the end (Testimony 4) and de Killer thought it was a man. So maybe the client is Engarde, but he's trying to frame Andrews? 

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 24: Engarde bought a stuffed bear identical to the one in the spy camera (Evidence 23). If the client was Engarde, and he had de Killer plant the spy camera in the bear, but Testimony 3 says de Killer was supposed to retrieve the bear figurine (Evidence 25) and give it to Andrews. But the stuffed bear (23) and the figurine (25) are different items. Wait, the figurine is a wooden puzzle, while the stuffed bear is the one with the camera. So maybe de Killer's testimony about retrieving the figurine (25) for Andrews contradicts with something else. 

Wait, the Suicide Note (27) is in the figurine, which was given to Andrews. If the client wanted to give that to Andrews, maybe to reveal Engarde's crimes. But if the client was Engarde, that doesn't make sense. Unless the client was someone else. However, Testimony 4 says de Killer thought the client was a man based on the name at the end of the letter. The client could be Engarde, but the note in the figurine implicates him. So why would Engarde want to give that to Andrews? Unless he's being forced or it's part of a plan. Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is that the figurine (25) can only be opened by Corrida and Andrews, so if de Killer was supposed to retrieve it, he couldn't open it to check, but the client might have known how. But that's not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 18: Picture Card (Shelly's card) was placed next to the victim, but Ms. Andrews was carrying it. Testimony 2 says the request included the murder of Corrida. So if de Killer did the murder, he should have left his card. But Evidence 18 says the card was placed next to the victim, but Andrews had it. That might be a contradiction. But how does that tie to the testimonies?

Wait, Testimony 3 says de Killer was supposed to give the figurine to Andrews. If Andrews had the Picture Card (18), which is Shelly's calling card, that suggests she might have been involved with de Killer. But de Killer's testimony says the client (who is a man) hired him. So if Andrews had the card, perhaps she was the client, but de Killer thought the client was a man. But Evidence 18 says the card was next to the victim and Andrews was carrying it. Wait, the description says the card was placed next to the victim at the time of the murder, but Ms. Andrews was carrying it. That seems contradictory. So perhaps the card was planted by de Killer, but Andrews had it, implying she took it, which might conflict with de Killer's modus operandi. But how does that tie to his testimony?

Alternatively, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 3 (de Killer was to give the figurine to Andrews) and Evidence 25 (the figurine can only be opened by Corrida and Andrews). If de Killer's client instructed him to retrieve the figurine, but only Corrida and Andrews could open it, the client would have to be one of them. But Testimony 4 says de Killer thought the client was a man. Corrida is dead, so the client would be a man (Engarde). But Engarde wouldn't know how to open the figurine. Therefore, if the client was Engarde, how could he instruct de Killer to retrieve the figurine if he can't open it? That might be a contradiction. Because de Killer's client (Engarde) wouldn't know how to access the contents, but the request was to retrieve it and give it to Andrews. But maybe Engarde wanted to get the figurine to prevent others from opening it. Hmm, maybe not a direct contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 27 is Celeste's Suicide Note found inside the figurine. The note talks about Engarde's misdeeds. So if the client was Engarde, why would he want to give that to Andrews? That would expose him. So maybe the real client is someone else, like Adrian Andrews. But Testimony 4 says de Killer thought the client was a man. So if the client was Adrian, but the name at the end of the letter made de Killer think it was a man, that's a contradiction. But how does that tie into the evidence?

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between Testimony 3 (de Killer was to give the figurine to Andrews) and Evidence 25 (the figurine can only be opened by Corrida and Andrews). If de Killer's client (who is a man) instructed him to retrieve the figurine and give it to Andrews, but the figurine can only be opened by Corrida (dead) and Andrews, then the client must have known that Andrews could open it. But if the client is a man (like Engarde), how would he know that Andrews can open it? Unless he knew through some means. But perhaps the contradiction is that the client is a man (as per Testimony 4), but the only people who can open the figurine are Corrida and Andrews. So if the client is a man (Engarde), he couldn't have known the method unless told by Corrida or Andrews. But there's no evidence here that he was told. Therefore, the testimony about being asked to retrieve the figurine (which requires knowledge only Andrews and Corrida had) by a male client (Engarde) contradicts the fact that Engarde couldn't have known how to open it, hence couldn't have instructed de Killer to retrieve it unless he had inside information. But this is more of an inference rather than a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 24: Engarde bought a stuffed bear identical to the one with the spy camera (Evidence 23). The spy camera was set in the victim's room. So Engarde set up the camera to record the murder. But de Killer's Testimony 2 says the request was for Corrida's murder and other things, including retrieving the figurine. If Engarde hired de Killer, he might have set up the camera to record the murder as blackmail. However, the Video Tape (29) was retrieved from de Killer's hideout, which might show the murder. But how does this tie to the testimonies?

Wait, Testimony 3 says de Killer was supposed to retrieve the bear figurine (Evidence 25) and give it to Andrews. However, Evidence 25's figurine is a wooden puzzle, while the stuffed bear (23) with the camera is different. The Credit Card Receipt (24) shows Engarde bought the stuffed bear, which was used for the spy camera. So if de Killer's client (Engarde) instructed him to retrieve the wooden figurine (25), but Engarde had already bought the stuffed bear (23), maybe there's a contradiction. But perhaps they are separate items.

Hmm. Maybe the contradiction is that de Killer's testimony says he was to give the figurine to Andrews (Testimony 3), but Evidence 25 states that the figurine can only be opened by Corrida and Andrews. If de Killer was instructed to retrieve it, he couldn't have opened it to verify its contents, but the client (Engarde) might not have known how to open it either, making the request impossible unless the client was either Corrida or Andrews. But since the client was supposed to be a man (Testimony 4), it's a contradiction because only Andrews (female) and Corrida (dead) could open it. Therefore, the client (a man) couldn't have known the method to open the figurine, making the request to retrieve it and give it to Andrews impossible unless the client had inside information, which contradicts the fact that only Andrews and Corrida knew how. Therefore, Testimony 3 (about retrieving the figurine) contradicts Evidence 25 (which states only they can open it) if the client is a man (Engarde), implying he couldn't have known how to access the contents, hence the request is contradictory. Therefore, the evidence 25 and testimony 3 contradict each other.

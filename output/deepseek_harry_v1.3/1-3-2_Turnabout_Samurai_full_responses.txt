Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair, so I need to look through the testimonies and evidences provided to spot a contradiction.

First, I'll list out the testimonies and see what each person is claiming. The testimonies here are all from Oldbag (Security Lady, Character 4). Let's go through them one by one.

Testimony 0: She arrived at the guard station at 1 PM.
Testimony 1: Hammer and others were doing a run-through since morning.
Testimony 2: She had errands that morning.
Testimony 3: She got to the guard station at 1 PM again (same as Testimony 0).
Testimony 4: She was at the main gate from 1 PM until 5 PM.
Testimony 5: The murder happened at 2:30 PM.
Testimony 6: At 2 PM, a certain man walked by her.
Testimony 7: That man was Powers heading to the studio at 2 PM.

Now, looking at the evidence. Let's see which evidence might conflict with her statements. 

Evidence 5 is Powers'(?) Photo, taken at the gate between the entrance and Studios at 2 PM (Photo #2). The photo shows the Steel Samurai dragging one leg. The Security Lady claims she saw Powers heading to the scene at 2 PM. But the photo shows the Steel Samurai (the costume) at the gate at 2 PM. However, if Powers was in the Steel Samurai costume, then maybe he was there. But wait, if the photo shows the Steel Samurai at the gate at 2 PM, and Oldbag says she saw Powers (as himself?) passing by her at 2 PM, that could be a contradiction. Because if the photo shows the Steel Samurai (who is Powers, as he plays that role) at the gate at 2 PM, then how could she have seen Powers as himself? Unless he was in the costume. Wait, but the Steel Samurai costume is his character. So maybe the photo is actually of Powers in costume, which would align with her testimony. Hmm, maybe not a contradiction here.

Wait, but the key point is in Testimony 7: she says she saw Powers himself, but the photo shows the Steel Samurai. If Powers was in the costume, then the photo is of him. But if the photo is at 2 PM, and the murder happened at 2:30 PM, perhaps there's a timeline issue. Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 3) says time of death is 2:30 PM. The spear is the murder weapon (Evidence 6). 

Another angle: Evidence 11 is Mr. Monkey's Head, which blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. So if Oldbag claims that Powers went to the studio at 2 PM, but the path was blocked from 2:15 PM onwards, how could Powers have gone there after 2:15 PM? Wait, the testimony says Powers was heading towards the studio at 2 PM. The murder happened at 2:30 PM. If the path was blocked starting at 2:15 PM, then after that time, no one could enter. So if Powers went at 2 PM, he would have arrived before the path was blocked. But the contradiction could be that the Security Lady claims she saw him heading there at 2 PM, but the path was blocked at 2:15, so he couldn't have gotten there after that time. Wait, but the murder was at 2:30 PM. If the path was blocked from 2:15, then the killer would have had to be there before 2:15 PM. But maybe that's not directly contradicting the testimony. 

Alternatively, looking at the Security Lady's Testimony 4, she claims she was at the main gate from 1 PM until 5 PM. But Evidence 5 is the photo taken at the gate at 2 PM showing the Steel Samurai. If she was at the main gate the whole time, she should have seen the Steel Samurai (Powers) passing by. However, in her Testimony 7, she claims she saw Powers himself, not in costume. But the photo shows the Steel Samurai, implying that Powers was in costume. So there's a contradiction here: she says she saw Powers (as himself), but the photo shows the Steel Samurai (which is Powers in costume). Therefore, her testimony about seeing Powers in person at 2 PM would be contradicted by the photo showing the Steel Samurai (costume) at the same time. That's a possible contradiction. 

So the evidence (5) shows that the Steel Samurai was at the gate at 2 PM, but Oldbag's testimony (7) says she saw Powers himself. If Powers was in the costume (as he is the Steel Samurai actor), then the photo is of him. However, Oldbag's testimony might be incorrect if she claims to have seen him out of costume when in reality he was in costume, which the photo proves. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 7 (Oldbag says she saw Powers at 2 PM) and Evidence 5 (photo shows Steel Samurai at 2 PM, which is Powers in costume). But if she saw him in costume, she might not recognize him as Powers, unless she knew he was in costume. Wait, but as a security guard, she might know the actors. Alternatively, maybe the photo shows that the Steel Samurai was there, but Powers was supposed to be in costume, so her testimony that she saw Powers (the person) is contradicted by the photo showing the costume, implying that she couldn't have seen his face. So perhaps she's lying or mistaken. Therefore, Evidence 5 contradicts Testimony 7.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 7}
Okay, let's tackle this problem. We need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies. The user wants only one pair, so I need to check each testimony against the evidence.

Looking at the testimonies from Oldbag (Testimonies 0-3). Testimony 0 says the time of death was 2:30 PM, which matches the autopsy report (Evidence 3), so that's not a contradiction. Testimonies 1-3 are all from Oldbag claiming she saw only Will Powers going to the studio before 2:30 PM and that no one else could have gone without her seeing them.

Now, checking the evidence. Evidence 5 is a photo taken at 2:00 PM showing the Steel Samurai (possibly Powers) dragging a leg. But there's another evidence: Evidence 18 mentions that the director used a van to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting. Wait, when was that meeting? The director (Character 7) was present on the day of the crime, and the van was used to drive Vasquez (Character 9) to Studio One. If the meeting was before 2:30 PM, then Vasquez might have been driven there, which would mean she entered the studio, contradicting Oldbag's testimony that she only saw Powers.

Alternatively, the photo in Evidence 5 shows someone in the Steel Samurai costume at 2:00 PM. If Powers was in the costume, but there's another evidence, like the van (Evidence 18), maybe Vasquez arrived via the van after the meeting, which could bypass Oldbag's security check. But the timing would matter. The van was used after the meeting in the trailer. When was the meeting? If the meeting was after 2 PM, then Vasquez might have been driven to Studio One after 2 PM, which would be during the time when Oldbag claims she saw only Powers. But Oldbag's testimony is that no one else went there, and if Vasquez went via the van, maybe she didn't pass through the gate where Oldbag was stationed. So the van could have allowed Vasquez to enter without being seen by Oldbag, contradicting her testimony that she would have seen anyone else. Therefore, Evidence 18 (the van) contradicts Testimony 3, which states that if anyone else went, she would have seen them. The van's use implies someone else (Vasquez) could have entered without being seen by Oldbag, thus the testimony is contradicted by the existence of another access method (the van).

Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Let's start by going through the testimonies and cross-referencing them with the evidence.

First, looking at the testimonies given by Iris. Testimony 0 says she went to the Inner Temple and saw everything happen in the garden. Then Testimony 1 claims she saw Elise strike Maya with her staff. Testimony 2 says Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike while Maya was stumbling. Testimony 3 mentions Elise threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from her robe. Testimony 4 states Maya tried to defend herself and stole the weapon, leading to the fatal outcome in Testimony 5.

Now, checking the evidence. Let's look at the Victim's Staff (Evidence 9). It says the staff has Elise's fingerprints and a hidden sword inside, which only Gumshoe and the protagonist know about. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) is listed as the apparent murder weapon with the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints, but it's actually not the real murder weapon. Then there's the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) stating the cause of death was a stab in the back leading to blood loss, and the body fell 10 feet after death. Also, the Dagger (Evidence 19) found behind a tree has blood that doesn't match the victim's.

Wait, Testimony 3 says Elise pulled a dagger from her robe. But according to Evidence 19, the dagger found doesn't have the victim's blood. If the murder was caused by the dagger, then the autopsy should show that, but the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) says the cause was a stab from the back. However, the Shichishito (Evidence 10) is noted as not being the real murder weapon despite having the victim's blood. Hmm, maybe the real weapon was the staff's hidden sword. But the staff's description says it's Elise's, and the hidden sword is a secret. If Elise was using the staff to strike Maya, but the murder weapon was the hidden sword, maybe there's a contradiction here.

Wait, Testimony 3 says Elise threw the staff away and pulled a dagger. But the Dagger (Evidence 19) doesn't match the victim's blood. So if the dagger was used, the blood should be the victim's, but it's not. That contradicts Iris's testimony about the dagger being used. Alternatively, the real murder weapon could be the staff's hidden sword, which would have Elise's fingerprints and blood. But the Autopsy Report says the cause was a stab in the back. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) has the victim's blood but isn't the murder weapon. Maybe the actual weapon is the staff's hidden sword, which isn't mentioned in the testimonies. 

Wait, in Testimony 1, Iris says Elise struck Maya with the staff. If the staff has a hidden sword, then perhaps when Elise used the staff, the sword was involved. But the Autopsy Report mentions a stab wound, which would align with a sword or dagger. However, the Dagger (Evidence 19) found has blood that doesn't match the victim. So if Iris's Testimony 3 says Elise used the dagger, but the dagger found doesn't have the victim's blood, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 3 (Elise using the dagger) is contradicted by Evidence 19 (the dagger's blood not matching the victim). 

But wait, the Shichishito (Evidence 10) is the apparent murder weapon but isn't actually. The real weapon could be the staff's hidden sword. So if the autopsy says a stab wound from the back, and the staff's sword caused that, then Testimony 3's mention of a dagger would be incorrect. Because the dagger wasn't the murder weapon. Therefore, Iris's Testimony 3 (Elise pulling a dagger) is contradicted by Evidence 19 (the dagger's blood not matching the victim) or Evidence 9 (staff's hidden sword being the real weapon). 

Alternatively, maybe the staff's hidden sword is part of the staff (Evidence 9), which is the murder weapon, but Iris's Testimony 3 says Elise used a dagger. That would be a contradiction because the real murder weapon was the staff's sword, not the dagger. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 3 and Evidence 9, or Evidence 10. Let me check the evidence again. 

Evidence 9: Victim's Staff has a hidden sword. Only Gumshoe and the protagonist know. So if the murder was done with the staff's sword, but Iris's testimony says a dagger was used, that's a contradiction. However, the Shichishito (Evidence 10) was thought to be the murder weapon but isn't. The real murder weapon would be the staff's sword. Therefore, Testimony 3's claim that Elise used a dagger contradicts the fact that the murder was committed with the staff's hidden sword (as per Evidence 9 and Autopsy Report). 

But how does that directly tie to a specific evidence? Let me see. The Dagger (Evidence 19) has blood that doesn't match the victim. So if the testimony says Elise used the dagger to stab, but the dagger's blood isn't the victim's, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 3 (Elise pulled a dagger) is contradicted by Evidence 19 (the dagger's blood not being the victim's), meaning the dagger wasn't used to kill Elise. Hence, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 19.

{"evidence": 19, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by going through the testimonies and the evidence provided.

Looking at the testimonies given by Iris (Testimony 0 to 4). She describes the events where Maya supposedly attacked Elise. Specifically, Testimony 3 says that Maya stabbed Elise with the knife, and Testimony 4 mentions Elise flinging the knife away before collapsing. The key point here is that the murder weapon according to the testimonies is a knife.

Now, checking the evidence. Evidence 10 is the Shichishito, which is described as the apparent murder weapon with the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints. However, the evidence states that it's "not the murder weapon." So there's a contradiction here. If the Shichishito isn't the real murder weapon, but Iris's testimony says Elise was stabbed with a knife (which would be the Shichishito if it were the case), then that's a contradiction. 

Additionally, Evidence 9 is the Victim's Staff, which has a hidden sword. The Shichishito might be the sword inside the staff. But according to the autopsy report (Evidence 11), the cause of death was a stab in the back. If the real murder weapon was the hidden sword in the staff (Evidence 9), then the Shichishito (Evidence 10) being not the murder weapon contradicts Iris's Testimony 3 where the stabbing is done with the Shichishito. Therefore, Testimony 3 claims the Shichishito was used, but Evidence 10 says it's not the actual weapon. That's the contradiction.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's try to figure this out. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by going through the testimonies and the evidence list.

Looking at the testimonies provided, Testimony 6 from Iris says that by the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped. The murder's time is mentioned in the autopsy report (Evidence 11) as between 10 PM and 11 PM. But according to the Weather Data (Evidence 7), snow was from 7 PM to around 10:50 PM. So if the murder happened between 10 and 11, part of that time would have snow until 10:50. Iris claims the snow had stopped when the murder occurred, but the weather data shows that snow stopped around 10:50, and the murder could have been as early as 10 PM. Wait, but the murder's time of death is 10-11 PM. If the snow stopped at 10:50, then during the murder time frame (say, at 10:45 when the lightning struck), there was still snow. So if Iris says the snow had already stopped when the murder took place, but according to the weather data, snow was ongoing until 10:50, and the murder was up to 11 PM. Therefore, there's a contradiction here because the murder could have happened while snow was still falling. So Evidence 7 (Weather Data) contradicts Testimony 6 from Iris. Let me check the exact testimony: Testimony 6 says the snow had already stopped when the murder took place. The weather data says snow was until 10:50 PM. So if the murder happened at 10:45, there was still snow. If the murder happened after 10:50, then snow had stopped. But the murder time is 10-11 PM. So Iris's testimony that snow had already stopped when the murder took place would be false if the murder occurred before 10:50. Therefore, there's a contradiction between her Testimony 6 and Evidence 7.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 6}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to go through each testimony and check the evidence to find inconsistencies.

Looking at the testimonies given by Maya (Testimony 0 to 6). In Testimony 4, she says she saw a man behind her attacker by the light of the stone lantern. But the evidence about the Stone Lantern (Evidence 20) states that it was not lit the night of the crime. If the lantern wasn't lit, Maya couldn't have seen the man by its light. That's a contradiction. So the evidence 20 and testimony 4 don't match up.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies. Let's go through each testimony and check against the evidences.

First, the testimonies are from Maya. Testimony 3 says "The torches were lit... And the body was gone." So she claims the torches were lit when she came back. Now, looking at the evidence. Evidence 20 is the Stone Lantern, which states it was not lit the night of the crime. Wait, but the testimony mentions torches, not the stone lantern. Hmm. Maybe the stone lantern is part of the garden's lighting? If the stone lantern wasn't lit, but the torches were, maybe that's possible. But maybe there's another contradiction.

Testimony 4 says "all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up." But if the stone lantern wasn't lit (Evidence 20), perhaps there's a contradiction here. Wait, the stone lantern not being lit is a fact from evidence, but Maya's testimony says the snow around it was cleaned up. Maybe if the lantern wasn't lit, but someone cleaned the snow, but why? Not sure. Let's check other possibilities.

Testimony 5: Maya thought the killer was a man because they did all the work alone. Maybe that's a subjective assumption, but evidence doesn't directly contradict that. 

Looking at Testimony 3 again: torches were lit. Let's check evidence about the garden. Evidence 20 (Stone Lantern) wasn't lit. But maybe the torches are different. However, the stone lantern is part of the garden's lighting. If the stone lantern wasn't lit, but torches were, maybe that's okay. But perhaps there's an inconsistency. Wait, the hanging scroll (Evidence 4) has Misty Fey's image obscured by gravy. Not directly related. 

Wait, the weather data (Evidence 7) says there was snow until around 10:50 PM and lightning until 11 PM. The crime happened around 10-11 PM. The body fell 10 ft after death (Autopsy Report, Evidence 11). Maybe the tracks photo (14) shows tracks leading to Dusky Bridge. Larry's sketch (15) shows a bridge on fire with two drawstrings and a silhouette. The crystal sphere (16) has blood, came from the victim's staff. The dagger (19) has different blood. 

But going back to Testimony 3: torches lit and body gone. The stone lantern (20) was not lit. Wait, the stone lantern is in the Inner Temple garden. If the stone lantern wasn't lit, but the torches (maybe other lights) were lit, that's possible. But maybe the torches are the same as the stone lantern? If the stone lantern wasn't lit, but Maya says the torches were lit, that's a contradiction. So Evidence 20 (stone lantern not lit) contradicts Testimony 3 (torches lit). Because the stone lantern was part of the garden's lighting and wasn't lit, but Maya says the torches were lit. So the testimony says torches were lit, but the evidence says the stone lantern wasn't. If the stone lantern is the main source of light there, then this is a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 20 contradicts Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 3}
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies from a game scenario, probably from the Ace Attorney series. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. We need to output one pair in JSON format.

First, I'll go through each testimony and cross-reference them with the evidence list to find inconsistencies. Let's start by looking at the testimonies provided.

Testimony 0 to 4 are all from Maya. Let's check each one:

Testimony 0: "Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night!" This refers to Pearl Fey (Character 3) being on the Inner Temple side when the crime happened. If there's evidence that shows Pearl was somewhere else, this would contradict.

Testimony 1: "The next morning, she looked around, but couldn't find anyone." If there's evidence that someone was present or evidence of someone's presence, this would be a contradiction.

Testimony 2: "The next day, when the bridge was finally fixed, she was in the spare prep room." If evidence shows she was elsewhere, contradiction.

Testimony 3: "That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!" So Godot arrived the next day. But if there's evidence that Godot was already there before, or during the crime, this would contradict.

Testimony 4: "He found Pearly first, and cheered her right up!" Not sure about contradictions here.

Now, looking at the evidences. Let's check each one for possible contradictions with these testimonies.

Evidence 3: Hazakura Temple Map. The map might show locations, but not sure if it directly contradicts.

Evidence 7: Weather Data mentions lightning striking Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. The bridge was out, so if someone was on the other side, they couldn't cross. Testimony 0 says Pearl was stuck on the Inner Temple side. But maybe other evidence shows movement?

Evidence 12: Iris's Testimony says she was in her room from 10 PM. If Pearl was on the Inner Temple side, perhaps Iris's testimony conflicts, but not directly with Maya's.

Evidence 15: Larry's Sketch shows a bridge on fire with a silhouette gliding over. If the bridge was out due to lightning (Evidence 7), how could someone cross? But Testimony 3 says Godot arrived the next day when the bridge was fixed. Wait, but Larry's Sketch is from the night of the crime. If the bridge was destroyed, but the sketch shows someone crossing, that might be a contradiction. But Testimony 3 is about Godot arriving the next day. Let me check Testimony 3 again.

Testimony 3 states that Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time the next day when the bridge was fixed. However, Evidence 2 (Oh! Cult! New Year's Issue) might mention something about the temple's layout or access. Alternatively, maybe another evidence.

Wait, looking at Evidence 4: Hanging Scroll. The description mentions Godot's comment about Misty Fey's image. Not directly related. Evidence 18: Burnt Letter from Morgan Fey. If it's orders, maybe related to someone being sent, but not sure.

Wait, let's focus on Testimony 3: Godot arrived at Inner Temple for the first time the next day. But if there's evidence that Godot was already there before, that would contradict. For example, if the map (Evidence 3) shows that access to Inner Temple was possible only via Dusky Bridge, which was destroyed. But Godot would have needed to cross after the bridge was fixed. However, maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, Evidence 17: Kurain Master's Talisman found in the garden. If Godot had been there earlier, maybe he left it. Not sure. Alternatively, Evidence 19: Dagger with blood not matching the victim. If Godot had used it, but that's speculative.

Wait, the key here is Testimony 3 saying Godot arrived the next day when the bridge was fixed. But if there's evidence that Godot was already present on the Inner Temple side before the bridge was fixed, that would contradict. For example, if someone saw him there earlier.

Looking at Evidence 16: Crystal Sphere found near Dusky Bridge with blood. If that's connected to Godot, maybe. But not directly. Let's check the weather data again. The bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM, causing it to be out. So anyone on the Inner Temple side before that would be stuck there. If Godot arrived the next day after the bridge was fixed, but there's evidence he was there during the crime time, that's a contradiction.

Wait, but Testimony 3 is about the next day when the bridge was fixed. So according to Maya, Godot arrived then. However, if there's evidence that Godot was present on the Inner Temple side before the bridge was fixed, that would contradict.

Looking at Evidence 2: Oh! Cult! New Year's Issue. The description says it's an occult magazine featuring Hazakura Temple. Click here for details. If the magazine mentions that the only way to the Inner Temple is via Dusky Bridge, then during the time the bridge was out (from 10:45 PM), no one could cross. So if Godot arrived the next day after the bridge was fixed, but there's evidence he was on the Inner Temple side during the crime night, that's a problem.

Wait, but how? Let's see. If Godot arrived the next day, but the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was found near Dusky Bridge, maybe connected to him. Alternatively, maybe the Magatama (Evidence 1) could show he had a secret. Not sure.

Alternatively, Evidence 4: Hanging Scroll. The description mentions Godot described Misty Fey's image. If Godot had seen the scroll before, that would imply he was at the temple earlier. But Testimony 3 says he arrived the next day for the first time. So if the scroll was in the temple, and Godot had described it before arriving, that would be a contradiction.

Wait, the Hanging Scroll's description says: "Misty Fey's image is obscured by gravy. Godot described her as 'clad in her stunning Japanese garb surrounded by the hue and aroma of Western tastes'." So Godot made that description. If the scroll is in Hazakura Temple, and Godot had never been there before the next day (per Testimony 3), how could he have seen the scroll to describe it? Because the scroll was there, and if he only arrived the next day, he couldn't have seen it before. But Maya's Testimony 3 says he arrived the next day for the first time, implying he wasn't there earlier. So if Godot described the scroll's image, which was in the temple, then he must have been there before the next day, contradicting Testimony 3.

Therefore, Evidence 4 (Hanging Scroll) and Testimony 3 contradict each other because Godot's description of the scroll implies he saw it before arriving the next day, which Testimony 3 says was his first time.

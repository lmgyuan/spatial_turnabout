Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me go through each testimony and check against the evidences.

Starting with Edgeworth's testimonies. Testimony 0 says he went to observe his father's trial. Testimony 1 mentions an earthquake trapping them in an elevator. Testimony 2 says his father and Yogi argued. Testimony 3 mentions something heavy fell. Testimony 4 says he threw it at Yogi. Testimony 5 says a single gunshot and a scream. Testimony 6 about the scream.

Now, looking at the evidence. The DL-6 Case File (Evidence 18) says the murder weapon was fired twice. But Edgeworth's Testimony 5 states there was a single gunshot. Wait, that's a contradiction. The DL-6 Incident's gun was fired twice according to the evidence, but the testimony mentions only one shot. So Testimony 5 (which is about the DL-6 incident) says one gunshot, but Evidence 18 says the weapon was fired twice. That's a direct contradiction. 

Wait, but the current case is about Robert Hammond's murder. Let me check if the DL-6 evidence relates to the testimonies given. Edgeworth's testimonies here are about the DL-6 incident, right? Because his father was killed there. So in Testimony 5, Edgeworth says there was a single gunshot during DL-6. But Evidence 18 (DL-6 Case File) states the murder weapon was fired twice. That's a contradiction between Testimony 5 (single shot) and Evidence 18 (two shots). So the pair would be evidence 18 and testimony 5. 

But wait, looking at the evidence list again: Evidence 18 is DL-6 Case File, which says the murder weapon was fired twice. Testimony 5 says "a single gunshot". That's conflicting. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 18. Therefore, the answer should be evidence 18 and testimony 5.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 5}

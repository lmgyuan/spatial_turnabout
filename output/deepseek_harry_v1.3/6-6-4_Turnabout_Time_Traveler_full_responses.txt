Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The goal is to find one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, let me go through the testimonies. The testimonies are from Sorin Sprocket (Character 8). Testimony 3 says, "I was badly injured from being stabbed, but I was frantic." And Testimony 4 mentions, "The knife wound is quite deep, and continues to throb with pain." So Sorin is claiming he was stabbed with a knife, resulting in a deep wound.

Now looking at the evidences. Evidence 17 is the Candelabra, which has Gloomsbury's fingerprints (left hand, his dominant hand) and blood traces matching the lift's bloodstain. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) states the murder weapon was the Time Keeper, a clock mechanism. However, Sorin's injury is from a candelabra according to Evidence 0, 1, 2, etc., where Nichody's testimony via the evidence says Sorin was stabbed with the candelabra by Gloomsbury. 

Wait, but in Sorin's testimonies 3 and 4, he refers to a "knife wound". But according to the evidence, the weapon used on Sorin was the candelabra, not a knife. The candelabra would cause a stabbing injury but perhaps not a knife wound. The contradiction here is that Sorin claims a knife wound, but the evidence (like the Candelabra) suggests the weapon was a candelabra, not a knife. However, looking at Evidence 17, the candelabra is the weapon with blood matching the lift, which might be Sorin's blood. So if Sorin was stabbed with the candelabra, his testimony about a knife wound would be contradictory because the weapon wasn't a knife. 

Therefore, the testimony about a knife wound (Testimony 4) contradicts the evidence that the injury was from a candelabra (Evidence 17). So the pair would be Evidence 17 and Testimony 4.

{"evidence": 17, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by going through the testimonies and evidences one by one.

Looking at the testimonies from Nichody:

Testimony 3 says Nichody tore the page out of Sorin's notebook to protect him. Evidence 18 is Sorin's Notebook, which mentions that one of the pages has been torn out. That seems to match, so no contradiction there.

Testimony 4 states that Nichody hid the body in the spare Pegabull lantern in the hold. Evidence 5 is the Broken Lantern, which was wheeled by Larry from the hold to the reception hall before the reception. The body was found in the lantern in the reception hall. But Nichody says he hid it in the hold's spare lantern. Wait, maybe Larry moved it later? So that might not be a contradiction. Because Nichody hid it in the hold's lantern, then Larry moved it to the reception. So that could fit. Maybe not a contradiction here.

Testimony 5 again mentions tearing the page, which matches Evidence 18, so not the issue.

Looking at other testimonies. Testimony 0: Nichody rushed to the vista deck but the crime was already committed. Evidence 2 is Ellen's Statement that she saw a suspicious third party on the vista deck when she was attacked. If Nichody arrived after the crime, maybe he wasn't the attacker? But how does that contradict?

Wait, maybe another angle. Let's check Evidence 15: Hold Entry Record, which logs key cards used to access the hold. If Nichody hid the body in the hold (Testimony 4), then his key card would be in the entry record. But the evidence doesn't specify whose key was used. Maybe not directly contradicting.

Another thought. Let's look at Testimony 3: Nichody says he tore the page from Sorin's notebook. Evidence 18's notebook has a torn page. But Sorin's notebook is described as meticulous. If Nichody tore the page to protect Sorin, but Sorin's notebook is a daily record, maybe the torn page would be recent. But how does that contradict? Not sure.

Wait, Testimony 1: Nichody saw Sorin writing in his notebook. So Sorin was using it around the time of the crime. If Nichody tore a page out, but Sorin was actively writing, maybe the page torn was the one Sorin was writing on. But how does that contradict?

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 4: hiding the body in the spare Pegabull lantern in the hold. Evidence 5 says the lantern was wheeled by Larry from the hold to the reception hall before the reception began. So if Larry moved it before the reception, and the body was found in the lantern in the reception hall, then Nichody must have hidden the body before Larry moved it. That's possible. But does that contradict?

Wait, the timing. Let me reconstruct. The body was hidden in the hold's lantern by Nichody (Testimony 4). Then Larry moved that lantern to the reception hall before the reception. So the body would be there. Then the body was found in the reception hall's lantern (Evidence 6). That seems consistent. So no contradiction here.

What about Evidence 17: Candelabra with Gloomsbury's left-hand fingerprints and blood matching the lift. Testimony 0 says Nichody arrived after the crime. But if Gloomsbury was hit with the Time Keeper (Evidence 14), then maybe he was attacked there. But if Gloomsbury was left-handed (since the note in Evidence 7 was smudged as if written by a right-handed person, but the candelabra has his left-hand prints), that might imply he was left-handed. Wait, the note's writing is smudged as if written by a right-handed person, but Gloomsbury's dominant hand is left (Evidence 17). So if the note was written by Gloomsbury, it should be left-handed, but the smudge suggests right-handed. So that would mean the note was written by someone else, contradicting if it was supposed to be his. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Wait, maybe the note (Evidence7) is supposed to be written by Gloomsbury, but since he's left-handed, the smudging (from a right-handed person) would mean someone else wrote it. If Nichody's testimony doesn't mention this, maybe a contradiction. But that's between evidence and the note's origin, not a testimony.

Alternatively, Testimony 3: Nichody tore the page from the notebook. Evidence 18 says a page was torn. But if Sorin's notebook is a meticulous daily record, then Sorin would have written about the events leading up to the murder. If Nichody tore the page to protect Sorin, maybe the torn page would have incriminating info. However, the contradiction here isn't obvious. 

Wait, another angle. Testimony 4 says Nichody hid the body in the spare Pegabull lantern in the hold. Evidence 5 says the lantern was wheeled from hold to reception by Larry before the reception began. If the body was hidden in the hold's lantern, and Larry moved it, then the body would be in the reception hall. So when was the body placed? If Nichody hid it in the hold's lantern, and Larry moved that same lantern to the reception, then the body is discovered there. That seems to line up. So no contradiction here.

Hmm. Let me check Evidence 16: Lift Bloodstain matches the blood on the candelabra (Evidence17). If the candelabra has Gloomsbury's blood, then he was bleeding in the lift. But if Nichody moved the body to the lantern in the hold, maybe there's a contradiction in the blood evidence. But not directly conflicting with any testimony.

Wait, Testimony 3: Nichody says he tore the page to protect Sorin. But if the notebook (Evidence18) is Sorin's, and a page is torn out, maybe Sorin wrote something incriminating. But how does that contradict? Maybe if the page was torn after Sorin wrote in it, but the notebook is a daily record. If Sorin was writing during the time of the crime (Testimony1: Nichody saw Sorin writing in the notebook), then the torn page would be that entry. But if Nichody tore it, then Sorin's notebook would have a missing entry. That's possible. Still not a direct contradiction.

Wait, maybe look at the Autopsy Report (Evidence14): the victim was hit twice. If Nichody claims he found them already collapsed (Testimony1), then maybe the two blows contradict something. But how?

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 4: Nichody hid the body in the hold's lantern. Evidence5 says that the lantern in which the body was found has a bloodstain on the inside wheel handle as if someone gripped it with a bloody hand. If Nichody hid the body in the lantern, then the bloodstain might be from him. But the bloodstain is on the inside wheel handle. However, Evidence16 says the lift bloodstain matches the candelabra, which has Gloomsbury's blood. So if the blood on the lantern's handle is from Nichody moving the body, but the blood on the candelabra and lift is Gloomsbury's, that's possible. But how does that contradict?

Wait, Testimony3: Nichody tore the page from the notebook. Evidence18's notebook has a torn page, so that's consistent. Not a contradiction.

Wait, Testimony2: Nichody says Sorin told him to take the blame. Then Testimony3: Nichody tore the page to protect Sorin. If Sorin wanted to take the blame, but Nichody tried to hide evidence by tearing the page, that's in line. So no contradiction here.

Another angle: Ellen's Statement (Evidence2) says she saw a suspicious third party on the vista deck when attacked. But Nichody's Testimony0 says he rushed to the vista deck after the crime was committed. So if Ellen saw a third party (maybe the real attacker), but Nichody arrived after, then the attacker could be someone else. But how does that contradict Nichody's testimony?

Wait, if Ellen saw a third party during her attack, and Nichody arrived after, then Nichody wasn't that third party. But that doesn't directly contradict unless Nichody's testimony says he was there at the time. But Testimony0 says he arrived after the crime. So if the third party is someone else, then maybe the real attacker is that third party. But how does that contradict?

Alternatively, maybe the third party Ellen saw was Nichody. If she saw someone, but Nichody claims he arrived after the crime, that would be a contradiction. Let's check: Ellen's Statement (Evidence2) says she saw a suspicious third party on the vista deck when attacked. Testimony0 says Nichody rushed there but the crime was already done. If Ellen was being attacked by Gloomsbury and saw Nichody (third party), then Nichody's claim that he arrived after the crime is contradictory. Because if Ellen saw him during the attack, he was present then, but he says he arrived after. So Ellen's Statement (Evidence2) contradicts Nichody's Testimony0.

But the problem is, Ellen's Statement says "suspicious third party" but doesn't name who. So if Nichody was that third party, then his Testimony0 is a lie. That would be a contradiction between Evidence2 and Testimony0. Because Ellen saw someone during the attack, but Nichody says he arrived after. So if Nichody was the attacker or present during the attack, but claims he arrived after, that's a contradiction.

So the pair would be Evidence2 and Testimony0. Let me confirm. Ellen's Statement (Evidence2) says she saw a third party during the attack. Nichody's Testimony0 says he arrived after the crime was committed. If Nichody was that third party, then his testimony is false. Therefore, Evidence2 contradicts Testimony0.

But wait, maybe Ellen saw someone else, not Nichody. But the contradiction could still exist if Nichody's testimony implies that no one else was there. But the problem states that the contradiction is between evidence and testimony. So if the evidence says there was a third party (Ellen saw them), but Nichody's testimony (Testimony0) says he arrived after the crime, implying that the crime was already done when he got there, then the presence of a third party during the attack (as per Ellen) would mean Nichody's statement about arriving after the crime might not directly contradict unless he's the third party. But if Ellen's statement is evidence that a third party was present during the attack, and Nichody's testimony says he arrived after, then unless Nichody is that third party, there's no direct contradiction. But if Ellen's statement is about seeing someone else, then there's no contradiction. However, if the third party is Nichody, then his testimony is a lie. Since we don't know who the third party is, but the question is about which evidence and testimony contradict each other, perhaps this is the pair.

Alternatively, perhaps another contradiction. Let me check other possibilities.

Looking at Testimony5: Nichody says he tore the page to protect Master Sorin. Evidence19: Newspaper article about Selena's accident where Sorin was driving. If Sorin felt guilty about that, maybe the torn page related to that, but not sure.

Wait, Evidence7: Gloomsbury's Note, written as if by a right-handed person. But Gloomsbury's dominant hand was left (Evidence17). So the note was not written by Gloomsbury. If the note is supposed to be a suicide note or something from him, this contradicts. But how does this relate to testimonies?

If Nichody's testimony claims that Gloomsbury wrote the note, but the evidence shows it was written by a right-handed person, then contradiction. But the testimonies don't mention the note. So maybe not relevant here.

Wait, another thought. Testimony4: Nichody hid the body in the hold's spare Pegabull lantern. Evidence5: the lantern was wheeled by Larry from hold to reception before the reception began. So if the body was hidden in the hold's lantern before Larry moved it, then when Larry moved it, the body would be inside. But Evidence6 says the victim was discovered in the lantern in the reception hall, which aligns. So no contradiction here.

Wait, but the Autopsy Report (Evidence14) says the Time Keeper was used as the murder weapon, and it was activated. The Key of Love (Evidence20) is needed to activate it. If Sorin had the key (since Ellen's Pendant, Evidence1, was from Sorin), maybe. But how does that relate to testimonies?

Alternatively, Sorin's Notebook (Evidence18) has a torn page. Nichody's Testimony3 says he tore it. So that aligns. No contradiction.

Wait, what about the Fog Machine (Evidence8) and Photo of Reception (Evidence10) showing fog. If the fog was present during the reception, maybe hiding something. But not related to testimonies.

Hmm. Going back to the original thought, Ellen's Statement (Evidence2) and Nichody's Testimony0. If Ellen saw a third party during the attack, and Nichody arrived after, then the third party could be the real culprit. But if Nichody is lying about arriving after and was actually the third party, that's a contradiction. But the problem is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So Ellen's Statement (Evidence2) directly states a third party was present during the attack, which contradicts Nichody's Testimony0 where he implies that when he arrived, the crime was already done and no one else was there. But unless Nichody is the third party, it's not a direct contradiction. However, since Ellen's Statement is evidence that someone else was present, and Nichody's testimony says he arrived after the crime, it's possible that the third party is the actual attacker, so Nichody's Testimony0 doesn't necessarily contradict. But maybe there's another angle.

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony3: Nichody says he tore the page from the notebook to protect Sorin. Evidence18's notebook has a torn page. If the notebook is Sorin's, and Sorin writes in it daily, then the torn page would be a recent entry. But if Sorin was writing in the notebook at the time of the crime (Testimony1 says Nichody saw Sorin writing in the notebook), then the torn page would be that entry. If Nichody tore it, then Sorin's current entry would be missing. But how does that create a contradiction? Maybe the notebook's meticulous nature (Evidence18) means that Sorin would have written about the events, but if the page is torn, that's missing. However, this doesn't directly contradict the testimony. Nichody admits to tearing the page.

Wait, the contradiction might be that if the notebook is a detailed record, then Sorin would have written about the incident. If Nichody tore the page to hide that, but the torn page's absence in the notebook (Evidence18) is explained by Testimony3. So that's consistent.

Maybe another angle: The Hold Entry Record (Evidence15) logs key card accesses. If Nichody hid the body in the hold (Testimony4), then his key card would have been used to enter the hold. But if the entry record doesn't show his access, that contradicts. However, the evidence description doesn't specify whose key was used, so we can't confirm.

Alternatively, Evidence5's Broken Lantern has a bloodstain on the inside wheel handle. If Nichody hid the body in the lantern (Testimony4), then perhaps his blood would be there. But the bloodstain matches the lift and candelabra (Evidence16 and 17), which is Gloomsbury's. So Nichody moving the body would have his blood only if he was injured, but the blood on the handle is from the victim. So that's possible. No contradiction here.

Wait, going back to the first idea: Ellen's Statement (Evidence2) vs. Nichody's Testimony0. If Ellen saw a third party during the attack, but Nichody claims he arrived after the crime was committed, then if Nichody is the third party, his testimony is false. But Ellen's statement doesn't specify who the third party was. However, if Nichody's testimony says he arrived after the attack, but Ellen's evidence suggests someone was present during the attack, then there's a contradiction in the timeline. Because the attack would have been ongoing when Ellen saw the third party, implying Nichody could have been present during the attack, contradicting his claim that he arrived after the crime was committed.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Ellen's Statement (Evidence2) and Nichody's Testimony0. Ellen's evidence indicates a third party was present during the attack, which is when the crime was happening. Nichody's testimony claims he arrived after the crime was already committed, implying the crime had concluded. But if the third party was there during the attack, then the crime was still in progress, and Nichody's arrival timing contradicts that.

So the pair would be Evidence2 and Testimony0. Therefore, the answer is {"evidence": 2, "testimony": 0}.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 0}
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. They want one pair. Let's start by looking at the testimonies given by Nichody. There are six testimonies here, numbered 0 to 5.

Looking at the testimonies:

Testimony 0: ............. (probably just silence or something)
Testimony 1: Gloomsbury was my right hand man. I'd suffer the most from losing him.
Testimony 2: .............
Testimony 3: I've never thought of exacting revenge on Master Sorin.
Testimony 4: .............
Testimony 5: I was always in the company of others. I didn't have the opportunity to murder Gloomsbury.

Now, the evidences. Let's go through them. The key here is to find a contradiction between what Nichody says in his testimony and one of the evidences.

Looking at Evidence 17: Candelabra with Gloomsbury's left-hand fingerprints. It's mentioned that his dominant hand is left. But Testimony 7 (Gloomsbury's Note) says the note was smudged as if written by a right-handed person. Wait, but the candelabra has his left-hand prints, which is his dominant. So if he was right-handed, that would contradict. Wait, but according to Evidence 17, Gloomsbury's left hand is dominant. So if the note (Evidence 7) was written by a right-handed person, but Gloomsbury is left-handed, then the note wasn't written by him. But how does that connect to Nichody's testimony?

Wait, maybe looking at Nichody's testimony 5: He claims he was with others, so no opportunity. But if there's evidence showing he could have been alone, that would contradict. Let me check.

Evidence 15 is the Hold Entry Record, which logs key card access. If Nichody's key card was used to enter the hold when the murder happened, that might contradict his alibi. But I don't know if that's in the evidence.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3: Nichody says he never thought of exacting revenge on Sorin. But maybe there's evidence that he had a motive related to Sorin. Evidence 19 is the newspaper article about Selena's death, where Sorin was driving. If Nichody had a connection to Selena, maybe he wanted revenge. But how does that tie into a contradiction with his testimony? If he said he didn't want revenge, but evidence suggests he did, that's a contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 11 is Selena's photo. Maybe Nichody was close to Selena and wanted revenge on Sorin for her death. Then his testimony 3 ("I've never thought of exacting revenge on Master Sorin") would be contradicted by evidence showing he had a motive. But which evidence directly contradicts that? The newspaper article (19) says Sorin was driving in the accident that killed Selena. If Nichody was connected to Selena (maybe via Evidence 9, the business card wallet with a familiar imprint?), but the business card wallet's description is a bit vague.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 17: The candelabra has Gloomsbury's left-hand fingerprints, which is his dominant hand. The note (Evidence 7) was written by a right-handed person. So the note wasn't written by Gloomsbury. If Nichody claims that Gloomsbury wrote the note (maybe in another testimony?), but that's not present here. Wait, in the given testimonies, Nichody's testimonies don't mention the note. Hmm.

Alternatively, Testimony 5: Nichody says he was always with others, no opportunity. But Evidence 15 (Hold Entry Record) might show that someone used a key card to access the hold during the time of the murder. If Nichody's key card was used, that would place him at the scene, contradicting his alibi. But the description of Evidence 15 just says it's a record of key cards used. Unless the entry record shows that Nichody accessed the hold when he claimed to be elsewhere. But without knowing the specifics of the entry record, it's hard to say. However, if in the hold entry log (Evidence 15), there's an entry that matches Nichody's key card, that would contradict his Testimony 5 where he claims he was always with others. But since the evidence descriptions don't specify whose key cards were used, this might be a stretch.

Another angle: Testimony 3: "I've never thought of exacting revenge on Master Sorin." If there's evidence that shows he had a motive to take revenge on Sorin, like the newspaper article (19) where Sorin was responsible for Selena's death, and perhaps Nichody was close to Selena. Maybe Evidence 11 (Selena's photo) taken in an office, and if the business card wallet (Evidence 9) has an imprint related to her, but this is speculative.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 20: Key of Love used to activate the Time Keeper. If Nichody had access to this key, maybe through his pocket watch (Evidence 9's Pierce Nichody has a pocket watch he's attached to). Maybe the key is connected to the pocket watch, which would mean he had the means to activate the murder weapon. But how does that contradict his testimonies?

Wait, Testimony 5: Nichody says he didn't have the opportunity. If Evidence 15 (Hold Entry Record) shows his key card was used, that's a contradiction. But the problem is, the user's answer must be based on the given evidence and testimonies. Since we don't have the exact content of Evidence 15's log, but perhaps there's another way.

Alternatively, Testimony 1: Nichody says Gloomsbury was his right-hand man. But Evidence 17 says Gloomsbury's dominant hand was left. So if Nichody refers to Gloomsbury as his right-hand man (as in trusted), but that's a play on words. Maybe that's not a contradiction. Hmm.

Wait, Testimony 3: "I've never thought of exacting revenge on Master Sorin." If there's evidence that shows Nichody had a reason to want revenge on Sorin, that would contradict this. Evidence 19 states that Sorin was driving in the accident that killed Selena. If Nichody was close to Selena (maybe her lover?), then he would have a motive. For example, if Selena's photo (Evidence 11) was in his possession, or if the business card (Evidence 9) relates to her. But the problem is, the evidence descriptions don't explicitly state that. However, perhaps the Autopsy Report (14) says the Time Keeper was used twice. If Nichody had to have access to the key (Evidence 20) to activate it, that's a possibility. But how does that tie into his testimony?

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 5: He claims he was with others. But Evidence 13 is a photo of the hold taken by Larry, showing Ellen in the center. If Nichody was also in the hold, that might contradict his alibi. But the photo only shows Ellen. Unless there's someone else, but it's not mentioned.

Wait, perhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Nichody claims he was always with others, no opportunity) and Evidence 15 (Hold Entry Record). If the Hold Entry Record shows that someone accessed the hold during the time of the murder, and if Nichody's key was used, then that would contradict his alibi. But since we don't know the specifics of Evidence 15's data, maybe there's another angle.

Alternatively, Testimony 3: "I've never thought of exacting revenge on Master Sorin." If Evidence 19 (newspaper article) shows that Sorin was responsible for Selena's death, and Evidence 11 (Selena's photo) perhaps implies Nichody had a connection to her. If Nichody was close to Selena, he might want revenge. Then his testimony 3 would be a lie. But does the evidence directly link Nichody to Selena? The business card wallet (Evidence 9) has a familiar imprint. If the imprint is Selena's, then that could link Nichody to her, giving him motive. But the evidence description doesn't say that. However, perhaps Ellen's pendant (Evidence 1) is from Sorin, and Selena's death via Sorin's accident could be the motive. If Nichody loved Selena, he'd want revenge. So his testimony 3 would be contradicted by Evidence 19 and 11 implying motive.

But the problem is, the evidence descriptions don't explicitly state Nichody's connection to Selena. However, the user's answer requires only one pair. So, perhaps the most direct contradiction is between Testimony 3 (no revenge thoughts) and Evidence 19 (Sorin caused Selena's death), assuming Nichody had a motive tied to Selena.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 5: He claims he was with others. Evidence 15 (Hold Entry Record) might show his key card accessed the hold alone, which would give him opportunity. But the evidence description for 15 says it's a record of key cards used. If Nichody's key was used to enter the hold when the murder happened, that's a contradiction. But again, without explicit info, but maybe that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, maybe the Fog Machine (Evidence 8) and the Photo of Reception (10) show fog, which could have allowed Nichody to move without being seen, contradicting his Testimony 5 about being with others. But that's a stretch.

Wait, Testimony 5: "I was always in the company of others. I didn't have the opportunity." If the Lift Bloodstain (16) has blood matching the candelabra (17) which has Gloomsbury's blood, maybe Nichody was in the lift alone and got blood there, contradicting his alibi. But how? The bloodstain is on the lift, and if Nichody was there alone, then his Testimony 5 is false. But connecting that would require some steps.

Alternatively, the Time Keeper (4) requires the Key of Love (20). If Nichody had access to the key (maybe through his pocket watch, as he's attached to it), that could mean he could activate the murder weapon. But that's more about means than opportunity.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me try to summarize possible contradictions:

1. Testimony 3 (no revenge) vs Evidence 19 (Sorin caused Selena's death, Nichody's possible motive)
2. Testimony 5 (no opportunity) vs Evidence 15 (Hold Entry Record shows his access)
3. Testimony 5 vs Evidence 13 (photo shows Ellen in hold, but not sure how it affects Nichody)
4. Testimony 1 (Gloomsbury was right-hand man) vs Evidence 17 (Gloomsbury is left-handed, but this might not be a direct contradiction)

I think the most likely answer is Testimony 3 contradicted by Evidence 19, assuming Nichody wanted revenge for Selena's death. But how? The user might expect that the newspaper article (19) shows Sorin was responsible for Selena's death, and if Nichody was close to her (maybe through the photo in Evidence 11 or business card), he had a motive. Therefore, Testimony 3 ("never thought of revenge") is contradicted by Evidence 19.

Alternatively, if the business card wallet (9) has an imprint related to Selena, then Nichody's connection to her is established. But the description of Evidence 9 is vague: "peculiar yet suspiciously familiar imprint." If that imprint is Selena's, then combined with the newspaper article (19), it would give Nichody a motive for revenge against Sorin, contradicting Testimony 3.

But without explicit mention in the evidence, this is speculative. However, the question is to find the one pair. Given the options, the likely answer is {"evidence": 19, "testimony": 3} because Evidence 19 provides a motive (Sorin caused Selena's death) which contradicts Nichody's claim in Testimony 3 that he never thought of revenge. Alternatively, maybe the Key of Love (20) and Testimony 3. Wait, the Key of Love is used to activate the Time Keeper. If Nichody had the key, that links him to the murder weapon. But how does that contradict his testimonies?

Alternatively, maybe Sorin's Notebook (18) has a torn page, which could be relevant if Nichody tore it to hide his actions. But that's not directly contradicting a testimony.

Wait, let me check the Autopsy Report (14): The victim was hit twice with the Time Keeper. If Nichody's alibi is that he was with others, but the murder required two hits, which takes time, maybe that's a contradiction. But not sure.

Alternatively, Evidence 7 (Gloomsbury's Note) written by a right-handed person, but Gloomsbury was left-handed (Evidence 17). So the note was forged. If Nichody is right-handed, that could imply he wrote the note, which would connect to his testimony. But none of his testimonies mention the note. Unless he claimed Gloomsbury wrote it, but there's no testimony about that here.

Alternatively, Testimony 5: "I was always in the company of others." If Evidence 15 shows his key card was used to enter the hold alone, that would contradict. But without knowing the content of Evidence 15's log, it's hard to confirm. But maybe the answer expects that combination.

Alternatively, looking back at the problem, the user says "You must only answer one pair." So maybe the intended answer is Evidence 17 (Candelabra with left-hand prints) and Testimony 7 (the note written by right-handed). But Testimony 7 isn't a testimony by Nichody. Wait, the testimonies given are all by Nichody (Testimonies 0-5). Evidence 7 is Gloomsbury's note. The contradiction here is that the note is written by a right-handed person, but Gloomsbury is left-handed. Therefore, the note was not written by him, suggesting someone else wrote it. But how does that contradict Nichody's testimony? Maybe if Nichody said something about the note being written by Gloomsbury, but in the provided testimonies, he doesn't mention the note.

So perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (no opportunity) and Evidence 15 (Hold Entry Record), if his key card is in the log. But without explicit info, maybe the answer is different.

Wait, maybe Evidence 9: Business Card Wallet with a familiar imprint. If the imprint matches the Time Keeper's Key (20), then Nichody has the key, which contradicts his Testimony 5 about not having the opportunity. But again, this is speculative.

Given the options, I think the most plausible answer is Testimony 3 (Nichody denies wanting revenge) and Evidence 19 (newspaper shows Sorin caused Selena's death, implying Nichody's motive). So the JSON would be {"evidence": 19, "testimony": 3}.

{"evidence": 19, "testimony": 3}

Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by going through the testimonies and evidences one by one.

First, looking at the testimonies from Dee Vasquez. Testimony 3 says, "I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me." That refers to them going to Studio One after the meeting. Now, the evidence list includes Evidence 18, which is a van used by Sal Manella to drive Vasquez to Studio One. But wait, there's another evidence: Evidence 18's description says Manella used the van to drive her to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer. So the testimony from Vasquez (Testimony 3) says she had Sal take her because she was fatigued, but according to Evidence 18, they used the van. But maybe that's not a contradiction. Let me check the timing.

Wait, looking at Testimony 1: the meeting ended at 4:00 PM, and Testimony 2 says they went to Studio One after the meeting. So they would have gone after 4:00 PM. However, the murder happened at 2:30 PM (Autopsy Report, Evidence 3). So maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Another testimony from Vasquez is Testimony 5: "Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer." The evidence list includes Evidence 16: Steak Plate found in the employee area with traces of sleeping pills and a large bone. So if they ate steaks in front of the trailer, why is the plate found in the employee area? Or maybe the plate is from that meal, but the presence of sleeping pills on it contradicts something. Also, the steak plate has traces of sleeping pills and a bone. If they ate the steaks during the meeting break, maybe. Wait, Testimony 4 says they took a 15-minute break at 2:30 PM. The time of death is also 2:30 PM. If they were on a break at that time, perhaps they ate then. But the plate is found in the employee area, but Vasquez says they ate in front of the trailer. So that could be a contradiction. The steak plate (Evidence 16) is in the employee area, but the testimony (Testimony 5) says they ate in front of the trailer. That's conflicting locations. So the steak plate's location contradicts Testimony 5's claim of where they ate. Therefore, Evidence 16 contradicts Testimony 5.

Alternatively, let's check another angle. Testimony 5 says they ate steaks on the table in front of the trailer, but the Steak Plate (Evidence 16) was found in the employee area. That's a location discrepancy. If they ate in front of the trailer, the plate should be there, but it's found elsewhere. So that's a contradiction. So the evidence would be 16 and testimony 5. 

Another possibility: the empty bottle (Evidence 7) has Jack Hammer's fingerprints. If the victim was killed at 2:30 PM, but the sleeping pills were in the bottle with his prints, but he was killed by a spear. Maybe the sleeping pills were used on someone else. But how does that tie into the testimonies?

Alternatively, looking at the Security Lady's statement (Character 4) that she saw Powers heading to the scene, but maybe the photo (Evidence 5) shows Powers at 2:00 PM, perhaps contradicting something else. But that's not part of the testimonies provided here. The testimonies we have to consider are only those listed under Testimonies, which are all from Vasquez. So the user is asking which of Vasquez's testimonies contradict an evidence.

So back to the steak plate. Testimony 5 says they ate in front of the trailer, but the plate is found in the employee area. That's a contradiction. So the evidence is 16 and testimony 5. Let me confirm the evidence numbers. Evidence 16 is the Steak Plate. Testimony 5 is Vasquez's fifth testimony about eating steaks in front of the trailer. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 16 (found in employee area) and Testimony 5 (ate in front of trailer). So the correct answer is {"evidence": 16, "testimony":5}.

Wait, but the user said to answer one pair. Let me check again. 

Another possible contradiction: Vasquez's Testimony 1 says the meeting ended at 4:00 PM. The van (Evidence 18) was used to drive her to Studio One after the meeting. But the Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11) blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. If the crime happened at 2:30 PM, and the path was blocked until 4, how did they get to Studio One after 4 if the path was blocked until then? Wait, but the crime scene was blocked during that time. So if the murder happened at 2:30, the path was blocked from 2:15 to 4:00. So the killer couldn't have left the scene during that time unless there was another way. But maybe this is unrelated to Vasquez's testimony. 

Alternatively, the Security Lady (Character 4) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene. But the photo (Evidence 5) taken at 2:00 PM shows Powers dragging a leg. If he was at the gate at 2:00 PM, but the Security Lady says he went to the scene, but the path was blocked from 2:15. However, this involves other characters' testimonies, which are not part of the provided testimonies here. The testimonies given are only from Vasquez.

So the main contradiction is the steak plate location. Hence, Evidence 16 contradicts Testimony 5.

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by going through the testimonies and checking the evidences one by one.

First, looking at the testimonies given by Vasquez. Testimony 5 says Vasquez went back to the trailer to get her script and direction notes. Then in Testimony 7, she mentions leaving Hammer behind because he was injured and couldn't do action scenes. Wait, but there's Evidence 9, which is Vasquez's Memo that says "Bring me the script from Episode 13". And Evidence 10 is the Script from Episode 13. So if she had a memo telling her to get the script, but her testimony says she went to get her own script and notes, maybe there's a contradiction here. Wait, but how does that directly contradict? Hmm.

Wait, another angle. Let's look at Testimony 0, where Vasquez says she was with Sal and Oldbag when they found the body. Then Testimony 2 says she called the police, and then Powers showed up. But there's Evidence 5, Powers'(?) Photo, which shows him at 2:00 PM dragging a leg. The autopsy report (Evidence 3) says time of death was 2:30 PM. If the photo shows Powers at 2 PM, and the murder happened at 2:30, but Testimony 2 says Powers showed up after the body was found. Wait, when was the body found? The security lady's testimony (Character 4) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene, but that's not directly a testimony here. Wait, the testimonies listed here are all from Vasquez. 

Wait, Testimony 2 says that after she called the police, Powers showed up. But the photo (Evidence 5) is from 2:00 PM, which is before the time of death at 2:30 PM. If Powers was in the photo at 2 PM, then he was already at the scene before the murder, but according to Vasquez's testimony, Powers showed up after the body was found (which would be after 2:30 PM). That seems contradictory. Because if the body was found at 2:30 PM (time of death), then Vasquez called the police after that. Then Powers shows up. But the photo shows him there at 2 PM. So if Powers was already there before the murder, how come he only showed up after the body was found? That's a contradiction between Evidence 5 (photo) and Testimony 2 (Vasquez says Powers showed up after she called police, which would be after 2:30 PM). So the photo is at 2 PM, which is 30 minutes before the time of death, but Vasquez's testimony implies Powers wasn't there until after the body was found. That's a contradiction. 

Another possible contradiction: Testimony 5 says Vasquez went back to the trailer to get the script. Evidence 10 is the script from Episode 13, and Evidence 9 is her memo asking to bring the script. So if she went to get the script, but maybe the script was already there? Or maybe there's a timing issue. Alternatively, the van (Evidence 18) was used by Manella to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer. If she was in the trailer, maybe the van's use contradicts her movement. Hmm, not sure.

But the main contradiction seems to be between the photo of Powers at 2 PM (Evidence 5) and Vasquez's Testimony 2 where she claims Powers showed up after she called the police (which would be after 2:30 PM). Therefore, the photo contradicts her statement that Powers arrived after the body was found, because the photo shows him there 30 minutes earlier.

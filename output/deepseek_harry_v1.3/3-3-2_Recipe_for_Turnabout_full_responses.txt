Okay, let's start by going through the evidence and testimonies to find contradictions.

First, let's look at the testimonies from Gumshoe. Testimony 5 says that there was nothing else missing from the crime scene. But looking at the evidence, Evidence 17 is the Victim's Prescription Bag, which is described as empty. However, the victim had a prescription from the doctor before going to Trés Bien. If the bag was found empty at the scene, but the victim was supposed to have medication from the doctor, maybe there's something missing here. But wait, the testimony says nothing was missing, but the prescription bag is empty. If the medication was supposed to be in the bag but wasn't found, that would mean something was missing, contradicting Testimony 5. However, the evidence states that the bag was on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket, so maybe the medication was already taken by the victim. Hmm, not sure if that's a direct contradiction.

Another angle: Evidence 14 is the Victim's Lottery Ticket found on Maggey during the search. Testimony 4 says when Maggey was searched, they found the lottery ticket and the poison. But Evidence 14 says the ticket was found during a body search of Maggey. So that's consistent. Maybe not a contradiction here.

Looking at Evidence 3: The Sports Paper has a doodle by the victim about 'MC Bomber' and 100,000 crossed out. The autopsy report (Evidence 10) says time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. Testimony 0 says the crime was reported at 2:25 PM by an old man. If the Sports Paper was left by the victim on Dec 3rd, the day of the incident, and the doodle is in his handwriting, but if the victim was at the restaurant during the time leading up to his death, maybe there's a connection. Not directly contradicting a testimony yet.

Evidence 6: Small Bottle with the victim's ear medicine, but covered in Furio Tigre's fingerprints. If the victim's medicine was found in the kitchen with Tigre's prints, that suggests Tigre handled it. But according to Testimony 5, nothing else was missing. However, the bottle was present but with someone else's fingerprints. Not sure if that's a contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 17 says the prescription bag was empty. If the victim was supposed to have medication, and the bag is empty, but the small bottle (Evidence 6) is his ear medicine, maybe that's the medication. So the bag is empty because the ear medicine was taken out. So maybe no contradiction there.

Another possible contradiction: Testimony 3 says they figured out the victim's identity quickly, but Evidence 2 is a Magazine Clipping from Dec 5th saying the attorney (Phoenix) was trounced and client found guilty. However, the incident happened on Dec 3rd. The clipping is from two days later. If the investigation went smoothly as per Testimony 3, but the Magazine Clipping is about a trial that happened after the incident, maybe that's not directly related. Not sure.

Looking at Testimony 5 again: "nothing else missing from the crime scene." But Evidence 1 is Maya's Magatama, which was recovered in the kitchen. If the Magatama was there but not initially part of the scene, maybe it was missing? Wait, the Magatama was on loan from Maya and recovered in the kitchen. So if it was left there, maybe it wasn't part of the original crime scene items. But Testimony 5 says nothing was missing. However, the Magatama wasn't supposed to be part of the scene, so maybe it's an added item. Not sure if that's a contradiction.

Another angle: Evidence 23 is MC Bomber, a virus program made by Glen Elg. The Sports Paper (Evidence 3) has the victim's doodle referencing MC Bomber. The calendar (Evidence 20) shows Glen had a meeting with "The Tiger" (Furio Tigre) on Dec 3rd. If Tigre is involved, and the virus is valuable, maybe there's a motive. But how does this contradict testimonies?

Wait, Testimony 5 says nothing else was missing. But if the MC Bomber disc was at Tender Lender, but originally created by Glen, perhaps it was taken from the scene. But the testimony refers to the crime scene (Trés Bien), and the disc was found elsewhere. So maybe not a direct contradiction.

Looking back at Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) and Testimony 5. The Sports Paper was left by a customer (the victim) on Dec 3rd. The testimony says nothing was missing. The Sports Paper was part of the scene, so it's accounted for. No contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 14: Lottery ticket found on Maggey. If the lottery ticket was the victim's, then taking it would mean something was stolen from the scene. But Testimony 5 says nothing was missing. However, the lottery ticket was found on Maggey, implying it was taken from the victim, hence missing from the scene. That's a contradiction. Because if the ticket was on the victim (as per Evidence 17, which mentions the lottery ticket was found on the victim's table along with the prescription bag), but then found on Maggey, then the ticket was moved. So the ticket was taken from the scene, hence something was missing. Testimony 5 claims nothing was missing, but the ticket was missing from the scene and found on Maggey. Therefore, Evidence 14 contradicts Testimony 5.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's go through each testimony and check against the evidence.

Testimony 0: Victor Kudo says the young man (victim) was reading the sports paper. Evidence 3 is the Sports Paper from Dec 3rd, the day of the incident. The evidence says the victim left it with a doodle. So that seems consistent. No contradiction here.

Testimony 1: Kudo claims Maggey brought the victim a javaccino and put something in it. Evidence 13 is the Coffee Cup with cyanide and Maggey's fingerprints. But wait, the autopsy (Evidence 10) says potassium cyanide poisoning. Evidence 16 also says cyanide was found in Maggey's apron. However, Kudo says she put white powder in the drink. But potassium cyanide is a powdery poison, so that could align. Hmm.

Testimony 2: Kudo insists she conspicuously put white powder. But if the cyanide was in her apron, maybe there's a contradiction. Wait, the Coffee Cup has Maggey's fingerprints. But maybe the method of administration? Let me check the autopsy again. The cause is cyanide in the coffee. So if Kudo saw her put powder in, which matches the cyanide in the coffee, but maybe the problem is elsewhere.

Testimony 5: Kudo mentions Maggey had a ribbon and loose apron straps. Evidence 15 is the apron with small pockets but big stains. Not sure if that's a contradiction. Maybe the straps being loose vs. how the apron was worn? Not obvious.

Looking at Testimony 4: Kudo points to Maggey as the defendant. But Evidence 14 says the lottery ticket was found on Maggey. Wait, maybe the real killer planted it? Not sure.

Wait, Testimony 2 says Kudo saw her put white powder in the coffee. But Evidence 16 says the cyanide was found in her apron pocket. If she put the powder from her pocket into the coffee, then her fingerprints would be on both the cup and the cyanide. That's possible. But maybe there's another angle.

Wait, Evidence 6 is the small bottle (ear medicine) with Furio Tigre's fingerprints. The victim's prescription bag (Evidence 17) is empty. If the victim had ear medicine, maybe the killer used that. But how does that tie into the testimonies?

Looking at Evidence 3: Sports Paper with a doodle about 'MC Bomber' and '100,000' crossed out. The victim's handwriting. Maybe this connects to the MC Bomber evidence (23), which is a computer virus. Glen's calendar (20) mentions meeting "The Tiger" (Furio Tigre). So perhaps the victim was involved with Tigre. 

Wait, Testimony 2 says Kudo saw Maggey put powder in the coffee, but Evidence 13's Coffee Cup has the victim's and Maggey's fingerprints. However, the Coffee Cup's description mentions a lip stain on the front and a floral handle. If the victim drank from it, his lip stain would be there. But if the poison was in the coffee, how was it administered? Maybe the poison was in the ear medicine bottle? But the autopsy says potassium cyanide in the coffee.

Wait, Evidence 6 is the ear medicine bottle with Furio's fingerprints. The contents are unknown, but the victim's ear medicine. If the bottle was supposed to have the medicine, but instead had cyanide, that could be a way. But the autopsy says the coffee had cyanide. So maybe the cyanide came from the apron, which Maggey supposedly put in the coffee. But if Kudo saw her put it in, then that's the prosecution's case.

But what contradicts? Let's see. Testimony 2 claims she put white powder in the coffee. Evidence 16 says the cyanide was in her apron. So that's consistent. Wait, but maybe the problem is with the presence of the cyanide in the apron. If Maggey used the cyanide from her apron to poison the coffee, then the cyanide in the apron would have been used up, but Evidence 16 says it was found there. Wait, but maybe she had some left. Or maybe the cyanide in the apron is the source, which she used. So that's not a contradiction.

Wait, another angle: Evidence 13's Coffee Cup has the victim's and Maggey's fingerprints. The lip stain is on the front, handle to the right. If the cup was facing the victim, then the lip stain would be where he drank. But if Maggey served it, her fingerprints would be on it. That seems okay.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is in Testimony 5 where Kudo says Maggey's apron straps were loose. Evidence 15 says the apron has small pockets but big stains. If the straps were loose, maybe the apron wasn't secured properly, making it harder to carry something in the pockets without spilling. But not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 1: Kudo says Maggey brought a javaccino. But the Lunch Special (Evidence 5) is a bad-tasting lunch. Maybe javaccino isn't part of the lunch special. Not sure.

Wait, Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony where he says he broke the vase at his seat. But in the Crime Photo (12), there's a vase on each table. If he broke his vase, the photo should show a broken vase on his table. But the Crime Photo description says both vases are intact. Wait, no: Crime Photo says two tables separated by a folding screen. The one closer to the camera is empty, the other is where the victim collapsed. Each has an intact vase. But Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony) says he broke the vase at his seat. So if Victor was sitting at the empty table (closer to camera), then his vase should be broken. But the photo shows both vases intact. That's a contradiction between Testimony 18 (Victor's statement) and Evidence 12 (Crime Photo). But wait, Testimony 18 is listed as "Victor's Testimony: 'When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry.'" So according to Victor, he broke his vase during the incident. But the Crime Photo shows both vases intact. That's a contradiction. So Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) shows intact vases, but Victor's Testimony (18) says he broke his. However, Testimony 18 is not listed in the testimonies provided. Wait, the testimonies given are from 0 to 6, all by Kudo. Wait, looking back:

The Testimonies listed are Testimony 0 to Testimony 6, all by Kudo. Testimony 18 is Victor's Testimony but it's listed under Evidences as Evidence 18. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the Testimonies section:

Testimonies:
Testimony 0 to Testimony 6: all by Kudo.

Then, Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony. So Evidence 18 is a testimony from Victor, but in the Testimonies section, only Kudo's testimonies are listed. So if the question is about contradictions between any evidence and any testimony (including those in the Evidences list?), then maybe Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) contradicts Evidence 12 (Crime Photo). But the user's instruction says "Testimonies" which includes the ones under the Testimonies section (0-6, Kudo) and the ones under Evidences (like Evidence 18). Wait, the Testimonies section lists Testimony 0-6 by Kudo. Then Evidence 18 is a separate testimony by Victor. So perhaps the user considers both Testimonies (section) and the testimonies listed under Evidences as testimonies. So the answer could be between Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony), but Testimony 18 is listed as Evidence 18. Wait, but the problem states "Which evidence and testimony contradict each other?" So the testimony in question could be one from the Testimonies list (0-6) or one from the Evidences list that is a testimony (like Evidence 18: Victor's Testimony).

But the user's input lists Testimonies as a separate section with 0-6, all by Kudo. So perhaps the answer should be between an evidence and a testimony from the Testimonies section.

So looking back, maybe Testimony 2 (Kudo says Maggey put white powder in the coffee) and Evidence 6 (small bottle with victim's ear medicine, but with Furio's fingerprints). Wait, maybe the cyanide came from the small bottle instead of the apron. If the cyanide was in the coffee, and the small bottle's contents are unknown but had Furio's prints, perhaps the real killer used the ear medicine bottle to administer the poison. But the autopsy says potassium cyanide in the coffee, which matches Evidence 16 (cyanide in Maggey's apron). So that's consistent with the prosecution's case.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says Maggey's apron straps were loose. Evidence 15 says the apron has small pockets. If the straps were loose, maybe the pockets were accessible, but that's not a contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 6 says "There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front." But Maggey's apron (Evidence 15) has big stains. If the front of her apron had big stains, wouldn't that catch his interest? So Testimony 6 (nothing caught interest from front) vs Evidence 15 (apron with big stains). That's a possible contradiction. Because if her apron had big stains, seeing her from the front would show those stains, which should be noticeable. So Kudo's Testimony 6 contradicts Evidence 15.

So the contradiction would be: Testimony 6 (nothing caught interest from front) vs Evidence 15 (apron with big stains). If the apron had big stains, Kudo should have noticed them when he saw her from the front. Therefore, the testimony and evidence contradict each other.

{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 6}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to pick one pair where the evidence and testimony don't align.

First, I'll look through the testimonies and see if any of them have details that can be cross-checked with the evidence. Let's go through each testimony one by one.

Testimony 0 is from Kudo, saying the victim had broken spectacles. I don't see any evidence mentioning broken glasses, so maybe not relevant here.

Testimony 1: Kudo mentions the victim had a newspaper in his right hand and was rustling the pages. Let's check the evidence. Evidence 13 (Coffee Cup) says the victim had a newspaper in his right hand. Wait, that's the same as the testimony. So no contradiction there.

Testimony 2: Kudo says the young man was listening to the wireless. The wireless? Like a radio? Evidence 19 is the Millionaire Radio Flyer, which mentions a radio program at 1:30 PM. The victim's time of death was between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. So maybe he was listening to the radio show. But is there a contradiction here? Let me check the evidence related to the radio. The Radio Flyer is about a thrilling experience every Monday at 1:30 PM. The autopsy says death was between 1:30 and 2:30. If the radio show was on at 1:30 and the victim was listening, maybe the timing aligns. Not sure if contradiction here.

Testimony 3: Kudo states that the serving girl (Maggey) brought over the javaccino. Evidence 13 is the Coffee Cup which has Maggey's fingerprints. So that's consistent. But wait, the Coffee Cup is described as containing potassium cyanide, and it's covered in Maggey's fingerprints. But according to Testimony 3, she brought the drink, which would explain her fingerprints. However, the contradiction might be elsewhere. Let me think. Wait, the Coffee Cup's description mentions that facing the cup, the lip stain is on the front and the handle is to the right. If the victim was holding the newspaper in his right hand (Testimony 1 and Evidence 13), then he would have to pick up the cup with his left hand. But Testimony 4 says he picked up the cup with his free hand (the left, since the right was holding the newspaper). That might be a point, but I need to check if that's a contradiction. Wait, the testimony says he used his free hand (left) to pick up the cup, which would align with the handle being on the right (so right-handed handle). Wait, if the handle is to the right, then a right-handed person would pick it up with the right hand, but he was holding the newspaper in his right. So he used his left. But the cup's handle is on the right, which might make it awkward for a left-handed grip. However, the lip stain is on the front. Hmm, maybe the position of the handle and the way he drank. But I'm not sure if that's a contradiction here.

Alternatively, looking at other evidence. Testimony 3 says Maggey brought the javaccino. But Evidence 16 is Potassium Cyanide found in her apron, which has her fingerprints. Also, the Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has her fingerprints, which would make sense if she served it. But the contradiction might be elsewhere.

Wait, let's check Testimony 4 again: "The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip." The free hand would be his left, since the right was holding the newspaper. The Coffee Cup's handle is on the right. So if the handle is on the right, a left-handed person would have to reach across to grab it. That might be possible, but maybe the handle's position suggests the cup was meant to be held with the right hand, but he used the left. Not sure if that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at other testimonies and evidence. Let's check Evidence 3: Sports Paper from Dec 3rd. It has a doodle by the victim saying 'MC Bomber' with 100,000 crossed out, and 'Ahahahaha' with a laughing face. Also, Evidence 23 is MC Bomber, a computer virus made by Glen Elg. The Sports Paper's doodle might relate to the virus. Also, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) says he was to meet with The Tiger (Furio Tigre) on Dec 3rd. Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) has Furio's fingerprints. So maybe there's a connection between the victim and Tigre.

But how does that relate to the testimonies? Let me see. The testimonies are from Kudo about what he saw during the incident. Let's check if any testimony contradicts the evidence about the timing or actions.

Evidence 10 (Autopsy Report) says time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. Evidence 19 (Millionaire Radio Flyer) says the radio program is at 1:30 PM. Testimony 2 says the victim was listening to the wireless (radio) at the time. If the program starts at 1:30 and the victim died around then, maybe there's a timing issue. But the radio show is every Monday. The incident was on Dec 3rd. What day was Dec 3rd in that year? If Dec 3rd was a Monday, then the timing aligns. If not, maybe that's a contradiction. But the problem is we don't know the actual day of the week for Dec 3rd. The evidence doesn't specify. So maybe that's not the angle.

Another angle: Testimony 3 says Maggey brought the javaccino. But Evidence 15 (Apron) has big stains. If she served the coffee, maybe the stains are from that. But Evidence 16 has the poison in her apron. But that's consistent.

Wait, looking at Evidence 6 (Small Bottle): it's the victim's ear medicine, found in the kitchen with Furio's fingerprints. So Furio handled the victim's ear medicine. Evidence 20 says the victim had a meeting with The Tiger (Furio) on that day. So Furio might have been present. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says Maggey brought the javaccino, but Evidence 13 (Coffee Cup) has the poison. The javaccino would be the coffee, right? So if the Coffee Cup had the poison, then Maggey served it. But the problem is, maybe the Coffee Cup's position or details contradict where the poison was administered.

Wait, the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows the victim's table with a coffee cup knocked over, and the tablecloth stained. The Coffee Cup has the victim and Maggey's fingerprints. So Maggey served it, victim drank it, which had cyanide. But the Potassium Cyanide (Evidence 16) was found in Maggey's apron. So she had the poison, which is in her apron, but the cup's fingerprints are hers and the victim's, implying she served it. That seems to fit. But maybe there's a contradiction in the handle's position.

Wait, the Coffee Cup's handle is on the right (floral handle to the right). If the victim used his left hand to pick it up (since his right hand was holding the newspaper), then the handle being on the right would mean he'd have to twist his hand awkwardly. But maybe that's possible. However, the lip stain is on the front of the cup. If he drank with his left hand, the lip stain would be on the left side, but the description says it's on the front. Hmm. Wait, the description says "facing the cup, one can see a lip stain on the front". So regardless of which hand he used, the lip stain is on the front. So maybe that's not an issue.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3: Maggey brought the javaccino. But if the poison was in the coffee, and the cup has her fingerprints, that's consistent. But maybe there's a contradiction in the timing or the presence of someone else.

Wait, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) says he was supposed to meet The Tiger (Furio) on Dec 3rd. Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) has Furio's fingerprints. So maybe Furio was at the scene. But Kudo's testimonies don't mention him. But that's not necessarily a contradiction unless a testimony explicitly states something conflicting.

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 4: The victim picked up the cup with his free hand (left) and took a sip. The Coffee Cup's handle is on the right. If the victim used his left hand, the handle would be on the opposite side, making it awkward. So maybe the handle's position contradicts the testimony about how he picked it up. For example, if the handle is on the right, a right-handed person would naturally use their right hand. But since his right hand was holding the newspaper, he used his left. However, the handle's position being on the right would make it difficult to pick up with the left hand. Therefore, if the handle is on the right, the cup would be designed for right-handed use. If the victim used his left hand, the lip stain might be on the opposite side. But according to Evidence 13, the lip stain is on the front. Maybe that's a contradiction. If the victim used his left hand to drink from a right-handled cup, the lip stain would be on the left side when facing the cup. But the evidence says the lip stain is on the front. Therefore, the testimony and evidence might contradict each other regarding how the cup was handled.

Alternatively, maybe the key contradiction is elsewhere. Let's check Evidence 3: Sports Paper with the doodle. The testimony mentions the victim was holding a newspaper (Testimony 1). The Sports Paper is the one with the doodle, and it's left by the victim. The testimony says he had a newspaper in his right hand. But Evidence 3 is a Sports Paper from Dec 3rd, which is the same day as the incident. The doodle on it is in the victim's handwriting. So that aligns. No contradiction here.

Another angle: Testimony 2 says the victim was listening to the wireless (radio). Evidence 19 is the Millionaire Radio Flyer, which is a radio program at 1:30 PM. If the time of death is between 1:30 and 2:30, then the victim could have been listening at 1:30. But maybe the program's content is relevant. However, without more info, this might not be a contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 17 is the Victim's Prescription Bag, which is empty. The Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is the victim's ear medicine. If the prescription was for the ear medicine, then the bag would have contained the small bottle. But the bag is empty, and the bottle is found in the kitchen. That's consistent. Not a contradiction with testimonies.

Hmm. Let me think again. The key contradiction might be between Testimony 4 and the Coffee Cup's handle position. Testimony 4 says he picked it up with his free (left) hand, but the handle is on the right, which would be awkward. If the cup's handle is on the right, the natural way to hold it is with the right hand. But since his right hand was occupied with the newspaper, he used his left. However, the lip stain being on the front might not align. If he used his left hand, turning the cup to drink from the front, maybe the handle's position would make the lip stain on the opposite side. So perhaps the position of the handle and the lip stain contradict the testimony about which hand was used.

Alternatively, the Coffee Cup's description says "facing the cup, one can see a lip stain on the front, and a floral looking handle to the right." If the victim used his left hand, the handle would be on his right, so he would have to reach across the cup to grab it with his left hand, causing the lip stain to be on the left side when facing the cup. But the evidence says the lip stain is on the front. Therefore, if the handle is on the right and the lip stain is on the front, that suggests the cup was held with the right hand. But Testimony 4 says he used his left hand. That's a contradiction.

So the contradiction would be between Testimony 4 (using left hand) and the Coffee Cup's handle position (right side), which implies right-hand use, leading to the lip stain's position. Therefore, the evidence (13) and testimony (4) contradict each other.

{"evidence": 13, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to identify one pair where the evidence contradicts a testimony.

Looking at the testimonies first. The testimonies are from Kudo (Victor Kudo). Let's go through each one:

Testimony 0: He starts by saying he's not sure, so maybe not the strongest contradiction here.

Testimony 1: He says the victim slumped over after sipping javaccino. The autopsy report (Evidence 10) says cause of death was potassium cyanide, which is in the coffee cup (Evidence 13). So maybe this is consistent, not a contradiction.

Testimony 2: He mentions the vase being knocked over. Testimony 3 says the cloth got soaked. Then Testimony 4 is a question, maybe rhetorical. 

Looking at Evidence 18: Victor's Testimony says "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." Wait, but in the testimonies provided here, Testimony 2 and 3 are from Kudo, talking about someone else (the clumsy idiot) breaking the vase. But Evidence 18 is Victor's own testimony where he admits to breaking the vase. So there's a contradiction here. Because in Testimony 2, Kudo says "the clumsy idiot upset the vase", implying someone else did it. But Evidence 18 (his own testimony) says he broke it. That's a contradiction. 

Wait, but wait. Let me check the details again. The Testimonies provided here are Testimony 0-4, all from Kudo. So Testimony 2 says "Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over." But according to Evidence 18, Victor's Testimony, he himself broke the vase. So the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (blaming someone else) and Evidence 18 (he admits to breaking it). But Evidence 18 is listed as a separate testimony. Wait, no. Wait, in the given data, the Testimonies section includes Testimony 18 as Victor's Testimony. Wait no, looking back:

Testimonies provided are Testimony 0 to Testimony 4 (all by Kudo). Then Evidence 18 is "Victor's Testimony: When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." So Evidence 18 is an evidence item, which is Victor's own testimony. But in the Testimonies section (Testimonies 0-4), Testimony 2 and 3 from Kudo say that someone else (the clumsy idiot) broke the vase. So there's a contradiction between Kudo's testimony (Testimony 2) where he blames another person, and Evidence 18 (Victor's own testimony) where he admits to breaking it himself. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 18 and Testimony 2. But wait, the question asks for which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The testimonies in the list (0-4) are separate from the evidence list. So Evidence 18 is a piece of evidence that is Victor's own testimony. So when Victor gives a testimony in the Testimonies section (Testimony 2) saying that someone else broke the vase, but in his own testimony (Evidence 18) he says he did it, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 18 contradicts Testimony 2. 

But wait, the Testimonies provided in the Testimonies section (0-4) are all from Kudo. So Testimony 2 is Kudo saying that "the clumsy idiot" broke the vase, but Evidence 18 is Kudo's own testimony where he says he broke it. So he's contradicting himself. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (where he blames someone else) and Evidence 18 (his own admission). So the evidence number is 18, and the testimony number is 2. 

Looking at the evidence list: Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony. So the answer would be {"evidence": 18, "testimony": 2}. But wait, need to check the numbering of the evidence. Let's check the evidences list again. The evidences are numbered 0 to 27. Evidence 18 is "Victor's Testimony: "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." So the evidence number is 18. The testimony in question is Testimony 2, which is from Kudo (Victor) saying "Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over." So Testimony 2 (index 2) contradicts Evidence 18. Therefore, the pair is evidence 18 and testimony 2. But wait, the user wants the evidence number and testimony number as per their indices. The evidence numbers go from 0 to 27. So Evidence 18 is index 18. Testimony 2 is index 2. So the correct JSON should be {"evidence": 18, "testimony": 2}.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 2}

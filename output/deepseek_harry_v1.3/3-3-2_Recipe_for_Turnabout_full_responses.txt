Okay, let's try to figure this out. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So, I need to go through each testimony and check if any of the evidence directly contradicts it.

Looking at the testimonies first. Testimony 5 from Gumshoe says, "And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene." So according to him, nothing was missing. Now, looking at the evidences, maybe something was missing but wasn't reported?

Evidence 17 is the Victim's Prescription Bag, which is empty. The victim got this from the doctor before going to the restaurant, but the bag is empty. If the prescription was supposed to have medicine (maybe the ear medicine mentioned in Evidence 6?), then the empty bag implies that the medicine was missing. But according to Testimony 5, nothing was missing. So that's a contradiction. The bag being empty suggests something was taken, but Gumshoe's testimony says nothing was missing. Therefore, Evidence 17 contradicts Testimony 5.

{"evidence": 17, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts which testimony here. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to find one pair where the evidence and testimony don't match up.

First, let's look at the testimonies. Testimony 1 and 2 from Kudo (Victor Kudo) say that Maggey put white powder in the victim's coffee. He claims he saw her do it. The evidence related to the poison is Evidence 16, which is the potassium cyanide found in Maggey's apron with her fingerprints. But wait, there's also Evidence 13, the coffee cup. The cup has Maggey's fingerprints, which makes sense if she served it. But the poison in her apron might support Kudo's claim.

Wait, but there's Evidence 6, the small bottle. It says the victim's ear medicine was found in the kitchen with unidentified fingerprints. If the victim had his own medicine, maybe that's related. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Looking at the testimonies again. Testimony 5 says the apron's straps were loose. Evidence 15 is the apron with small pockets and big stains. If the straps were loose, maybe something could have been put into the apron without her knowing? But I'm not sure how that's a contradiction.

Wait, another angle. Testimony 2 states that Kudo saw Maggey put white powder into the coffee. But Evidence 13 says the coffee cup has a lip stain on the front and a handle to the right when facing it. If the victim drank from the cup, the lip stain would be where he drank. But if the poison was in the coffee, maybe the method of poisoning wasn't via the coffee? Or maybe the position of the cup indicates something else.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony) which is Evidence 18. Wait, the Testimonies list Testimony 0-6 are from Kudo. Testimony 18 is a separate evidence. Wait no, the Testimonies section lists Testimonies 0-6, each with a person. So Testimony 0-6 are all from Kudo. So Testimony 2 says Kudo saw Maggey put white powder in the coffee. But Evidence 13's description says the coffee cup has the victim's and Maggey's fingerprints, which matches. But Evidence 16 is the cyanide in her apron. So if Kudo saw her put the powder in, but the cyanide was found in her apron, which has her fingerprints, that would support his testimony. But maybe there's a contradiction elsewhere.

Wait, Evidence 14 is the victim's lottery ticket found on Maggey. That's suspicious, but how does it contradict a testimony?

Alternatively, let's look at Evidence 3: the sports paper from Dec 3rd, with a doodle 'MC Bomber' pointing to 100k crossed out. Evidence 23 is the MC Bomber disc with a virus. The magazine clipping (Evidence 2) is about the user (Phoenix?) being trounced in court. Maybe that's related to a different case.

Wait, Testimony 0: Kudo says the young man (victim) was reading the sports paper. But Evidence 3 is the sports paper left by a customer on Dec 3rd. So the victim was reading it, according to Kudo. However, Evidence 3's description mentions a doodle with 'MC Bomber' and '100,000' crossed out. But maybe the victim had a meeting with 'The Tiger' (from Evidence 20: Glen's calendar). If the victim was meeting someone else, maybe the sports paper wasn't his. Wait, but the testimony says the young man (victim) was reading it. If the sports paper was left by a customer, maybe it wasn't the victim's. But if the victim was reading it, then it's possible. Hmm, not sure.

Another angle: Testimony 4 says Kudo identifies Maggey as the serving girl. Testimony 5 mentions her apron's straps were loose. Evidence 15 (apron) has big stains. Maybe the contradiction is that if the straps were loose, the apron might not stay on properly, making it hard to carry the poison without spilling? Not sure.

Wait, let's look at Testimony 6 from Kudo: "There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front." But Testimony 5 mentions a ribbon in her hair and loose apron straps. If he noticed those details, then Testimony 6 is a contradiction because he did notice things about her. Wait, that could be. Testimony 6 says there was nothing interesting when he saw her from the front, but Testimony 5 describes specific details (ribbon, loose straps), which are things that would have been noticeable from the front. So Testimony 6 contradicts Testimony 5? But the question is about evidence contradicting testimony.

Wait, perhaps the testimony about the powder being put in the coffee is contradicted by another piece of evidence. Let's check Evidence 17: the victim's prescription bag was empty. The victim had ear medicine (Evidence 6), but the prescription bag was empty. If the victim needed medicine, maybe he took it, but how does that relate to the testimony?

Alternatively, Evidence 10: the autopsy says death by potassium cyanide between 1:30-2:30 PM. The Millionaire Radio Flyer (Evidence 19) is every Monday at 1:30 PM. Maybe timing is an issue, but not directly contradicting a testimony.

Wait, back to Testimony 2: Kudo claims he saw Maggey put white powder in the coffee. Evidence 13 says the coffee cup has a lip stain on the front and the handle to the right. If the victim was right-handed, he would hold the handle with his right hand, so the lip stain would be on the opposite side. Wait, maybe the position of the lip stain indicates the victim was left-handed? If the handle is on the right, a right-handed person would turn the cup so the handle is on their right, and drink from the side. The lip stain being on the front (relative to the handle's position) might suggest something. Not sure. Alternatively, if the poison was in the coffee, but the victim's autopsy shows potassium cyanide, which is a fast-acting poison. So if he took a sip and collapsed, that's consistent. But how does this contradict?

Alternatively, Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) has a doodle 'MC Bomber' with 100k crossed out and 'Ahahahaha'. The victim was a programmer (Character 6), and Evidence 23 is the MC Bomber disc with a virus. Maybe the victim was involved with that, but how does that relate to the testimony?

Wait, another angle. Testimony 1 and 2 state that Maggey put something in the coffee. But Evidence 6 is the victim's ear medicine found in the kitchen with unidentified fingerprints. If the victim's medicine was in the kitchen, maybe someone else handled it. But the cyanide was in Maggey's apron. So if the poison was in the coffee, but the victim's own medicine was in the kitchen, perhaps the real poison was substituted for the medicine. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Alternatively, the small bottle (Evidence 6) is the victim's ear medicine, but it's found in the kitchen with unidentified fingerprints. If Maggey didn't touch it, then her fingerprints wouldn't be on it. But Kudo says she put powder in the coffee, which would be the cyanide from her apron. But if the cyanide was in her apron, and the coffee had it, then her fingerprints on the cup make sense. However, the small bottle's fingerprints are unidentified. Maybe the real culprit used the victim's medicine bottle to plant evidence, but that's not directly contradicting Kudo's testimony.

Wait, here's a possible contradiction. Testimony 2 says Kudo saw Maggey put white powder in the coffee. But Evidence 13 says the coffee cup has a lip stain on the front and a handle to the right. If the cup was positioned in a way that the handle is to the right when facing it, then the lip stain would be on the front. If the victim was sitting across from someone, but according to the Crime Photo (Evidence 12), there's no one across from the victim. The coffee cup was knocked over, maybe. But how does this contradict?

Alternatively, the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) was left by a customer on Dec 3rd. The victim was at Trés Bien on Dec 3rd (the day of the incident). Testimony 0 says the victim was reading the sports paper. But if the sports paper was left by another customer, then the victim might have been reading his own paper, or the one left behind. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the key is in the description of the coffee cup. The coffee cup has a lip stain on the front and the handle to the right. If the person drinking it is right-handed, they would hold the handle with their right hand, so the lip stain would be on the opposite side. Wait, maybe the lip stain's position suggests that the drinker was left-handed. If the victim was right-handed, then the lip stain being on the front (from the cup's perspective) might mean he turned the cup to drink from the front, which could be inconsistent. But unless there's evidence about the victim's handedness, this might not be relevant.

Alternatively, Testimony 2 claims Maggey put white powder in the coffee. However, Evidence 16 states that the potassium cyanide was found in her apron pocket with her fingerprints. If she had put the powder in the coffee, why would there still be cyanide in her apron? Unless she only used part of it. But that's not necessarily a contradiction. However, if the cyanide in her apron is the same as what was used, then her fingerprints on it make sense. But maybe there's another angle.

Wait, looking back at the testimonies: Testimony 18 (which is Evidence 18) is Victor's testimony saying he broke the vase at his seat. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows two vases, each on the tables. If Victor broke his vase, but in the photo, both vases are intact, that would be a contradiction. Wait, but Evidence 12's description says "two dining tables are separated by a folding screen. The one closer to the camera is empty. The other one is where the victim collapsed. There is an intact vase on each table." So the photo shows both vases intact. But Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony) says he broke the vase at his seat. That directly contradicts the photo evidence. So Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) shows intact vases, but Testimony 18 says he broke his. That's a clear contradiction. But wait, Testimony 18 is listed as Evidence 18, but in the Testimonies section, the testimonies are 0-6 from Kudo. Wait, the user listed Testimonies 0-6 under the Testimonies section, each with a person. Then Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony, which is a separate evidence. So the testimonies in the Testimonies section are different from the Evidences that are testimonies. Wait, the user might have made a mistake here, but according to the data provided:

Testimonies:
Testimony 0-6 are from Kudo.

Evidences include:
Evidence 18: Victor's Testimony: "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry."

So Evidence 18 is Victor Kudo's testimony about breaking the vase. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows both vases intact. Therefore, Evidence 12 contradicts Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony). But the question asks for a testimony (from the Testimonies list) and an evidence. So if Evidence 18 is considered a testimony (as it's labeled as Victor's Testimony), but it's part of the Evidences list. The Testimonies section includes Testimonies 0-6, which are testimonies given during the trial, perhaps.

Wait, the user's instruction says "Which evidence and testimony contradict each other?" where testimonies are the ones listed under Testimonies (0-6 from Kudo) and evidences are the ones in the Evidences list. So we need to find a testimony from Testimonies 0-6 (all from Kudo) that contradicts one of the Evidences 0-27.

So the contradiction would be between one of Kudo's testimonies (0-6) and an evidence.

Looking again at Testimony 2: Kudo says Maggey put white powder in the coffee. But Evidence 6 (small bottle) is the victim's ear medicine, which was found in the kitchen with unidentified fingerprints. If the poison was the cyanide from Maggey's apron, then the white powder Kudo saw could be the cyanide. But the small bottle being the victim's medicine, perhaps the real poison was substituted, but that's not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 5: Kudo says Maggey had a ribbon in her hair and loose apron straps. Evidence 15 (apron) has big stains but small pockets. If the straps were loose, maybe the apron was more likely to get stained, but that's not a contradiction. Unless the apron in evidence doesn't have a ribbon, but the testimony mentions a ribbon. However, the apron's description doesn't mention a ribbon, but Maggey's character (Character 4) doesn't mention a ribbon either. The testimony says there was a ribbon in her hair, which is separate from the apron. So that's not a contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 4: Kudo identifies Maggey as the defendant, saying "I remember her well!" But Evidence 14 (lottery ticket) was found on Maggey, which is a winning ticket. If Maggey had no motive (as she didn't know the victim), but the ticket is worth half a million, maybe she had a motive. But how does that contradict the testimony? The testimony is about identifying her, not about motive.

Hmm. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the timing. The Millionaire Radio Flyer (Evidence 19) is every Monday at 1:30 PM. The time of death was between 1:30 and 2:30 PM (Evidence 10). If the victim was at Trés Bien during that time, maybe he was there for the radio show. But how does that contradict testimony?

Wait, Evidence 3: Sports Paper has a doodle 'MC Bomber' with 100k crossed out. The victim's calendar (Evidence 20) says he was meeting "The Tiger" (Furio Tigre). The MC Bomber disc (Evidence 23) is a virus from Tender Lender, which is run by Tigre. So maybe the victim was involved with Tigre, and the doodle relates to the virus. But how does this contradict testimony?

Alternatively, the Repair Bill (Evidence 25) shows Tigre paid the Cadaverinis $15k. Viola's Medical Papers (Evidence 27) show a $1M bill. Maybe financial motives, but not directly related.

Wait, going back to the original question: find one pair where evidence and testimony contradict. The most likely is between Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony about breaking the vase) and the Crime Photo (Evidence 12 showing intact vases). But Testimony 18 is in the Evidences list as Evidence 18, not in the Testimonies section. The Testimonies section only includes Testimonies 0-6 from Kudo. So perhaps the answer is among those.

Wait, Testimony 0: Kudo says the victim was reading the sports paper. Evidence 3 is the sports paper left by a customer. If the victim was reading it, but the paper was left by someone else, maybe the victim wasn't the one who brought it. But that's not a contradiction unless there's evidence the victim didn't have access to it.

Alternatively, Testimony 3: Kudo says the victim took one sip, looked in pain, and collapsed. Potassium cyanide is fast-acting, so that's consistent. Not a contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 1: Maggey brought a javaccino and put something in it. Evidence 13 says the coffee cup had potassium cyanide. So that's consistent. But the cyanide was in her apron (Evidence 16). If she put it in the coffee, her fingerprints would be on the cup, which they are. So no contradiction here.

Hmm. Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 6. Testimony 2 says Maggey put white powder in the coffee. Evidence 6 is the victim's ear medicine found in the kitchen with unidentified fingerprints. If the ear medicine was in a small bottle different from others, and the cyanide was in Maggey's apron, perhaps the white powder Kudo saw was actually the ear medicine, not poison. But that would mean the cyanide was planted. However, this is speculative. Alternatively, if the ear medicine was supposed to be with the victim, but was found in the kitchen, maybe someone else handled it. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Alternatively, Evidence 14: the winning lottery ticket was found on Maggey. If she had no prior connection to the victim, why would she have his ticket? That suggests she stole it, which could be a motive. But Testimony 4 says Kudo identifies her as the culprit. That's not a contradiction, but rather supporting evidence.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 6 says "There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front." But Testimony 5 mentions specific details about her appearance (ribbon, loose apron straps). If there was nothing interesting, why does he remember those details? That's a contradiction within his own testimonies. But the question is about evidence contradicting testimony, not testimony vs testimony.

Back to the initial thought about the vase. If Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) says he broke the vase, but the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows both vases intact, that's a contradiction. But Evidence 18 is part of the Evidences list, not the Testimonies section. The Testimonies section includes Testimonies 0-6 from Kudo. So this might not be the answer the user is looking for.

Wait, but the user might have made a mistake in listing Evidence 18 as Victor's Testimony, but the Testimonies section includes only Kudo's testimonies. Therefore, the correct contradiction would be between a testimony from Kudo (0-6) and an evidence.

Let me re-examine Kudo's testimonies:

Testimony 2: "She very conspicuously put some white powder in there."

Evidence 16: Potassium Cyanide with Maggey's prints in her apron. If she put the powder in the coffee, why is there still poison in her apron? Unless she used only part of it. But that's possible. Not a contradiction.

Testimony 5: "her apron's straps were loose." Evidence 15: apron with small pockets and big stains. Loose straps could explain why the apron got stained, but not a contradiction.

Testimony 0: victim was reading the sports paper. Evidence 3: sports paper left by a customer. If the victim was reading it, that's consistent unless Evidence 3 says it was left by someone else. The victim could have picked it up. Not a contradiction.

Ah! Wait, the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows that there's an intact vase on each table. Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony in Evidences) says he broke the vase at his seat. But the photo shows both vases intact. However, Testimony 18 is part of the Evidences, not the Testimonies section. So if the user intended for us to consider Evidence 18 as a testimony, then pairing Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) with Testimony 18 would be the contradiction. But according to the data provided, Testimonies are 0-6 (all from Kudo), and Evidences 0-27 include some testimonies like Evidence 18. However, the user's question says "testimonies" refer to the ones listed under Testimonies, which are 0-6 from Kudo. Therefore, the contradiction must be between one of Kudo's testimonies (0-6) and an evidence.

Wait, looking again at Testimony 3: "The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed." Potassium cyanide acts quickly, so this matches. No contradiction.

Testimony 4: "That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!" If Maggey is the defendant, that's consistent.

Wait, Evidence 14: the lottery ticket was found on Maggey. If she had no prior connection to the victim, how did she get it? Maybe she stole it, which would be a motive. But Kudo's testimony says she put poison in the coffee. That's not a contradiction, but supports the idea of her guilt.

Wait, here's an idea: Testimony 0 says the victim was reading the sports paper (Evidence 3). The sports paper has a doodle about 'MC Bomber' and 100k crossed out. The victim's calendar (Evidence 20) says he was meeting "The Tiger" (Furio Tigre). The MC Bomber disc (Evidence 23) is a virus from Tender Lender, run by Tigre. If the victim was meeting Tigre, maybe the sports paper's doodle relates to their meeting. But how does this contradict the testimony? Kudo says the victim was reading the paper, which is true. No contradiction.

Another angle: Testimony 2 says Maggey put white powder in the coffee. Evidence 6 is the victim's ear medicine with unidentified fingerprints. If the ear medicine was a powder, perhaps the white powder was the medicine, not poison. But the autopsy says death was by cyanide, so the powder in the coffee must have been cyanide. Therefore, if the ear medicine was a different substance, this could mean that Kudo's testimony is incorrect about what he saw. But this requires making an assumption that the ear medicine is a white powder, which isn't stated. The evidence says it's ear medicine, but not its form. So unless we can confirm that, this is speculative.

Alternatively, Evidence 13: the coffee cup has a lip stain on the front and the handle to the right. If the victim was right-handed, he would hold the handle with his right hand, bringing the lip stain to the left side. But the lip stain is on the front. This might suggest that the cup was turned, which could mean the victim didn't drink from it normally. But unless there's evidence about handedness, this is a stretch.

Wait, the repair bill (Evidence 25) shows Tigre paid the Cadaverinis $15k. If Tigre owed money, maybe he had a motive. But how does this relate to the testimony?

I think the most solid contradiction is between Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) and the Crime Photo (Evidence 12). But since the user's Testimonies list only includes Kudo's testimonies (0-6), and Evidence 18 is part of the Evidences, perhaps the intended answer is different.

Wait, looking back, Testimony 0: "The young man was reading the sports paper." The sports paper (Evidence 3) was left by a customer. If the victim was reading it, that's possible. But if the sports paper has a doodle related to 'MC Bomber' and the victim's meeting with Tigre, maybe the victim was the one who left the sports paper. But that's not a contradiction.

Alternatively, the Lunch Special (Evidence 5) costs $20 but tastes bad. Not relevant.

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 2 (Kudo saw Maggey put white powder in the coffee) and Evidence 13 (the coffee cup's handle and lip stain position). If the coffee cup was positioned in a way that the handle is on the right, and the lip stain is on the front, maybe the victim was left-handed. If the victim was left-handed, he would hold the handle with his left hand, causing the lip stain to be on the right side. But the description says the lip stain is on the front. This is getting too speculative.

Another approach: The testimony says Maggey put powder in the coffee, but the poison was found in her apron. If she had the poison in her apron, that supports the testimony. However, the small bottle (Evidence 6) with the victim's ear medicine has unidentified fingerprints, suggesting someone else handled it. Maybe the real killer used the victim's medicine bottle to frame Maggey. But this doesn't directly contradict the testimony.

Alternatively, the Lottery Ticket (Evidence 14) found on Maggey is a winning ticket for $500k. The victim's calendar (Evidence 20) shows a meeting with Tigre, who runs a loan company. If the victim owed money to Tigre, the lottery ticket could be a motive. But how does this contradict testimony?

I'm struggling here. Maybe the answer is Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony). But since Testimony 18 is part of the Evidences, not the Testimonies list, perhaps the user intended Testimony 18 to be considered as a testimony. Alternatively, the user made a mistake in listing the testimonies.

Wait, looking at the Testimonies list:

Testimonies 0-6 are from Kudo (Victor Kudo). Then in the Evidences, there's Evidence 18: Victor's Testimony about breaking the vase. So if the user is considering all testimonies (both in Testimonies and Evidences sections), then Evidence 18's testimony contradicts Evidence 12 (the photo). But according to the problem statement, the Testimonies are the ones listed under Testimonies (0-6 from Kudo), and Evidences are separate. Therefore, the answer must be a testimony from 0-6 and an evidence from 0-27.

The only possible contradiction I can find is between Testimony 0 (Kudo says the victim was reading the sports paper) and Evidence 3 (the sports paper left by a customer). If the victim was reading the sports paper left by someone else, that's possible. But unless the sports paper's content contradicts something else.

Alternatively, the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) has a doodle with 'MC Bomber' pointing to 100k crossed out, which could relate to the victim's debt or the virus program. If the victim was meeting Tigre (Evidence 20) about the loan, maybe the '100k' refers to the debt. The crossed-out 100k and 'Ahahahaha' might suggest the debt was canceled, but the victim's lottery ticket is worth 500k (Evidence 14). Not sure.

I think the most plausible answer is that Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) about breaking the vase contradicts the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) showing intact vases. But since Evidence 18 is part of the Evidences list and not the Testimonies list, maybe the user expects us to pair Evidence 12 with Testimony 18. However, according to the user's instructions, the Testimonies are the ones listed under Testimonies (0-6 from Kudo). Therefore, this would be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check the testimonies again.

Testimony 0: Kudo says the victim was reading the sports paper.

Evidence 3: Sports paper left by a customer. If the victim was reading it, that's possible.

But the Sports Paper's description says "Left by a customer in Trés Bien on Dec. 3rd." So the victim could have picked it up. No contradiction.

Testimony 1: Maggey brought a javaccino and put something in it.

Evidence 13: Coffee cup has her fingerprints. Consistent.

Testimony 2: She conspicuously put white powder in.

Evidence 16: Cyanide in her apron. Supports the testimony.

Testimony 3: Victim took a sip and collapsed.

Evidence 10: Died of cyanide, which is fast-acting. Consistent.

Testimony 4: Identifies Maggey.

Testimony 5: Ribbon and loose straps.

Testimony 6: Nothing interesting from the front.

If Testimony 6 says there was nothing interesting about her from the front, but Testimony 5 mentions specific details, that's a contradiction in his own testimony. But the question is about evidence contradicting testimony.

Wait, Evidence 15: Apron with big stains. If Maggey's apron had big stains, but Testimony 5 says the straps were loose, which could lead to stains, that's consistent. No contradiction.

I'm really stuck. Maybe the answer is Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony in Evidences), but since the user might have intended that, even if it's not in the Testimonies list. Alternatively, perhaps there's another pair.

Wait, Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony: "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." The Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows both vases intact. So Evidence 12 contradicts Evidence 18. But the user's instruction says to pair an evidence with a testimony. If the testimony is considered to be in the Testimonies list (0-6), then this wouldn't apply. But if the user considers Evidence 18 as a testimony (since it's labeled as such), then the pair would be Evidence 12 and Testimony 18. But according to the data provided, Testimonies are a separate section, so I think the intended answer is this pair.

But the Testimonies section only includes Testimonies 0-6 from Kudo. Evidence 18 is part of the Evidences list. Therefore, the user might have made a mistake, but according to the problem structure, we have to choose a testimony from the Testimonies list and an evidence from the Evidences list.

Given that, I think the correct answer is {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 18} but testimony 18 is not in the Testimonies list. Therefore, this is invalid.

Wait, no. The Testimonies section lists Testimonies 0-6, each with a Person. Testimony 18 is not part of that. Therefore, the correct pair must be within Testimonies 0-6 and Evidences 0-27.

After thorough consideration, the only possible contradiction is between Testimony 18 (which is part of Evidences) and Evidence 12, but since Testimony 18 is not in the Testimonies list, I must find another pair.

Wait, perhaps Testimony 2 (Kudo saw Maggey put powder in coffee) and Evidence 6 (small bottle with victim's ear medicine). If the powder was the ear medicine, then the cyanide in the coffee would be a different substance, contradicting the testimony. But this requires assuming the ear medicine is a powder, which is not stated.

Alternatively, the victim's prescription bag (Evidence 17) is empty. If the victim was supposed to take his ear medicine, but the small bottle (Evidence 6) is in the kitchen with someone else's fingerprints, perhaps the victim didn't take his medicine. But how does this contradict Kudo's testimony?

I think I'm missing something obvious. Let's go back to the Crime Photo (Evidence 12). The photo shows two tables separated by a folding screen. The victim's table has a coffee cup knocked over, stained cloth, and papers. No one is sitting across. The other table is empty with a vase. Testimony 0 says the victim was reading the sports paper. Evidence 3 is the sports paper left by a customer. If the victim was reading it, that's possible. The Crime Photo mentions papers near the coffee cup, which could be the sports paper. No contradiction.

Another thought: The lip stain on the coffee cup (Evidence 13) is on the front. If the victim was sitting alone, he would drink from the side closest to him. If the handle is on the right, and the lip stain is front, maybe he turned the cup, which could suggest he was left-handed. But there's no evidence about his handedness. Not a contradiction.

Wait, the Lunch Special (Evidence 5) costs $20 and tastes bad. The prescription bag (Evidence 17) is empty. If the victim took his medicine before coming, but the small bottle (Evidence 6) is in the kitchen, maybe someone tampered with it. But how does this relate to Kudo's testimony?

I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think the intended answer is Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony), even though Testimony 18 is part of the Evidences. The user might have intended that. So the JSON would be {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 18}.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 18}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to go through each testimony and check the evidence to find inconsistencies.

First, looking at the testimonies provided by Kudo. Testimony 3 says that the serving girl (Maggey) brought over the javaccino. But looking at the evidence related to the coffee cup, Evidence 13 mentions that the coffee cup had potassium cyanide and had fingerprints from both Maggey and the victim. The description of the cup says that the handle is on the right side with a floral design, and there's a lip stain on the front. 

Wait, but if the cup was served by Maggey, then her fingerprints would be on the handle. However, the handle is on the right, which is the side where a right-handed person would hold it. But the lip stain is on the front. If the victim picked it up with his free hand (as per Testimony 4, which mentions the victim used his free hand to pick up the cup), which hand was that? The victim might have used his left hand if his right hand was holding the newspaper (Testimony 1 says the victim had a newspaper in his right hand). So when he picked up the cup with his left hand, the handle would be on the right side. That would make sense. But then the lip stain's position might be affected. Alternatively, the handle's position might not align with how the cup was held. Hmm, maybe that's not the contradiction.

Looking at another angle: Testimony 3 says the serving girl brought the javaccino. But Evidence 13's coffee cup has fingerprints from both Maggey and the victim. If Maggey served the cup, her fingerprints would be on it. But maybe the way the cup was handled contradicts something. Wait, Testimony 4 says the victim picked up the cup with his free hand (left hand, since right was holding the newspaper). The cup's handle is on the right side. If he's using his left hand to pick it up, the handle's position would be awkward. Maybe the handle should be on the left if he's using his left hand. But the handle is described as being on the right. That would mean the victim had to reach across the cup to grab the handle with his left hand, which might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the orientation of the cup when served. If Maggey placed the cup with the handle to the right, the victim would normally use his right hand. But Testimony 1 says the victim's right hand was holding the newspaper, so he used his left hand. This could mean that the handle's position contradicts the way the victim held the cup, leading to a contradiction between Testimony 4 (using free left hand) and Evidence 13 (handle on the right). But is this a solid contradiction?

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 2: Kudo says the victim was listening to the wireless. But maybe there's evidence that contradicts that. Let me check the evidence. Evidence 3 is a sports paper from Dec 3rd with a doodle about 'MC Bomber' and a laughing face. The victim's calendar (Evidence 20) mentions a meeting with "The Tiger" (Furio Tigre). Evidence 23 is MC Bomber, a virus program. The victim was a programmer. Maybe the wireless listening contradicts something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says the serving girl brought the javaccino. But Evidence 13's coffee cup is described as a coffee cup, not a javaccino. Wait, maybe the drink was supposed to be coffee, but Kudo refers to it as javaccino. But that might not be a contradiction. Alternatively, the cup's description mentions a lip stain on the front. If the victim was drinking from it, the lip stain should be on the side where he sipped. If he used his left hand, the stain would be on the left side. But the evidence says the lip stain is on the front. That might indicate he was holding the cup with his right hand, which contradicts Testimony 4 where he uses his free (left) hand. Therefore, the lip stain's position contradicts the testimony about which hand he used. So Evidence 13 (lip stain front, handle right) and Testimony 4 (picked up with free left hand) would imply that the victim's hand usage doesn't align with the cup's orientation. So that would be a contradiction. Thus, Evidence 13 and Testimony 4. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 0: Kudo describes the victim as wearing broken spectacles. But maybe there's evidence that the victim didn't have broken glasses. Not sure.

Wait, the main contradiction I can think of is Testimony 3: the serving girl brought the javaccino. But Evidence 13 says the coffee cup has Maggey's fingerprints. If Maggey served it, her fingerprints would be on the handle. The handle is on the right. So if the victim picked it up with his left hand (since right was holding the newspaper), then the handle's position would be on the right, making it awkward to hold with the left. But maybe that's possible. However, the lip stain on the front might indicate the cup was turned a certain way. Alternatively, perhaps the key contradiction is between the coffee cup's handle position and the way the victim held it. The testimony says he used his free (left) hand, so the handle should be on the left. But the handle is on the right, meaning he would have to reach over, which may not make sense. Thus, Evidence 13 (handle on right) contradicts Testimony 4 (picked up with left hand). Therefore, the evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So the answer would be Evidence 13 and Testimony 4.

{"evidence": 13, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by reviewing all the given information.

The characters are listed, but maybe the key ones here are Maggey Byrde (Character 4), the victim Glen Elg (Character 6), and Victor Kudo (Character 7) who provided some testimonies. The evidence includes things like the coffee cup with cyanide, the autopsy report, and the testimonies from Victor Kudo.

Looking at the testimonies by Victor Kudo (Testimonies 0-4). Testimony 2 says, "Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over." Testimony 3 adds, "It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!" So Victor is talking about a vase being knocked over, causing the tablecloth to get soaked.

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 12 is the Crime Photo, which describes the scene. The photo shows two dining tables separated by a folding screen. On each table, there's an intact vase. Wait, Victor's testimony says the vase was broken, but the crime photo mentions intact vases. That seems contradictory. If Victor claims the vase was broken and the tablecloth soaked, but the photo shows both vases intact, that's a contradiction. So the testimony (probably Testimony 2 or 3) contradicts Evidence 12.

Looking at the Testimony numbers: Testimony 2 is about upsetting the vase and knocking it over. Testimony 3 says it broke and soaked the cloth. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) states both vases are intact. So Testimony 2 and 3 both mention the vase being broken, but the evidence shows they're intact. Therefore, either Testimony 2 or 3 contradicts Evidence 12. Since Testimony 3 is more specific about the broken vase, maybe that's the one. The problem is that the Crime Photo says "intact vase on each table," which directly contradicts the testimony that the vase broke. So the pair would be Evidence 12 and Testimony 3. But the evidence numbers and testimony numbers need to be checked.

Wait, let me check the numbering again. Evidence 12 is the Crime Photo. Testimony 3 is Kudo's statement about the vase breaking and the cloth getting soaked. So that's a direct contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be Evidence 12 and Testimony 3. But wait, looking back at the evidence list: Evidence 12 is the Crime Photo. The description says "there is an intact vase on each table." So if Victor's testimony (Testimony 3) says the vase broke, but the photo shows both intact, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 12 and Testimony 3. But let me check if there's another possible contradiction. For example, the Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has a floral handle and lip stain. Maybe another testimony talks about the cup's position? Not sure. But the vase contradiction seems clear. So the JSON would be {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3}.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3}

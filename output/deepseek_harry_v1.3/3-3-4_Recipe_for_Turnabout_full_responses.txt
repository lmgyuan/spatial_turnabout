Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. I need to cross-reference these to identify a contradiction.

First, I'll look through the testimonies. Testimony 3 from Armstrong says: "After la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way." And Testimony 4 adds: "But naturally, I did not touch anything else!" So Armstrong claims he only moved the mirror and nothing else.

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 1 is Maya's Magatama, which was recovered in the kitchen of Tres Bien. Wait, maybe not directly relevant. Evidence 13 is the Coffee Cup, which has the victim and Maggey's fingerprints. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Wait, the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows two tables separated by a folding screen. The victim's table has a coffee cup knocked over. The testimonies from Armstrong mention moving the mirror (maybe the folding screen?), but he says he didn't touch anything else. However, the Coffee Cup's position might be affected if he moved the mirror/screen. Wait, the Crime Photo was taken from near the kitchen, showing the scene. If Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident, then the Crime Photo might show the original position of the mirror before he moved it. But how does that contradict?

Wait, Testimony 0 says the mirror was in the middle of the restaurant dividing the two halves. Testimony 1 says only one seat could see the victim's image, which was the old man's seat (Victor Kudo?). Testimony 3 says after the incident, he moved the mirror. The Crime Photo's caption mentions that the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. If the mirror was moved after the incident, but the Crime Photo (taken at the scene) shows the mirror in its original position, then Testimony 3 might contradict the Crime Photo. Wait, but the Crime Photo's caption says the view from the entrance is obstructed, which could relate to the mirror's position.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 3: Sports Paper from Dec 3rd with a doodle by the victim. The doodle mentions 'MC Bomber' and '100,000' crossed out. Evidence 23 is MC Bomber, a computer virus made by the victim. The Sports Paper's doodle is in the victim's handwriting. Testimony from Armstrong about moving the mirror might not directly relate here.

Wait, let's focus on Armstrong's Testimony 3 and 4. He claims he moved the mirror but nothing else. However, Evidence 1 (Maya's Magatama) was recovered in the kitchen. The Magatama reacts to secrets, but how does that contradict? Maybe not directly.

Alternatively, Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) is left by the victim in Tres Bien on Dec 3rd. The doodle is in the victim's handwriting. If Armstrong moved the mirror (which was part of the setup), maybe the position of the mirror is important for the crime's visibility. The Tres Bien Floor Plans (Evidence 11) state that the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. If the mirror was moved, that could affect visibility. But the Crime Photo shows the original setup. So if Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident, the Crime Photo would reflect the original position, which aligns with Testimony 3. Hmm, maybe that's not a contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 3 says he moved the mirror after the incident. The Crime Photo was taken at the scene, so it should show the mirror in its original position, which would be before Armstrong moved it. That's consistent. So no contradiction there.

Looking for other contradictions. Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) has Furio Tigre's fingerprints. If Armstrong says he didn't touch anything else, but the bottle was in the kitchen, maybe he's lying about not touching other things. But Evidence 6 is the victim's ear medicine, found in the kitchen with Tigre's prints. So maybe Armstrong's Testimony 4 ("I did not touch anything else") is contradicted if he had handled the bottle. But the fingerprints are Tigre's, so maybe not.

Wait, Evidence 1 (Maya's Magatama) was recovered in the kitchen. If Armstrong moved the mirror but claims he didn't touch anything else, but the Magatama was found in the kitchen, maybe he moved it there. But the Magatama was on loan from Maya and recovered in the kitchen. Not sure if that's a contradiction.

Another angle: Evidence 11 (Tres Bien Floor Plans) states the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. Testimony 0 says the mirror was in the middle dividing the two halves. Testimony 1 says only one seat (Victor's) could see the victim. If the floor plans show the mirror's original position, then after Armstrong moved it, the layout changed. But Testimony 3 says he moved the mirror after the incident. The floor plans are the original blueprints, so that's okay.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (moving the mirror) and the Crime Photo (Evidence 12). The Crime Photo's caption mentions the folding screen separating the tables. If the mirror was the folding screen, then moving it would change the scene. But the Crime Photo shows the scene as it was when the crime occurred, which would have the mirror in place. So Armstrong moving it afterwards doesn't contradict the photo. Therefore, maybe another pair.

Looking at Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) which has the victim's doodle with 'MC Bomber' and '100,000' crossed out. Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) has a note to meet with The Tiger (Furio Tigre) on Dec 3rd. Evidence 23 (MC Bomber) is a virus program by Glen. The Sports Paper's doodle suggests that the victim was involved with MC Bomber and possibly a deal for 100,000, but crossed out. Maybe this connects to Tigre and the loan company.

But how does this relate to testimonies? Maybe Armstrong's testimony about moving the mirror is contradicted by another piece of evidence. Alternatively, looking at Testimony 4: "But naturally, I did not touch anything else!" If there's evidence that he did touch something else, that's a contradiction.

Evidence 1 (Magatama) was recovered in the kitchen. If Armstrong moved the mirror (which is in the dining area) but the Magatama was found in the kitchen, maybe he went into the kitchen and left it there. But he says he didn't touch anything else. If moving the mirror required accessing the kitchen, perhaps he had to touch other things. However, the Magatama was Maya's, so maybe she left it there. Not sure.

Alternatively, Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) is in the kitchen with Tigre's fingerprints. If Armstrong didn't touch anything else, then he didn't move the bottle, which is consistent because Tigre's prints are on it. So no contradiction there.

Wait, Testimony 3 and 4: Armstrong moved the mirror, nothing else. But if there's evidence that something else was moved or altered, then Testimony 4 is contradicted. Looking at the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) which shows two vases on each table, intact. But Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) says he broke the vase at his seat. If the Crime Photo shows intact vases, but Victor broke his vase during the incident, then the photo must have been taken before Victor broke the vase. But the Crime Photo's caption says it's a photo of the scene taken from near the kitchen. If Victor broke the vase during the incident (which occurred at the time of the murder), then the photo should show the broken vase. Contradiction here? But the Crime Photo caption says "There is an intact vase on each table." So if Victor broke his vase during the incident, the photo would show it broken. Therefore, Victor's Testimony (18) contradicts the Crime Photo (12). But the user is asking for a contradiction between evidence and testimony from the provided list.

Wait, but the testimonies provided are Testimony 0-4, all from Armstrong. The user's question is to find a pair among the given testimonies (0-4) and the evidences (0-27). So the answer must pair one of the testimonies (0-4) with one of the evidences (0-27).

Looking back, Testimony 3: Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident. Testimony 4: He didn't touch anything else. Now, Evidence 1 (Maya's Magatama) was recovered in the kitchen. If moving the mirror required going into the kitchen, perhaps Armstrong had to go there, but he says he didn't touch anything else. Alternatively, maybe the Magatama was moved by someone else. Not sure.

Alternatively, look at Evidence 11 (Tres Bien Floor Plans) which shows the original layout. The Floor Plans state that the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. Testimony 1 says there's only one seat (Victor's) from which you could see the victim. If the Floor Plans show that the view is obstructed except for the patio, but after moving the mirror, the view might have changed. However, Testimony 3 says he moved the mirror after the incident. The Floor Plans are the original blueprints, so they wouldn't reflect the post-move state. No contradiction here.

Wait, another angle. Testimony 0 says the mirror was in the middle dividing the restaurant. Testimony 1 says only one seat could see the victim, which was Victor's. If the mirror was in the middle, then the layout would have the two tables separated by the mirror (folding screen). The Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows two tables separated by a folding screen, with the victim's table behind it. So the mirror/folding screen was in place during the crime. Armstrong moved it after, as per Testimony 3. But the Floor Plans (Evidence 11) say the view from the entrance is obstructed, which matches the original layout. So no contradiction.

Hmm. Let's think about the Magatama (Evidence 1) being found in the kitchen. If Armstrong moved the mirror (which is part of the dining area) but the Magatama is in the kitchen, maybe he went into the kitchen and left it there. But he claims he didn't touch anything else. If the Magatama was in the kitchen, and he moved it there, that would contradict his Testimony 4. But the Magatama was on loan from Maya, so maybe she left it there. Not necessarily a contradiction.

Alternatively, Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) has a doodle by the victim. The Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2) is an article from Dec 5th saying the user was trounced and the client (Maggey) found guilty. But how does this relate to the testimonies?

Wait, Testimony 4: "But naturally, I did not touch anything else!" So Armstrong insists he only moved the mirror. However, Evidence 1 (Magatama) was found in the kitchen. If Armstrong had to enter the kitchen to move the mirror (unlikely), maybe he touched something there. But maybe the mirror is in the dining area, not the kitchen. So moving the mirror wouldn't require entering the kitchen. Therefore, no contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) is the victim's ear medicine found in the kitchen with Furio Tigre's fingerprints. If Armstrong didn't touch anything else, then he didn't handle the bottle. Which is consistent because the prints are Tigre's. No contradiction.

Looking back, perhaps the contradiction is between Armstrong's Testimony 3 (moving the mirror after the incident) and the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) which shows the mirror in its original position. Wait, but the Crime Photo was taken at the time of the crime, before Armstrong moved the mirror. So that's not a contradiction. The photo shows the scene as it was during the crime, and Armstrong moved it afterward. So no conflict.

Wait, another possibility: Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony where he says he broke the vase at his seat. The Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows intact vases on both tables. If Victor broke his vase during the incident, the photo should show it broken. But according to the Crime Photo's caption, the vases are intact. This is a contradiction between Evidence 12 and Victor's Testimony (18). However, the user's question is to find a contradiction between one of the provided testimonies (0-4, all by Armstrong) and an evidence. So Victor's testimony isn't in the provided testimonies list here; the testimonies provided are only 0-4 from Armstrong.

So, back to the original problem. The user is asking for a pair from the given testimonies (Armstrong's 0-4) and the given evidences (0-27).

Let me check Testimony 3 and Evidence 11 (Tres Bien Floor Plans). Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror, but the Floor Plans show the original layout. But the Floor Plans are blueprints, so they wouldn't change even if the mirror was moved. No contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 11's caption says "The view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio." Testimony 1 says only one seat (Victor's) could see the victim. If the Floor Plans show the original layout with the mirror, then after moving the mirror, the view might change, but the Floor Plans are as built, not as modified. No contradiction.

Alternatively, Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) has the victim's doodle with 'MC Bomber' and '100,000' crossed out. Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) notes meeting with The Tiger (Furio Tigre) on Dec 3rd. Evidence 23 (MC Bomber virus) connects to the victim. This suggests a financial motive involving Tigre. But how does this relate to Armstrong's testimonies?

Maybe not directly. Another angle: Testimony 2 says the old man (Victor) was sitting at the seat next to the victim's table. But Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) says he broke the vase at his seat. The Crime Photo shows the vase intact. If Victor broke it during the incident, the photo should show it broken. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) caption says both vases are intact. This is a contradiction between Evidence 12 and Victor's Testimony (18), but Victor's testimony isn't among the provided Testimonies 0-4. So it's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Armstrong's Testimony 3 (moving the mirror) and Evidence 11 (Floor Plans). If the Floor Plans show the mirror's original position, and Armstrong moved it, then the Floor Plans don't reflect the current state. But the Floor Plans are blueprints of the crime scene, not necessarily the current state. No contradiction.

Another approach: Look for a direct contradiction in statements. For example, Armstrong says he moved the mirror (Testimony 3) and didn't touch anything else (Testimony 4). But an evidence shows he did touch something else.

Looking at Evidence 1: Maya's Magatama was found in the kitchen. If Armstrong moved the mirror and then placed the Magatama in the kitchen, that would mean he touched something else. But the Magatama is Maya's, so maybe she left it there. Not necessarily Armstrong.

Evidence 6: Small Bottle has Furio's prints, not Armstrong's. So no contradiction.

Evidence 13: Coffee Cup has Maggey and victim's prints. No relation to Armstrong's testimony.

Hmm. Maybe Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) and Testimony 3. The Sports Paper was left by the victim on Dec 3rd. If Armstrong moved the mirror, maybe the Sports Paper was under the mirror or something. But no direct link.

Wait, Evidence 3's description says it was left by a customer (the victim) on Dec 3rd. The doodle is in the victim's handwriting. The Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2) is from Dec 5th saying the user lost the case. If Armstrong moved the mirror, but the Sports Paper was left on the table, perhaps moving the mirror displaced the paper, but Testimony 4 says he didn't touch anything else. If the paper was moved, that would contradict. But there's no evidence stating that the paper was moved. Not sure.

Alternatively, the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows pieces of paper near the coffee cup. If the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) was on the victim's table, then after moving the mirror, perhaps Armstrong moved the paper. But he claims he didn't touch anything else. But the Crime Photo shows the papers as they were during the crime, so moving the mirror wouldn't affect that. Unless moving the mirror caused the papers to be displaced. But unless there's evidence that the papers were moved, this is speculative.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 1 says only one seat could see the victim, which was Victor's. The Floor Plans (Evidence 11) say the view from the entrance is obstructed. If the mirror's position is key to the visibility, then after moving it, the view changes. But the Floor Plans are original, so no contradiction.

Wait, the answer might be Evidence 11 (Tres Bien Floor Plans) and Testimony 0. Testimony 0 says the mirror was in the middle of the restaurant dividing the two halves. The Floor Plans caption says the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. If the mirror's position in the middle aligns with the Floor Plans, no contradiction. So not the case.

Alternatively, Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 3. The Crime Photo shows the mirror in its original position, which Armstrong moved after the incident. That's consistent. So no contradiction.

At this point, I'm struggling to find a direct contradiction. Let me re-examine the testimonies and evidences again.

Testimony 3: Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident.

Testimony 4: He claims he didn't touch anything else.

Looking for evidence that shows he did touch something else. If any evidence indicates that something else in the crime scene was moved or altered after the incident, then Testimony 4 would be contradicted.

Evidence 1: Magatama found in the kitchen. If Armstrong moved the mirror and then went to the kitchen and left the Magatama there, that contradicts Testimony 4. But the Magatama is Maya's, so she might have left it. Unless Armstrong took it there. Not sure.

Alternatively, Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) says he broke the vase. The Crime Photo shows intact vases. So that's a contradiction, but Victor's testimony isn't part of the provided testimonies (0-4). So can't use that.

Wait, looking back at the user's data:

Testimonies provided are only Testimony 0-4, all from Armstrong.

Evidences are 0-27.

Looking at Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) which was left by the victim on Dec 3rd. Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident. If the mirror was covering the Sports Paper, moving it would expose the paper. But unless there's evidence that the paper was moved, no contradiction.

Alternatively, the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is in the kitchen with Furio's prints. Armstrong claims he didn't touch anything else, so he didn't touch the bottle. Which is okay, since the prints are Furio's.

Another possibility: The Magatama (Evidence 1) was found in the kitchen. If Armstrong moved the mirror, and the Magatama was in the kitchen, perhaps he had to go into the kitchen to move the mirror. But if the mirror is in the dining area, maybe not. Unless the mirror is part of the kitchen setup. Not sure.

Alternatively, the Repair Bill (Evidence 25) shows Tigre paid the Cadaverini Family for car repairs. Not related to testimonies.

Wait, Evidence 26: Paper Badge found at Tender Lender. Made to look authentic. This relates to the phony attorney (Furio Tigre impersonating Phoenix). But not directly related to Armstrong's testimonies.

Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 11. Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror, but the Floor Plans (Evidence 11) show the original layout. However, Floor Plans are blueprints and don't change, so no contradiction.

Another angle: The Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is the victim's ear medicine, found in the kitchen with Furio's prints. If the victim had it, how did it end up in the kitchen? Maybe someone moved it. If Armstrong says he didn't touch anything else, but the bottle was moved, then perhaps he did. But the prints are Furio's, so he's the one who moved it. So no contradiction with Armstrong's testimony.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let's try to summarize the possible contradictions again.

The most likely contradiction is between Armstrong's Testimony 4 ("did not touch anything else") and an evidence showing that he did touch something else. For example, if an evidence indicates that he moved another item.

Looking at Evidence 1 (Magatama found in the kitchen). If Armstrong placed it there after the incident, that would contradict Testimony 4. But the Magatama is Maya's; maybe she was in the kitchen and left it. The description says "Recovered in the kitchen of Tres Bien." But why would Maya's Magatama be there? Maybe during the investigation, but not necessarily moved by Armstrong.

Alternatively, Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) was left by the victim. If Armstrong moved the mirror and in doing so, had to move the paper, then he touched it, contradicting Testimony 4. But there's no evidence stating the paper was moved.

Wait, the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows near the coffee cup some pieces of paper. If the Sports Paper was part of those, and Armstrong moved the mirror, but the papers remained in place, then no contradiction. However, if moving the mirror displaced the papers, then Armstrong might have touched them. But no evidence states that.

Another possibility: Evidence 11 (Floor Plans) and Testimony 0. Testimony 0 says the mirror was in the middle. The Floor Plans' caption says the view from the entrance is obstructed. If the mirror's position in the middle causes the obstruction, then they align. No contradiction.

Wait, the user mentioned that the answer must be one pair. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. The most straightforward contradiction is between Testimony 3 (moved the mirror) and Evidence 11 (Floor Plans show original layout). But the Floor Plans are blueprints, not the actual crime scene setup. So no.

Wait, Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) shows the mirror in its original position (as a folding screen separating the tables). Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved it after the incident. The photo was taken during the crime, so it's before he moved it. No contradiction.

Wait, the user's question requires one pair. Let me think again. Maybe the answer is Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) and Testimony 3. The Sports Paper has the victim's doodle with 'MC Bomber' and '100,000' crossed out. Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident. How is this related? Maybe the Sports Paper was under the mirror, and moving it would have disturbed the paper. But unless the evidence says so, not sure.

Alternatively, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) notes meeting with The Tiger on Dec 3rd. Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror. No direct link.

Wait, the answer might be Evidence 11 (Tres Bien Floor Plans) and Testimony 1. Testimony 1 says only one seat could see the victim, which was Victor's. The Floor Plans' caption says the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. If Victor's seat is the only one with a view due to the mirror's placement, then the Floor Plans support that. So no contradiction.

Alternatively, Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) left by the victim on Dec 3rd. Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident. The Sports Paper's presence at the scene isn't affected by moving the mirror. So no.

Wait, the Magatama (Evidence 1) was recovered in the kitchen. If Armstrong moved the mirror but the Magatama is in the kitchen, maybe he had to enter the kitchen, thus touching something else. But Testimony 4 says he didn't touch anything else. If entering the kitchen implies touching something (like the door), but the Magatama's location isn't necessarily linked. Unless moving the mirror required kitchen access, which isn't stated.

I'm stuck. Let's look for the most voted answer in similar problems. Wait, in the game, the contradiction is often between a testimony about not moving something and evidence that it was moved. For example, in "Bridge to the Turnabout", moving the mirror affects the crime scene view.

Ah! Wait, Armstrong's Testimony 3 says he moved the mirror after the incident. Testimony 4 says he didn't touch anything else. However, the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows the mirror in its original position. But if the photo was taken after the incident, then the mirror should have been moved. However, the photo's caption says it was taken from near the kitchen at the time of the crime, so it's before Armstrong moved it. No contradiction.

But wait, if the police arrived and took the photo after the incident, but Armstrong moved the mirror before the photo was taken, that would contradict. But the photo is of the crime scene as it was when the victim collapsed, so it must have been taken before Armstrong moved the mirror. Thus, no contradiction.

Alternatively, Armstrong's Testimony 3 says he moved the mirror, but the Floor Plans (Evidence 11) show the mirror in the original position. But the Floor Plans are blueprints, not the current layout, so that's okay.

Wait, the answer might be Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 3. The Crime Photo shows the mirror in place, but Testimony 3 says he moved it. But the photo was taken before he moved it, so no contradiction.

Alternatively, Evidence 11's caption says the view from the entrance is obstructed, which would only allow seeing the patio. Testimony 1 says only Victor's seat could see the victim. If the Floor Plans and Testimony 1 align, no contradiction.

Wait, maybe the answer is Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 2. Testimony 2 says the old man (Victor) was sitting at the table next to the victim's. The Crime Photo shows the victim's table with no one sitting across. But Victor was at the adjacent table, so that's possible. No contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 0 says the mirror was in the middle. Evidence 12's photo shows the folding screen separating the tables. If the mirror is the folding screen, then they align. No contradiction.

I think I'm missing something. Let me check each evidence and testimony again.

Testimony 3: Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident.

Evidence 1: Magatama found in the kitchen. Did Armstrong go to the kitchen? If he did, he might have touched something there, contradicting Testimony 4. But there's no evidence he went to the kitchen.

Evidence 6: Small Bottle in kitchen with Furio's prints. Not related.

Evidence 3: Sports Paper with victim's doodle. No link to Armstrong's actions.

Evidence 12: Crime Photo shows the scene as it was during the crime, including the mirror. No contradiction.

Ah! Wait, Evidence 1 (Magatama) was recovered in the kitchen. The Magatama's description says "On loan from Maya. Recovered in the kitchen of Tres Bien." If Maya was in the kitchen, that's possible. But why would the Magatama be there? Maybe someone with a secret was there. But Armstrong's testimony about not touching anything else doesn't directly relate.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (Armstrong didn't touch anything else) and Evidence 1 (Magatama found in the kitchen). If Armstrong moved the mirror and in the process, placed the Magatama in the kitchen, that would mean he touched it. But the Magatama belongs to Maya, so she might have dropped it. So no.

Alternatively, Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches) found at Tender Lender. If Armstrong took matches from Tres Bien to Tender Lender, but he claims he didn't touch anything else. But no direct link.

Wait, another angle. Testimony 0 says the mirror was in the middle dividing the restaurant. Evidence 12's Crime Photo shows two tables separated by a folding screen. If the mirror is the folding screen, then Testimony 0 and Evidence 12 align. No contradiction.

Hmm. After extensive analysis, the most plausible contradiction is between Armstrong's Testimony 3 (moved the mirror) and Evidence 12 (Crime Photo showing the mirror in place during the crime). But since the photo was taken before he moved it, there's no contradiction. So this isn't the case.

Wait, the user might expect the answer to be Evidence 11 (Floor Plans) and Testimony 0. Testimony 0 says the mirror was in the middle. The Floor Plans' caption says the view from the entrance is obstructed. If the mirror's position in the middle causes the obstruction, then they align. No contradiction.

At this point, I'm going to make an educated guess. The answer is likely Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 3. The Crime Photo shows the folding screen (mirror) in place, but Testimony 3 says it was moved. However, since the photo was taken before the move, this isn't a contradiction. So that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) has the victim's doodle. Testimony 3 says the mirror was moved. If the mirror's original position was covering the Sports Paper, then moving it would reveal the paper, which was left by the victim. But unless the evidence states that the paper was hidden, this is speculative.

Alternatively, Evidence 19 (Millionaire Radio Flyer) advertises a thrill every Monday at 1:30 PM. The victim's time of death is 1:30-2:30 PM (Evidence 10). If the mirror was moved, affecting the radio's placement, but no direct link.

Wait, the answer might be Evidence 11 (Floor Plans) and Testimony 3. Floor Plans show the original layout, but Testimony 3 says the mirror was moved. However, Floor Plans are blueprints and not expected to change. No contradiction.

Alternatively, Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) has a date of Dec 3rd, the day of the incident. Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident. If the Sports Paper was on the mirror or under it, moving the mirror would displace the paper. But there's no evidence of that.

I'm really stuck here. Let me try to look for the most voted answer in similar logic puzzles. In the game "Ace Attorney: Trials and Tribulations," the case "Recipe for Turnabout" involves Armstrong moving the mirror. The contradiction there is that the crime photo shows the mirror in its original position, which should have been moved, but that's not the case here. Wait, in this scenario, the contradiction is between Armstrong's Testimony 3 (moving the mirror) and the Crime Photo's depiction of the mirror in place. But if the photo was taken after the incident, that's a contradiction. However, the Crime Photo's caption says it was taken from near the kitchen at the time of the crime, so before Armstrong moved it. Therefore, no contradiction.

Then, maybe the answer is Evidence 1 (Magatama found in kitchen) and Testimony 4 (didn't touch anything else). If moving the mirror required entering the kitchen, and the Magatama was there, then he touched something else. But there's no indication the mirror is in the kitchen.

Alternatively, the Magatama was found in the kitchen, but Armstrong says he didn't touch anything else. If the Magatama was moved there after the incident, and Armstrong was the only one who could have done it, that would contradict. But the Magatama is Maya's, so she might have been in the kitchen.

I think the intended answer is Evidence 1 (Magatama) and Testimony 4 (didn't touch anything else). Because the Magatama was recovered in the kitchen, implying someone (like Armstrong) placed it there after the incident. But since Armstrong says he didn't touch anything else, but the Magatama is in the kitchen, it's a contradiction. However, the Magatama was on loan from Maya, so she might have left it. But the user might expect this pair.

Alternatively, the correct answer is Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) and Testimony 3. Because the Sports Paper was left by the victim, and if Armstrong moved the mirror, the paper's position might have changed, but there's no direct evidence.

After thorough consideration, I think the correct answer is Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 3. The photo shows the mirror in place, but Testimony 3 says it was moved. However, since the photo was taken before the move, this isn't a contradiction. So this can't be right.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident. Evidence 11's Floor Plans show the mirror's original position. But the Floor Plans are just blueprints, not the actual crime scene. No contradiction.

Wait, the answer might be Evidence 1 (Magatama in kitchen) and Testimony 4. If Armstrong moved the mirror and the Magatama is in the kitchen, he must have touched it, contradicting Testimony 4. But the Magatama is Maya's. So, this is a possible intended answer.

But the Magatama's description says it was on loan from Maya and recovered in the kitchen. So Maya could have been in the kitchen, and Armstrong didn't touch it. So no contradiction.

Hmm. I'm really not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with the most plausible answer I can think of: Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 3. Even though the photo was taken before the move, but maybe the contradiction is that the mirror's position is different. Wait, no. The photo shows the scene as it was during the crime, and Testimony 3 says it was moved after. No contradiction.

The only other option is Evidence 1 and Testimony 4. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) and Testimony 4. The bottle has Furio's prints, so Armstrong didn't touch it. No contradiction.

I think I'll have to settle on Evidence 11 (Floor Plans) and Testimony 0. But how?

Wait, Testimony 0 says the mirror was in the middle dividing the restaurant. Evidence 11's Floor Plans show the view from the entrance is obstructed. If the mirror's position in the middle aligns with the Floor Plans, no contradiction. So not.

Finally, I'll choose Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 3, but I'm not sure. Wait, the Crime Photo shows two tables separated by a folding screen. Testimony 0 says the mirror was in the middle. If the folding screen is the mirror, then the photo shows the mirror in place, and Testimony 3 says it was moved after. No contradiction.

I think the correct answer is Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) and Testimony 3. But why?

The Sports Paper's doodle says 'MC Bomber' with 100,000 crossed out. Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) says meet with The Tiger (Furio). This connects to Tigre and the loan. The Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2) says the user lost the case, which was because of the phony (Furio). But this doesn't relate to Armstrong's testimonies.

Wait, the answer provided in the game might involve the folding screen/mirror and the visibility. If Armstrong moved the mirror, the view would change, but the Floor Plans say the view is obstructed. But Testimony 1 says only Victor's seat could see the victim. If the mirror's original position allowed that, but after moving it, others could see. But this doesn't directly contradict evidence.

Given the time I've spent, I'll conclude that the contradiction is between Armstrong's Testimony 3 (moving the mirror) and the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) showing the mirror in place. However, since the photo was taken during the crime, there's no contradiction. So perhaps another pair.

Wait, Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror, and Testimony 4 says he didn't touch anything else. If the mirror was part of the kitchen setup, moving it would require touching kitchen items. But the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is in the kitchen with Furio's prints. So no.

I'm stuck. According to the game's logic, the contradiction is usually when a testimony about not moving something is contradicted by evidence showing it was moved. For example, if Armstrong said he didn't move the mirror but evidence shows it was moved. But here, he admits to moving it. The contradiction might instead be about something else he touched.

Wait, the Repair Bill (Evidence 25) is for Tigre's car repair paid to Cadaverini. Not related.

The answer must be Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) and Testimony 3. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) is the victim's ear medicine found in the kitchen with Furio's prints. Testimony 4 says Armstrong didn't touch anything else. But the bottle's presence in the kitchen suggests someone (Furio) moved it, not Armstrong. No contradiction.

I think I have to make an educated guess here. The answer is {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3} because the Crime Photo (12) shows the mirror in place, but Testimony 3 says it was moved. However, this is incorrect because the photo was taken before the move. But maybe the user considers this a contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe Evidence 11 (Floor Plans) and Testimony 0. Floor Plans say the view is obstructed, Testimony 0 says the mirror was in the middle. If the mirror's position in the middle is what causes the obstruction, then they align. No contradiction.

Wait, looking back at the initial problem: Which evidence and testimony contradict each other? Must be one pair.

In the game, this case (Recipe for Turnabout) has a contradiction where moving the mirror would affect the line of sight. The mirror's original position allowed Victor to see the victim, but after moving it, others could. The floor plans show the original layout. But the contradiction here is between the floor plans and Armstrong's testimony about moving the mirror. However, floor plans are blueprints and don't reflect post-incident changes.

Alternatively, the answer is Evidence 11 (Floor Plans) and Testimony 1. Testimony 1 says only Victor's seat could see the victim. The Floor Plans' caption says the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. If the mirror's position (as per Testimony 0) allows Victor's seat to see the victim, then no contradiction.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The intended answer is likely {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3} because the Crime Photo (12) shows the mirror in place, but Testimony 3 says it was moved. Even though the photo was taken before the move, perhaps the user expects this pair. However, this is incorrect because the photo captures the scene before the mirror was moved.

Alternatively, the correct answer is Evidence 1 (Magatama in kitchen) and Testimony 4 (didn't touch anything else). If moving the mirror required Armstrong to enter the kitchen and leave the Magatama there, contradicting Testimony 4. But this is speculative.

Given that I need to provide an answer, I'll go with {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3} but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, the correct answer is {"evidence": 1, "testimony": 4} because the Magatama was found in the kitchen, implying Armstrong touched it, but he claims he didn't touch anything else.

But according to the evidence descriptions, the Magatama was "Recovered in the kitchen of Tres Bien" and "On loan from Maya". So Maya might have left it there, not Armstrong. Therefore, no contradiction.

Given all that, the most plausible answer is {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3} even though it's not a true contradiction. But I think the intended answer is different.

Wait, another thought: Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident. The Crime Photo (Evidence 12) was taken after the incident, showing the mirror in its original position. If the photo was taken after the incident, this would contradict. But the photo's caption says it was taken from near the kitchen at the time of the incident. Therefore, the photo was taken before the mirror was moved. So no contradiction.

The correct answer must be something else. Let me check the evidences again.

Evidence 3: Sports Paper with victim's doodle. Testimony 3: moved mirror. The victim's doodle mentions 'MC Bomber' which relates to Evidence 23 (MC Bomber virus). The connection is that Glen was meeting with Tigre (Evidence 20). This might suggest that Tigre killed Glen over the virus. But how does this relate to Armstrong's testimony?

Alternatively, Evidence 26: Paper Badge found at Tender Lender. This connects to Furio impersonating Phoenix. But no link to testimonies.

Another possibility: Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches) found at Tender Lender. This implies someone from Tender Lender was at Tres Bien, possibly Furio. But no direct link to testimonies.

Wait, the Lunch Special (Evidence 5) costs $20 but tastes bad. The Lottery Ticket (Evidence 14) found on Maggey is worth half a million. This connects to the motive, but not testimonies.

Back to the testimonies. Testimony 1 says only Victor's seat could see the victim. Evidence 11's Floor Plans say the view from the entrance is obstructed. If the mirror's position in the middle (Testimony 0) caused the obstruction, then Victor's seat was the only one with a view. This aligns, so no contradiction.

I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3} due to the mirror's position in the photo versus the testimony about moving it. Even though logically it's not a contradiction because the photo was taken before the move, perhaps in the game's context, this is considered a contradiction. For example, if the photo was supposed to show the post-move state but still has the mirror, but the caption says it was taken at the time of the crime, so before the move. Therefore, no contradiction. I'm really not sure.

Alternatively, the answer is {"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}. Evidence 11 (Floor Plans) shows the original layout, Testimony 3 says the mirror was moved. But Floor Plans are blueprints, so no contradiction.

At this point, I'll have to make a guess. The most likely intended answer is {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3} but I'm not certain. Alternatively, {"evidence": 1, "testimony": 4}.

Wait, the Magatama (Evidence 1) was found in the kitchen. If Armstrong moved the mirror and the Magatama is in the kitchen, he must have gone there, implying he touched something else (the kitchen door, etc.), contradicting Testimony 4. But there's no direct evidence he touched the Magatama. So this is a stretch.

Alternatively, the answer is {"evidence": 3, "testimony": 3}. Evidence 3 is the Sports Paper left by the victim. Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror. If moving the mirror displaced the paper, then he touched it, contradicting Testimony 4. But there's no evidence the paper was moved.

I think the correct answer is {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3}. Even though it's not a direct contradiction, it's a common type of contradiction in the games where the photo shows the scene as-is, but the testimony says it was altered. However, since the photo was taken before the alteration, it's not a contradiction. Therefore, this must be incorrect.

After struggling, I think the intended answer is {"evidence": 1, "testimony": 4}. Because the Magatama was found in the kitchen, and Armstrong claims he didn't touch anything else. If moving the mirror required him to go into the kitchen and leave the Magatama, but he says he didn't touch anything else, that's a contradiction. However, the Magatama is Maya's, so she could have left it. So this is uncertain.

In the game, the contradiction in this case is between the fact that Armstrong moved the mirror (Testimony 3) and the Floor Plans (Evidence 11) showing the mirror's original position. But again, the Floor Plans are blueprints.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (didn't touch anything else) and Evidence 1 (Magatama in kitchen). If Armstrong touched the Magatama to move it to the kitchen, that's a contradiction. But he claims he didn't touch anything else.

I think the answer is {"evidence": 1, "testimony": 4}.

{"evidence": 1, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So I need to look through all the testimonies and see if any of them are contradicted by one of the evidences provided.

First, let's list out the testimonies. Testimony 0 from Armstrong says the victim came alone. Testimony 1 says an old man arrived not long after him. Testimony 2 specifies the old man arrived just after 2 PM. Testimony 3 states there were no other customers. Testimony 4 mentions the victim got excited about winning the lottery. Testimony 5 says the poisoning happened about 5 minutes later. Testimony 6 claims there was no time for a phony to act.

Now looking at the evidence. Evidence 20 is Glen's calendar with a note to meet "The Tiger" on Dec 3rd. Since "The Tiger" is Furio Tigre (Character 10), that suggests the victim had a meeting with him on the day of the incident. So if the victim was supposed to meet Tigre, but Armstrong says there were no other customers (Testimony 3), that's a contradiction because Tigre might have been there. But wait, maybe Tigre wasn't a customer but someone else? Or perhaps the meeting was elsewhere?

Wait, another angle. Evidence 3 is the Sports Paper from Dec 3rd with a doodle by the victim that says 'MC Bomber' pointing to 100,000 crossed out, and laughter. Also, Evidence 23 is the MC Bomber disc found at Tender Lender, which is a virus made by Glen. The victim was a programmer. So maybe the meeting with The Tiger (Tigre) was related to this virus. But how does this tie into the testimonies?

Testimony 3 from Armstrong says there were no other customers. But if the victim was meeting Tigre, then Tigre would be there. Unless Tigre wasn't considered a customer but was part of the staff or something. Alternatively, maybe someone else arrived but wasn't considered a customer. Wait, Evidence 1 (Maya's Magatama) was recovered in the kitchen. Maybe someone was in the kitchen?

Wait, Evidence 24 is Tres Bien matches found at Tender Lender. That might indicate a connection between the restaurant and the loan company. Also, Evidence 8 is Jean Armstrong's loan contract with Tender Lender, so he's in debt to them. So maybe Tigre (head of Tender Lender) was at Tres Bien but not as a customer. For instance, if he was there to collect the debt from Armstrong. If that's the case, then Armstrong might be lying when he says there were no other customers because Tigre was there but not as a customer. That could contradict Testimony 3.

Alternatively, Evidence 20 says the victim had a meeting with The Tiger (Tigre) on that day. So if the victim was at Tres Bien to meet Tigre, but Armstrong says there were no other customers (Testimony 3), that would mean Tigre wasn't present. But if Tigre was there, then Testimony 3 is false. However, is there evidence that Tigre was present? Let's check the evidences.

Evidence 6: Small Bottle (victim's ear medicine) has Furio Tigre's fingerprints. So Tigre handled the bottle. The bottle was found in the kitchen. Therefore, Tigre was in the kitchen, possibly. So if Armstrong claims there were no other customers (Testimony 3), but Tigre was present in the kitchen (not a customer), then maybe that's not a direct contradiction. But Armstrong might have omitted that Tigre was there as a non-customer. However, the testimony specifically says "no other customers", so if Tigre was present but not a customer, Testimony 3 could still be true. But if Tigre was present in the restaurant, then there's a contradiction if he was a customer. But according to Evidence 6, his fingerprints are on the victim's medicine bottle in the kitchen. So maybe he was in the kitchen, not the dining area, so Armstrong didn't see him as a customer. Therefore, maybe Testimony 3 is accurate in that there were no other customers in the dining area.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 19: Millionaire Radio Flyer says every Monday at 1:30 PM. The incident happened on Dec 3rd, which was a Monday (since Evidence 3's date is Dec 3rd, and the sports paper is from that day). The time of death is between 1:30 and 2:30 PM (Evidence 10). The victim met with The Tiger per Evidence 20. If the meeting was at 1:30 PM, then perhaps the victim was at Tres Bien for that. But Testimony 2 from Armstrong says the old man arrived just after 2 PM. Wait, Testimony 1 and 2 mention an old man arriving after the victim. The old man is Victor Kudo? Or someone else? Wait, the victim is Glen Elg. The old man could be Victor Kudo (Character 7) who was present. But Testimony 3 says no other customers, but Victor Kudo was there. Wait, Testimony 18 is Victor's Testimony: "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." So Victor was present in the restaurant. But Armstrong's Testimony 3 says "Z'ere were no other customers." That's a contradiction. Because Victor Kudo was a customer. Therefore, Testimony 3 (Testimony index 3) is contradicted by Victor's presence. But the question is which evidence contradicts the testimony. Because Victor's Testimony is Evidence 18. Wait, but Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony where he admits to being there. So if Armstrong says there were no other customers (Testimony 3), but Victor was there as a customer, then Testimony 3 is contradicted by Victor's own testimony (Evidence 18). However, the question is which evidence contradicts the testimony. So Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) would contradict Testimony 3 (Armstrong's claim of no other customers). But in the given evidences, the user's list includes Testimonies as separate entities. Wait, the Testimonies are listed as Testimony 0 to 6, each given by a person. Testimony 18 is Victor's Testimony (from the Evidences list). Wait, no, in the given data, the Testimonies section includes Testimony 0 to 6, each with a Person. Then in the Evidences list, there's Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony). Wait, I need to check the structure again.

Looking back: The Testimonies section includes Testimony 0-6, each given by a Person (like Armstrong). Then the Evidences list includes items like Evidence 18: Victor's Testimony. So the Testimonies are separate from the Evidences. Therefore, if Testimony 3 (from Armstrong) says there were no other customers, but Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) says he was there and broke a vase, then this is a contradiction. However, according to the problem statement, we need to find a pair where an Evidence (from the Evidences list) contradicts a Testimony (from the Testimonies list). So Testimony 3 (Armstrong's "no other customers") is contradicted by Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony). But Evidence 18 is part of the Evidences list. Therefore, this would be the pair: Evidence 18 and Testimony 3. However, the problem might require the evidence and testimony as per their indexes. Let me check the indexes. Testimony 3 is index 3 (Testimony 3: "Z'ere were no other customers." Person: Armstrong). Evidence 18 is index 18: "Victor's Testimony: 'When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry.'" So if Victor was present, that means there was another customer, contradicting Armstrong's Testimony 3. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 18 and Testimony 3. But I need to verify if there's any other possible contradictions.

Another angle: Testimony 2 says the old man arrived just after 2 PM. The time of death is between 1:30 and 2:30. If the poisoning happened around 1:30-2:30, and the old man arrived after 2 PM, but the victim was already dead by then. Wait, but the victim died between 1:30 and 2:30. The old man arriving after 2 PM might have been after the poisoning. But the victim was poisoned between that time. However, the coffee cup (Evidence 13) had cyanide. The victim would have had to drink it before death. So if the old man arrived after 2 PM, maybe the poisoning occurred after that. But the autopsy report says time of death between 1:30 and 2:30. So there's a possible contradiction here with the timing. However, the problem is to find a contradiction between evidence and testimony.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says the poisoning happened 5 minutes after the victim found out about the lottery. If the lottery ticket was found on Maggey (Evidence 14), then maybe the victim told someone, got excited, and then was poisoned. But how does that contradict any evidence?

Wait, Evidence 3: Sports Paper from Dec 3rd with a doodle by the victim. The doodle says 'MC Bomber' pointing to 100,000 crossed out, and 'Ahahahaha'. This could indicate that the victim was involved in some deal related to the MC Bomber virus (Evidence 23) which is worth millions. But if the victim had a lottery ticket for half a million (Evidence 14), maybe he was planning to use that to pay off something, but the MC Bomber was worth more. But how does this tie into the testimonies?

Wait, Testimony 4 says when the victim found out he won the lottery, he became excited. Then, Testimony 5 says 5 minutes later the poisoning happened. But Evidence 14 is the victim's lottery ticket found on Maggey. So if Maggey had the ticket, how did the victim know he won? Maybe the ticket was stolen, but the victim already knew he won. But that's not necessarily a contradiction.

Another possible contradiction: Evidence 20 (Glen's calendar) shows he was supposed to meet "The Tiger" (Tigre) on the day of the incident. So if he was at Tres Bien for that meeting, but Armstrong's testimonies (Testimony 0, 1, 2) say he came alone and only an old man arrived later. But Tigre's fingerprints are on the victim's ear medicine (Evidence 6), which was in the kitchen. So Tigre was present in the kitchen, possibly. But Testimony 3 says there were no other customers, but Tigre wasn't a customer. So that might not contradict. However, if Tigre was there but not considered a customer, then Armstrong's testimony is still true. But the victim was supposed to meet him. So maybe the meeting happened in the kitchen, but Armstrong didn't see him as a customer.

Alternatively, looking back at the floor plans (Evidence 11): The view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. The crime photo (Evidence 12) shows two tables separated by a folding screen. One table is empty, the other where the victim collapsed. The coffee cup was there. The vase on each table. Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) says he broke the vase at his seat. So Victor was sitting at one of the tables. But according to Armstrong's Testimony 3, there were no other customers. So if Victor was present, then Testimony 3 is a lie, contradicted by Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18). Therefore, Evidence 18 contradicts Testimony 3. So the answer would be {"evidence": 18, "testimony": 3}.

Wait, but Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony. Let me confirm the indexes. Evidence 18 is named "Victor's Testimony" and is part of the Evidences list. Testimony 3 is the third testimony in the Testimonies list, which is from Armstrong stating there were no other customers. So yes, Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony that he was present and broke a vase) contradicts Testimony 3 (no other customers). Therefore, this is the correct pair.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies given. Let me start by looking through the testimonies and the evidences to see if there's a conflict.

First, the testimonies from Tigre. Testimony 3 says, "I got whales lined up to borrow cash from Tender Lender every single day." So Tigre is claiming that his business was busy with clients every day. Now, looking at the evidences, let's see if any of them show that this isn't true.

Evidence 24 is Tres Bien Matches found in Tender Lender. Wait, Tres Bien is the restaurant where the murder happened. If matches from Tres Bien are at Tender Lender, maybe someone from Tender Lender was at Tres Bien. But Tigre's testimony says he was in his office all day on December 3rd (from Testimony 1 and 2). But Evidence 6, the Small Bottle, has Furio Tigre's fingerprints. The Small Bottle was found in the kitchen of Tres Bien. So if Tigre's fingerprints are on the victim's ear medicine in the restaurant's kitchen, that contradicts his testimony that he was in his office all day and didn't see the victim. So Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) shows he was present at the crime scene, which contradicts his Testimony 2 where he says he was in the office and never saw the victim.

Wait, but the question asks for a pair where evidence contradicts a testimony. Let me check again. Testimony 3 is about having clients every day, but Evidence 27 is Viola's Medical Papers with a million-dollar bill. Maybe that shows financial trouble, but not directly contradicting Testimony 3. Alternatively, Evidence 8 is Jean's Loan Contract with Tender Lender for half a million. If Tigre's business is lending, but Jean owes money, maybe that's related. Hmm.

Wait, no. The key contradiction is Tigre's alibi. His testimony (Testimony 1 and 2) says he was in the office all day on Dec 3rd. But Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) has his fingerprints in the kitchen of Tres Bien. That directly contradicts his claim that he was in the office. So the correct pair would be Evidence 6 and Testimony 2. However, the user asked for only one pair. Let me check which testimony exactly.

Testimony 2 says: "The day youse talkin' about, I was in de office, too. I never saw that kid before." The kid refers to Glen Elg. But Evidence 6 has his fingerprints on the victim's ear medicine bottle in Tres Bien, which would mean he was at the crime scene, contradicting his alibi. So the evidence 6 contradicts testimony 2. But Testimony 3 is about having clients every day, which maybe another evidence contradicts. Let me check again.

Alternatively, Testimony 3: "I got whales lined up..." which could be contradicted by Evidence 8 (Jean's Loan Contract) showing that Jean is in debt to Tender Lender. But Tigre could still have other clients. Not a direct contradiction. Or Evidence 25, the Repair Bill paid by Tigre to Cadaverini, maybe indicating financial strain, but not directly related to Testimony 3.

Wait, perhaps Evidence 23: MC Bomber found at Tender Lender. It's a computer virus made by the victim, Glen Elg. The Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2) says that the user (Phoenix) was trounced and client guilty. The Sports Paper (Evidence 3) has a doodle about MC Bomber pointing to 100k crossed out. The victim's calendar (Evidence 20) mentions meeting "The Tiger" (Tigre) on Dec 3rd. So if Glen was supposed to meet Tigre that day, but Tigre claims he never saw Glen (Testimony 2), then Evidence 20 contradicts Testimony 2. But the user is looking for evidence and testimony that directly contradict each other. Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) says he had a meeting with The Tiger on the day of the incident. Tigre's Testimony 2 says he never saw Glen. So that's another contradiction. But which evidence is stronger?

Alternatively, the fingerprints on the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) directly place Tigre at the scene, contradicting his Testimony 2. So that would be the pair: Evidence 6 and Testimony 2. But the user's example answer was {"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}, which is just an example. So I need to confirm.

But wait, Testimony 3 is "I got whales lined up..." which is about having clients every day. Maybe Evidence 27 (Viola's Medical Papers) shows a million-dollar bill due last year. If Tigre's business is doing well (whales borrowing), why is there a huge unpaid medical bill? But that's more of a financial motive, not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, Evidence 26: Paper Badge found at Tender Lender, made to look like an attorney's badge. If Tigre's business is loan sharking, maybe this is used for scams. But how does that contradict a testimony?

Wait, Testimony 4 from Tigre says "Youse wanna check my alibi, just ask Violetta." But if Violetta (Viola Cadaverini) is involved with the medical bill (Evidence 27), maybe she has her own issues. Not sure.

But the strongest contradiction seems to be Evidence 6 (Small Bottle with Tigre's fingerprints at the crime scene) and Tigre's Testimony 2 where he claims he was in the office and never saw the victim. That directly contradicts because his fingerprints are present where the victim was. So the correct pair is evidence 6 and testimony 2.

Looking back at the user's instruction, they want the evidence number and testimony number. Testimony 2 is the one where he says he was in the office and never saw Glen. So {"evidence": 6, "testimony": 2}.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 2}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair. Let me start by going through the testimonies and cross-referencing with the evidence.

Looking at the testimonies from Tigre. Testimony 3 says he waited at his office (Tender Lender) for Glen Elg, but Glen didn't show up. But Evidence 20 is Glen's calendar, which has a note on Dec 3rd (the day of the incident) saying "Meet with The Tiger". So if Glen had a meeting with "The Tiger" (which is Tigre's nickname according to Evidence 10), then why didn't Glen show up? Wait, but Evidence 23 is the MC Bomber disc found at Tender Lender, which is Tigre's place. Also, Evidence 24 are Tres Bien matches found at Tender Lender. So maybe Glen was at Tender Lender, but Tigre claims he never came. But if there's evidence that Glen was there, that would contradict. Wait, but the calendar note is about the meeting, but the actual location of the murder is Tres Bien. Hmm, maybe the contradiction is that Tigre says he never went to Tres Bien (Testimony 4: "I ain't never been to that Tres Bien joint") but there's evidence linking him there. Let's check the evidence. Evidence 6: Small Bottle found in the kitchen, which has Furio Tigre's fingerprints. If the bottle is in Tres Bien's kitchen and has his prints, that means he was there, contradicting his testimony that he never went to Tres Bien. So Evidence 6 (Small Bottle with Tigre's prints) contradicts Testimony 4 (Tigre claims he was never at Tres Bien). That seems solid. Let me confirm. Testimony 4: Tigre says he's never been to Tres Bien. Evidence 6: Found in Tres Bien's kitchen, with his fingerprints. So that's a direct contradiction. Yes, that's the pair.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair. Let's start by going through the testimonies and cross-referencing them with the evidences.

Looking at the testimonies, the ones by Tigre (Testimony 0 to 3). Testimony 3 says Tigre left because he thought the place would be hot soon, and he heard the sirens on his way out (Testimony 4). But wait, Evidence 6 is the small bottle which has Furio Tigre's fingerprints. The bottle was found in the kitchen. If Tigre left immediately when he heard the sirens, how did his fingerprints get on the bottle in the kitchen? Because if he left before the cops arrived, he wouldn't have been there when the crime scene was processed. So the presence of his fingerprints on the bottle contradicts his testimony that he left before the police arrived. The bottle's fingerprints would require him to have handled it, which would mean he was present at the scene when the bottle was there, but he claims he left quickly. That's a contradiction.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. First, I need to go through all the evidence and testimonies to spot any inconsistencies.

Looking at the testimonies, Tigre has several statements. Testimony 0 says he loaned Elg 100,000 dollars. Evidence 3 is a sports paper with a doodle that says 'MC Bomber' pointing to 100,000 crossed out, and 'Ahahahaha' next to it. The doodle is in the victim's handwriting. Also, Testimony 4 from Tigre mentions that Elg won half a million, which matches Evidence 14 (the lottery ticket for half a million). 

But wait, in Testimony 7, Tigre says he was after the $100,000 and had no other reason to kill. However, Evidence 23 is the MC Bomber disc, which is a computer virus worth millions. Also, the Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2) mentions that the attorney was trounced and the client found guilty, which might relate to Tigre's motive. 

But the key contradiction might be between Tigre's claim that he only wanted the 100k (Testimony 7) and the fact that the victim had a lottery ticket worth half a million (Evidence 14). If Tigre knew about the lottery ticket, his motive would be higher than just 100k. But wait, in Testimony 4, Tigre says Elg won the lottery, so he knew about the 500k. However, in Testimony 7, he says he was only after the 100k. But according to Evidence 3, the victim crossed out the 100k, which might indicate that he paid it back, hence Tigre's motive would be invalid. Wait, Evidence 3's doodle by the victim has '100,000' crossed out, which could mean that the 100k debt was settled. But Tigre in Testimony 1 says they were due to have a chat because Elg hit his payback date. If the 100k was already crossed out (paid?), then Tigre's claim that he was after the 100k (Testimony 7) contradicts Evidence 3, which suggests the debt was resolved. That would mean Tigre's testimony about needing the 100k is false because the victim had already addressed it, perhaps by using the lottery money. So the contradiction is between Testimony 7 (Tigre says he wanted the 100k) and Evidence 3 (victim crossed out 100k, implying it was paid or no longer owed). Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 3 and Testimony 7.

{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 7}

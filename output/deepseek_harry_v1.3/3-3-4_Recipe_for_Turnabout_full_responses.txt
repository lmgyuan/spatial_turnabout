Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to look through the provided evidence and testimonies to find a contradiction.

First, let's review the testimonies. The testimonies given are all from Armstrong (Testimony 0 to 4). Testimony 0 says there was a mirror in the middle of the restaurant dividing the two halves. Testimony 1 mentions that only one seat could have seen an image of the victim. Testimony 2 points out that the old man (Victor Kudo?) was sitting at the table next to the victim's. Testimony 3 states that after the incident, Armstrong moved the mirror out of the way. Testimony 4 claims he didn't touch anything else.

Now, looking at the evidence. Evidence 11 is the Tres Bien Floor Plans, which mention that the view from the entrance is obstructed and only the patio is visible. Evidence 12 is the Crime Photo, which describes the scene with two tables separated by a folding screen. The photo shows an empty table closer to the camera and the victim's table with coffee stains, papers, and vases on both tables. Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) says he broke the vase at his seat.

Wait, Armstrong's Testimony 3 says he moved the mirror after the incident. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows that there are vases on each table. However, Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) mentions he broke the vase at his seat. If Victor broke the vase, then in the Crime Photo, the vase at his seat (the table next to the victim's) should be broken. But according to the Crime Photo's description, both tables have intact vases. That seems contradictory. Wait, but Evidence 12's description says "intact vase on each table". So if Victor broke his vase, the photo should show a broken vase, but it's intact. That would mean Victor's Testimony contradicts the photo. But Victor's Testimony is Evidence 18, which is separate. However, Armstrong's Testimony 3 says he moved the mirror, but he also claims he didn't touch anything else (Testimony 4). 

Wait, let's check the Crime Photo (Evidence 12). The photo is taken from near the kitchen, showing two tables with a folding screen between them. Each table has an intact vase. But according to Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18), he broke the vase at his seat. So the photo should show a broken vase where Victor was sitting, but it's intact. That would be a contradiction between Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) and the Crime Photo (Evidence 12). But the user is asking for a pair between the given testimonies (Testimony 0-4, all Armstrong's) and the evidence. So maybe looking at Armstrong's testimonies against evidence.

Looking at Armstrong's Testimony 0, he mentions a mirror in the middle. But the Floor Plans (Evidence 11) mention that the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. The Floor Plans might have a folding screen instead of a mirror. Wait, the Floor Plans (Evidence 11) say "the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio." The Tres Bien Floor Plans would show the layout. Armstrong's Testimony 0 says there was a mirror dividing the two halves, but the Floor Plans (Evidence 11) mention a folding screen (as per Evidence 12's description: two tables separated by a folding screen). So Armstrong's Testimony 0 about the mirror contradicts the Floor Plans (Evidence 11) and the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) which mention a folding screen. Because the mirror would be a different structure than a folding screen. So if the Floor Plans and Crime Photo show a folding screen, but Armstrong says there was a mirror dividing the restaurant, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Armstrong's Testimony 0 is contradicted by Evidence 11 (Floor Plans) or Evidence 12 (Crime Photo description). 

But the user wants one pair. Let's check the exact descriptions. Testimony 0: Armstrong says there was a mirror in the middle dividing the restaurant. Evidence 11: Floor Plans show that the view from the entrance is obstructed (by a folding screen, as per Evidence 12's mention of a folding screen). The Crime Photo (12) specifically mentions a folding screen separating the tables. Therefore, Armstrong's Testimony 0 about the mirror is contradicted by the Floor Plans (11) and Crime Photo (12), which indicate a folding screen, not a mirror. So the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 11 or 12. Let's confirm. 

Evidence 11: Tres Bien Floor Plans: "the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio." The obstruction is likely the folding screen mentioned in Evidence 12. Therefore, Armstrong's Testimony 0 about the mirror being in the middle contradicts the actual layout shown in the Floor Plans and Crime Photo, which use a folding screen. So the evidence contradicting Testimony 0 would be either 11 or 12. The user asks for one pair, so which is more direct? The Floor Plans (11) describe the obstruction (folding screen), while the Crime Photo (12) shows it. But the Floor Plans are blueprints, which should show the actual structure. Therefore, Testimony 0 (Armstrong) is contradicted by Evidence 11 (Floor Plans) because Armstrong claims there was a mirror, but the Floor Plans (and photo) show a folding screen. So the contradiction is Evidence 11 (Floor Plans) and Testimony 0 (Armstrong's statement about the mirror). But the user requires the answer in JSON. Wait, but maybe there's another contradiction. Let me check other possibilities.

Looking at Testimony 3: Armstrong says he moved the mirror after the incident. But if there was a folding screen instead of a mirror, then Testimony 3 is a lie. Because moving a mirror that wasn't there would be impossible. Therefore, Testimony 3 (Armstrong moved the mirror) would contradict Evidence 11 (Floor Plans with folding screen) or 12 (Crime Photo showing folding screen). So the contradiction here would be between Testimony 3 and Evidence 12. Because if the photo taken at the crime scene shows a folding screen and intact vases, and Armstrong claims he moved a mirror, which wasn't there, then his testimony is false. So that's another possible contradiction. 

So which pair is correct? The answer could be either Testimony 0 vs Evidence 11, or Testimony 3 vs Evidence 12. Let's check Evidence 12's description again. The Crime Photo shows two tables separated by a folding screen, with each table having an intact vase. The photo was taken from near the kitchen. So if Armstrong moved the mirror (Testimony 3), the photo (taken after the incident?) would still show a folding screen, not a mirror. Therefore, Testimony 3's claim that he moved the mirror would be contradicted by the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) showing a folding screen. Because if he moved the mirror, then the mirror wouldn't be present, but the photo shows a folding screen. Wait, but maybe the mirror was part of the folding screen? That's possible. But the description in Evidence 12 says "two dining tables are separated by a folding screen." So the screen is a physical divider, not a mirror. Therefore, Armstrong's Testimony 3 about moving the mirror (which wasn't there) is contradicted by the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) which shows a folding screen. So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Armstrong moving the mirror) and Evidence 12 (Crime Photo showing a folding screen instead of a mirror). Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 12 and Testimony 3. Alternatively, Testimony 0 and Evidence 11.

Another angle: The Floor Plans (Evidence 11) indicate that the view from the entrance is obstructed. If the obstruction was a mirror (as per Testimony 0), then the Floor Plans would reflect that. But the Floor Plans mention the view is obstructed and only the patio is visible, which aligns with a physical barrier like a folding screen. Therefore, the Floor Plans (11) contradict Testimony 0's mention of a mirror. 

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident. But if the mirror wasn't there (as per Evidence 12's folding screen), then Testimony 3 is a lie. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 3 and Evidence 12. 

But which is the correct pair? Let me check the user's examples. The user's example answer would be {"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}. But here, perhaps the answer is Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) contradicting Testimony 3. Because the photo taken after the incident (assuming it was taken right after the crime) would show the folding screen, not a mirror, which Armstrong claims he moved. Therefore, moving a mirror that wasn't there (since the photo shows a folding screen) would mean Armstrong is lying. Hence, Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 12.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all provided. I need to carefully compare each testimony with the evidence to spot inconsistencies.

First, I'll look through the testimonies. Testimony 3 from Armstrong says there were no other customers. But let's check the evidences. Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony where he mentions breaking a vase at his seat during the incident. If Victor was there and broke a vase, then he must have been a customer present. That directly contradicts Armstrong's statement that there were no other customers. 

Also, Evidence 3 is a sports paper left by a customer on Dec 3rd. So there was at least one other customer (Victor), which means Armstrong's Testimony 3 is false. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) and Testimony 3 (Armstrong saying no other customers). But wait, Evidence 3 also supports the presence of another customer. Maybe either Evidence 3 or 18 could contradict Testimony 3. But the user wants one pair. Let me confirm. 

Testimony 3 by Armstrong claims no other customers, but Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) states he was there and broke a vase. So the contradiction is clear here. Hence, the correct pair is Evidence 18 and Testimony 3. Alternatively, Evidence 3 (sports paper left by a customer) also shows there were customers. But maybe the user expects the most direct contradiction. Victor's Testimony directly states his presence, making Testimony 3 false. So the answer should be Evidence 18 and Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies provided. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all given. Let's start by going through each testimony and cross-referencing with the evidence.

The testimonies are from Tigre. Let's look at his statements. 

Testimony 3 says: "I got whales lined up to borrow cash from Tender Lender every single day." Now, looking at the evidence, Evidence 8 is Jean's Loan Contract which mentions that Jean's debt is half a million dollars, and the owner is Tender Lender. But wait, maybe there's something else. 

Evidence 23 is MC Bomber, a sample disc found at Tender Lender containing a computer virus. And Evidence 20 is Glen's Calendar with a note to meet "The Tiger" on Dec 3rd. The Tiger is likely Furio Tigre. So if Tigre claims he was in his office all day on December 3rd (Testimony 1), but Glen's calendar says he had a meeting with The Tiger that day, that's a contradiction. But wait, Tigre's Testimony 1 says he was in his office all day in December last year. However, the calendar note is on Dec 3rd, the day of the incident. If he was in his office, how could he meet Glen? Unless "The Tiger" refers to someone else, but Tigre is known as "The Tiger". 

Wait, but maybe the evidence that contradicts is the Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2), which is from Dec 5th saying the phony attorney (which might be Tigre using the Paper Badge) got Maggey convicted. But how does that tie to Tigre's testimony?

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 2: Tigre says he was in the office that day and never saw Glen. But Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) says he was supposed to meet The Tiger. So that's a contradiction. So if Glen was supposed to meet Tigre, but Tigre says he never saw him, that's conflicting. But Evidence 20 is the calendar note. So that would pair Evidence 20 with Testimony 2. But Testimony 2 is Tigre saying he never saw Glen. So if the calendar says they were supposed to meet, that's a contradiction. But maybe Tigre is lying about not seeing him.

Alternatively, Evidence 24: Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender. If Tigre claims he was in his office all the time, but the matches from Tres Bien (the crime scene) are at his place, that might indicate he was there. But Testimony 1 says he was in the office all of December. If the matches are from Tres Bien and found at Tender Lender, that could imply someone from Tender Lender was at Tres Bien, contradicting Tigre's alibi. But the matches are just advertising, maybe they're distributed elsewhere. Not sure.

Another angle: Testimony 4 says "Youse wanna check my alibi, just ask Violetta." But Viola's Medical Papers (Evidence 27) show a huge bill due last year. If Viola is in debt, maybe she's coerced into lying for Tigre. But that's more of a motive rather than a direct contradiction.

Looking at Evidence 25: Repair Bill paid by Tigre to Cadaverini. Maybe connects to the mafia, but not directly a contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 3: "whales lined up every day" (big borrowers). But Evidence 8 shows Jean's loan is half a million, which is a large sum. If Tigre's business is doing well with big clients, but Jean's contract is from Tender Lender, that might not contradict. Unless there's evidence that Tender Lender isn't doing well. Not sure.

Wait, Evidence 23 is MC Bomber, a virus. If Tigre is involved in distributing viruses, maybe, but how does that contradict his testimony?

Alternatively, Evidence 26: Paper Badge found at Tender Lender. If Tigre used a fake badge to impersonate an attorney (as in Maggey's case), then the paper badge being there supports that. But how does that contradict his testimonies?

Wait, back to the initial thought. Testimony 1: Tigre was in his office all day on December 3rd. Evidence 20: Glen's calendar says meet The Tiger that day. If they were supposed to meet, but Tigre claims he was in the office, maybe they didn't meet. But maybe the meeting was at the office. Not necessarily a contradiction. Unless the meeting was elsewhere. But the evidence doesn't specify where.

Wait, the crime happened at Tres Bien. Glen was a programmer, meeting with The Tiger (Tigre) there? But the calendar note just says "Meet with The Tiger" on Dec 3. If Tigre says he was in his office, maybe the meeting was at Tender Lender. But Glen was at Tres Bien where he died. So maybe the contradiction is that Tigre claims he was in the office and didn't see Glen, but the calendar suggests a meeting. However, without knowing where the meeting was supposed to take place, it's hard to confirm.

Alternatively, Evidence 3: Sports Paper from Dec 3rd with 'MC Bomber' doodle. If Tigre's involved with MC Bomber (Evidence 23), which is a virus, maybe there's a connection. But how does that tie to his testimony?

Hmm. Maybe Evidence 24: Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender. If the matches are from Tres Bien, and they're in Tigre's office, that suggests someone from Tender Lender was at Tres Bien. But Tigre's testimony says he was in his office all day. So if the matches were brought back, maybe he or someone else went there. But the matches could have been brought by anyone. Not sure.

Wait, the repair bill (Evidence 25) is paid to Cadaverini. If the Cadaverinis are involved, but Tigre's testimony doesn't mention them, that's not a direct contradiction.

Another angle: Testimony 3 says he has whales borrowing every day. But Evidence 27 is Viola's medical bill of 1 million due last year. If Viola is part of Tender Lender (Violetta → Viola Cadaverini), maybe she couldn't pay and that's a problem for Tigre's claim of having big clients. But that's indirect.

Wait, the Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2) from Dec 5th says the attorney (fake) lost the case. The Paper Badge (26) found at Tender Lender suggests Tigre was impersonating the attorney. If Tigre was posing as the attorney on Dec 3rd (the day of the incident), but his Testimony 1 says he was in his office all day in December, that's a contradiction. Because if he was impersonating Phoenix on Dec 3rd at the trial, he couldn't have been in his office. So Evidence 2 (Magazine Clipping) from Dec 5th says the trial was on that date, but Testimony 1 says he was in the office all of December. Wait, but the trial where Maggey was convicted would have been after the incident. The incident was Dec 3rd, the trial probably happened later. Wait, the Magazine Clipping is from Dec 5th, which says the attorney was trounced and client found guilty. So if Tigre was impersonating Phoenix during that trial on Dec 5th, but his Testimony 1 says he was in the office all of December last year (assuming December of the same year), that would mean he couldn't have been in court. So Evidence 2 contradicts Testimony 1. Because if he was in court as the fake attorney, he wasn't in his office all day in December. That seems like a solid contradiction.

Yes, that makes sense. Testimony 1 is Tigre claiming he was in his office all of December. But the Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2) shows that on Dec 5th, the fake attorney (Tigre) was in court, which would mean he wasn't in his office that day. Therefore, Evidence 2 contradicts Testimony 1.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 1}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Let me start by going through each testimony and checking the evidence that might contradict it.

First, looking at the testimonies given by Tigre. Testimony 2 says he set up a meeting with Glen Elg at Tender Lender. Testimony 3 claims he waited but Glen never showed. Then, Testimony 4 states he's never been to Tres Bien. Now, checking the evidence, Evidence 20 is Glen's calendar which notes "Meet with The Tiger" on Dec 3rd. The Tiger is Furio Tigre's nickname. So, if Glen had a meeting scheduled with Tigre at Tender Lender, but according to Evidence 24, Tres Bien matches were found at Tender Lender. Wait, no, maybe another angle. 

Wait, Evidence 20 shows that Glen had a meeting scheduled with "The Tiger" (Tigre) on the day of the incident. However, Tigre's Testimony 3 says Glen didn't show up. But Evidence 23 is the MC Bomber disc found at Tender Lender, which is linked to the crime. Hmm. Let me check again.

Wait, Evidence 20 is Glen's calendar note about meeting The Tiger. But Tigre in Testimony 2 says he set up the meeting at Tender Lender. However, Evidence 24 are Tres Bien matches found at Tender Lender. If Tres Bien matches are at Tender Lender, that might imply someone from Tres Bien was there. But Tigre's Testimony 4 says he's never been to Tres Bien. But if the matches from Tres Bien are in his office (Tender Lender), that could mean he was there, contradicting his testimony. So, Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender) contradicts Testimony 4 where Tigre claims he never went to Tres Bien. Because if the matches are from Tres Bien and found in his office, maybe he brought them there, implying he was at Tres Bien. But wait, the matches could have been brought by someone else. Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and 3 and another evidence. Let me check.

Wait, Glen's calendar (Evidence 20) says he was supposed to meet The Tiger on Dec 3rd. But in Testimony 3, Tigre says he waited but Glen didn't show. However, the victim (Glen) died between 1:30 and 2:30 PM (Evidence 10). The meeting at Tender Lender would be the same day. If Glen died at Tres Bien during lunch, he couldn't have gone to Tender Lender. So perhaps the meeting was at Tres Bien? But the calendar note says "Meet with The Tiger". If the meeting was actually at Tres Bien, then Tigre's Testimony 2 about setting up the meeting at Tender Lender would be contradicted by Glen's calendar. But maybe the calendar note is correct, so Tigre is lying about the meeting location. Alternatively, the victim intended to meet Tigre at Tender Lender but ended up at Tres Bien. Wait, but how does that connect?

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 4 where Tigre says he's never been to Tres Bien. But Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender) could imply that someone from Tender Lender (like Tigre) obtained the matches from Tres Bien. If Tigre claims he's never been there, but the matches are present in his office, that suggests he was there. Therefore, Evidence 24 contradicts Testimony 4. That seems plausible. So the pair would be Evidence 24 and Testimony 4. Let me confirm that. The matches from Tres Bien are found in Tender Lender, Tigre's place, which he runs. If he never went to Tres Bien, how did the matches get there? Unless someone else brought them, but maybe the contradiction is that he had to have been there to get the matches. Alternatively, the matches could have been brought by Glen. But Glen was supposed to meet Tigre at Tender Lender. If Glen had the matches, maybe he took them from Tres Bien to Tender Lender, but he died at Tres Bien. Hmm. The key is that Tigre says he's never been to Tres Bien, but the presence of Tres Bien matches in his office suggests otherwise. Therefore, the contradiction is Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches at Tender Lender) and Testimony 4 (Tigre never went to Tres Bien). That's the pair.

{"evidence": 24, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's see. I need to find a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. Let me start by going through the testimonies and evidences one by one.

First, the testimonies are all from Tigre (Testimony 0 to 3). Let's look at his statements. Testimony 3 says he left the scene because he thought the place would be hot (probably meaning the police would come), and he heard the sirens on his way out. Then he went straight back to his office.

Now, checking the evidences. Evidence 24 is Tres Bien Matches found in Tender Lender. But maybe more relevant is Evidence 23: MC Bomber, a sample disc found at Tender Lender. Evidence 20 is Glen's calendar with a note to meet "The Tiger" on Dec 3rd. Since Tigre is known as "The Tiger" (Evidence 10), that suggests Glen was supposed to meet Tigre that day. 

Wait, in Testimony 0, Tigre says he was supposed to meet "the kid" at the restaurant. If "the kid" is Glen Elg, then according to his testimony, he was there for the meeting. But according to Evidence 20, Glen had a meeting with "The Tiger" (Tigre) scheduled. So if Tigre went to the restaurant for the meeting, but then left before the police arrived, maybe there's a contradiction.

But where's the contradiction with evidence? Let me check the timing. The victim died between 1:30 and 2:30 PM (Evidence 10). The Millionaire Radio Flyer (Evidence 19) mentions an event every Monday at 1:30 PM. The incident was on Dec 3rd, which might be a Monday. So maybe Tigre's alibi is that he left when he heard the sirens, but the repair bill (Evidence 25) shows he paid the Cadaverini family, possibly for something related. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 3 where Tigre says he heard the cops' sirens on his way out and went straight back to his office. But Evidence 24 is Tres Bien matches found at Tender Lender (Tigre's place). If Tres Bien matches are at Tender Lender, that could indicate someone from Tres Bien was there. But how does that contradict Tigre's testimony?

Wait, maybe the Paper Badge (Evidence 26) found at Tender Lender. If Tigre made a fake badge, maybe he was impersonating someone. But how does that tie in with his testimony?

Wait another angle: The victim's prescription bag (Evidence 17) is empty. The small bottle (Evidence 6) is the victim's ear medicine. If the victim took his medicine before dying, but the bag is empty, maybe that's a clue. But not directly related to Tigre's testimony.

Looking back at Tigre's Testimony 3: He left when he heard the sirens. But the murder happened between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. The police would have been called after the murder. If the sirens were heard by Tigre as he left, but the body was discovered at the time, perhaps the timeline doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe the problem is that Tigre claims he left when he heard the sirens, but the crime photo (Evidence 12) shows the scene. The coffee cup is knocked over, but according to the autopsy, it's potassium cyanide in the coffee. The coffee cup has Maggey's fingerprints, but if Tigre was there, maybe his presence is contradicted by some evidence.

Alternatively, look at Evidence 3: Sports Paper from Dec 3rd with 'MC Bomber' and 100,000 crossed out, and laughing face. MC Bomber is a virus (Evidence 23) at Tender Lender. If Glen was meeting Tigre (The Tiger) as per Evidence 20, and MC Bomber is linked to Tigre's company, maybe Tigre was involved in some plot. But how does this contradict his testimony?

Wait, Testimony 3: Tigre says he went straight back to his office after hearing the sirens. But Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender) could imply that he was at Tres Bien and brought matches back, but his testimony says he left immediately. But that's a stretch.

Another angle: Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) has a doodle about MC Bomber and 100,000 crossed out. If that refers to the virus which is a 100k debt, maybe related to Jean's loan (Evidence 8: 500k). But not sure.

Wait, looking at the MC Bomber disc (Evidence 23) found at Tender Lender. It's a virus program. If Tigre used that to extort money or something, maybe Glen was involved. But how does that tie into the testimony?

Alternatively, the Repair Bill (Evidence 25) paid by Tigre to Cadaverini for $15k. If Tigre needed to pay them, maybe he had a motive. But how does this contradict his testimony?

Wait, going back to Testimony 3 where Tigre claims he went straight back to his office. However, Evidence 24 (matches from Tres Bien found at Tender Lender) could indicate that someone from Tender Lender was at Tres Bien. If Tigre was there, maybe he left the matches, but his testimony doesn't mention anything about that. Hmm, maybe not a direct contradiction.

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Tigre's testimony about the timing and the presence of the Paper Badge (Evidence 26) at Tender Lender. The Paper Badge is a fake attorney badge. If Tigre was impersonating someone (like the phony Phoenix Wright who framed Maggey), then he might have been at the scene. But how does that contradict his testimony?

Alternatively, consider that the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) was left by a customer on Dec 3rd. The doodle on it mentions 'MC Bomber' and 100k crossed out. The MC Bomber virus (Evidence 23) is a sample disc at Tender Lender. If Tigre is behind the MC Bomber, then maybe the crossed-out 100k refers to a failed extortion. But if Tigre's testimony says he went back to his office, but the MC Bomber is at his office, that's not a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 3 and Evidence 24. Testimony 3 says he went straight back to his office after leaving the scene. But Evidence 24 is Tres Bien matches found at his office (Tender Lender). If he went straight back, then the matches would have been brought there by him, implying he was at Tres Bien. But maybe there's a contradiction in his alibi. Wait, no, because he was at Tres Bien for the meeting. So he could have taken the matches then. That might not be a contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 0: Tigre says he was supposed to meet "the kid" (Glen) at Tres Bien. But according to Evidence 20 (Glen's calendar), he had a meeting with "The Tiger" (Tigre) that day. So that's consistent. But maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Wait, the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is the victim's ear medicine with unidentified fingerprints. If Tigre handled it, his fingerprints would be there. But unless we have his prints, we can't link that. Not directly a contradiction.

Another angle: Evidence 7 (Scooter) ridden by the phony (the fake Phoenix). If Tigre was the phony, then the scooter's wheel guard being smashed could indicate a crash. If Tigre had to leave quickly, maybe the scooter was used. But how does that contradict his testimony?

Wait, Testimony 3 says Tigre heard the sirens on his way out. But the police arrived after the murder. If the murder occurred between 1:30-2:30 PM, and the radio flyer (Evidence 19) is at 1:30 PM on Mondays. If Dec 3 was a Monday, then the timeline is that the victim was poisoned during or after the event. The police would have been called after the death, so Tigre hearing sirens as he left would make sense. But maybe the Repair Bill (Evidence 25) shows that Tigre paid the Cadaverini family $15k, which could be a motive. But how does that contradict his testimony?

Hmm. Maybe the contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 3 (he went straight back to his office) and Evidence 24 (Tres Bien matches found at Tender Lender). If the matches are from Tres Bien and found at his office, that's expected if he was there. Not necessarily a contradiction.

Wait, let's think of the timeline again. The victim died between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. The lunch special (Evidence 5) is served at Tres Bien. The crime photo shows the coffee cup knocked over. The coffee had cyanide (Evidence 13), and the poison was in Maggey's apron (Evidence 16). But the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is the victim's ear medicine with unknown fingerprints. If Tigre was there, maybe he tampered with the medicine. But without his prints on the bottle, not sure.

Alternatively, looking at the Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2) from Dec 5th, which says Phoenix was trounced and client guilty. That case was Maggey's, which was a setup. The phony attorney (Tigre using the Paper Badge) framed her. So if Tigre was the fake attorney, then his Testimony 0-3 might conflict with that. For example, if he was posing as Phoenix during the trial, but his testimony is about being at the restaurant. But how does that directly contradict?

Wait, in Testimony 3, Tigre says he went straight back to his office. But the Paper Badge (Evidence 26) is found at Tender Lender, implying he used it to impersonate Phoenix. If he was the one who posed as Phoenix in court, then his presence at the crime scene (as per his testimony) and then going back to his office to hide the badge. But how does that contradict?

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 3 and Evidence 3 (Sports Paper). The Sports Paper from Dec 3rd has a doodle that says 'MC Bomber' with 100k crossed out. If Tigre was involved in the MC Bomber virus (Evidence 23), which was a plan to extort money, and the crossed-out 100k suggests the plan failed or changed. But how does that relate to his testimony?

Wait, the victim's lottery ticket (Evidence 14) is for half a million, found on Maggey. Jean's loan (Evidence 8) is half a million. If the victim had the winning ticket, maybe Tigre wanted to steal it. If Tigre met the victim to get the ticket, killed him, and framed Maggey. But how does that contradict his testimony?

Alternatively, looking at the victim's autopsy (Evidence 10) and the coffee cup (Evidence 13). The poison was in the coffee, which had Maggey's prints. But if Tigre was the one who poisoned the coffee, how? Maybe he had access. But again, not a direct contradiction with his testimony.

Wait, maybe the key contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 3 (hearing sirens and leaving) and the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) which was left by a customer on Dec 3rd. The doodle on the paper includes 'MC Bomber' pointing to 100k crossed out. If 'MC Bomber' refers to the virus (Evidence 23) that was part of a plan, perhaps Tigre's presence at the scene contradicts that. But I'm not seeing the direct link.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 20 (Glen's calendar note to meet The Tiger) and Testimony 0 (Tigre says he was supposed to meet the kid). That seems consistent, but maybe the time is conflicting. If the meeting was at a certain time, but the murder occurred during that window. But how?

Wait, the victim's prescription bag (Evidence 17) is empty. The Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is his ear medicine. If the victim took the medicine, which was replaced with poison, but the fingerprints on the bottle are unknown. If Tigre's fingerprints are there, but his testimony says he didn't touch it. But we don't have his prints to compare.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 3 where he says he went straight back to his office, but Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender) suggests he was at Tres Bien, which is the crime scene. But that's not a contradiction; he was there for the meeting.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again. The user wants one pair where the evidence contradicts the testimony.

Looking at Testimony 3: "I figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split. I heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office."

Evidence 19: Millionaire Radio Flyer - event every Monday at 1:30 PM. If the incident happened on Dec 3rd (a Monday), the event was at 1:30 PM. The victim's time of death is 1:30-2:30 PM. If the police were called after the death, then the sirens would have been after 1:30 PM. But if Tigre left when he heard the sirens, that would be after the murder. However, Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) from Dec 3rd has a doodle that says 'MC Bomber' with 100k crossed out. The MC Bomber virus is at Tender Lender (Tigre's place). If Tigre had to leave quickly, but the virus disc was already there, maybe there's a timing issue. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 3 says Tigre heard the sirens on his way out and went straight to his office. However, Evidence 25 (Repair Bill) shows Tigre paid $15k to the Cadaverini family. If this payment was related to covering up the crime, maybe the repair was for the scooter (Evidence 7) that the phony used. The Scooter's wheel guard is smashed, implying a crash. If Tigre had to pay for repairs, but his testimony says he went straight back to the office, how did the repair happen? But the bill is paid by Tigre, which could be done later. Not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, the victim's lottery ticket (Evidence 14) worth half a million was found on Maggey. Jean's loan (Evidence 8) is also half a million. If Tigre was involved in framing Maggey to get the ticket, then the ticket's presence on her contradicts Tigre's testimony that he left the scene. But how?

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Tigre's Testimony 3 and Evidence 24. If the matches from Tres Bien are found at Tender Lender (Tigre's office), then he must have brought them there. If his testimony says he went straight back to the office after leaving the crime scene, then it's possible. But that's not a contradiction. Unless there's a time discrepancy.

Alternatively, the repair bill (Evidence 25) is dated after the incident, but Tigre's testimony doesn't mention anything about that. Not a direct contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 0 and Evidence 20. Testimony 0 says he was supposed to meet "the kid" (Glen) at Tres Bien. Evidence 20 (Glen's calendar) notes meeting "The Tiger" on Dec 3rd. That's consistent. So no contradiction there.

Another thought: The MC Bomber disc (Evidence 23) is a virus. If Tigre used it to cause some financial damage, maybe to Blue Screens, Inc. (Lisa Basil's company), which Glen worked for. If Glen was meeting Tigre to discuss the virus or blackmail, then Tigre's presence at the meeting is part of the plan. But how does this contradict his testimony?

Alternatively, the victim's autopsy report says potassium cyanide poisoning. The poison was found in Maggey's apron (Evidence 16), but the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) with the victim's medicine has unknown fingerprints. If those prints are Tigre's, that contradicts his testimony that he didn't touch anything. But without knowing the prints, can't confirm.

Wait, maybe the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) has a doodle that says 'MC Bomber' with 100k crossed out. The MC Bomber virus (Evidence 23) is at Tender Lender. If Tigre was using the virus to extort 100k, but it's crossed out, perhaps the plan changed. If the victim was meeting Tigre to pay the 100k but was killed instead, then the crossed-out 100k could indicate that the plan failed. But how does this contradict Tigre's testimony?

I'm struggling to find a clear contradiction. Let me try a different approach. Look for a testimony that says something impossible given the evidence.

Tigre's Testimony 3: He heard the sirens on his way out and went straight back to his office.

But Evidence 26: Paper Badge found at Tender Lender. The badge is a fake attorney badge. If Tigre used this to impersonate Phoenix Wright during Maggey's trial (as per Evidence 2 where Phoenix lost the case), then he must have been in court posing as Phoenix. But his testimony is about being at the crime scene. However, the trial would be after the investigation. So timing-wise, maybe he couldn't be at both places. But the testimony is about the day of the incident (Dec 3rd), while the trial would be later. So no direct contradiction.

Wait, the Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2) is from Dec 5th, saying Phoenix lost the case. So the trial was after the incident. If Tigre impersonated Phoenix during the trial, that's after Dec 3rd, so his testimony about the incident day doesn't conflict with that.

Alternatively, the Scooter (Evidence 7) ridden by the phony (Tigre) has a smashed wheel guard. If he crashed it while fleeing the scene, but his testimony says he left when he heard sirens and went straight back. If the scooter was damaged in the crash, that would mean he had to go somewhere else first, contradicting his testimony of going straight back. But there's no evidence directly linking the scooter to Tigre's movements that day. Unless the repair bill (Evidence 25) is for the scooter's repairs. If the scooter belongs to Tigre and was repaired by Cadaverini, then the repair bill would be linked. But the testimony says he went straight back to the office, but the scooter's damage suggests he had an accident, meaning he didn't go straight back. That would be a contradiction between Testimony 3 and Evidence 7 or 25.

But the Repair Bill (Evidence 25) is for a car repair, not a scooter. So maybe not directly related.

Hmm. Maybe the key contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 3 and Evidence 3. The Sports Paper (Evidence 3) from Dec 3rd has a doodle that includes 'MC Bomber' with 100k crossed out. If 'MC Bomber' refers to the virus Tigre used, and the 100k was the amount he demanded, but it's crossed out, perhaps indicating the plan changed. If Tigre was at the scene to collect the 100k but killed the victim instead, his testimony about leaving when he heard sirens might conflict. But how?

Alternatively, consider that the victim's Lottery Ticket (Evidence 14) is worth 500k, which is the same amount as Jean's loan (Evidence 8). If Tigre killed the victim to steal the ticket, but it ended up in Maggey's possession, that suggests the ticket was planted on her. If Tigre was the one who framed her, then his testimony about leaving the scene might conflict with the fact that he had to plant the ticket. But the ticket was found during a body search of Maggey, which would be after the arrest. So if Tigre left the scene when the police arrived, he couldn't have planted it then. Therefore, the ticket must have been planted earlier. But how does that contradict his testimony?

I'm going in circles. Let me try to pick the most likely pair. 

Testimony 3 from Tigre says he heard the sirens and went straight back to his office. Evidence 24 is Tres Bien matches found at Tender Lender. If the matches were from the crime scene, and Tigre took them to his office, that's consistent with him being there. Not a contradiction.

Wait, another angle: The Sports Paper (Evidence 3) was left by a customer on Dec 3rd. The doodle on it includes 'Ahahahaha' and a laughing face. If this is Tigre's doing, maybe he left it, which would mean he was at Tres Bien before the incident. But his testimony says he came for the meeting, saw the body, and left. If the Sports Paper was left by him earlier, but the testimony doesn't mention that. Not a contradiction.

Alternatively, the MC Bomber disc (Evidence 23) at Tender Lender has the name written in marker. If Tigre wrote that, and the Sports Paper's doodle also references MC Bomber, then there's a connection. But how does that contradict his testimony?

Perhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 20. Evidence 20 is Glen's calendar entry to meet "The Tiger" on Dec 3. Testimony 0 says Tigre was supposed to meet the kid (Glen) at the restaurant. If Tigre was there for the meeting, and then left after seeing the body, but the calendar entry proves the meeting was scheduled, but the actual meeting didn't happen because Glen was dead. But if Tigre arrived and found Glen dead, that's possible. So no contradiction.

Wait, but the autopsy says time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. If the meeting was scheduled for, say, 1 PM, and Tigre arrived after the murder, but his testimony says he was there for the meeting. That could mean he arrived after Glen was already dead, which is possible. Not a contradiction.

Hmm. This is tough. Maybe I need to look at another testimony. Testimony 2 from Tigre says the victim was laid out on the table. The Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows the victim collapsed on the table with a coffee cup. The Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has Maggey's fingerprints. If Tigre saw the victim dead, but the coffee cup was there, which Maggey served, then maybe the cup's presence is expected. No contradiction.

Wait, but the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) has unidentified fingerprints. If Tigre handled it, but his testimony doesn't mention touching anything, that's a contradiction. But unless we know the fingerprints are his, we can't say. The evidence doesn't state whose prints are on the bottle.

Another angle: The victim had a meeting with Tigre (Evidence 20). The victim's prescription bag (Evidence 17) is empty, implying he took his medicine. If the medicine was substituted with poison by Tigre during the meeting, but Tigre's testimony says he saw the victim already dead and left. But without evidence of when the medicine was taken, hard to say.

I think the most plausible contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 3 (he left when he heard sirens and went straight back) and Evidence 24 (Tres Bien matches found at Tender Lender). If the matches were from Tres Bien and found at his office, but he claims he went straight back, implying he didn't have time to plant the matches there. Wait, no. If he took the matches from Tres Bien during his visit and then went to his office, that's plausible. So no contradiction.

Maybe Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) and Testimony 3. The Sports Paper's doodle mentions 'MC Bomber' and 100k crossed out. If Tigre's plan was to extort 100k using the virus, but he ended up killing the victim, the crossed-out amount suggests the plan changed. But how does this contradict his testimony?

Alternatively, the Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2) says Phoenix lost the case on Dec 5th. Since the real Phoenix wasn't there (it was a phony), and the phony is Tigre using the Paper Badge (Evidence 26). Therefore, Tigre must have been in court on Dec 5th, but his testimony is about Dec 3rd. No direct contradiction.

I'm stuck. Let me look for the most obvious contradiction. Maybe Testimony 3 says he heard the sirens on his way out, but the crime photo (Evidence 12) shows that the view from the entrance is obstructed and only saw the patio (from Floor Plans, Evidence 11). So if Tigre entered and saw the body, but the entrance view is obstructed, he couldn't have seen the body from the entrance. Wait, Testimony 1 says "When I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene." But the Floor Plans (Evidence 11) state that the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. Therefore, Tigre's Testimony 1 contradicts Evidence 11. Because if the entrance view is obstructed, he couldn't have seen the body when he opened the door. The crime photo also shows the victim's table is behind a folding screen, so not visible from the entrance. Therefore, Tigre's Testimony 1 is contradicted by Evidence 11 (Floor Plans) or Evidence 12 (Crime Photo). 

Ah, this makes sense. Tigre says when he opened the door, he saw the scene. But the floor plans say the view from the entrance is obstructed and only the patio is visible. The crime photo shows the victim's table is behind a folding screen, not visible from the entrance. Therefore, Tigre couldn't have seen the victim's body upon entering, contradicting his Testimony 1. But Testimony 1 is the second testimony in the list (Testimony 1: "When I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene." Person: Tigre). The evidence that contradicts this is Evidence 11 (Tres Bien Floor Plans) which says the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. So the pair would be Evidence 11 and Testimony 1. But wait, the user provided evidences up to 27, and testimonies up to Testimony 4. Let me check the indices.

Evidence 11 is Tres Bien Floor Plans. Testimony 1 is Tigre's testimony about seeing the scene upon opening the door. So the JSON would be {"evidence": 11, "testimony": 1}.

But the user said to answer one pair and output in JSON. This seems like a valid contradiction. Because according to the floor plans, you can't see the victim's table from the entrance, but Tigre claims he saw the body as soon as he opened the door. That's a clear contradiction.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 1}
Okay, let's tackle this problem. We need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user has provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Our goal is to identify one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a statement in the testimony.

First, I'll start by going through the testimonies. The testimonies from Tigre (Testimonies 0-7) are key here. Let's look at each one and see if any evidence contradicts his statements.

Testimony 0: Tigre says he loaned Elg $100,000. Looking at the evidence, there's Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) which mentions a meeting with "The Tiger" on Dec 3rd. That matches since Tigre is known as "The Tiger". Also, Evidence 8 (Jean's Loan Contract) shows Tender Lender (Tigre's company) is involved in a loan, but that's Jean's, not Glen's. However, Evidence 20 supports that Glen had a meeting with Tigre, which might relate to a loan. So maybe no contradiction here yet.

Testimony 1: Tigre states they were due to chat because Glen hit his payback date. Evidence 20 again supports the meeting. No contradiction here.

Testimony 2: Tigre says Glen couldn't pay up. But Evidence 14 (Victim's Lottery Ticket) shows Glen had a winning ticket for half a million. If he couldn't pay, why didn't he use the ticket? Wait, but Tigre's Testimony 4 says Glen won the lottery, so he could pay. So Testimony 2 says Glen had no way to pay, but then Testimony 4 says he won. Hmm, but that's part of Tigre's story. Maybe Tigre's Testimony 2 and 4 are part of his narrative that Glen initially couldn't pay but then won the lottery. So maybe no contradiction here. But let's check evidence related to the loan amount.

Evidence 20's note is "Meet with The Tiger". Also, Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) has a doodle with 'MC Bomber' pointing to '100,000' crossed out. Tigre's Testimony 0 says he loaned Elg $100k. Then in Testimony 4, he says Glen won half a million. So if Glen owed Tigre $100k, the lottery ticket (half a million) would cover that. So why would Tigre kill him? According to Tigre's Testimony 5, if Maggey hadn't killed Glen, his business would be over, implying he could collect the money. But Evidence 14 shows the lottery ticket was found on Maggey. Wait, if Glen had the winning ticket, but it was found on Maggey, maybe she took it. But Tigre's Testimony 4 says Glen won, which would mean he had the ticket. But if Maggey had it, that's a problem. Wait, the Evidence 14 says the ticket was found during a body search of Maggey. So Maggey had the ticket. That contradicts Tigre's Testimony 4 where he says Glen won. Because if Glen won, he should have the ticket, but Maggey had it. Therefore, this could be a contradiction. Let me check the details.

Testimony 4 by Tigre: "He got lucky, you know. Real lucky." He's referring to Glen winning the lottery. But Evidence 14 says the ticket was found on Maggey. So if Glen had the ticket, how did it end up with Maggey? Unless Tigre is lying about Glen winning. But the ticket is a winning one. So maybe Tigre knew about the ticket and killed Glen to take it, but Maggey ended up with it. However, Tigre's Testimony 5 and 6 suggest that Maggey's action (killing Glen) ended his business, implying he didn't get the money. So if the ticket was found on Maggey, that would mean Tigre didn't get it. But according to his Testimony 4, Glen had the ticket, but Evidence 14 shows it's on Maggey. So this could be a contradiction. But let me check other possibilities.

Looking at Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) notes a meeting with The Tiger (Tigre) on Dec 3rd. Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) from Dec 3rd has a doodle with 'MC Bomber' and 100k crossed out, which might relate to the loan amount. Tigre's Testimony 0 says he loaned Elg 100k. Then Testimony 4 says Glen won 500k. So if Glen had the ticket, he could pay back the 100k. But the ticket was found on Maggey, which suggests she took it. So Tigre's Testimony 4 claiming that Glen won would be true (since the ticket exists), but how did Maggey get it? Maybe she took it after killing him. But Tigre's Testimony 5 and 6 imply that Maggey's action (killing Glen) ended his business. If Tigre wanted the money, he needed Glen alive to cash the ticket. If Glen was dead, maybe the ticket's ownership is unclear, but if Maggey had it, perhaps she stole it. But this might not directly contradict Tigre's testimony.

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 7 by Tigre: "I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!" But Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) shows he was meeting with Tigre. If Tigre's plan was to collect the 100k, and Glen had the lottery ticket, then Tigre would have a motive to kill Glen to take the ticket. Because the ticket is worth 500k, which is more than the 100k owed. So Tigre's claim that he only wanted the 100k and had no other reason is contradicted by the presence of the 500k ticket, giving him a larger motive. But how does the evidence tie in here? The ticket is found on Maggey, but if Tigre knew about it, he would have a stronger motive. However, the contradiction here is that Tigre says he had no other reason, but the existence of the ticket gives him a bigger reason. But is that a direct contradiction? Maybe not, because he could be lying about his motive.

Another angle: Evidence 23 (MC Bomber) is a disc with a computer virus found at Tender Lender. The Sports Paper (Evidence 3) mentions 'MC Bomber' with 100k crossed out. If 'MC Bomber' is related to the virus, maybe Tigre was involved in some scheme. But how does this tie into the testimonies?

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 7 where Tigre claims he only wanted the 100k. But Evidence 20's note about meeting "The Tiger" on Dec 3rd, and Evidence 3's doodle with 'MC Bomber' and 100k. If the 'MC Bomber' refers to the virus disc (Evidence 23), which is a virus program, maybe Tigre was involved in a plan to get more money through the virus, which contradicts his claim of only wanting 100k. However, the link here is not direct.

Wait, Evidence 21 (Losing Horse Racing Tickets) in Glen's desk shows he had over 500 tickets. This might indicate he was in debt due to gambling, which could explain needing a loan. But Tigre's loan was 100k, but Glen's lottery win was 500k. So he could have paid off the loan. But the ticket was found on Maggey. If Tigre knew Glen had the ticket, he might have killed him to take it, which is a bigger motive than the 100k. Therefore, Tigre's Testimony 7, where he says he had no other reason than the 100k, is contradicted by the existence of the 500k ticket, giving him a larger motive. But how is this directly linked via evidence?

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Tigre's Testimony 0 where he says he loaned Elg $100k and another evidence. Wait, Evidence 8 is Jean's loan contract for half a million. But that's Jean's, not Glen's. So maybe not. Alternatively, Evidence 20's note of meeting "The Tiger" and Evidence 3's 100k crossed out. If Tigre's Testimony 0 says he loaned 100k, but the crossed out 100k and the lottery ticket of 500k suggests that maybe the debt was higher. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, Testimony 7 by Tigre: He claims he was after the $100k and had no other reason. But Evidence 25 (Repair Bill) shows Tigre paid $15k to the Cadaverini Family. If Tigre owed money to the mob, he might need more funds, giving him a motive beyond the 100k. But how does this tie in? The repair bill is for a car, paid to the Cadaverinis. But that's a stretch.

Wait, let's look at Testimony 5 and 6 from Tigre: He says that if Maggey hadn't killed Glen, his business would have been over. But if Glen had the 500k ticket, Tigre could have collected the 100k and let Glen keep the rest. But with Glen dead, maybe the ticket is useless unless someone else can claim it. If Maggey had the ticket, perhaps she could claim it, but Tigre would have a motive to get it from her. However, this is getting too convoluted.

Back to the original thought: Testimony 4 by Tigre says Glen won the lottery (500k), but Evidence 14 shows the ticket was found on Maggey. If Tigre is claiming that Glen had the ticket, but the evidence shows Maggey had it, that's a contradiction. Because Tigre says Glen won, implying the ticket was with Glen, but it's found on Maggey. However, maybe Glen gave the ticket to Maggey, but that's not addressed. Alternatively, if Tigre is lying about Glen having the ticket, but the ticket is real and a winning one, then perhaps Tigre killed Glen to take the ticket, but Maggey ended up with it. But how does that directly contradict a testimony?

Alternatively, Testimony 6: "Thanks to what she did, my business with that kid was over!" If Maggey killed Glen, then Tigre couldn't collect the debt, but he says his business was over because of her action. But if Glen had the 500k ticket, Tigre could have taken it as payment. So maybe Tigre's Testimony 6 is contradicted by Evidence 14, because if Maggey had the ticket, Tigre's business wasn't over; he could go after Maggey for the ticket. But this is more of a motive inconsistency than a direct contradiction.

Wait, let's check Evidence 14 again: Victim's Lottery Ticket found during a body search of Maggey. So Maggey had the ticket on her. If Glen had won the lottery, he should have the ticket. But how did Maggey get it? Maybe she took it after he died. But according to Tigre's Testimony 4, Glen had the ticket. So if the ticket was found on Maggey, that suggests she took it, which contradicts Tigre's statement that Glen had it. But wait, Tigre's Testimony 4 is "He got lucky...", which implies that Glen won, but doesn't explicitly say he had the ticket on him. Maybe Glen had the ticket but Maggey took it after poisoning him. That's possible, but does that create a contradiction? Not directly. Because Tigre's testimony doesn't state that the ticket was on Glen's person, only that he won. The evidence shows Maggey had it, which could be after the fact.

Hmm. Maybe another angle. Let's look at Testimony 7 where Tigre says he only wanted the $100k. However, Evidence 14's lottery ticket is worth $500k, which is a much larger sum. If Tigre knew about the ticket, he would have a stronger motive to kill Glen to take it, contradicting his claim that he only wanted the $100k. But does any evidence directly show that Tigre knew about the ticket? Evidence 3's sports paper has a doodle referring to 'MC Bomber' and 100k crossed out, which might be related. But how?

Alternatively, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) notes the meeting with "The Tiger" on the day of the incident. If the meeting was about the loan, and Glen had the lottery ticket, Tigre would know about it. Therefore, Tigre's claim in Testimony 7 that he had no other reason than the 100k is contradicted by the existence of the 500k ticket, which he would have been aware of. Therefore, his testimony is contradicted by Evidence 14. But the user's question is about evidence and testimony that directly contradict each other. So the contradiction would be between Tigre's Testimony 7 (no other reason) and Evidence 14 (lottery ticket worth 500k), implying a larger motive. But does this count as a direct contradiction?

Alternatively, Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) has a doodle with 'MC Bomber' and 100k crossed out, which might indicate that the debt was settled (crossed out), but Tigre's Testimony 0 says he loaned Elg 100k. If the 100k was crossed out, maybe the debt was paid or canceled, contradicting Tigre's claim that he loaned the money. But the doodle's meaning is unclear. However, if the 100k is crossed out, it might mean the debt was resolved, but Tigre is still claiming he loaned it. That could be a contradiction. Let me check Evidence 3's description: "Dated Dec 3rd, the day of the incident. On it is a doodle that said 'MC Bomber' with an arrow pointing to '100,000' that was crossed out. 'Ahahahaha' and a laughing face are written next to it." The crossed-out 100k could imply that the 100k debt was no longer an issue, perhaps because Glen had the lottery ticket. So if Tigre's Testimony 0 says he loaned Elg 100k, but the crossed-out 100k on the same day suggests the debt was resolved, that would contradict his statement. But Testimony 0 is about loaning, not about the current status. The contradiction would be if the debt was already paid, but Tigre says he loaned it. However, the crossed-out 100k might not necessarily mean it was paid; it could be a plan or something else.

Alternatively, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) has a note to meet "The Tiger" (Tigre) on Dec 3rd. Tigre's Testimony 1 says they were due to have a chat because Glen hit his payback date. This aligns, so no contradiction here.

Wait, another angle: Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) is the victim's ear medicine, found in the kitchen with unidentified fingerprints. The autopsy report (Evidence 10) says death by potassium cyanide. The coffee cup (Evidence 13) has Maggey's and the victim's prints. But the poison was found in her apron (Evidence 16). However, Maggey's conviction is phony, so maybe the real killer is someone else. But how does this tie into Tigre's testimonies?

Alternatively, Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony) says he broke the vase. Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) shows two vases intact. Wait, no: Evidence 12's description says there's an intact vase on each table. But Victor's Testimony says he broke the vase at his seat. So that's a contradiction. But Victor's Testimony is Testimony 18, and the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows intact vases. So that's a contradiction between Evidence 12 and Testimony 18. But the user is asking for one pair. However, the user specified that the answer must be from the given testimonies and evidences. But Testimony 18 is from Victor, not Tigre, but the user didn't restrict to Tigre. Wait, the user provided all testimonies, including Victor's. But the question is to find any evidence and testimony that contradict each other. So in this case, Evidence 12 (Crime Photo showing intact vases) and Testimony 18 (Victor saying he broke the vase) would contradict. That's a valid pair. But the user's example answer used evidence 2 and testimony 3, but I'm supposed to find one pair. However, the user's question didn't specify to focus on Tigre's testimonies, but all testimonies. So this is another possible pair. But perhaps the intended answer is between Tigre's testimony and the lottery ticket.

Alternatively, looking back at Tigre's Testimony 4: "He got lucky, you know. Real lucky." If Glen won the lottery, the ticket should be with him. But Evidence 14 says it was found on Maggey. So how did she get it? If Glen had it, and then Maggey took it after his death, that's possible. But Tigre's Testimony 4 implies that Glen had the ticket, but the evidence shows Maggey had it. So if Tigre was present when Glen won, he would know Glen had the ticket. But if the ticket was found on Maggey, that suggests she took it, which could mean Tigre is lying about Glen having it, or that the ticket was moved. However, this might not be a direct contradiction unless Tigre explicitly states that the ticket was in Glen's possession.

Alternatively, Evidence 14 is a winning ticket found on Maggey, which contradicts Tigre's Testimony 5 and 6 where he implies that Maggey's action (killing Glen) ended his business, but if Maggey had the ticket, Tigre could go after her for the money. So his business wouldn't be over. Therefore, Testimony 6 is contradicted by Evidence 14. But Testimony 6 says "Thanks to what she did, my business with that kid was over!" But if the ticket is with Maggey, Tigre's business could continue by pursuing her. So his statement that it's over is contradicted by the existence of the ticket. But this is more of a logical inconsistency than a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 7: Tigre claims he had no other reason to kill Glen except the $100k. But Evidence 25 (Repair Bill) shows Tigre paid $15k to the Cadaverini Family. If Tigre owed money to the mob, he might need more funds, giving him another motive. But this is indirect.

Wait, another possibility: Testimony 5 by Tigre: "If that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over." He implies that Maggey's action (killing Glen) prevented Tigre from getting his money. But if Glen had the lottery ticket, Tigre could have taken it as payment, so Maggey killing Glen would prevent that. But if the ticket was found on Maggey, then Tigre's plan would be to get it from her. So his statement that everything would have been over (i.e., he would have gotten his money) if Maggey hadn't acted contradicts the presence of the ticket on Maggey. Because if Maggey hadn't killed Glen, Tigre could have collected the 100k from the ticket. But this is a bit of a stretch.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to approach this systematically. For each testimony, check if any evidence directly contradicts it.

Testimony 7 by Tigre: "I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!" But Evidence 14 is a winning ticket for $500k found on Maggey. If Tigre knew about this ticket, he'd have a motive to kill Glen to take it, which contradicts his claim of only wanting $100k. However, the evidence doesn't explicitly show Tigre knew about the ticket. But the ticket's existence gives a potential larger motive, which contradicts his testimony that he had no other reason. This could be the contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 0: Tigre says he loaned Elg $100k. Evidence 20's calendar note supports a meeting, so no contradiction. Evidence 3's doodle with crossed-out 100k might imply the debt was resolved, contradicting Tigre's claim that the loan was still active. If the 100k is crossed out, maybe the debt was paid, but Tigre still claims he loaned it. However, Testimony 0 is about loaning, not about current status. The loan could have been given and then crossed out if paid. So no direct contradiction here.

Testimony 4: "He got lucky... half a million bucks!" Evidence 14 confirms the ticket exists, so no contradiction. The ticket being on Maggey doesn't contradict Glen having won it; maybe he gave it to her or she took it.

Testimony 2: "he tells me he's got no way to pay up." But if he had the lottery ticket, he could pay. However, the ticket might need to be cashed, so until then, he couldn't pay immediately. So no contradiction.

Testimony 7: Tigre claims only motive was $100k. Evidence 14's $500k ticket provides a larger motive, contradicting his statement. Therefore, this pair (Evidence 14 and Testimony 7) is a contradiction.

But the user wants the evidence and testimony numbers. Evidence 14 is the Victim's Lottery Ticket. Testimony 7 is Tigre's statement about only wanting $100k.

Therefore, the correct answer is {"evidence": 14, "testimony": 7}.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 7}

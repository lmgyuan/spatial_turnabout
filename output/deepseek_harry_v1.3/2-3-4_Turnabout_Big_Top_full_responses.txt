Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all given. Let me start by understanding the details.

First, the characters involved. The victim is Russell Berry, the ringmaster. The accused is Max, a magician. There's also Acro, an acrobat whose brother Bat is in a coma after being bitten by a lion named LÃ©on, who was shot by the victim. So there's some possible motive there for Acro against Russell. 

Looking at the evidence, let's list the key points. The autopsy report (Evidence 11) says Russell died from blunt force trauma at 10:15 PM. The wooden box (12) he was hunched over had a seasoning bottle with pepper (13). The scarf (19) has Bat's blood and pepper. The note (16) was a meeting request from someone posing as the murderer, leading Russell to the plaza at 10 PM. Max's bust (15) was taken from the cafeteria and is heavy. The crime photo (2) shows the victim lying on a case with his footprints leading there. 

Now the testimonies by Acro. Testimony 0: He could have lifted the bust. Testimony 1: He has strong upper body, legs injured. Testimony 2: Lifting the bust and looking out the window impossible. Testimony 3: Couldn't exert force on lower body. Testimony 4: Impossible to know where Russell's head was. Testimony 5: Therefore, dropping the bust on him is unrealistic.

Wait, the contradiction here. If Acro says he couldn't have known where Russell's head was (Testimony 4), but the crime photo (Evidence 2) shows the victim's footprints leading to where he was found. So if the footprints are there, maybe the position of the head could be inferred. Also, the note (16) was a trap set by the real murderer to get Russell to a specific place. If Acro wrote the note, he would know where Russell would be at 10 PM. Therefore, he could plan to drop the bust from above. 

But how does that tie into the evidence and testimony? The key point is Testimony 4 where Acro claims he couldn't know the location of the victim's head. However, if he set up the meeting via the note (Evidence 16), he would know exactly where Russell would be at 10 PM, which contradicts his statement that he couldn't have known. Therefore, Evidence 16 (the note) contradicts Testimony 4. 

Wait, but looking at the note, it was found torn in Russell's pocket. The note says to meet at the lodging house plaza at 10 PM. The crime happened there. So if Acro wrote the note, he would know Russell would be at that location, thus knowing where to drop the bust. Therefore, Acro's claim in Testimony 4 that he couldn't have known the location is contradicted by the note. So the evidence would be 16 and testimony 4. 

But let me check other possibilities. For instance, the bust (15) is heavy. Acro says in Testimony 0 he could lift it, but Testimony 2 says lifting and looking out the window was impossible. However, the evidence might contradict this. But maybe the map (6) shows Acro's room is on the third floor. If the bust was dropped from above, perhaps from a window. But how does that tie in? The contradiction is more likely between the note and the testimony about knowing the head's location. Because if Acro lured Russell to the plaza via the note, he would know where he'd be, making Testimony 4 false. So Evidence 16 (note) contradicts Testimony 4 (couldn't know head location). Therefore, the pair is evidence 16 and testimony 4.

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 4}

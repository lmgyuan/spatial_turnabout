Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by going through the testimonies and checking the evidence against them.

Looking at the testimonies provided by Gumshoe. Testimony 3 says that the Jammin' Ninja's button was found in Engarde's hakama. The corresponding evidence for the button is Evidence 16, which is the Jammin' Ninja's Button. The description says it was found in Engarde's hakama, so that matches the testimony. Hmm, maybe not a contradiction here.

Testimony 4 mentions that the defendant's fingerprints were on the knife. The knife is Evidence 15, which does have Engarde's fingerprints. So that's consistent. Testimony 5 says Engarde bought the knife, but the knife's description says it's engraved with "Gatewater Hotel". Wait, but the receipt (Evidence 24) is for a stuffed bear, not the knife. So maybe the knife's origin isn't directly linked to Engarde's purchase. Wait, the knife's description says it has Engarde's fingerprints and "Gatewater" engraved. But the receipt for the stuffed bear is what's linked to Engarde. So maybe the knife wasn't bought by Engarde, but the testimony says he bought it. That could be a contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 5 says the defendant bought the knife for the crime, making it premeditated. But the evidence for the knife (15) mentions it's engraved with "Gatewater Hotel". Is there any evidence that Engarde purchased the knife? The receipt (24) is for a stuffed bear, not the knife. So if there's no evidence that Engarde bought the knife, then Testimony 5's claim that he bought it is contradicted. But the knife's fingerprints are Engarde's, so maybe they assume he bought it. Hmm, maybe another angle.

Alternatively, looking at the autopsy report (14), the cause of death is strangulation first, then stabbing. The knife is the murder weapon with Engarde's prints. But if the actual cause of death was strangulation, then the stabbing might have been post-mortem. If that's the case, then the knife's fingerprints might not be relevant to the actual killing. But how does this relate to a contradiction between evidence and testimony?

Wait, the problem is to find a testimony and evidence that directly contradict. Let's check each testimony again.

Testimony 3: Button found in Engarde's hakama. Evidence 16 confirms that. No contradiction.

Testimony 5: Engarde bought the knife. The knife's evidence (15) says it has Engarde's prints, but the only purchase linked to Engarde is the stuffed bear (Evidence 24). So the testimony claims he bought the knife, but there's no evidence of him purchasing it. Unless the knife's engraving is from the hotel, which might imply it's hotel property. So if the knife is from the hotel, and Engarde didn't buy it, then Testimony 5 is incorrect. The testimony says he bought it, but evidence shows it's a hotel item. That's a contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 15.

Wait, Evidence 15's description: "Knife... In the grip, 'Gatewater' is engraved. Gatewater Hotel." So the knife is from the hotel. If Engarde didn't buy it, but the hotel owns it, then Testimony 5's claim that Engarde bought the knife is contradicted by the knife's origin. Therefore, Testimony 5 says he bought the knife, but Evidence 15 shows it's hotel property. That's the contradiction. So the pair would be Evidence 15 and Testimony 5.

{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me go through the testimonies and see which one might have inconsistencies with the evidence provided.

Looking at the testimonies by Oldbag (Testimony 0 to 5). Testimony 4 says that Oldbag saw Matt Engarde coming out of Juan's room, wearing his flashy racing jacket (Testimony 5 mentions the jacket). But wait, let's check the evidence related to the crime scene. 

The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim in a samurai outfit. Also, the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) was found in Engarde's hakama, which is part of a samurai costume. The Nickel Samurai photo (Evidence 2) is a costume. The spy camera in the stuffed bear (Evidence 23) might be related. 

Wait, the key point here is the outfit. Testimony 5 says Engarde was wearing a racing jacket when Oldbag saw him leaving the room. However, if the crime involved a samurai costume (since the victim was in a samurai outfit and the button from the Jammin' Ninja was found in Engarde's hakama), perhaps Engarde should have been in his Nickel Samurai costume instead of a racing jacket. Also, Lotta's Photo (Evidence 17) shows a person in samurai garb outside the door. That contradicts Oldbag's testimony that Engarde was in a racing jacket. So the testimony claims Engarde was in a racing jacket, but the photo shows someone in samurai garb. Therefore, Testimony 3 (where she says a man came out of the room) and Testimony 4 (specifically naming Engarde in the jacket) would conflict with Evidence 17. Alternatively, the testimony about the jacket (Testimony 5) contradicts the photo (Evidence 17) showing samurai garb. Let me check the exact testimony numbers.

Testimony 3: "That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room." Then Testimony 4 says it was Engarde in the racing jacket. The photo (Evidence 17) shows someone in samurai garb, not a racing jacket. So the testimony about the person wearing a racing jacket (Testimony 5) contradicts the photo (Evidence 17) which shows the person in samurai clothing. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 17 (Lotta's Photo) and Testimony 5 (which mentions the jacket). But wait, Testimony 5 is part of the same testimony sequence. Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (Engarde exiting) and the photo showing someone in samurai garb. Wait, maybe the security lady (Oldbag) claims she saw Engarde in a racing jacket, but the photo shows someone in samurai outfit. Therefore, the testimony that Engarde was in the racing jacket (Testimony 5) contradicts Evidence 17 (the photo shows samurai garb). So the pair would be Evidence 17 and Testimony 5. Let me confirm:

Evidence 17 is Lotta's Photo: "Picture taken in the Hallway right after the murder. A person in samurai garb stands outside the door." 

Testimony 5: "He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show."

So if the photo shows the person in samurai garb, but Oldbag says he was in a racing jacket, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 17 (Testimony Photo) and Testimony 5 (clothing description) contradict each other. So the answer should be {"evidence": 17, "testimony": 5}.

Wait, but Testimony 5 is part of the same set. Let me check the numbers again. The testimonies are numbered 0-5. Testimony 5 is the last one, where Oldbag mentions the racing jacket. The photo shows the person in samurai garb. So the testimony about the jacket (Testimony 5) contradicts the photo (Evidence 17). So the correct pair is evidence 17 and testimony 5.

{"evidence": 17, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are provided. Let me start by looking through the testimonies first.

Testimony 0 to 4 are all from Oldbag (Security Lady). Testimony 0 is her remembering something about Engarde. Testimonies 1-4 are about her claiming that the Nickel Samurai (Matt Engarde) was seen, and that he must have worn his costume during the murder because he had a stage show to attend right after. Specifically, Testimony 3 says he had to go to the post-ceremony stage show after the crime, so he was in costume. Testimony 4 claims he wore the costume when stabbing Juan.

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 2 is a photo of the Nickel Samurai costume. Evidence 3 is the Press Conference Ticket mentioning the Nickel Samurai's confession after the stage show. But wait, let's check the other evidence related to the time of death and the stage show timing.

The Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) states the time of death as 8:15 PM. The stage show would presumably be after that. But if the murder was at 8:15 PM, and the stage show is right after, maybe there's a timing conflict. However, the key contradiction might be elsewhere.

Looking at Evidence 17: Lotta's Photo shows a person in samurai garb outside the door right after the murder. But if Engarde was in his costume during the murder (as per testimony), but then had to go on stage, perhaps there's a timing issue. Alternatively, maybe the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record from 8 PM for 1 hour. The murder happened at 8:15 PM. If the camera was running, but the person in the costume was seen outside the room (in Lotta's Photo), maybe that's conflicting.

Wait, but the testimonies from Oldbag are about Engarde wearing the costume during the murder because he had to attend the stage show. But maybe the actual evidence shows that the costume was used by someone else. For example, the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) found in Engarde's hakama (part of his costume) is covered in Corrida's blood. That could imply Engarde was involved. However, the contradiction could be between the testimony that he was in costume (Testimony 4) and the fact that the button from the victim's costume was found in his. Wait, that might not directly contradict.

Alternatively, Evidence 17 (Lotta's Photo) shows a person in samurai garb outside the door right after the murder. If the testimony says Engarde was in costume (Nickel Samurai) during the murder and then went to the stage show, but the photo shows someone else (maybe the Jammin' Ninja, since the victim was dressed as a samurai?), but the victim was already dead. Hmm.

Wait, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) describes the victim in a samurai outfit. So the victim was dressed as a samurai (Jammin' Ninja). The testimonies are about the Nickel Samurai (Engarde) being the killer. But the photo from Lotta shows a person in samurai garb outside the room. If Engarde had to be on stage, maybe the time doesn't align. But let's check the Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) which says the Nickel Samurai is to confess something after the post-ceremony stage show. If the stage show was at 8 PM, and the murder was at 8:15 PM, maybe he couldn't be in two places at once. However, the exact timing isn't clear.

Wait, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record from 8 PM for 1 hour. The murder happened at 8:15 PM. If the camera was in the victim's room, and it recorded the murder, then maybe the footage would show the killer. However, the testimonies claim that Engarde was in his costume during the murder because he had to go to the stage show. If the stage show was at 8 PM, then he would have been on stage around that time, making it impossible for him to commit the murder at 8:15 PM. But this requires knowing the exact timing of the stage show. The Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) says the confession is after the post-ceremony stage show, but the exact time isn't specified. However, if the stage show was at 8 PM, and the murder was at 8:15, then Engarde couldn't be both places.

Alternatively, the Spy Camera's footage might show that the killer was in the room at 8:15 PM, but if Engarde was on stage then, that would contradict. But without the footage's content, maybe that's not the right angle.

Another angle: The testimonies (Testimony 3 and 4) say that Engarde had to wear his costume because he was going to the stage show right after. However, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim in a samurai outfit, and the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) next to him with only Corrida's fingerprints. The Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but the button (Evidence 16) from the Jammin' Ninja (Corrida) is found in Engarde's costume. Wait, but if Engarde was wearing his own costume (Nickel Samurai), how did Corrida's button end up there? That might imply a struggle. But perhaps the contradiction is elsewhere.

Wait, looking at the testimonies again. Testimony 3: "He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know." So the idea is that Engarde committed the murder and then went to the stage show, hence wearing the costume. But if the stage show was at 8 PM, and the murder was at 8:15 PM, he couldn't be at both. However, the exact timing is crucial here. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) says time of death is 8:15 PM. If the stage show was before that, then maybe he could have done both, but if the stage show was after, then he couldn't. But without explicit evidence on the stage show's time, maybe another angle.

Wait, the Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) mentions the post-ceremony stage show. Ceremonies often have schedules. If the stage show is after the ceremony, and the murder occurred during or after the ceremony, but the timing is conflicting.

Alternatively, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record from 8 PM for 1 hour. If the murder happened at 8:15 PM, and the camera was in the room, it should have captured the killer. If the footage was transmitted via the Transmitter (Evidence 22), but if the killer was in a costume, maybe it's Engarde. But if the testimonies say Engarde was in costume (Nickel Samurai), but the Spy Camera's footage (if viewed) would show that the killer was in a different costume (Jammin' Ninja) or someone else. However, the contents of the camera aren't described, only that it was running. So maybe that's not directly helpful.

Wait, another angle: The testimonies from Oldbag (Testimony 4) state that Engarde was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume when he stabbed Juan. But the victim's autopsy report (Evidence 14) says the cause of death was strangulation with a scarf and then stabbed. The Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but if he was wearing the costume (which would presumably have gloves or cover his hands), how did his fingerprints get on the knife? That could be a contradiction. Because if he was in costume, his fingerprints shouldn't be on the knife. However, the Nickel Samurai costume might not cover hands, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, the contradiction is that the testimony says he was in the costume, but the knife has his fingerprints, which would require him not wearing gloves. But maybe the costume includes gloves, making the fingerprints impossible. However, without explicit evidence about the costume including gloves, this might not hold.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 2: The Nickel Samurai photo shows the costume. If the costume includes gloves, then Testimony 4 (stabbing in costume) contradicts the presence of Engarde's fingerprints on the knife (Evidence 15). If the costume does have gloves, then the fingerprints on the knife shouldn't be there. But since the description of Evidence 2 only says it's a photo of the costume, and we don't know if gloves are part of it. This is a possible contradiction, but maybe not the strongest.

Another angle: The Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) indicates that the Nickel Samurai (Engarde) is supposed to have a confession after the stage show. If he committed the murder at 8:15 PM, then he would have had to leave the crime scene and go to the stage show. However, the security lady's testimony (Testimony 3) says he had to go to the stage show right after the crime. But if the stage show was scheduled for a time that conflicts with the murder time, that's a contradiction. However, without explicit timing for the stage show, it's hard to confirm.

Wait, looking at Evidence 6: Hotel Guidemap. The viola hall is east of the lobby. The path from the west leads to the viola hall. Engarde's room is north of the path, Corrida's south. If the stage show was in the viola hall, then Engarde would need to go from his room (north) to the viola hall (east). But the murder was in Corrida's room (south). The time taken to move between locations could be a factor. If the murder was at 8:15 PM and the stage show started at 8:20 PM, maybe possible, but again, not explicit.

Alternatively, the contradiction could be between Testimony 3 (Engarde had to go to the stage show right after the crime) and Evidence 3 (Press Conference Ticket about the stage show). Wait, Evidence 3 says the press conference is after the post-ceremony stage show. If the stage show was before the press conference, but the murder occurred during that time, maybe the timing conflicts. But without exact times, it's unclear.

Another thought: The Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record from 8 PM. The murder happened at 8:15 PM. If the camera recorded the murder, then the killer's identity would be on the tape. However, the Video Tape (Evidence 29) from De Killer's hideout might have the footage. But since the contents are unknown, maybe that's not helpful here.

Wait, perhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Engarde had to go to the stage show right after the crime) and the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) stating the time of death as 8:15 PM. If the stage show was at 8:15 PM, he couldn't be in two places. But again, without the stage show's exact time, this is speculative.

Alternatively, the testimonies say that Engarde was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume during the murder. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim in a samurai outfit. If the victim was in a different samurai costume (Jammin' Ninja), and the button from his costume (Evidence 16) was found in Engarde's costume, that suggests they were in proximity. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Wait, the testimonies claim that Engarde was in his own costume (Nickel Samurai), but the photo in Evidence 17 (Lotta's Photo) taken right after the murder shows a person in samurai garb outside the door. If the victim was already dead, then that person in samurai garb can't be the victim. So it must be the killer. But if the killer was in a samurai costume (Nickel Samurai), then that aligns with the testimony. However, the photo might show a different costume. For example, if the person in the photo is wearing the Jammin' Ninja costume, but the victim was already dead. Hmm, but the victim was in the Jammin' Ninja costume. If the person in the photo is wearing that, that's impossible. Alternatively, maybe the photo shows the Nickel Samurai, which would support the testimony. So not a contradiction there.

Wait, maybe the key contradiction is between Testimony 4 (Engarde wore the costume when stabbing) and the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) stating the cause of death was strangulation first, then stabbing. So the actual murder was via strangulation, not stabbing. The testimonies focus on the stabbing, but the primary cause was strangulation. Therefore, the testimonies are incorrect about the method. However, the knife with Engarde's fingerprints is in evidence. But the fact that the victim was strangled first might mean that the stabbing was post-mortem. So the testimonies about stabbing as the murder method contradict the autopsy report. But Testimony 4 says "he was stabbing poor Juan", which implies that the stabbing was the cause. However, the autopsy says the cause was strangulation. Therefore, Testimony 4 is incorrect because the stabbing wasn't the cause of death. But is that a direct contradiction between evidence and testimony?

Yes. The testimony says Engarde stabbed Juan, leading to his death. But the autopsy report says he was strangled to death first, then stabbed. So the stabbing wasn't the cause. Therefore, the testimony that Engarde stabbed him during the murder (as the cause) is contradicted by the autopsy report. However, the testimony doesn't explicitly state that the stabbing was the cause, just that he stabbed him. But if the stabbing occurred post-mortem, then the testimonies claiming he "stabbed poor Juan" during the murder (which happened via strangulation) isn't a direct contradiction. But the testimony says "when he was stabbing", implying that the stabbing was part of the murder act. However, the murder was already committed via strangulation. So the testimonies are focusing on the stabbing as the murder method, which is contradicted by the autopsy report.

But the question asks for evidence and testimony that contradict each other. The testimony is Testimony 4: "he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan." The evidence would be the Autopsy Report (14) stating that the cause was strangulation. But the problem is that the testimony doesn't say the stabbing caused death, just that he was stabbed. However, if the stabbing occurred after death, then the testimony's implication that the stabbing was part of the murder act (i.e., the killing) is contradicted. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 14.

But wait, the user asked for one pair. Let me check the evidence list again. The Autopsy Report is Evidence 14. The testimony is Testimony 4 (index 4). So the JSON would be {"evidence": 14, "testimony": 4}.

Alternatively, another possible contradiction: The testimony says Engarde was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume during the murder (Testimony 4), but the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording the room. If the footage shows the killer in a different costume, but since the user doesn't have access to the footage's content, maybe this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, the Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but if he was wearing his costume (which may include gloves, as per samurai costumes sometimes do), then the fingerprints shouldn't be there. However, without explicit evidence about the costume having gloves, this is speculative.

Wait, looking back at Evidence 2: The Nickel Samurai is a photo of the costume. If the costume includes gloves, then Testimony 4 (wearing the costume) would mean no fingerprints. But the knife has Engarde's prints. So that's a contradiction. However, if the costume doesn't include gloves, then no contradiction. Since the photo's description doesn't mention gloves, this is uncertain.

Another angle: The testimonies from Oldbag claim that Engarde was the killer in the Nickel Samurai costume. However, the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) from Corrida's costume was found in Engarde's hakama (part of his costume). This suggests that Engarde was in contact with Corrida's costume. But how does that contradict the testimony? Maybe the button implies that Engarde's costume was in contact with the victim's, but the testimony says he was wearing his own costume during the stabbing. Not sure if that's a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) next to the victim has only Corrida's fingerprints. The Wine Glass (8) has Andrews' fingerprints. The Knife (15) has Engarde's. If the testimony says Engarde was there in costume, but the Guitar Case only has Corrida's prints, maybe that's a contradiction. But if Engarde was wearing gloves, then his prints wouldn't be on the case. But the knife has his prints, so he wasn't wearing gloves. So no contradiction there.

Wait, the testimony says he was in costume (Testimony 4), which might include gloves, but the knife has his fingerprints. So if the costume includes gloves, contradiction. If not, no. But since the costume's photo (Evidence 2) doesn't specify, this is unclear.

Back to the earlier point: The cause of death being strangulation (Evidence 14) contradicts Testimony 4's implication that the stabbing was the murder. Since the testimony says he "was stabbing" during the crime, but the actual cause was strangulation. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 14.

So the pair would be {"evidence": 14, "testimony": 4}.

But let me check the user's evidence list again. Evidence 14 is Juan's Autopsy Report: cause of death is strangulation, then stabbing. Testimony 4 is Oldbag's testimony that Engarde wore the costume when stabbing. Therefore, the contradiction is that the actual cause of death was strangulation, so the stabbing was post-mortem, making the testimony about the stabbing being part of the murder incorrect. Therefore, the correct pair is evidence 14 and testimony 4.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to go through each testimony and check if any of the evidences provided directly contradict what's being said in the testimonies.

Looking at the testimonies, the ones from Adrian Andrews (Testimony 0 to 5) are key here. Let's take each one step by step.

Testimony 3 by Andrews says: "What I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo." The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim with a knife in his chest, a glass of tomato juice on the dresser, an open guitar case, and a smashed vase with water on the carpet. 

Now, in Testimony 5, Andrews states: "I was the one who knocked the flower vase over, where it fell onto the guitar case." But in the Crime Photo, the guitar case is next to the smashed vase, and there's water on the carpet. However, the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) description mentions that there's water only on the top of the lid. If Andrews knocked over the vase after discovering the body, the water from the vase would have spilled onto the guitar case. But the evidence says water is only on the lid, which might mean the vase was already broken before Andrews arrived, contradicting her statement that she knocked it over when she was there. 

Wait, but the Crime Photo's caption says the guitar case is next to the remains of the smashed vase. The vase's water stained the carpet. The guitar case has water only on top of the lid. If Andrews knocked over the vase, which caused the water to spill onto the guitar case, then the case should have water from the vase. But the evidence states the water is only on the lid. If the vase was already broken before Andrews arrived, then her testimony about knocking it over would be false. That's a contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 7 (Guitar Case). However, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the smashed vase, which might align with her testimony. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 4 says Andrews poured herself a glass of juice. The Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has tomato juice and Andrews' fingerprints. But the Wine Glass is found next to the victim, filled with tomato juice, and not drunk from. If Andrews poured the juice and took a sip, there should be signs of drinking, but the glass wasn't touched. So her statement about pouring juice (Testimony 4) might contradict Evidence 8 (no sign it's been drunk). But the user wants one pair. 

Wait, looking back at Testimony 3: Andrews claims the scene was exactly as in the crime photo. But Evidence 9's caption mentions the glass of juice is behind the victim on the dresser, and the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) is found next to the victim. Wait, the Wine Glass is next to the victim, but the Crime Photo's caption says the glass is behind him on the dresser. Maybe that's a discrepancy. Or perhaps not. Let me check.

The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) says: "a glass of juice sits behind him on the dresser. A full bottle of juice sits on the desk in front of him." The Wine Glass (Evidence 8) is described as "found next to the victim. It's filled with tomato juice. No sign it's been drank. Bears Andrews' fingerprints." So, if the glass in the crime photo is behind the victim on the dresser, but the Wine Glass evidence says it's next to the victim, maybe that's a contradiction. But maybe "next to the victim" is the same as on the dresser behind him. Not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 5: Andrews says she knocked over the vase onto the guitar case. The Crime Photo shows the smashed vase next to the guitar case. The Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has water only on top of the lid. If the vase was already smashed before Andrews arrived, then her testimony about knocking it over would be a lie. However, the Guitar Case's water is only on the lid. If the vase was broken when Andrews arrived, and she knocked it over, then the water would have spilled on the case. But according to the evidence, the water is only on top of the lid. Maybe that suggests the vase was broken before she arrived, and the water had already spilled, so the case's lid had water. Then when she knocked it over again, perhaps more water would be on the carpet, but the evidence says only on the lid. So her testimony about knocking the vase over contradicts the evidence. Therefore, Testimony 5 (Andrews saying she knocked over the vase) and Evidence 7 (Guitar Case with water only on the lid) could contradict each other. But how?

Wait, the vase's remains are next to the guitar case. If the vase was already broken, then the water would have spilled on the carpet. But the Guitar Case's lid has water. If Andrews knocked it over, perhaps that's when the water got on the lid, but the evidence says only on top of the lid. Maybe the vase was broken earlier, and the water on the lid was from that, but Andrews claims she knocked it over, which would have added more water. But the evidence says only on top of the lid. Hmm, maybe not the strongest contradiction.

Looking back at Testimony 3 again. Andrews says the scene was exactly as in the crime photo. But the autopsy report (Evidence 14) states the cause of death was strangulation with a scarf followed by a stab wound. The crime photo shows a knife in the chest. So the actual cause of death is strangulation, but the knife was added later. If the crime photo shows the knife, but the autopsy says he was strangled first, then the scene in the photo (knife in chest) would be after the actual cause of death. However, that's not a contradiction between testimony and evidence, but between autopsy and photo. But the testimony is about the scene matching the photo, which it does. So that's not a contradiction.

Another possibility: Testimony 4 says Andrews poured herself juice. The Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has her fingerprints but wasn't drunk from. If she poured it but didn't drink, that's okay. Unless there's another evidence that contradicts this. Maybe not.

Looking at the Magazine Clipping (Evidence 11) which talks about Corrida and Ms. A.A. (Adrian Andrews) having a relationship. The Suicide Report (Evidence 12) says Celeste Inpax was found by Corrida, and her suicide note was hidden. Then Adrian's attempted suicide (Evidence 13) because of Celeste's death. But how does this relate to testimonies?

Alternatively, the Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but the testimony from Andrews doesn't mention Engarde. Maybe not directly.

Wait, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record the victim's room from 8 PM. The time of death is 8:15 PM (Evidence 14). The Video Tape (Evidence 29) retrieved from De Killer's hideout might have footage, but if the spy camera was recording, then the Video Tape could contradict Testimony 3 if the footage shows someone else. However, since the Video Tape's contents are unknown, it's hard to use that.

Back to Testimony 3: Andrews says the scene was exactly as the crime photo. The crime photo includes a glass of juice behind the victim. The Wine Glass (Evidence 8) is found next to the victim with Andrews' fingerprints. If in the crime photo the glass is on the dresser behind him, but the evidence says the Wine Glass is next to the victim, that could be a contradiction. Wait, maybe not. The crime photo's caption says "a glass of juice sits behind him on the dresser," and the Wine Glass is "found next to the victim." Maybe "next to" refers to the same location. So perhaps no contradiction there.

Another angle: Testimony 3 says the scene matches the crime photo, which includes the smashed vase. Testimony 5 says Andrews knocked over the vase. If the crime photo already shows the smashed vase before Andrews arrived, then her statement about knocking it over would be a contradiction. But according to the timeline, the murder happened at 8:15 PM. Andrews went to the room after the show was supposed to start. If the spy camera was recording from 8 PM, maybe the footage would show when the vase was broken. But without the video, we can't say. However, the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has water only on the lid. If the vase was broken during the murder (before Andrews arrived), then the water would have spilled on the case, but Andrews says she knocked it over, implying she did it later. The water on the lid might have already been there, and her knocking over the vase would have caused more water to spill, but the evidence only mentions water on the lid. Therefore, her testimony about causing the vase to fall might contradict the evidence about the water's location.

So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Andrews says she knocked over the vase onto the guitar case) and Evidence 7 (Guitar Case has water only on the lid). If she knocked it over, the water would have spilled onto the case, possibly more than just the lid. But the evidence says only the lid has water. So this is a possible contradiction. However, the Crime Photo mentions the vase's remains next to the guitar case, which is stained with water. So maybe the initial breaking of the vase caused water on the carpet and the case's lid, and Andrews knocking it again might not add much. But the key is the Guitar Case's description: "some water, but only on top of the lid." If Andrews knocked the vase over, she would have added more water, but the evidence says only the lid has water. That suggests the vase was already broken and the water on the lid was from that initial breakage, not from Andrews' action. Therefore, her testimony about causing the vase to fall contradicts the evidence, implying she's lying about that action.

So the correct pair is Evidence 7 (Guitar Case) and Testimony 5 (Andrews' testimony about knocking over the vase).

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to identify one pair where the evidence and testimony don't align.

First, let me look through the testimonies. Testimonies 0-3 are all from Adrian Andrews (Character 8). The testimonies are about her actions regarding the guitar case. She says she must have opened the guitar case after knocking over the vase (Testimony 1), and that the case was empty (Testimony 2). She also states she doesn't know why she opened it (Testimony 3).

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 7 is the Guitar Case, which is empty with water on the lid and only Corrida's fingerprints. Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) shows an open guitar case on the floor next to the victim, along with a smashed vase that stained the carpet with water. So the vase was broken, which matches Andrews knocking it over. But according to Evidence 7, the guitar case has only Corrida's fingerprints. However, Andrews' testimony (Testimony 1) says she opened the case. If she opened it, her fingerprints should be on it. But the evidence says only Corrida's. That's a contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 1 says Andrews opened the case, but the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has only Corrida's prints. So that's a direct contradiction. Therefore, the pair would be Testimony 1 (Andrews saying she opened the case) and Evidence 7 (only Corrida's fingerprints). But in the given testimonies, Testimony 1 is "I suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over." So if the guitar case has only Corrida's fingerprints, but Andrews claims to have opened it, that's a contradiction because her fingerprints would be present. Therefore, the testimony (Testimony 1) and Evidence 7 (Guitar Case) contradict each other. But let me check if there's another possible contradiction.

Another angle: Testimony 2 says the case was empty. Evidence 7 is empty, so that's consistent. Testimony 3 says she doesn't know why she opened it. That's not necessarily contradicted by evidence. So the main contradiction is Testimony 1 (Andrews opening the case) vs Evidence 7 (only Corrida's fingerprints). Therefore, the correct pair would be evidence 7 and testimony 1. But the user wants only one pair. Let me check the indexes again. Testimony 1 is index 1, Evidence 7 is index 7. So the JSON should be {"evidence": 7, "testimony": 1}.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 1}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by going through the testimonies and the evidences one by one.

First, the testimonies are all from Adrian Andrews (Character 8). Let's look at each testimony:

Testimony 0: She thought Matt was the murderer from the crime scene.
Testimony 1: Matt had to kill Juan no matter what.
Testimony 2: She knows the motive but can't prove it.
Testimony 3: Matt didn't have an alibi during the murder.
Testimony 4: Evidence confirmed her thoughts (button and knife).
Testimony 5: The button was torn off during a fight between Matt and Juan.
Testimony 6: She felt she had to protect Matt as his manager.

Now, the key is to find a contradiction between a testimony and an evidence. Let's check each testimony against the evidences.

Looking at Testimony 3: Matt didn't have an alibi at the time of the murder (8:15 PM). But let's check if any evidence suggests he might have an alibi or was somewhere else.

Evidence 21 is a Spy Camera set to record the victim's room from 8 PM for 1 hour. If the camera was running during the murder, maybe there's footage that could show Matt wasn't there. Wait, but the camera was in the stuffed bear (Evidence 23), which was bought by Engarde (Evidence 24). If Engarde set up the camera to record the room, perhaps the footage could show someone else, which would contradict his alibi. But Testimony 3 says he had no alibi. If the spy camera's footage (Evidence 21) was from the victim's room, maybe it shows that Matt wasn't present, which would support the alibi. Wait, no. If the camera was in the room and recorded the murder, but the murder happened there, then maybe the footage shows the killer. But the testimony says Matt didn't have an alibi, but if the camera was his, perhaps he could have an alibi if the footage shows someone else. Alternatively, if the camera was set up by Matt, maybe he intended to record something else. But there's also Evidence 21 and 22 (transmitter), which might relate to the video tape (Evidence 29) from De Killer's hideout. Maybe the video tape shows something that contradicts Matt not having an alibi.

Alternatively, consider Testimony 5: The button (Evidence 16) was torn off during a fight between Matt and Juan. But the autopsy report (Evidence 14) says the cause of death was strangulation with a scarf and then stabbed. If the button was from the fight, but the murder was done by someone else, maybe there's a contradiction. Wait, the button was found in Engarde's hakama, suggesting he was in a fight. But if the murder happened via strangulation first, maybe the fight happened before the actual murder. Not sure.

Wait, let's focus on Testimony 3: No alibi. But what if there's evidence suggesting he might have an alibi? Let's check Evidence 21: Spy Camera set to record from 8 PM for 1 hour. If the camera was in the room and the murder happened at 8:15 PM, perhaps the footage would show the killer. If Matt was elsewhere and the footage shows the real killer, then he would have an alibi. But according to Testimony 3, Andrews claims he didn't have an alibi. But if the spy camera was set by Matt, maybe he could have used the footage to prove he wasn't there. Alternatively, the Video Tape (Evidence 29) from De Killer's hideout might show something else. Wait, the Video Tape is from De Killer's hideout, and he tried to recover it violently. Maybe the video tape shows that Matt was being blackmailed or something, but that might not directly contradict the alibi.

Alternatively, the Security Lady (Character 3) might have seen him elsewhere. But the key is to find a direct contradiction between a testimony and an evidence.

Wait, Testimony 3: Matt didn't have an alibi. But maybe Evidence 17 is Lotta's Photo taken right after the murder, showing a person in samurai garb outside the door. If that person is Matt, then he was at the crime scene, supporting the testimony. But if the photo shows someone else, then it contradicts. But the testimony is about Matt not having an alibi, not necessarily placing him at the scene. Hmm.

Alternatively, Evidence 15 is the knife with Engarde's fingerprints. But the testimony 4 says the evidence (knife and button) confirms her thoughts. So that supports the testimony. So no contradiction there.

Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 14) says time of death is 8:15 PM. If there's evidence that Matt was somewhere else at that time, that would contradict Testimony 3. But according to Testimony 3, he had no alibi. So if Evidence 20 is Matt's Note asking to feed his cat, but that's not a time-specific alibi. Evidence 24 shows he bought the stuffed bear, which is the spy camera. If the spy camera was in the victim's room, and the footage (Evidence 21) was recorded, maybe the video shows someone else committing the murder, thus giving Matt an alibi. But if the camera was in the room, and Matt was in his own room (as per hotel guidemap, Evidence 6: Engarde's room is north of the path), but the murder happened in Corrida's room (south of the path), then maybe the camera's footage would show Matt wasn't present. However, if the footage shows the real killer (like Shelly de Killer), then Matt could have an alibi. But Testimony 3 says he didn't have an alibi, which would contradict if there's evidence that he did.

Alternatively, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record from 8 PM. The murder was at 8:15 PM. If the camera was in the victim's room and recorded the murder, then the footage would show the killer. If the killer is someone else (like Shelly de Killer), then Matt would have an alibi. But Testimony 3 says he didn't have an alibi. Therefore, if the Spy Camera's footage (Evidence 21) proves that Matt wasn't present, then that contradicts Testimony 3. But how is the Spy Camera's footage used here? The Video Tape (Evidence 29) might be the footage from the spy camera. Since De Killer tried to recover it, maybe the video shows the real killer, thus giving Matt an alibi. But the problem is that the Spy Camera is listed as Evidence 21, and the Video Tape as 29. So if the Spy Camera was set to record, but the Video Tape is retrieved from De Killer's hideout, which could be the same footage. If the existence of the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) implies that there is footage, then Testimony 3 (Matt has no alibi) is contradicted by the possibility that the footage could provide an alibi. However, this is a bit indirect. Alternatively, the Spy Camera's presence in the room might mean that Matt could have been elsewhere, but the testimony says he had no alibi. But this is speculative.

Wait, another angle: The murder was committed by Shelly de Killer, as per Evidence 4 (Radio Transceiver from De Killer) and Evidence 30 (Bellboy's Uniform missing a button, which might link to the button found in Evidence 16?). But the testimony from Andrews claims Matt is the killer, but if the evidence points to De Killer, then Testimony 0 (Andrews thought Matt was the murderer) would be contradicted by Evidence 13 (Shelly de Killer's presence). But the question is about a specific evidence-testimony pair.

Alternatively, the autopsy report (Evidence 14) says the cause of death was strangulation, then stabbing. The knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints. But if the victim was already dead when stabbed, then the knife's fingerprints wouldn't matter because the actual cause of death was strangulation. So Testimony 4 and 5, which rely on the knife and button as evidence, would be contradicted by the autopsy report. For example, if the button was torn during a fight, but the murder was by strangulation (which doesn't require a fight), then the button evidence (Evidence 16) might not be relevant. However, Testimony 5 says the button was torn during a fight between Matt and Juan. If the actual cause of death was strangulation, then the fight might not have been the murder, but perhaps a prior altercation. But the testimony is saying that the button was torn during the fight that led to the murder. So maybe there's a contradiction here: if the victim was strangled first, then the stabbing with the knife was post-mortem, so the fight (which caused the button to be torn) might have happened before the murder, but the actual killing was by someone else (like De Killer). Thus, the button (Evidence 16) being in Matt's hakama doesn't directly tie him to the murder, but only to a fight. Therefore, Testimony 4 and 5 would be contradicted by Evidence 14 (autopsy report), but that's not exactly a direct contradiction. 

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 4: Andrews says the evidence (button and knife) confirmed her thoughts. But the knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but the autopsy report says the cause was strangulation, not the knife. So even if the knife has his prints, the actual murder was via strangulation. So the knife's fingerprints wouldn't prove he committed the murder. Therefore, Testimony 4 (evidence confirms with the knife) is contradicted by the autopsy report (Evidence 14) showing the knife wasn't the murder weapon. That's a possible contradiction. So Testimony 4 is contradicted by Evidence 14. But let's check the details.

Evidence 14: Cause of death is strangulation with a scarf, then stabbed. So the stabbing was post-mortem. Therefore, the knife with Engarde's prints was used after the victim was already dead. Thus, the knife isn't the murder weapon. So Testimony 4 says the evidence (knife and button) confirmed her thoughts that Matt was the killer. But if the knife wasn't the murder weapon, then the presence of his fingerprints on the knife doesn't prove he killed Corrida. Thus, Testimony 4 is contradicted by Evidence 14.

But wait, Testimony 4 says "the evidence, of course; the button and the knife..." So she's using the knife as evidence that Matt did it. But if the knife was used post-mortem, then the actual killer could have planted it. So the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (knife as evidence) and Evidence 14 (murder was by strangulation). Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 4. However, Evidence 14 is the autopsy report, and Testimony 4 is about the knife and button confirming her thoughts. The autopsy report shows that the knife wasn't the cause of death, so the knife's fingerprints don't indicate Matt was the murderer. Therefore, Testimony 4 is contradicted by Evidence 14. 

But the user wants the answer as one pair. So {"evidence": 14, "testimony":4}. But I need to check if there's a more direct contradiction.

Alternatively, consider Testimony 5: The button was torn off during the fight with Matt. But the autopsy says the victim was strangled. If the button was torn during a fight, maybe that fight occurred before the murder. So if Matt fought with Juan, leading to the button being torn, but the actual murder was committed by someone else (De Killer), then the button's presence doesn't implicate Matt in the murder, only in a prior fight. However, Testimony 5 is part of Andrews' argument that Matt killed Juan, using the button as evidence. But the button's presence could be from a prior altercation, not the murder itself. The contradiction here would be that the button (Evidence 16) is from a fight, but the murder method (strangulation) doesn't require a fight. So Testimony 5 (button torn during fight) may not directly link to the murder. But this is more of a logical inconsistency rather than a direct contradiction with evidence.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3: Matt had no alibi. But if the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording the room from 8 PM, and the murder happened at 8:15 PM, then the camera would have captured the killer. If the killer wasn't Matt, then Matt could have an alibi elsewhere. But the testimony says he didn't have an alibi. However, without the actual footage, maybe this is not a direct contradiction. But if the Spy Camera was set by Matt (as per Evidence 24, he bought the stuffed bear), then maybe he intended to record something. If the Spy Camera's existence implies that there is footage, but the testimony says he has no alibi, that could be a contradiction. But the user might want a more direct link.

Another angle: The knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but the autopsy report (14) states that the victim was strangled first. So the knife was used post-mortem, meaning the fingerprints on the knife don't necessarily implicate Engarde in the murder. Therefore, Testimony 4's claim that the knife is evidence of his guilt is contradicted by the autopsy report. So Evidence 14 contradicts Testimony 4.

Yes, that seems plausible. Because if the murder was by strangulation, the knife's fingerprints don't prove murder. So Testimony 4 is using the knife as evidence of murder, but the autopsy shows the knife wasn't the murder weapon. Therefore, the evidence (14) contradicts the testimony (4).

So the correct pair would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 4.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies. Let me start by looking through the testimonies and the evidence.

The testimonies here are all from Adrian Andrews. Testimony 0 says she didn't pour the juice for herself. Testimony 4 mentions she poured juice for him when she thought he fainted. Then Testimony 5 says she knocked over the vase when she realized he was dead.

Looking at the evidence, the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has Andrews' fingerprints and is filled with tomato juice. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the glass on the dresser behind the victim, along with a smashed vase. The autopsy report (Evidence 14) states the time of death was 8:15 PM, and the cause was strangulation followed by a stabbing. 

Wait, the problem is in Testimony 4: Andrews says she poured juice for Corrida when she thought he was just unconscious. However, the autopsy says he was strangled and stabbed. If he was already dead by 8:15 PM, then he couldn't have been sitting slumped over when she entered, because the actual cause of death was strangulation. So if she poured juice for him, but he was already strangled (which would mean he was dead), then the juice glass with her fingerprints contradicts her statement that she poured it for him thinking he was alive. Also, the Crime Photo shows the glass behind the victim, which might indicate she placed it there after he was dead. 

Wait, but the autopsy says the cause was strangulation followed by stabbing. So the actual time of death was 8:15 PM. If Andrews entered the room after that, then when she poured the juice, he was already dead. But she claims she poured it thinking he was just fainted. However, if he was strangled, there might be signs that he was dead (like no breathing, cold body, etc.), which would contradict her not realizing he was dead. But the contradiction here might be with the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) having her fingerprints. She said she poured the juice for him, but the glass is found next to the victim with her prints. But if the victim was already dead, then she couldn't have given him the juice. However, the autopsy report's time of death is 8:15 PM. The Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record from 8 PM for an hour. Maybe the footage would show when Andrews entered. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 5: Andrews says she knocked over the vase when she realized he was dead. The Crime Photo shows the smashed vase with water on the carpet. The Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has water only on the lid. If the vase was knocked over when she realized he was dead, then the water from the vase would be on the carpet, which matches the photo. But the Guitar Case's water is only on top, maybe implying it was there before the vase was broken. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has Andrews' fingerprints. If she poured the juice for Corrida, but he was already dead, then the glass being there with her prints supports her testimony. But maybe there's a contradiction in the contents. The Wine Glass is filled with tomato juice, and the Crime Photo shows a full bottle of juice on the desk. If she poured from the bottle, but the bottle is full, then maybe the bottle wasn't opened. That could be a contradiction. Wait, the Crime Photo says a full bottle of juice is on the desk. If Andrews poured juice from that bottle into the glass, the bottle should not be full anymore. So if the bottle is still full, then she couldn't have poured from it, which contradicts her testimony that she poured him juice. Therefore, the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) with her prints and the full bottle in the photo would contradict her testimony about pouring the juice. But Testimony 4 is where she says she poured him juice. So the evidence (Crime Photo showing full bottle and the glass) contradicts her Testimony 4. But the Wine Glass is Evidence 8, and the Crime Photo is Evidence 9. Wait, the Crime Photo's description mentions the full bottle. So the full bottle (Evidence 9) would contradict her testimony that she poured juice from it. Therefore, Evidence 9 and Testimony 4. Alternatively, the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has her prints, which she admits to pouring, but the full bottle would mean she didn't pour from it, so maybe she brought the glass already filled. But the Crime Photo shows the glass is behind the victim on the dresser, and the bottle is on the desk. Hmm. If the bottle is full, then she couldn't have poured from it. So her Testimony 4 says she poured him juice, but if the bottle was full, then she didn't pour from it, which would be a contradiction. Therefore, the evidence (Crime Photo, Evidence 9) showing the full bottle contradicts Testimony 4 where she says she poured juice for him. So the pair would be Evidence 9 and Testimony 4. But the question allows only one pair. Alternatively, maybe another angle.

Another possible contradiction: The autopsy report (Evidence 14) says Corrida was strangled with a scarf and then stabbed. So the actual cause of death was strangulation. If Andrews saw him slumped over and thought he fainted, but the body would have shown signs of strangulation (like marks on the neck). However, she didn't notice that, which might be a contradiction. But the testimonies don't mention the scarf. Alternatively, the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has tomato juice. If Corrida was strangled, maybe the juice was a setup. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 0: Andrews says she didn't pour the juice for herself. But the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has her fingerprints, implying she handled it. If she poured it for him, that's consistent. But if the bottle was full, then she couldn't have poured it. So Evidence 9 (Crime Photo with full bottle) contradicts Testimony 4 where she says she poured juice. Therefore, the answer would be Evidence 9 and Testimony 4. But I need to check the numbers. Evidence 9 is the Crime Photo. Testimony 4 is "To be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice." So if the bottle is full, she couldn't have poured from it. Therefore, the evidence (Crime Photo, 9) contradicts Testimony 4.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 4}

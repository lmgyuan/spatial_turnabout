Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and we need to pick one pair where the evidence contradicts a testimony.

First, let me go through the testimonies. The testimonies are from Detective Gumshoe. Testimony 3 says: "The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back." The defendant here is probably Maya Fey since she's the one accused. The testimony suggests that the victim (Dr. Grey) didn't fight back, meaning there was no struggle.

Now, looking at the evidence. Let's check the autopsy report (Evidence 8). It says Dr. Grey was stabbed in the chest first and then shot in the forehead at point-blank. The presence of gunpowder residue indicates the shot was very close. If he was stabbed first, that might have incapacitated him, making the subsequent shooting possible without resistance. But wait, the testimony claims the victim didn't fight back. But the stabbing would have required the attacker to be in close proximity. However, maybe the key contradiction is elsewhere.

Another angle: Maya's Costume (Evidence 11) has blood splatters and a bullet hole in the sleeve. If Maya was the attacker, why does her costume have a bullet hole? That suggests she was shot at. But Dr. Grey was shot in the forehead. If Maya was shot, maybe there was a struggle. But the testimony says the victim didn't fight back. If Grey didn't fight back, how did Maya get a bullet hole in her sleeve? Unless someone else fired the gun. But the Pistol (Evidence 9) has two shots fired, with Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. If Grey fired the gun, he did fight back, which contradicts Testimony 3. So the fact that the pistol has Grey's fingerprints might mean he fired it, which would mean he did fight back. Therefore, Testimony 3's claim that the victim didn't fight back is contradicted by Evidence 9 showing Grey's fingerprints on the gun, implying he used it.

Wait, but the autopsy says he was stabbed first, then shot. So maybe Grey was stabbed, which incapacitated him, then someone else shot him. But the gun has Grey's fingerprints. If Grey fired the gun before being stabbed, that could indicate a struggle. However, the autopsy says the gunshot was after the stabbing. Hmm, maybe the sequence is important here. If Grey was already stabbed, he might not have been able to fire the gun. So the presence of his fingerprints on the gun might indicate that he had it before the attack. But if he didn't fight back, why would his fingerprints be on the gun? The contradiction here is that if Grey's fingerprints are on the pistol, he might have handled it, possibly firing it, which would mean he did fight back, contradicting Testimony 3. Therefore, Evidence 9 (Pistol with Grey's fingerprints) contradicts Testimony 3 (victim didn't fight back).

Alternatively, looking at Maya's Costume (Evidence 11) which has a bullet hole. If Maya was shot, then perhaps Grey fired at her, meaning he did fight back. That would contradict Testimony 3. So Evidence 11's bullet hole in the costume suggests that someone shot at Maya, implying the victim (Grey) might have fired, thus contradicting the testimony that he didn't fight back.

But the Pistol (Evidence 9) has two shots fired. If Grey was shot once (the fatal shot in the forehead), then another shot was fired. The other shot could be the one that hit Maya's sleeve. So if Grey fired that shot before being stabbed, then he did fight back. But the autopsy says he was stabbed first. So the sequence would be: stabbed, then shot. But if Grey was stabbed first, he couldn't have fired the gun. Therefore, the presence of Grey's fingerprints on the gun might be from before the attack. But if he didn't fight back (as per Testimony 3), then why did the gun have his fingerprints? Maybe because it's his own gun. The contradiction here is that the testimony says he didn't fight back, but the gun's fingerprints (his and Maya's) suggest he might have handled it, but that might not necessarily mean he fought back. Alternatively, the bullet hole in Maya's costume (Evidence 11) indicates that a shot was fired at her, which would mean someone else (Grey) shot at her, thus contradicting the testimony that he didn't fight back.

So, the key contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Grey didn't fight back) and Evidence 11 (Maya's costume has a bullet hole). The bullet hole suggests that a shot was fired at Maya, implying that Grey (or someone else) shot at her, meaning there was a fight, which contradicts the testimony.

Alternatively, the Pistol (Evidence 9) has two shots fired. If two shots were fired, maybe one was at Maya (causing the hole in her sleeve) and the other killed Grey. But the autopsy says Grey was shot after being stabbed. So if the first shot was fired by Grey at Maya (causing the hole in her sleeve), then he did fight back, which contradicts Testimony 3. Therefore, Evidence 9 (Pistol) and Testimony 3 are the contradicting pair.

Wait, but the Pistol's description says it's the murder weapon, with two shots fired, and has Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. So if Grey's fingerprints are on it, he might have fired it. If he fired it once (the shot that hit Maya's sleeve), then that's an act of fighting back, which contradicts Testimony 3. So the existence of his fingerprints on the gun, combined with the two shots, implies he used the gun, hence fought back. Therefore, Evidence 9 contradicts Testimony 3.

Another possibility: Maya's Costume (11) has a bullet hole. If she was shot at, then the victim (Grey) must have fired, meaning he fought back. So Evidence 11 contradicts Testimony 3.

So which is the correct pair? Let's check the exact testimony: Testimony 3 says "The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back." So the claim is that the victim (Grey) didn't fight back. If there's evidence that he did fight back (like firing a gun), that contradicts the testimony.

The Pistol (9) has Grey's fingerprints, suggesting he handled it. If he fired it, that's fighting back. But the autopsy says he was stabbed first, then shot. So if he was stabbed first, he couldn't have fired the gun afterward. Therefore, maybe his fingerprints are from before the attack. But the presence of a bullet hole in Maya's costume (11) suggests a shot was fired at her. If the pistol was used to fire that shot, then either Grey fired it before being stabbed (thus fighting back), or someone else did. But the gun has Grey's fingerprints. So if he fired it, that's fighting back. Therefore, Evidence 9 (Pistol with Grey's fingerprints and two shots) contradicts Testimony 3 (Grey didn't fight back).

Alternatively, the bullet hole in the costume (11) shows that a shot was fired towards Maya, which would imply that the victim (Grey) fired it, hence fighting back. Therefore, Evidence 11 contradicts Testimony 3.

But according to the Pistol's description, it's the murder weapon with two shots fired. The autopsy says Grey was shot once (in the forehead), so the other shot could have been the one that hit Maya's sleeve. Therefore, the two shots are accounted for: one killed Grey (but according to the autopsy, he was stabbed first), so the shot that killed him was after the stabbing. But if the other shot was fired by Grey at Maya before being stabbed, that would mean he fought back, contradicting Testimony 3.

Alternatively, Maya fired both shots: one to stab Grey, then shoot him. But the gun has both their fingerprints. Hmm, this is getting complicated. The key point is that the presence of a bullet hole in Maya's costume (11) indicates that she was shot at, which would mean that the victim (Grey) or someone else shot at her. If it was Grey, then he did fight back, which contradicts Testimony 3. Therefore, Evidence 11 (Maya's Costume with bullet hole) contradicts Testimony 3.

So, the correct pair is Evidence 11 and Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The goal is to find one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, let me go through the testimonies. All of them are from Detective Gumshoe, Testimonies 0 to 4. They describe the sequence of events during the murder. 

Testimony 3 says: "The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed." So according to Gumshoe, Dr. Grey (the victim) fired a shot at Maya but missed because they were too close. 

Now looking at the evidences. Evidence 11 is Maya's Costume. The description mentions a bullet hole in the sleeve, and that when something is shot from point blank, there's a burn area around the bullet hole. But her robe has a bullet hole with blood splatter, and the robe is otherwise clean. The presence of a bullet hole in her sleeve suggests that the shot actually hit her, not missed. 

Wait, but Testimony 3 claims the victim missed because they were too close. However, if there's a bullet hole in Maya's costume, that implies the shot didn't miss. That's a contradiction. 

Additionally, Evidence 9 is the Pistol, which had two shots fired. If one shot was the missed one (as per testimony 3), then the other might be the one that hit Maya. But according to the autopsy report (Evidence 8), Dr. Grey was stabbed first, then shot in the forehead at point-blank. So the two shots from the pistol: one might have been during the struggle (the missed one according to testimony) but the other was the fatal shot. But Maya's costume has a bullet hole, so the missed shot actually hit her, contradicting the testimony. 

So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (claiming the shot missed) and Evidence 11 (showing the bullet hole in Maya's sleeve, indicating the shot hit her). Therefore, the evidence and testimony that contradict are Evidence 11 and Testimony 3.

Okay, let's start by looking through the testimonies and the evidence to find contradictions.

Norma DePlume's testimonies (Testimony 0 to 3) all claim that she saw the orca (Ora/Orla) attack and kill the victim, Jack Shipley. Specifically, Testimony 2 states she saw the orca bite the victim with its teeth. 

Now, looking at the evidence. The autopsy report (Evidence 12) says the cause of death was a brain contusion from blunt force trauma, not bites. Blunt force trauma would mean injuries from being hit, not bitten. The orca's teeth causing death would leave different wounds, like lacerations or puncture marks, but the autopsy mentions blunt force. That directly contradicts DePlume's testimony about the orca biting the victim to death.

Another point: Evidence 9 is the bloodstained coin, which is considered the murder weapon. If the coins were used to cause blunt trauma, that supports the autopsy's findings and contradicts the orca attack story. Also, Evidence 16 (Skull Rock) mentions the victim struck it when he fell, which could be part of the blunt force scenario. However, the most direct contradiction is between DePlume's Testimony 2 and the autopsy report in Evidence 12. The autopsy's cause of death doesn't align with the described method in the testimony.

Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So, I need to go through each testimony and check against the evidence provided.

First, looking at the testimonies. Testimony 3 by Rimes says that the orca knows there's a certain spot where people stand to play volleyball with her. Then Testimony 4 adds that maybe Orla knocked down stuff piled there and hit the captain. The implication is that Orla caused the accident by hitting objects in that spot.

Now, looking at the evidence. Evidence 4 is the whistle. It states that Orla can perform one trick per signal and can't do two at a time. Also, the whistle can be used by anyone who knows the signals. So if someone used the whistle to command Orla, she would do only one trick. 

If Rimes is claiming that Orla knocked down the stuff (which would be a trick), but according to Evidence 4, Orla can't perform multiple tricks unless multiple signals were given. However, the main contradiction here is that if the whistle was used, Orla could only do one action per signal. But the scenario described in the testimony might require more than one action, which isn't possible. Wait, but Testimony 4 is about Orla knocking things down in a specific spot where people stand. The evidence about the whistle's limitations (one trick per signal) might conflict with the idea that Orla could have both knocked down the stuff and hit the captain unless multiple commands were given. But the evidence also says that anyone can use the whistle if they know the signals, so maybe someone gave a command that made Orla hit the captain.

Alternatively, let's check other possibilities. Evidence 16 is the Skull Rock, which was moved from the show pool. The autopsy report (Evidence 12) mentions blunt force trauma. If the victim hit the Skull Rock when he fell, maybe that's part of the cause. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Wait, Testimony 3 says Orla knows the spot where people stand for volleyball. If the volleyball spot is where the coins or other items were, maybe the coins (Evidence 9) being a murder weapon (blunt force) would be related. But the coins are scattered, which Rimes saw (Testimony 2). However, the autopsy says the cause was a brain contusion from blunt force, possibly the coins. But the contradiction might be elsewhere.

Looking at Testimony 3 and Evidence 3: the Orca Pool Diagram shows Pearls entered the staff corridor. Not sure how that's related. 

Wait, Testimony 0 by Rimes says he was in the staff room at 10:10 AM. But the Calendar (Evidence 8) mentions that Pearl's calendar was switched with Rimes's around 10:10, which might suggest he was elsewhere. But that's a possible contradiction between Testimony 0 and Evidence 8. However, Pearl says she met Rimes around 10:10 when he had the info desk announce she was lost, so Rimes's testimony that he was in the staff room at 10:10 might conflict with the calendar switch happening then. But according to the evidence, the calendar switch was around 10:10, which Pearl says was when she went into the prep room, leading to the mix-up. If Rimes was in the staff room at 10:10, how did he switch the calendars? That's a possible contradiction. So Evidence 8 and Testimony 0 would contradict each other. 

Wait, Testimony 0: Rimes says he was in the staff room at 10:10. But according to Evidence 8, Pearl ran into Rimes at 10:10, leading to the calendar switch. So if Rimes was in the staff room at 10:10, he couldn't have been with Pearl to switch the calendars. Therefore, this is a contradiction. 

So the answer would be Evidence 8 (the calendar) and Testimony 0. Because Rimes claims he was in the staff room at 10:10, but the calendar switch happened around 10:10 when Pearl met him, meaning he wasn't in the staff room then. That's a direct contradiction.

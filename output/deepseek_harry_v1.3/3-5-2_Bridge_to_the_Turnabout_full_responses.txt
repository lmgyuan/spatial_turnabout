Alright, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair, so I need to look through the provided information carefully.

First, let's review the testimonies given by Bikini. Testimony 3 says, "Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner." So Bikini is stating that Iris was wearing her usual attire, which includes the hood mentioned in Evidence 6. 

Now, looking at Evidence 6: Iris's Hood. The description mentions that Iris gave her hood to Phoenix before the lights-out bell the night of the crime. If Iris gave away her hood before the lights-out (which was at 10 PM according to the weather data), then she wouldn't have been wearing it when she came to the Inner Temple after that time. But Bikini's testimony claims she was dressed exactly as at dinner, which would include the hood. That's a contradiction because if she gave the hood away, she couldn't have been wearing it later when she went to the Inner Temple.

So the contradiction is between Bikini's Testimony 3 (saying Iris was dressed the same as at dinner, including the hood) and Evidence 6 (showing Iris had given the hood away before the crime time). Therefore, the correct pair should be Evidence 6 and Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair where the evidence contradicts a testimony. Let's start by going through each testimony and see if any of the evidences don't align with it.

Looking at the testimonies first. Testimony 3 by Bikini says that Iris didn't have her hood on during the incident. Now, checking the evidence related to Iris's hood. Evidence 6 is Iris's Hood, which states that Iris received the hood before the lights out bell the night of the crime and that it's supposed to protect from evil spirits. The testimony claims she wasn't wearing it, but if she had the hood, why wasn't she wearing it? Wait, but the evidence doesn't directly state that she was wearing it, just that she received it before the lights out. Hmm, maybe that's not a direct contradiction. Let me think again.

Testimony 5 says that the stabbing happened after Elise was pushed out the window. The autopsy report (Evidence 11) states the cause of death was a stab wound in the back, and the body fell 10 feet after death. So if the stabbing happened after being pushed out the window, that would mean the fall occurred before the stabbing. But the autopsy report says the body fell after death, which would mean she was stabbed first, then fell. That contradicts Bikini's Testimony 5. So according to Bikini's testimony, the stabbing was after the fall, but the autopsy says the fall happened after death (so after the stabbing). That's a contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 11. 

Another possible contradiction: Testimony 2 says Bikini saw Iris with the sword (Shichishito, Evidence 10), but Evidence 10 says the Shichishito had the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints but is not the actual murder weapon. The real weapon was the staff (Evidence 9) which had a hidden sword. So if Bikini saw Iris with the Shichishito, but that wasn't the murder weapon, maybe there's a contradiction here. But the testimony says "with that sword of all things," but the evidence says the Shichishito isn't the real weapon. So the contradiction here would be that Testimony 2 claims the sword (Shichishito) was used, but the evidence shows it's not the murder weapon. However, the testimony might not be directly about the murder weapon but just that she was seen with it. Maybe that's not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 (stabbing after being pushed) vs. Autopsy (stab caused death, then fell). That's a clear contradiction. So Evidence 11 (Autopsy Report) states that the cause of death was a stab in the back, and the body fell after death. So the stabbing happened first, leading to death, then the body fell. But Testimony 5 by Bikini says the stabbing occurred after she was pushed out the window (i.e., after the fall). So the order of events here contradicts. Therefore, Evidence 11 contradicts Testimony 5. That seems solid.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. I need to find a pair where a piece of evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, I'll go through the testimonies. The testimonies are from Bikini, Testimonies 0 to 5. Let's look at what each testimony says.

Testimony 0: Bikini says when she looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place. So she saw the sword already there.

Testimony 5: She says when she awoke, Mystic Ami was stabbing Mystic Elise through the back. Wait, that's an active stabbing action. But in Testimony 0, the sword was already in place. So maybe there's a contradiction here.

Now looking at the evidences. Let's check the autopsy report. Evidence 11 is Elise's Autopsy Report. It states the cause of death was loss of blood from a stab in the back, and the body fell 10 ft after death. Also, the victim's staff (Evidence 9) is mentioned to have a hidden sword which was the actual murder weapon, while Evidence 10 (Shichishito) is the apparent murder weapon but not the real one. The real weapon is the staff's sword.

Wait, but Testimony 5 says Bikini saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise. However, the autopsy says the cause was a stab in the back, which would be from behind. If Bikini saw the stabbing, then how does that align with the actual weapon? Also, if the Shichishito (Evidence 10) had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints but is not the murder weapon, then the real weapon is the staff's hidden sword. So if Bikini saw the stabbing with the Shichishito, but the real weapon was the staff's sword, that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 5, Bikini says she saw the stabbing happen. But the autopsy report says the body fell 10 ft after death. If she was stabbed in the back and then fell, maybe the sequence of events is important. If Bikini saw the stabbing, but the murder weapon (staff's sword) wasn't visible because it's hidden, then maybe the Shichishito being present with blood and fingerprints but not the actual weapon contradicts her testimony about seeing the stabbing with that sword.

Wait, Evidence 10 says the Shichishito is the apparent murder weapon, but it's not the actual one. The real weapon is the staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9). So if Bikini testifies that she saw someone stabbing with the Shichishito (since that's what was found with blood), but the actual murder was done with the staff's sword, then that's a contradiction. Because the Shichishito wasn't the real weapon, so even if she saw someone using it, that couldn't have caused the fatal wound. Therefore, Testimony 5 (seeing the stabbing) would be contradicted by the evidence that the real weapon was the staff's sword. But how does that directly link?

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 5: Bikini says she saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise through the back. But according to the autopsy report (Evidence 11), the stab was in the back. However, the real weapon was the staff's hidden sword. If Bikini saw the stabbing with the Shichishito (which is not the actual weapon), then her testimony is contradicted by Evidence 9 and 10. But maybe another angle.

Wait, Testimony 0 says the sword was already in place when she looked. Testimony 5 says she saw the stabbing. So maybe there's a contradiction between these two testimonies. But the question is about evidence contradicting testimony.

Alternatively, Testimony 2: Bikini says she saw the blade being drawn out smoothly. But if the murder weapon was the staff's sword hidden inside the staff, which has a crystal sphere (Evidence 16 found near the bridge with blood). The staff's sword was used, which was hidden, so perhaps the Shichishito (the seven-branched sword) wasn't the actual weapon. So if Bikini testifies about seeing the Shichishito being used (since that's the one with the blood and fingerprints), but the real weapon was the staff's sword, then her testimony is contradicted by the evidence that Shichishito wasn't the murder weapon.

But how does that specifically contradict? For example, if Bikini says she saw someone stabbing with the Shichishito (which is the apparent weapon), but the evidence shows that the real weapon was the staff's sword, then her testimony about the act of stabbing with that sword is contradicted by Evidence 10 stating that it's not the actual weapon.

Looking at Testimony 5: "And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!" If Bikini saw Mystic Ami using the Shichishito (since that's the one with fingerprints), but the real murder weapon was the staff's sword, then that's a contradiction. So the testimony claims the stabbing was with the Shichishito, but the evidence says that weapon wasn't the actual one. Therefore, the testimony is contradicted by Evidence 10, which states that the Shichishito had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints but is not the murder weapon. So if the murder wasn't done by the Shichishito, then Bikini's testimony of seeing the stabbing with that weapon is false.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (seeing the stabbing with the Shichishito) and Evidence 10 (Shichishito isn't the murder weapon, the staff's sword is). So the pair would be Evidence 10 and Testimony 5.

Wait, but Evidence 10 says "Had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but is not the murder weapon." So even though it has blood and prints, it's not the actual weapon. So if Bikini's testimony says she saw the stabbing happen with that sword, but the actual cause of death was the staff's sword, then her testimony is contradicted by Evidence 10. Because the murder weapon was the staff's sword, not the Shichishito, so the act she saw couldn't have caused the fatal wound.

Therefore, Evidence 10 contradicts Testimony 5. So the answer would be {"evidence": 10, "testimony": 5}.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 5}
Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, the user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The goal is to find one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a statement in the testimony. Let's start by reviewing the given testimonies and evidences.

First, looking at the testimonies from Bikini. Testimony 3 says, "It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!" Here, Bikini is referring to using a snowmobile to get to Dusky Bridge quickly. The key point here is the time it takes to travel to the bridge using a snowmobile versus walking.

Now, checking the evidences. Evidence 3 is the Hazakura Temple Map. If the map shows that the distance between locations is such that walking takes 15 minutes, but using a snowmobile reduces it to under 5, then maybe the map's details might conflict. Wait, but the map's description just mentions showing the temple and surrounding area. Maybe another evidence is more relevant.

Wait, Evidence 7 is the Weather Data. It mentions that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. The bridge would have been destroyed or damaged by the lightning. If Bikini's testimony (Testimony 3) suggests that someone could use a snowmobile to reach the bridge in under 5 minutes, but the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM, making it impassable after that time. So, if the murder happened around 11 PM (as per Testimony 0), then after 10:45 PM, the bridge was struck by lightning. Therefore, using the snowmobile to go to the bridge after 10:45 would be impossible because the bridge was destroyed. So Bikini's testimony about using the snowmobile to go to the bridge in under 5 minutes after 10:45 would contradict the fact that the bridge was struck by lightning and possibly unusable. Therefore, the testimony about using the snowmobile to go to the bridge quickly after the lightning strike is contradicted by the weather data showing the bridge was struck and possibly destroyed at 10:45.

Wait, but the problem is to find which testimony is contradicted by evidence. Let me check again. Testimony 3 by Bikini says that using a snowmobile takes less than 5 minutes to reach Dusky Bridge. However, if the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM and the fire from that took 30 minutes to go out (as per Evidence 7), then the bridge might have been inaccessible during that time. So if someone tried to use the bridge after 10:45 PM (like at 11 PM when the murder occurred), they couldn't have used it. Therefore, Bikini's Testimony 3 suggests that using the snowmobile allows quick access, but the Evidence 7 shows the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45, making it impossible to cross after that time. Therefore, the testimony about the snowmobile's travel time is contradicted by the evidence that the bridge was destroyed by lightning before the murder time (11 PM). So the pair would be Evidence 7 and Testimony 3.

Wait, but Evidence 7 is the weather data. Let me confirm: The weather data states that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. The fire started and went out around 30 minutes later, so the bridge would be on fire from 10:45 until about 11:15 PM. The murder happened at 11 PM. So if the bridge was on fire, you couldn't cross it. Therefore, Testimony 3's claim that the snowmobile can get to the bridge in under 5 minutes (implying it's possible to cross) contradicts the fact that the bridge was struck and possibly impassable at 10:45. Therefore, Bikini's Testimony 3 is contradicted by Evidence 7.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair where the evidence and testimony don't align.

First, I'll go through the testimonies provided. The testimonies are from Butz (Larry Butz). Let's look at each one:

Testimony 0: Larry says he went to the shack around 9 PM, so it was about 10:30 PM when... Hmm, maybe he's talking about the time he was there. Wait, the time here might be conflicting with something else.

Testimony 1: He mentions a white flash blinding him while he was under his bedding. The white flash could be lightning. Let's check the weather data in the evidences.

Evidence 7 (Weather Data) states that there was lightning from 10 PM to around 11 PM, and specifically mentions that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. So if Larry saw the flash at a certain time, does that match up?

Testimony 2: Larry says he looked out the window and saw Dusky Bridge on fire. Testimony 3 says there was still some thunder, so he went to check. Then Testimony 5 says he arrived at the bridge and Nick (Phoenix) showed up less than a minute later.

Looking at the timeline: According to Evidence 7, the lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM. The fire started then, and took about 30 minutes to go out. The murder was discovered at 11:06 PM, as per the note in Evidence 7. 

Now, Larry's Testimony 5 says he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. But according to the crime photo and Phoenix's timeline, he found the body at 11:06 PM. If Larry arrived at the bridge after seeing the fire (which started at 10:45 PM), and then Phoenix arrived a minute later, that would place Phoenix there around 10:46 PM. But the murder's discovery was at 11:06 PM. There's a 20-minute discrepancy here. That's a contradiction.

But wait, let's check Testimony 0 again. He says he went to the shack at around 9 PM, so it would have been about 10:30 PM... Not sure how that fits. Maybe the timeline in the testimonies is conflicting with the weather data's timing.

Wait, Testimony 3 says "there was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out." Thunder would be during the lightning period. The weather data says lightning (and thus thunder) was from 10 PM to 11 PM. So if Larry went to check the fire right after seeing the lightning (which struck at 10:45), then he would have arrived at the bridge around 10:45-10:50. But Phoenix's arrival time as per the evidence is 11:06 PM. So Larry's claim that Phoenix arrived less than a minute later (Testimony 5) contradicts the timeline because there's a 15-20 minute gap between the lightning strike and the discovery of the body.

Additionally, in Evidence 7, there's a note from Bikini saying she saw the murder around 11 PM, which aligns with the 11:06 PM discovery. But Larry's testimony suggests he and Phoenix were at the bridge much earlier. Therefore, Testimony 5 (Larry saying Phoenix arrived less than a minute later) contradicts the Weather Data (Evidence 7) which shows the fire started at 10:45 and was discovered at 11:06. The time between the lightning strike and the discovery is about 21 minutes, so Larry and Phoenix couldn't have been there just a minute apart around 10:45-10:46. This is a contradiction.

Another angle: Testimony 2 says Larry saw the bridge on fire when he looked out the window. The fire started at 10:45 PM due to lightning. If Larry saw it then, and went to check, arriving a few minutes later (say 10:50), but the body was found at 11:06 PM. However, Phoenix's arrival is at 11:06 PM. So Larry's claim that Phoenix arrived less than a minute after him would mean Phoenix arrived around 10:51, which contradicts the actual discovery time. Therefore, Testimony 5 (evidence 5) contradicts Evidence 7's timeline.

So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Butz's claim that Phoenix arrived less than a minute after he did) and the Weather Data (Evidence 7) which shows the timeline from lightning strike to discovery is about 21 minutes. Therefore, Larry's timeline doesn't add up because if he arrived at the bridge around 10:45-10:50, Phoenix arriving a minute later would be before 11 PM, but the body was found at 11:06 PM. Hence, the evidence (7) and testimony (5) contradict.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair. Let me go through the testimonies and evidences step by step.

First, look at the testimonies. Testimony 2 by Butz says he saw Iris flying with her white hood fluttering. But evidence 6 is Iris's Hood, which she gave to Phoenix before the lights out bell at 10 PM. If Iris gave her hood to Phoenix before the crime, then she wouldn't be wearing it during the time Butz claims he saw her. So if Butz saw someone with a white hood, it can't be Iris because she didn't have the hood anymore. That's a contradiction. 

Wait, the timing here is important. The lights out bell was at 10 PM, and the crime happened later. So Iris was supposed to be in her room from 10 PM onwards according to her testimony (Evidence 12). But Butz's Testimony 2 says he saw Iris flying with the hood, which she had already given away. That definitely contradicts. The hood was in Phoenix's possession, so the person Butz saw couldn't have been Iris. Therefore, the evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) contradicts Testimony 2 (Butz seeing Iris with the hood).

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 2}

Alright, let's try to figure this out. So, I need to find which evidence contradicts a testimony. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all given. Let's start by looking through the testimonies first, particularly Bikini's since there are several from her.

Testimony 3 from Bikini says that Iris came to the Inner Temple dressed exactly as she had been at dinner. But according to Evidence 6, Iris's Hood, Iris always wears her hood, which is supposed to protect from evil spirits. However, if Iris was wearing the hood during dinner and then when she came to the Inner Temple, but in the photo of Elise (Evidence 5), Elise was wearing a white robe and hood. Wait, maybe there's a mix-up here. Wait, no. Let me check again.

Wait, Testimony 3 says Iris was dressed exactly as at dinner. So if during dinner Iris was wearing her hood, then when she came to the Inner Temple, she should still have the hood. However, Evidence 6 says that Iris's Hood was received before the lights out bell the night of the crime. The lights out bell was rung at 10 PM according to Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12). So if Iris gave her hood to someone before 10 PM, then she couldn't have been wearing it when she came to the Inner Temple. But Bikini's Testimony 3 states that Iris was dressed exactly as at dinner. If she was supposed to have her hood on at dinner, but had already given it away before 10 PM (lights out bell), then there's a contradiction here. Because Iris would have been without the hood when she went to the Inner Temple, but Bikini says she was dressed the same as at dinner. That could be the contradiction. 

So, the key is that Iris's Hood (Evidence 6) was received before the lights out bell at 10 PM. If Iris gave her hood away before 10 PM, then during dinner (which would be before 10 PM), she was wearing the hood. But after 10 PM, when the lights out bell rang, she wouldn't have the hood. However, Bikini's Testimony 3 says that when Iris came to the Inner Temple, she was dressed exactly as at dinner. But if the hood was received (taken away) before the lights out bell (10 PM), then when Iris went to the Inner Temple after 10 PM, she wouldn't have the hood, which contradicts Bikini's statement that she was dressed the same as at dinner (with the hood). Therefore, Evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) contradicts Testimony 3 (Bikini's statement about Iris's attire). 

Another possibility: Check the timing. The crime happened between 10-11 PM. The lights out bell was at 10 PM. Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room after 10 PM. But Bikini's Testimony 3 is about Iris coming to the Inner Temple, which would have to be after 10 PM because the lights out was at 10. If Iris was supposed to be in her room after 10 PM, but Bikini says Iris came to the Inner Temple, that's a contradiction with Iris's own testimony. But wait, the problem is between evidence and testimony. So maybe the contradiction is between Bikini's Testimony 3 and Iris's Hood (Evidence 6). Since the hood was received before 10 PM, if Iris was at the Inner Temple after 10 PM without the hood, but Bikini says she was dressed as at dinner (with the hood), that's a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 6 and Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by reviewing the given information.

First, the characters and their relationships. There's a murder involving Elise Deauxnim, and various people are involved, like Bikini, Iris, Larry, etc. The key here is to look at the testimonies and see which one is contradicted by the evidence.

Looking at the testimonies, Bikini has several statements. Testimony 3 says, "Iris didn't have her hood on." But looking at the evidence, Evidence 6 is Iris's Hood, which mentions that Iris was wearing it before the lights out bell the night of the crime. The note says she received the hood before the lights out at 10 PM. However, the crime happened later. Wait, the lights out bell was at 10 PM according to Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12). Bikini's testimony 3 is about seeing Iris without the hood during the crime. But according to Evidence 6, Iris had the hood on before the lights out (10 PM). However, the murder occurred between 10-11 PM. So if Iris was in her room from 10 PM onward (as per her testimony), but Bikini saw her without the hood during the crime, there's a contradiction here. Because if Iris was in her room, how could Bikini see her without the hood in the courtyard? Wait, maybe Bikini is lying or mistaken. Wait, Bikini's testimonies 0-5 are about the time around 11 PM. Testimony 0 says she finished her bath around 11 and went back. Then she heard a noise and saw Iris in the courtyard. Testimony 3 says Iris wasn't wearing the hood then. But Evidence 6 states that Iris had the hood on when she received it before lights out (10 PM). If Iris was supposed to be in her room after 10 PM, how did she end up in the courtyard without the hood? Unless someone else was impersonating her. But the contradiction here is between Bikini's testimony 3 (Iris wasn't wearing the hood) and the fact that Iris's Hood (Evidence 6) was received before the crime. Wait, but the hood's description says Iris was wearing it before lights out. The murder happened after 10 PM. So if Bikini saw Iris without the hood during the crime, that contradicts the evidence that she had the hood. Unless the hood was taken off after 10 PM. But the evidence says she received it before the lights out. So if Iris was in her room all night (as per her own testimony), she should still have the hood. Therefore, Bikini's testimony 3, which claims Iris wasn't wearing the hood during the crime, contradicts Evidence 6, which states that Iris had the hood when she received it before 10 PM. However, if Iris was in her room, how could Bikini see her without the hood? That suggests that the person Bikini saw wasn't Iris, hence the contradiction. Therefore, the testimony that Iris wasn't wearing the hood (Testimony 3) is contradicted by Evidence 6 that she had the hood on before the crime and was supposed to be in her room. Alternatively, perhaps the hood was found, implying she wasn't wearing it. Wait, Evidence 6 is Iris's Hood, which says she received it before lights out. So she had it. But Bikini saw her without it. Therefore, that's a contradiction. So the evidence and testimony that contradict are Evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) and Testimony 3 (Bikini's statement that Iris didn't have her hood on). That's the pair.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me go through all the provided information step by step.

First, I'll look at the testimonies given by Bikini. There are six of them (Testimony 0 to 5). Let me list them out again:

Testimony 0: "When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place."
Testimony 1: "Thinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise."
Testimony 2: "I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out."
Testimony 3: "I've never seen so much blood before..."
Testimony 4: "That's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?"
Testimony 5: "And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!"

Now, looking at the evidences. The key here is to find a contradiction between a specific testimony and a piece of evidence. Let's go through the evidences one by one and see if any clash with Bikini's statements.

Evidence 11 is Elise's Autopsy Report: Time of death between 10-11 PM, cause is blood loss from a stab in the back. The body fell 10 ft. after death.

Testimony 5 from Bikini says that when she awoke, she saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise through the back. However, the autopsy report states that the cause of death was a stab in the back. But how does this contradict? Wait, the contradiction might not be here. Let's check other evidences.

Evidence 10 is the Shichishito, which is the apparent murder weapon with the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints. However, the note says it's not the actual murder weapon. So if Bikini's testimony mentions the sword being used, but the actual murder weapon was different, that could be a contradiction. But Testimony 5 says "stabbing", which could be with the Shichishito. But the Shichishito's description says it's not the murder weapon. So if the testimony claims the sword was used, but evidence says it's not, that's a contradiction. Wait, Testimony 0 says "the sword was already in place" when she looked. If the Shichishito wasn't the actual weapon, but Bikini's testimony refers to that sword being present, that might not directly contradict. Hmm.

Another angle: Testimony 5 says she saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise through the back. But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) says the cause was a stab in the back. That seems to align. Wait, unless the autopsy report indicates something else. Wait, maybe the timing. Let me check the weather data (Evidence 7). The snow stopped around 10:50 PM, lightning until 11 PM. The autopsy says time of death is 10-11 PM. The staff (Evidence 9) has a hidden sword, which only Gumshoe and the user know about. The crystal sphere (Evidence 16) has blood and came from the staff. Maybe the real murder weapon was the staff's hidden sword, not the Shichishito. So if Bikini claims the stabbing was with the Shichishito (Testimony 5), but the actual weapon was the staff's sword, that's a contradiction. However, Testimony 5 doesn't specify the weapon. Let me check Testimony 5 again. It just says "stabbing through the back", which could be with any weapon. So that might not be the contradiction.

Looking at Testimony 0: Bikini says the sword was already in place when she looked. If the sword (Shichishito) was already there, but the real murder weapon was the staff's hidden sword, then the presence of the Shichishito at the scene could be a planted evidence, which would contradict Testimony 0 if the actual stabbing happened with a different weapon. But how does that directly contradict?

Wait, Evidence 10 says the Shichishito had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints but is not the murder weapon. So if Bikini's testimony (Testimony 0) says the sword was already in place, maybe implying it was used, but the evidence says it's not the actual weapon. That could be a contradiction. But Testimony 0 says "the sword was already in place", not necessarily that it was used in the stabbing. So maybe not.

Looking at Testimony 2: "I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out." If this blade was the Shichishito, but Evidence 10 says it's not the murder weapon, then that's a contradiction. Because Testimony 2 claims the blade was used (plunged into the victim), but the evidence says that the Shichishito wasn't the actual weapon. So Testimony 2 and Evidence 10 would contradict. However, Evidence 10 states that the Shichishito "had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but is not the murder weapon." So even though it's not the murder weapon, it has the blood. Maybe the real weapon was the staff's sword (Evidence 9), which has no crystal sphere, but the crystal sphere (Evidence 16) was found with blood. So if the staff's sword was used, but Bikini saw the Shichishito being used, that would be a contradiction. So if Testimony 2 refers to the Shichishito being used (the blade being drawn out), but Evidence 10 says it's not the murder weapon, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 2 and Evidence 10 contradict.

Alternatively, Testimony 5: Bikini says she saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise through the back. But if the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the cause was a stab in the back, that aligns. Unless the timing is different. Let's check the timeline. The weather data (Evidence 7) says the lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. The fire started and went out after 30 minutes. The autopsy time is 10-11 PM. If the stabbing happened after 10:45 PM, but Bikini's testimony about the events might conflict with the timing. But I don't see a direct contradiction here.

Another possible contradiction: Testimony 12 (Iris's Testimony) says she was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. But maybe another evidence contradicts that. However, the problem asks for a pair between Bikini's testimonies and any evidence. So focusing on Bikini's testimonies.

Wait, Evidence 5 is the Photo of Elise, showing her holding a staff with a crystal sphere. The staff (Evidence 9) doesn't have the crystal sphere, which is found near Dusky Bridge (Evidence 16). So the crystal sphere was detached. If the staff's sword was used, which is hidden, then the murder weapon might be that. However, Bikini's testimonies talk about a sword (Shichishito) being used. If the Shichishito wasn't the murder weapon (as per Evidence 10), but Bikini's testimony says she saw the stabbing with it, that's a contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 5 says "stabbing through the back", but if the actual murder weapon was the staff's sword, then Bikini's testimony about seeing the stabbing with the Shichishito (assuming that's the sword she refers to) would be incorrect. However, the testimonies don't specify which weapon was used. So maybe that's not the contradiction.

Let me think again. Testimony 0: "When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place." If the sword (Shichishito) was already in place, but the murder was committed with the staff's sword, then perhaps the presence of the Shichishito is a red herring. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Alternatively, Evidence 11 says the body fell 10 ft after death. If Bikini saw the stabbing happen, but the body fell after death, perhaps there's a contradiction in the positioning. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: Testimony 5 claims Bikini saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise, but if the autopsy report says the stab was in the back, which requires the attacker to be behind the victim. Depending on how the testimony describes the act, but that's not necessarily contradictory.

Wait, Evidence 10 says the Shichishito had the victim's blood but isn't the murder weapon. So someone might have used the Shichishito to make it look like the murder weapon, but the real one was the staff's sword. Therefore, if Bikini testifies that she saw the Shichishito being used (Testimony 2 or 5), but Evidence 10 says it's not the murder weapon, that's a contradiction. Let's look at Testimony 2 again: "I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out." If that blade is the Shichishito, but it's not the murder weapon, then this testimony is false. So Testimony 2 and Evidence 10 contradict each other. Because the testimony claims the blade (Shichishito) was used to stab, but the evidence says it's not the murder weapon. Therefore, the correct pair would be evidence 10 and testimony 2.

Wait, but the Shichishito is Evidence 10. The description says it's the apparent murder weapon but actually isn't. So if Bikini's Testimony 2 says she saw the blade being plunged in, that blade would be the Shichishito. But since Evidence 10 states it's not the murder weapon, then Testimony 2 is incorrect. Therefore, this is a contradiction.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be evidence 10 and testimony 2.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 2}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony. Let me go through each testimony and check against the evidences.

Looking at Testimony 5 from Bikini: She says Iris could have done it because she can drive a snowmobile. But looking at the evidence, let's see. Evidence 14 is the Tracks Photo showing one track leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. Also, Testimony 2 says Bikini saw tracks indicating the snowmobile was used. Now, if the tracks only show one set, that would mean the snowmobile was used once. But using a snowmobile to go to the bridge and back would require two trips: going there and coming back. So if there's only one track, that implies the snowmobile was only used once, which contradicts the idea that someone could go to the bridge, commit the crime, and come back, because that would leave two tracks. Therefore, Testimony 5 suggests Iris could have used the snowmobile, but the single track in Evidence 14 shows only a one-way trip. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 14. But wait, the user said to output one pair. Alternatively, maybe another contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 3 says it takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge but less than 5 using a snowmobile. Evidence 14's tracks show one track. If the murderer used the snowmobile to go to the bridge, then there should be tracks going both ways. But the photo only shows one track. So if someone used the snowmobile to go there, they would leave tracks going and coming back. But the photo shows only one track. Therefore, Testimony 3's statement about the time saved via snowmobile would be contradicted by Evidence 14's single track, because using the snowmobile would require two tracks. So if the tracks only show one, then maybe the person went one way but didn't come back, which would mean they couldn't have returned in time. Wait, but the murder happened around 10-11 PM. Let me check other evidence. Evidence 7 (Weather Data) shows that snow stopped around 10:50 PM. So any tracks made after that would not be covered by snow. If the snowmobile was used after 10:50, the tracks wouldn't be covered. But the tracks photo (Evidence 14) is from that night, showing one track. If the snowmobile was used once, going to the bridge, and then maybe the person didn't return because the bridge was destroyed by lightning at 10:45 PM. Wait, the lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45, causing a fire. The bridge was destroyed. So after 10:45, you can't cross back. Therefore, if someone took the snowmobile to the bridge after 10:45, they couldn't return. But the murder was at 10-11 PM. The victim's time of death is 10-11 PM. The bridge was struck at 10:45, so if the murderer went to the bridge after 10:45, they couldn't return. But the tracks in Evidence 14 are from the snowmobile. So if the tracks only show one way, that would mean the person went to the bridge and couldn't return. But Bikini's testimony 5 says Iris could have used the snowmobile (implying she went and came back). But if the tracks are only one way, that contradicts that she came back. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Iris could have used the snowmobile) and Evidence 14 (only one track), because using the snowmobile to go and come back would need two tracks, but there's only one. Therefore, the testimony that Iris could have used the snowmobile is contradicted by the single track in Evidence 14. Alternatively, Testimony 3 says using the snowmobile takes less than 5 minutes, but if you can only go one way because the bridge is destroyed, then the time aspect is still possible. Hmm. Wait, maybe another angle. Let's check the timing. The murder happened between 10 and 11 PM. The snow stopped at 10:50. If the tracks were made after the snow stopped, they wouldn't be covered. The tracks photo shows a single track leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. So if someone took the snowmobile to the bridge after 10:50, the track wouldn't be covered. But the bridge was destroyed at 10:45. Wait, the lightning struck at 10:45, causing the fire. So after 10:45, the bridge was on fire and eventually destroyed. So if the tracks were made after 10:45, the person couldn't come back. Therefore, the tracks would only be one way. So if someone used the snowmobile to go to the bridge after 10:45, they couldn't return. Therefore, Testimony 5 says Iris could have done it using the snowmobile, but if she did, she couldn't return because the bridge was destroyed. But the tracks would show only one way. So Bikini's Testimony 5 suggests Iris could have used the snowmobile to go and come back, but Evidence 14 shows only one track, implying she couldn't come back. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 14. Alternatively, maybe Testimony 2 (Bikini saw tracks indicating snowmobile was used) and Evidence 14 (only one track). But the testimony says "tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used". If the snowmobile was used once, then the tracks would be one way. But the contradiction here is that if someone used the snowmobile to go to the bridge and come back, there would be two tracks, but the photo only shows one. Therefore, Testimony 3 says it takes less than 5 minutes using the snowmobile, implying a round trip would be under 10 minutes, but Evidence 14 only shows one track, so the return trip's tracks would have been covered by snow if done before the snow stopped. Wait, the snow stopped at 10:50 PM. If someone took the snowmobile to the bridge at, say, 10:40 (during snowfall), then the tracks would be covered by the snow that continued until 10:50. So going there at 10:40, tracks would be covered. Then returning at 10:45 (before snow stopped), the return tracks would also be covered. Therefore, the tracks photo (Evidence 14) taken that night would show no tracks, but it shows one track. So maybe the track was made after the snow stopped. For example, if someone used the snowmobile after 10:50, the tracks wouldn't be covered. So if the track is leading to the bridge, made after 10:50, but the bridge was destroyed at 10:45. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the bridge was destroyed by lightning at 10:45, then after that, you can't cross. So if someone used the snowmobile after 10:45, they would go to the bridge but couldn't cross. Therefore, the tracks would be from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge, made after 10:45, but the person couldn't return. So the tracks would be one way. Therefore, if Bikini's Testimony 5 says Iris could have used the snowmobile to go and come back, but the tracks show only one way, then that's a contradiction. So the pair is Testimony 5 and Evidence 14. Alternatively, Testimony 3 (snowmobile takes less than 5 minutes) and Evidence 14's single track. If the snowmobile was used to go and come back, but the tracks only show one, that's a contradiction. But the tracks could have been made after the snow stopped (post 10:50), so the return trip tracks would still be visible. Wait, but if they went after 10:50, then both tracks (to and from) would be visible. But Evidence 14 shows only one track. So if the person went and came back, there should be two tracks, but the photo only shows one. Therefore, Testimony 3's claim that the snowmobile can be used for a quick trip (implying round trip) is contradicted by the single track in Evidence 14. Wait, but Testimony 3 is about the time it takes, not the tracks. The contradiction would be between Testimony 4 (maybe they threw the weapon into the river and came back while I was knocked out) and the tracks. But Testimony 4 is Bikini's hypothesis. Alternatively, Testimony 5 (Iris can drive snowmobile) and the tracks. But the main contradiction is that using the snowmobile to commit the crime and return would require two tracks, but only one is present. Therefore, Testimony 5 (Iris could have done it using the snowmobile) is contradicted by Evidence 14 (only one track exists). Therefore, the correct pair is evidence 14 and testimony 5. But looking at the evidence list, Evidence 14 is "Tracks Photo" showing one track. Testimony 5 is Bikini's statement that Iris could have done it because she can drive a snowmobile. So the contradiction is that if Iris used the snowmobile to go to the bridge and back, there should be two tracks, but the photo shows only one. Hence, the evidence (14) contradicts testimony (5). Therefore, the answer should be {"evidence": 14, "testimony":5}.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. Let's start by going through the provided information.

First, the characters: There are several, including Larry Butz (Character 7), who is involved in some testimonies. The key here is to focus on the testimonies given by Butz and cross-reference them with the evidence list.

Looking at the testimonies from Butz (Testimony 0 to 6):

- Testimony 0: He went to the shack around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM.
- Testimony 1: He was under bedding when a white flash blinded him.
- Testimony 2: He looked out the window and saw Dusky Bridge on fire.
- Testimony 3: There was still some thunder, but he went to check it out.
- Testimony 4: He ran into Nick (Phoenix Wright) then.
- Testimony 5: He arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.
- Testimony 6: He thought he'd never see something so big burning.

Now, the evidence. Let's check the weather data (Evidence 7), which states that lightning occurred from 10 to approx. 11 PM. Specifically, lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. Also, the snow stopped around 10:50 PM.

Testimony 3 says Butz went to check the fire despite some thunder still happening. But the weather data indicates lightning (and thus thunder) was until around 11 PM. However, Testimony 5 says Butz arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. But Phoenix Wright (Nick) fell from the bridge and was hospitalized. According to the weather data, the lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM. If the bridge caught fire then, and the fire lasted about 30 minutes (from 10:45 to 11:15?), but according to Testimony 5, Larry claims he arrived at the bridge and Nick was there shortly after. But Phoenix was hospitalized after falling, so maybe the timing is off. Wait, but Phoenix's fall is part of the scenario. Let's check the bridge photo (Evidence 21) and the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) found near the bridge with blood, which is from the victim's staff. 

Wait, the key contradiction might be in the timing. Testimony 5 says Larry arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. However, according to the weather data, lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM. If the fire started then, Larry's timeline might conflict. Also, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) states the victim died between 10-11 PM. But let's focus on Larry's testimonies. 

Wait, Testimony 0: He went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM. Wait, that seems like a time discrepancy. If he went to the shack at 9 PM, how does that translate to 10:30 PM? Maybe he's saying he arrived there at 9 PM and stayed until 10:30? Or maybe that's a mistake. Let me check the exact testimony again.

Testimony 0: "I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM..." Hmm, that's confusing. If he went to the shack at 9 PM, then why does he mention 10:30 PM? Maybe he's saying he was there from 9 PM until 10:30 PM? Or perhaps he's mixing up times. 

Wait, the weather data shows that snow stopped around 10:50 PM. The lightning was from 10 PM to 11 PM. So the bridge was struck at 10:45 PM. If Larry saw the bridge on fire (Testimony 2) and then went to check (Testimony 3), he must have done so after 10:45 PM. But according to Testimony 5, he arrived at the bridge and Nick arrived a minute later. But Phoenix Wright fell from the bridge and was hospitalized. How could Nick (Phoenix) be there if he was hospitalized? Unless this is a different timeline. Wait, maybe Phoenix was present before the fall. Let me check the characters: Phoenix is hospitalized after falling from the bridge. So if the crime occurred when Phoenix was there, but according to the testimonies, Larry met Nick at the bridge after the fire started. But if Phoenix was already hospitalized, this is a contradiction. But I need to check the exact timeline.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 5: Larry claims he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. But according to the weather data, the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM, which started the fire. The fire lasted about 30 minutes. If Larry went to check the bridge after seeing it on fire (Testimony 2 and 3), then he would have gone around 10:45 PM. However, Phoenix fell from the bridge and was hospitalized, which must have happened that night. So if Phoenix was at the bridge when the fire started (10:45 PM), then Larry's testimony of meeting Nick there would make sense if Phoenix fell then. But the problem is that Phoenix is hospitalized, so he couldn't have been there later. However, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Wait, Testimony 5: Larry says he arrived at the bridge and Nick arrived less than a minute later. But if the bridge was on fire due to lightning at 10:45 PM, and the fire started then, how could Larry and Nick both be there? Unless the bridge was still intact. But the bridge photo (Evidence 21) taken the next morning shows the bridge's condition. If the bridge was destroyed by the fire, then maybe Larry and Nick couldn't have been on it after 10:45 PM. Alternatively, maybe the fire was on the bridge, but they approached it. 

Another angle: Evidence 16 is the Crystal Sphere found near Dusky Bridge with blood, which came from the victim's staff. The victim's staff (Evidence 9) originally had the sphere but it's missing. The murder weapon was the Shichishito (Evidence 10), but it's stated that it's not the actual murder weapon. The real weapon might be the dagger (Evidence 19) with blood not matching the victim. Wait, no, the autopsy report says the cause was a stab in the back. The Shichishito had the victim's blood but isn't the murder weapon. Hmm.

But back to testimonies and evidence. Let's look for contradictions. For example, Larry's Testimony 0 says he went to the shack around 9 PM, which he says would be about 10:30 PM. That's confusing. Maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the time he mentions conflicts with the weather data. For example, if he claims to have been at the shack until 10:30 PM, but the snow stopped at 10:50 PM. Wait, the snow was from 7 PM to 10:50 PM. If he was at the shack until 10:30 PM, then when he left, it was still snowing. But his testimony about going to check the bridge after seeing the fire (which was at 10:45 PM) would have been during the snow. But maybe that's not a contradiction. 

Alternatively, Testimony 3: Larry says there was still some thunder when he went to check the bridge. The weather data says lightning (and thunder) occurred until around 11 PM. So that's consistent. 

Wait, let's check Testimony 5 again. Larry says he arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later. But according to the weather data, the lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM, starting the fire. If Larry saw the bridge on fire (Testimony 2) and went to check (Testimony 3), he would have arrived at the bridge shortly after 10:45 PM. But Phoenix (Nick) would have been there around the same time. However, Phoenix fell from the bridge and was hospitalized. So if Phoenix fell during the fire, then Larry's testimony about meeting him there would make sense, but the problem is that Phoenix is hospitalized. Unless the timeline is such that Phoenix fell before the fire, but that's unclear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and the fact that the bridge was struck by lightning and on fire. If the bridge was on fire, how could both Larry and Nick be on it? Unless the fire started after they were there. Wait, the fire started at 10:45 PM. If Larry arrived at the bridge and then Nick came a minute later, maybe the lightning strike happened while they were there. But according to the weather data, the lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM. So if they were on the bridge at that time, they would have been in danger. However, the fire started then and lasted 30 minutes. 

Another angle: The burnt letter (Evidence 18) is from Morgan Fey. The Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) is linked to the victim's staff. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) has the victim's blood but isn't the murder weapon. The real murder weapon might be the dagger (Evidence 19), but the blood doesn't match. 

But perhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Larry claims he and Nick were at the bridge) and the fact that Phoenix fell from the bridge and was hospitalized, implying he couldn't have been there after the fall. Wait, but when did Phoenix fall? The bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM, and the fire started then. Phoenix fell from the bridge and was hospitalized. If the fall happened during the fire, then Larry's testimony about meeting Nick there would be accurate. However, perhaps the timeline contradicts this. Alternatively, maybe the bridge was destroyed by the fire, making it impossible for them to be there after 10:45 PM. 

Wait, the weather data says the lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM, and the fire lasted around 30 minutes. If the bridge was on fire for 30 minutes, maybe it collapsed afterward. So if Larry and Nick were on the bridge after 10:45 PM, that's impossible if the bridge was already burning. But that's speculative. 

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo), which shows one track leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If Larry and Nick both went to the bridge, there should be multiple tracks, but the photo only shows one. That could contradict their testimonies of both being there. But the Tracks Photo is taken that night, showing one track. If both Larry and Nick went to the bridge, there should be two sets of tracks, unless they walked the same path. But that's possible. 

Another possible contradiction is Testimony 5 where Larry says he arrived at the bridge and Nick came less than a minute later. But according to the Crime Photo (Evidence 13) or other evidence, maybe the bridge's condition makes this impossible. However, without more details on the Crime Photo, it's hard to say. 

Wait, let's check the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16). It was found near Dusky Bridge with blood, and it's from the victim's staff. The victim's staff (Evidence 9) had the crystal sphere missing. The staff was carried by Elise, who was wearing a white robe and hood in the photo (Evidence 5). The murder occurred in the courtyard (Evidence 13), and the body fell 10 ft after death (Autopsy Report, Evidence 11). 

Wait, the victim's autopsy says the time of death was between 10-11 PM, cause was stab in the back. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) had her blood and the suspect's prints but isn't the murder weapon. The real weapon might be the dagger (Evidence 19), but the blood doesn't match. So the actual murder weapon is unclear. 

But back to the original question: which evidence contradicts which testimony. Let me focus again. 

Testimony 5: Larry claims he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. But according to the weather data (Evidence 7), the lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM. If the bridge was struck by lightning and caught fire at 10:45, then how could Larry and Nick be on the bridge after that? Unless the lightning strike was the cause of the fire, and they arrived afterward. But the fire lasted 30 minutes. If they arrived shortly after 10:45, maybe the bridge was still on fire. However, the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows only one track leading to the bridge. If both Larry and Nick went there, there should be two tracks unless they followed the same path. The photo shows one track, which contradicts their joint presence. 

So the contradiction would be between Testimony 5 (Larry and Nick both at the bridge) and Evidence 14 (only one set of tracks). Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 5. But let me check the numbers. Evidence 14 is Tracks Photo (number 14), Testimony 5 is Testimony 5. 

Alternatively, maybe another contradiction: Testimony 0 says Larry was at the shack around 9 PM, which he says would be about 10:30 PM. That seems like a time discrepancy. If he went there at 9 PM and stayed until 10:30 PM, but the snow stopped at 10:50 PM. However, this might not directly contradict unless there's evidence about the shack's location or timing. 

Alternatively, Testimony 6: Larry says he thought he'd never see something so big burning. But the fire from the bridge lasted only 30 minutes, so maybe the size is exaggerated. Not sure. 

Another angle: The victim's staff (Evidence 9) has a hidden sword, and the Shichishito (Evidence 10) is a sword but isn't the murder weapon. The real weapon might be the dagger (Evidence 19), but blood doesn't match. The Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) has blood and is from the staff, suggesting the staff was used. But the autopsy says cause was stab in the back. 

But focusing back on testimonies and evidence. The most likely contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Larry and Nick at the bridge) and the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) showing only one set of tracks. So if two people went to the bridge, there should be two tracks, but the photo shows one. Hence, the evidence (14) contradicts testimony (5). 

But wait, the Tracks Photo's description says "one track is shown leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge." If both Larry and Nick went from the Main Gate to the bridge, they could have walked the same path, making a single track. So maybe that's not a contradiction. 

Hmm. Then another possibility: Testimony 2 says Larry looked out the window and saw the bridge on fire. But according to the weather data, the lightning struck at 10:45 PM. If Larry was in his room until 10 PM (Iris's Testimony, Evidence 12 says she rang the bell at 10 PM and was in her room). Wait, Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) says she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and stayed in her room. So after 10 PM, everyone should be in their rooms. But Larry's Testimony 0 says he was at the shack until 10:30 PM. If the lights out was at 10 PM, Larry shouldn't have been out. So Testimony 0 contradicts Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12). But the question is about evidence and testimony contradicting, not testimony vs testimony. 

Wait, the user is asking for evidence and testimony that contradict each other. So the testimony (from Butz) must contradict an evidence item. 

Looking at Testimony 5: Larry arrived at the bridge, and Nick came less than a minute later. But Phoenix (Nick) fell from the bridge and was hospitalized. If the bridge was on fire at 10:45 PM, and Phoenix fell then, how could he have been there after? Unless the fall happened after they met. But according to the scenario, Phoenix is hospitalized, so he couldn't have been present at the bridge after the fall. Therefore, Larry's Testimony 5 claims he met Nick at the bridge after the fire started, but Phoenix was already hospitalized, which is a contradiction. However, the evidence about Phoenix's hospitalization is part of the character description (Character 8), not an evidence item. The user might consider character descriptions as part of the context. 

But the problem states that we must use the list of evidences and testimonies provided. So, if there's an evidence that indicates Phoenix was not present, then Testimony 5 would contradict that. However, Phoenix's hospitalization is mentioned in his character description (Character 8), which is part of the given data. But the evidence list does not include his hospitalization. So maybe that's not directly an evidence item. 

Alternatively, the burnt letter (Evidence 18) is from Morgan Fey. The Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) has blood. The dagger (Evidence 19) has blood not matching the victim. 

Wait, another angle: The victim's autopsy (Evidence 11) says the body fell 10 ft after death. If the murder occurred in the courtyard (Evidence 13), perhaps the fall was from a height. But how does that relate to the testimonies? 

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 2: Larry says he looked out the window and saw Dusky Bridge on fire. But according to the weather data (Evidence 7), the lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM. If Larry saw the bridge on fire at that time, then his Testimony 3 says he went to check despite some thunder. But the thunder was ongoing until 11 PM, which is consistent. 

Wait, Testimony 0: "I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM..." This seems contradictory. If he went to the shack at 9 PM, why does he say it would have been about 10:30 PM? Maybe he's saying that the time he arrived at the shack was around 9 PM, and he stayed until 10:30 PM. But if the lights out was at 10 PM (Iris's Testimony, Evidence 12), then he shouldn't have been out past 10 PM. So Testimony 0 contradicts Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony about lights out at 10 PM). But the user wants evidence and testimony contradiction. Evidence 12 is Iris's Testimony, which is an evidence item. So Testimony 0 (Butz's testimony) contradicts Evidence 12. But the question allows for any evidence and testimony pair. 

So, the contradiction would be between Butz's Testimony 0 (he was at the shack until 10:30 PM) and Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony that she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and everyone should be in their rooms). But the problem is that the user is asking for a pair of evidence and testimony from the given list. Evidence 12 is labeled as Iris's Testimony, which is an evidence item. So if Testimony 0 contradicts Evidence 12, that's a valid pair. 

But the user's instruction says to output the evidence number and testimony number. Evidence 12 is number 12, and Testimony 0 is number 0. 

But let's check Evidence 12's description: "Rang lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room until the murder was discovered." So Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) states that after 10 PM, everyone should be in their rooms. Larry's Testimony 0 says he was at the shack until about 10:30 PM, which would be after lights out. Therefore, Larry's Testimony 0 contradicts Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12). 

Thus, the pair would be evidence 12 and testimony 0. 

But I need to confirm the evidence numbers. Evidence 12 is "Iris's Testimony" with the description about ringing the bell at 10 PM. Testimony 0 is Butz's testimony about being at the shack until 10:30 PM. 

Yes, that seems like a contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 0}.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 0}
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. I need to go through them step by step.

First, let's look at the testimonies. The testimonies are from Butz (Larry). Testimony 2 says he saw Iris flying with her white hood fluttering. Evidence 6 is Iris's Hood, which is supposed to protect from evil spirits. But wait, the hood was received before the lights out bell, which was at 10 PM according to Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12). If Larry saw Iris flying after 10 PM when the hood was already with someone else, that contradicts.

Wait, the Weather Data (Evidence 7) mentions snow until around 10:50 PM and lightning until 11 PM. The crime happened between 10 and 11 PM. Larry's sketch (Evidence 15) and his testimony about seeing Iris flying. But the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was found near Dusky Bridge with blood, which came from the staff. The victim's staff (Evidence 9) had a hidden sword and no crystal sphere. The photo of Elise (Evidence 5) shows her with the staff and crystal. So if the sphere was found near the bridge, maybe the staff was used there.

But let's go back to Larry's testimony. He says he saw Iris flying with the white hood. However, Iris's Hood (Evidence 6) was received before 10 PM. If Iris wasn't wearing the hood when Larry saw her, then his testimony about the hood might be a lie. Alternatively, if the hood was already in someone else's possession, Iris couldn't have been wearing it. So Testimony 2 claims Iris was wearing the hood, but Evidence 6 says it was received before the crime. That would be a contradiction. Because if Iris gave away the hood before 10 PM, she couldn't be wearing it when Larry saw her later that night. So Testimony 2 (Butz) saying he saw Iris in the hood contradicts Evidence 6, which states the hood was received before the lights out at 10 PM. Therefore, the testimony and evidence conflict here.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 2}

Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair, and the answer has to be in a specific JSON format at the end.

First, I'll need to go through all the testimonies and evidences to see where there's a conflict. Let's start by looking at the testimonies. The testimonies given by Gumshoe (Testimonies 0 to 5) are key here. 

Testimony 2 says that the word "Maya" was written in blood on a memo found next to the victim. Testimony 3 adds that the blood was the victim's, and Testimony 5 concludes that the victim wrote the killer's name before dying. So according to these, Mia wrote Maya's name with her own blood, implicating Maya as the killer.

Now looking at the evidences. Evidence 3 is a receipt with letters written in blood on the back. The receipt is for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder. Evidence 2 is the glass shards from a broken light stand. 

Wait a minute. If the receipt (Evidence 3) has blood writing, but the glass shards (Evidence 2) are from the same light stand, maybe there's a contradiction. The testimony says the victim wrote "Maya" in blood on a memo (Testimony 2), but Evidence 3 is a receipt with blood writing. So if the receipt is the actual item with the blood writing, then the memo that Gumshoe found (Testimony 1 and 2) would be the receipt. But the receipt's description says it's a department store receipt with blood on the back. The testimonies mention a memo next to the body with "Maya" in blood. If the receipt is that memo, then the testimony's claim that it's a memo (maybe a different item) would conflict. Alternatively, maybe the receipt's blood writing isn't "Maya" but something else, conflicting with the testimony's claim.

Another angle: The autopsy report (Evidence 5) states that the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, but also mentions that the victim may have lived a few minutes after being hit. Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name before dying. If the victim died instantly (as per autopsy report's first part), then she couldn't have written anything. But the autopsy report actually says "Death was instantaneous" but then also "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Wait, that's conflicting within itself. Hmm, but how does this relate to the testimonies? Testimony 5 claims she wrote the name before dying. If the autopsy says death was instantaneous, then she couldn't have written anything. But if she lived a few minutes, she could. But the autopsy report has both statements. Maybe that's a point of contradiction with a testimony. Wait, Testimony 5 says "before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name." If the autopsy says death was instantaneous, then she couldn't have written anything. But the autopsy report also says "may have lived for a few minutes." So there's ambiguity here. But how does this tie to evidence? Let me check again.

Alternatively, let's consider the evidence related to the murder weapon. Evidence 1 is The Thinker statue, which is the murder weapon. It's a clock with gears removed. The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken glass light stand. So maybe the actual murder weapon was the statue, but the receipt and glass shards suggest another item. But how does that contradict a testimony?

Wait, the testimonies from Gumshoe are about the memo with "Maya" written in blood. If the receipt (Evidence 3) is the actual item with blood writing, then the memo mentioned in Testimony 1 and 2 would be the receipt. But the receipt is a department store receipt, so the memo found next to the body would be this receipt. But the testimony says it's a memo written on a piece of paper. If the receipt is that memo, then perhaps there's a contradiction in the content. The receipt's blood writing might not be "Maya," but maybe the testimony claims it is. But according to the evidence descriptions, the receipt has letters written in blood. The testimony says the memo has "Maya" written. If the receipt's blood writing is something else, that would contradict. However, the evidence descriptions don't specify what's written on the receipt's blood. So maybe that's not the contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says the blood on the memo is the victim's. Evidence 3 is a receipt with blood on the back. If the receipt's blood is the victim's, then that's consistent. But perhaps the problem lies elsewhere.

Looking back at the autopsy report (Evidence 5): The cause of death is a single blunt force trauma, death was instantaneous, but also says "may have lived a few minutes." That's conflicting. But how does this contradict a testimony? Testimony 5 says she wrote the name before dying. If the autopsy says death was instantaneous, then she couldn't have written it. But the autopsy also says may have lived a few minutes. So perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and the autopsy. But the question is about evidence and testimony. So if the autopsy is Evidence 5, then Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name) contradicts Evidence 5 (death was instantaneous). But the autopsy report has conflicting statements. So perhaps the testimony is contradicted by the part where death was instantaneous. But the autopsy report says both things. Hmm, maybe that's not the right path.

Another angle: The Thinker (Evidence 1) is the murder weapon, a statue clock with gears removed. The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand bought the day before. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken glass light stand. If the murder weapon was The Thinker, then the glass light stand (evidence 2 and 3) might be unrelated. But the receipt's date is the day before the murder. So perhaps the glass light stand was broken at the scene. But how does that tie to the testimonies?

Wait, Testimony 9 (May Testimony) says "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but was caught and struck." If the murder weapon was The Thinker (a heavy statue), maybe the attack was with that. But if the glass light stand was broken (Evidence 2), perhaps that's another weapon. But not sure.

Alternatively, let's look at the memo mentioned in Testimony 1 and 2. The memo is written in blood. Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo, which says a conversation with her sister is recorded on her cell phone. Evidence 6 is Maya's cell phone with the conversation. But that's separate. Maybe the memo in Testimony 1 is different from Maya's Memo in Evidence 4.

Wait, Testimony 1 says Gumshoe found a memo next to the victim's body with "Maya" in blood. Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo, but it's a note that says a conversation is recorded on her cell phone. So that's a different memo. The memo found by Gumshoe (Testimony 1) is a separate piece of evidence. But according to the evidence list, there's no evidence called "Memo" except Evidence 4 (Maya's Memo) and Evidence 14 (Mia's Memo). The memo with "Maya" written in blood would be the receipt (Evidence 3), but the receipt's description says the blood is on the back. So if the receipt is the memo, then Testimony 2's claim that "Maya" was written in blood on a memo would be supported. But where is the contradiction?

Alternatively, Evidence 3 is a receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken glass light stand. If the receipt is dated the day before, then the light stand was purchased then, and broken at the crime. But how does that relate to the testimonies? The testimonies about the memo written in blood (Testimonies 1-5) suggest that the victim wrote "Maya" in blood. But if the receipt (Evidence 3) is the actual item with blood writing, perhaps the content of the receipt's blood writing contradicts the testimony. For example, if the receipt's blood writing is not "Maya," but something else. However, the evidence descriptions don't specify what's written on the receipt in blood. But Testimony 2 clearly states "Maya" was written. So if the receipt is the memo, and the receipt's blood writing is "Maya," then there's no contradiction. But the receipt's date is the day before the murder. How could Mia have written on it with her blood if she was killed the next day? Wait, the receipt's purchase date is the day before the murder. The murder happened on 9/5 (from the autopsy report). The receipt's purchase date is the day before, so 9/4. If Mia was killed on 9/5, then the receipt was already in existence before her death. So if the receipt has blood writing on the back, that blood would have to be from after the purchase. But if Mia wrote "Maya" in her own blood (as per testimony) on the day of the murder (9/5), then the receipt's date (9/4) wouldn't conflict. However, if the receipt was purchased on 9/4, but the blood was added on 9/5, that's possible. But that doesn't create a contradiction.

Wait, the receipt is a department store receipt. If someone wrote "Maya" in blood on the back of it after the purchase, that's plausible. So maybe no contradiction there.

Alternatively, Evidence 2 is glass shards from a broken glass light stand. Testimony 9 (May Testimony) says the victim dodged an attack and ran, then was struck. If the glass light stand was broken, maybe that was used in an initial attack. But the murder weapon is The Thinker statue. So perhaps the glass shards being present contradict the testimony about the attack sequence. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 claims the victim wrote the killer's name before dying. The autopsy report (Evidence 5) says "Death was instantaneous. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." These two statements are conflicting. If the death was instantaneous, she couldn't write. If she lived a few minutes, she could. But the testimony says she did write. The autopsy is contradictory, but how does this pair with an evidence and testimony? If the autopsy says instantaneous death (part of it), that contradicts Testimony 5. But the autopsy also says maybe lived a few minutes. So maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and the first part of the autopsy. But the user is asking for an evidence and testimony pair. So Evidence 5 (autopsy report) vs Testimony 5. But the evidence has both statements. Hmm, tricky.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 1: The Thinker statue has gears removed. The murder weapon was a blunt object. If the statue's gears were removed, maybe it's lighter, but still possible. Not sure how that contradicts testimony.

Wait, Testimony 9 (May Testimony) says the victim dodged an attack, ran to the right, but was caught and struck. The floor plans (Evidence 8) might show the layout. If the floor plan indicates that running to the right would lead to a dead end, or if there's a contradiction in the direction, but without seeing the floor plan details, it's hard to tell.

Another angle: The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand bought the day before. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken glass light stand. So the light stand was broken during the murder. If the murder weapon was The Thinker statue (Evidence 1), then the glass shards are unrelated. But perhaps the broken glass was part of the crime scene. However, Testimony 9 mentions the victim dodging an attack, which could have involved the glass stand breaking. But how does that contradict a testimony?

Wait, Testimony 9 says the victim dodged an attack, then ran to the right, but was caught and struck. If the glass shards are from a light stand that was broken during the initial attack (the one she dodged), then perhaps the murder weapon (The Thinker) was used in the second attack. That could fit. But where's the contradiction?

Back to the original thought: The memo with "Maya" in blood. If the memo is actually the receipt (Evidence 3), which was purchased the day before, but the blood was the victim's (from the day of the murder), then the receipt itself was already present. The victim wrote on it with her own blood. But the receipt's date being the day before isn't a contradiction. The writing could have been added later.

Hmm, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (says "Maya" written in blood on the memo) and Evidence 3 (receipt with blood writing). If the receipt's blood writing is not "Maya," but something else, that would contradict. However, the evidence descriptions don't specify what's written on the receipt. But the testimonies do say it's "Maya". Wait, but the user might expect that the receipt's blood writing is something else. For example, if the receipt's blood writing is "Redd" or another name, then Testimony 2's claim would be contradicted. But how can we know? The evidence descriptions don't specify the content of the blood writing on the receipt, only that there are letters. So this might be a stretch.

Alternatively, the receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from that stand. If the receipt was used as the memo with blood writing, then the presence of the glass shards and the receipt might indicate that the real weapon was the light stand, contradicting the Thinker being the murder weapon. But Testimony 9 says the victim was struck after dodging, so maybe two attacks. But the autopsy says cause of death was a single blunt force trauma. So if there were two blows, but the autopsy says one, that's a contradiction. But that would be between testimony and autopsy, not evidence and testimony.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says the blood on the memo was the victim's. Evidence 3's receipt has blood writing. If the receipt's blood is not the victim's, that would contradict Testimony 3. But according to Testimony 3, the lab test confirmed it was the victim's. So if the receipt is the memo, then the blood on it is the victim's, which matches. So no contradiction there.

Wait, another angle. The Thinker (Evidence 1) is the murder weapon, a statue clock with gears removed. The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from the stand. If the murder weapon was the statue, then the broken glass stand might be unrelated. But maybe the actual murder weapon was the glass stand, not the statue. If that's the case, then the Thinker being labeled as the murder weapon would be incorrect. But how does that tie into a testimony?

Alternatively, the autopsy report says the cause was blunt force trauma. The Thinker is a heavy statue, which would cause that. The glass stand, when broken, might have sharp edges, causing lacerations, not blunt trauma. So if the glass stand was the weapon, it wouldn't match the autopsy. But the Thinker is the murder weapon. So that's consistent.

I'm getting stuck. Let's try a different approach. Look for the most obvious contradiction. The classic contradiction in Ace Attorney cases often involves a dying message. For example, the victim writes a name, but it's actually referring to someone else, or the message was altered. 

In this case, the memo with "Maya" in blood (Testimony 2) is supposed to be written by the victim. But maybe the receipt (Evidence 3) is the actual item, and the receipt's purchase date is the day before the murder. If the victim wrote on it on the day of the murder, that's possible. But perhaps the receipt was already in the possession of the killer, who wrote "Maya" to frame her. But how does that create a contradiction between evidence and testimony?

Wait, the receipt (Evidence 3) is a department store receipt with blood letters. If the receipt was purchased the day before, then the killer could have brought it to the scene and written "Maya" in blood to frame her. But the testimony says the victim wrote it. If the blood on the receipt is the victim's, then Testimony 3 is correct. But if the receipt was purchased the day before, then the victim couldn't have written on it before the murder. Wait, no. The purchase date is the day before, but the writing could have been done on the day of the murder. So the receipt existed before, but the blood was added during the murder. That's possible. So no contradiction there.

Alternatively, the receipt's blood letters might not be "Maya". If the testimony claims it's "Maya" but the evidence (receipt) has different letters, that would contradict. But the evidence doesn't specify the letters. So this is speculative.

Wait, another thought. The memo mentioned in Testimony 1 is written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body. Evidence 3 is a receipt. If the receipt is that piece of paper, then the receipt's date being the day before the murder indicates that it was already in the office before the murder. But Mia (the victim) might have had the receipt in her possession. When she was attacked, she wrote "Maya" on it with her blood. That's possible. No contradiction.

Hmm. Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (victim wrote the killer's name before dying) and the autopsy report (Evidence 5) which states "Death was instantaneous". If the victim died instantly, she couldn't have written anything. But the autopsy also says "May have lived for a few minutes". So there's ambiguity. However, Testimony 5 claims she wrote the name, which requires her to have survived long enough. The contradiction here is that the autopsy report's first statement (instantaneous death) contradicts Testimony 5, but the report also says she might have lived a few minutes. So this might be a red herring.

Another angle: The Thinker statue (Evidence 1) has gears removed. If it's a clock, removing gears would make it lighter. But the murder weapon needs to be heavy enough to cause blunt trauma. If the gears are removed, maybe it's not heavy enough, contradicting the cause of death. But the description says it's a statue, so even without gears, it might still be heavy. Not sure.

Alternatively, the glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a glass light stand. The receipt (Evidence 3) is for purchasing that stand. If the stand was broken during the murder, then the time of purchase (day before) makes sense. But the Thinker is the murder weapon. So the glass stand being broken is unrelated. But no contradiction here.

Wait, Testimony 9 (May Testimony) says the victim dodged an attack, ran to the right, and was struck. If the floor plans (Evidence 8) show that running to the right leads to a dead end, then the testimony might be contradicted by the floor plan. But without seeing the floor plan details, we can't confirm. So this is speculative.

Back to the original idea: The memo with "Maya" in blood. If the memo is the receipt (Evidence 3), then the receipt's date is the day before. But the victim was killed the next day. The receipt could have been in the office, and the victim wrote on it during the murder. That's possible. No contradiction.

Wait, the receipt's description says it has letters written in blood on the back. Testimony 2 says the memo has "Maya" written. If the receipt's blood writing is "Maya", then it's consistent. But if the receipt's blood writing is something else, like "Redd" (as in Redd White, Character 7), then Testimony 2 is wrong. However, the evidence doesn't specify what's written. But given that Testimony 2 explicitly states "Maya" is written, and the receipt is the only evidence with blood writing, perhaps that's the contradiction. Wait, but how? If the receipt has "Maya" written, then it's consistent. But maybe the receipt has the word "Redd" written, which would contradict. But the evidence descriptions don't say that. So this is a guess.

Alternatively, the receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from that stand. If the stand was broken during the murder, then the receipt's purchase date is relevant. But how does that contradict a testimony? If the receipt's purchase date is the day before, and the murder happened the next day, that's okay. No contradiction.

I'm really stuck here. Let's try to list possible contradictions:

1. Testimony 2 (Maya written in blood on memo) vs Evidence 3 (receipt with blood writing) - if receipt's writing isn't Maya.
2. Testimony 5 (victim wrote name) vs Evidence 5 (autopsy says instantaneous death).
3. Testimony 9 (victim ran right) vs Floor Plans (Evidence 8) - but no details on floor plans.
4. The Thinker (Evidence 1) as murder weapon vs Glass Shards (Evidence 2) implying another weapon.

But which of these is valid based on given data?

The most likely is Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name) vs Evidence 5 (autopsy report says death was instantaneous). If the victim died instantly, she couldn't write. But the autopsy also says "may have lived a few minutes". So maybe the contradiction is that the autopsy report's first statement (instantaneous death) contradicts Testimony 5, but the report itself is conflicting. However, the user might expect that the testimony is contradicted by the part of the autopsy that says death was instantaneous. So the pair would be Evidence 5 and Testimony 5.

But let's check:

Testimony 5: "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!" (Gumshoe)
Evidence 5: Mia's Autopsy Report states "Death was instantaneous. ... May have lived for a few minutes after being hit."

If the death was instantaneous, she couldn't write. So Testimony 5 is contradicted by the autopsy's instantaneous death claim. However, the autopsy also says she may have lived a few minutes, which allows for writing. So the contradiction is within the autopsy itself. But the user wants a contradiction between evidence and testimony. The testimony claims she wrote before dying, which requires her to have survived for some time. The autopsy has conflicting statements: one says instantaneous, the other says a few minutes. But the evidence (autopsy report) as a whole includes both statements. Therefore, Testimony 5 is not necessarily contradicted by the autopsy report because the report has ambiguity.

Alternatively, the Thinker statue (Evidence 1) has gears removed. If the murder weapon was a clock, but the gears are missing, perhaps it couldn't function as a clock. But how does that contradict a testimony?

Another possibility: The receipt (Evidence 3) is dated the day before the murder. If the blood on it is the victim's (from the day of the murder), then the receipt was present at the scene. But Testimony 1 says the memo was found next to the body. If the memo is the receipt, then the receipt being purchased the day before doesn't contradict anything. So no issue.

Wait, what if the receipt was for the glass light stand, which was broken (Evidence 2). The Thinker statue is the murder weapon. The receipt's purchase the day before would mean the light stand was in the office before the murder. If the light stand was broken during the murder, perhaps during a struggle. But the actual killing was done with the statue. No contradiction.

Alternatively, the memo found (Testimony 1) is Mia's Memo (Evidence 14), which is a list of names. But Testimony 2 says "Maya" was written in blood. If Evidence 14's memo has a list of names, but not "Maya" written in blood, that would contradict. But the description of Evidence 14 says it's a list of people's names in Mia's handwriting. Testimony 2 says the memo has "Maya" written in blood. So if the memo in Evidence 14 is the same as the one in Testimony 1, but it's a list of names (not just "Maya"), that contradicts. However, Evidence 14 is Mia's Memo, which is a different memo than the one found by Gumshoe (Testimony 1). Because Testimony 1's memo is written in blood, while Evidence 14 is a regular memo in Mia's handwriting. So they're separate. Therefore, no contradiction here.

Back to the earlier idea: The contradiction is between Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name) and Evidence 5's statement that death was instantaneous. Even though the autopsy also says she may have lived a few minutes, the existence of the instantaneous death statement contradicts Testimony 5. But is this the intended pair?

Alternatively, the memo with "Maya" in blood (Testimony 2) is written on a piece of paper. Evidence 3 is a receipt with blood writing. If the receipt is that paper, but the receipt is a different type of document (a receipt), then the testimony's description of it as a memo might not contradict. But a receipt can be considered a piece of paper, so no contradiction there.

Another angle: The receipt (Evidence 3) has blood writing, and the glass shards (Evidence 2) are from the light stand. If the light stand was broken during the murder, the receipt's purchase the day before indicates that the killer brought the light stand to the scene, implying premeditation. But how does that contradict testimony?

I think I'm going in circles. Let me recap the options again:

1. Testimony 5 vs Evidence 5 (autopsy report's instantaneous death vs writing)
2. Testimony 2 (Maya written) vs Evidence 3 (receipt's blood writing) if they differ
3. Testimony 3 (blood is victim's) vs Evidence 3 (if the blood isn't the victim's, but testimony says it is)

But the user says to choose one pair. In Ace Attorney cases, a common contradiction is the dying message being written with the victim's own blood, but the implement used (like a pen) is missing or the victim couldn't have written it due to injuries. For example, if the victim's finger had blood (Testimony 4), but the memo's writing is in blood, implying she used her finger, but if she had a severe injury, maybe she couldn't. But in this case, the autopsy says blunt force trauma. If the victim's hands were injured, but Testimony 4 says blood was found on her finger, suggesting she used it to write. So that's consistent.

Wait, Testimony 4 says there was blood on the victim's finger, supporting the idea that she wrote the name with her own blood. So no contradiction there.

The most plausible contradiction I can think of is between the autopsy report's statement that death was instantaneous (part of Evidence 5) and Testimony 5 claiming the victim wrote the name before dying. If death was truly instantaneous, writing would be impossible. However, the autopsy report also says she may have lived a few minutes. But since the question asks for a contradiction between evidence and testimony, even if the evidence has conflicting info, the presence of the instantaneous death part contradicts Testimony 5.

So the JSON answer would be {"evidence": 5, "testimony": 5}.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to identify one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, let me go through the testimonies. The testimonies are from April May, right? Testimonies 0 to 4. She's an eyewitness who claims she saw Maya commit the murder. Her testimonies describe the sequence: the victim dodged an attack, ran to the right, Maya chased her, and hit her with the Thinker statue.

Now looking at the evidence. Let's check the autopsy report (Evidence 5). It says Mia died from a single blunt force trauma, death was instantaneous, but may have lived a few minutes after being hit. Wait, that's a bit conflicting in itself. Hmm. Also, the Thinker (Evidence 1) is the murder weapon, a statue clock with gears removed. The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand bought the day before. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken glass light stand.

April's Testimony 3 says she saw Maya hit Mia with the Thinker. But if the murder weapon was The Thinker, which is a statue, but the receipt and glass shards suggest a glass light stand was purchased and broken. Maybe the actual murder weapon is the glass light stand, not the statue. But according to the autopsy, the cause was a blunt object, which could be either. Wait, but Evidence 1 says the Thinker was the murder weapon. Wait, but the glass shards are broken beyond recognition. Maybe there's a contradiction here.

Wait, let me cross-reference. April says the murder weapon was The Thinker (Testimony 4). But maybe the real weapon was the glass light stand. Let me check the receipt (Evidence 3): it's a receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken glass stand. If the murder happened the next day, maybe the glass stand was broken during the murder. But the autopsy says blunt force trauma from a blunt object. The Thinker is a statue (blunt), but maybe the actual weapon was the glass stand, which when broken, could have sharp edges but the initial hit might be blunt. However, the evidence list says The Thinker is the murder weapon. Hmm.

Wait, the problem is that April's testimony says the weapon was The Thinker (statue), but perhaps the real weapon was the glass stand. But how does that contradict? Let me check the autopsy report again. The cause is blunt force trauma. Both could be blunt. Wait, but if the Thinker's gears were removed, maybe it was modified. Alternatively, the glass stand's receipt (Evidence 3) is from the day before, so maybe the glass stand was broken during the murder, but the Thinker was the weapon. Maybe the contradiction is in the timeline or the location. Alternatively, the floor plans (Evidence 8) might show the layout, but I don't have details here.

Wait, Testimony 1 says the victim dodged the first attack and ran to the right. Testimony 2 says Maya chased her. The floor plans might show that running to the right leads to a place where there's no exit, but I don't have details. Alternatively, the wiretap (Evidence 7) in April's room could suggest she was being monitored, implying her testimony is unreliable. But how does that directly contradict her testimony?

Another angle: the Thinker (Evidence 1) is a clock with gears removed. The receipt (Evidence 3) for a glass light stand purchased the day before. If the murder weapon was the Thinker, why is there a receipt for a glass stand? Maybe the actual weapon was the glass stand, and April is lying about using the Thinker. But the Thinker is listed as the murder weapon. Hmm. Alternatively, the glass shards (Evidence 2) and the receipt (Evidence 3) indicate that the glass stand was broken, perhaps during the murder. If the murder weapon was the glass stand, then April's testimony about the Thinker being used is a lie. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 3 (she hit her with that weapon, the Thinker) and the evidence that the glass stand was broken (Evidence 2) and purchased the day before (Evidence 3), implying that the glass stand was the real weapon. Therefore, the evidence (2 or 3) contradicts the testimony (3 or 4).

But which pair? Let's see. Evidence 3 is the receipt for the glass stand bought the day before. Evidence 2 is the glass shards. If the glass stand was broken during the murder, and the receipt shows it was purchased the day before, then the murder might have involved the glass stand. If April testifies that the Thinker was used, but the real weapon was the glass stand (as per Evidence 2 and 3), then that's a contradiction. So the testimony (3 or 4) which claims the Thinker was used contradicts the evidence that the glass stand was present and broken.

But wait, the autopsy report says the cause was a blunt object. The Thinker is a statue (blunt), the glass stand (if it's a light stand, maybe it's made of glass, which when broken could leave shards. But the initial hit would be with the stand. If the murder was done with the glass stand, then the Thinker wasn't the weapon. So April's testimony that the Thinker was used (Testimony 4: "that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? 'The Thinker'...") and Testimony 3 where she says "she hit her with that weapon" (referring to the Thinker). So if the actual weapon was the glass stand (Evidence 2 and 3), then her testimony is false. Therefore, Evidence 2 (glass shards) contradicts Testimony 3 or 4. The key is that the receipt (3) shows purchase of the glass stand, and the shards (2) are from the stand. If the murder weapon was the stand, then April's testimony about the Thinker is wrong.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (using the Thinker as the weapon) and Evidence 2 (glass shards from a broken stand, which could indicate the actual weapon was the stand). But how do we know the glass stand was the weapon? Maybe the receipt and the shards together imply that the stand was broken during the murder. If the Thinker was a clock with gears removed, perhaps it's a red herring, and the actual weapon was the glass stand. Therefore, April's testimony about the Thinker being the weapon contradicts the evidence of the broken glass stand (Evidence 2) and the receipt (3). But the question is to choose one pair. So which evidence directly contradicts the testimony? If the glass shards (Evidence 2) are from the actual weapon, then Testimony 3 (hit with Thinker) is contradicted. So the pair would be Evidence 2 and Testimony 3. Alternatively, the receipt (3) shows purchase of the glass stand, but how does that directly contradict? The glass shards (2) being present would suggest the stand was broken there, possibly used as a weapon. So if the murder weapon was the glass stand, then the testimony about the Thinker is wrong. Thus, Evidence 2 (glass shards) contradicts Testimony 3 (hit with the Thinker). That's the contradiction.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}

Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair. Let me go through each testimony and check the evidence.

First, looking at the testimonies. Testimony 0 is Gumshoe saying he examined the scene. Testimony 1 says he found a memo next to the victim's body. Testimony 2 claims the memo had "Maya" in blood. Testimony 3 says the blood was the victim's. Testimony 4 mentions blood on the victim's finger. Testimony 5 concludes the victim wrote the killer's name before dying.

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 3 is a receipt with letters in blood on the back. The receipt is for a glass light stand bought the day before. Evidence 2 is glass shards from a broken light stand. The receipt's date matches the purchase date as the day before the murder. 

Wait, if the receipt has blood writing, but Testimony 2 says the memo (which might be the receipt) has "Maya" written in blood. But according to Evidence 3, the receipt is a store receipt with blood on the back. However, Testimony 2 refers to a memo found next to the body with "Maya" in blood, which they say is the victim's blood. But the receipt (Evidence 3) is a receipt for the glass stand, which is broken (Evidence 2). Maybe the memo Gumshoe found (Testimony 1 and 2) is actually the receipt (Evidence 3), but the receipt's purchase date is the day before. If the victim wrote "Maya" in her own blood on the receipt the day after purchasing it, that's possible. But wait, the receipt's purchase date is the day before the murder. The murder happened on 9/5. If the receipt was purchased the day before (9/4), then Mia could have written on it on 9/5 when she died. So that's possible.

But maybe there's another contradiction. Let me check the autopsy report (Evidence 5). It says cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, death instantaneous. But Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name before dying. If death was instantaneous, how could she write after being hit? The autopsy report in Evidence 5 actually says two things: "Death was instantaneous" and "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Wait, that's conflicting. The first part says instantaneous, the second part says a few minutes. That's a contradiction in the evidence itself. Hmm, but the problem is between evidence and testimony. Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the name before dying, but if death was instantaneous (as per the first part of the autopsy), she couldn't have written. But the autopsy also says maybe lived a few minutes. So maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 5's first part. But the user wants evidence and testimony. So Evidence 5's autopsy report (which says death was instantaneous) contradicts Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name before dying). Because if death was instantaneous, she couldn't have written anything after being struck. But the autopsy report in Evidence 5 also says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit," which contradicts itself. Wait, maybe the user made a typo in Evidence 5. Let me check again.

Evidence 5: Mia's Autopsy Report. Description says "Time of death: 9/5 at 9:00PM. Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous. Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Wait, that's inconsistent. The first line says death was instantaneous, but the next line says may have lived a few minutes. That's conflicting. But maybe that's a mistake in the data. However, the user provided this info. So perhaps Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name) is contradicted by the first part of Evidence 5 (instantaneous death), but the second part of Evidence 5 allows for a few minutes. So maybe not.

Alternatively, the receipt (Evidence 3) is the memo that Gumshoe found (Testimony 1). But the receipt's back has blood letters. If the receipt was purchased the day before, then the blood on it would have to be from the murder day. That's possible. But perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (memo has "Maya" in blood) and Evidence 3, which is a receipt with blood letters. Wait, but Testimony 2 says "Maya" was written in blood, which is the victim's. But Evidence 3 is a receipt with letters in blood. If the receipt is the memo, then maybe the content contradicts. For example, if the receipt's blood writing isn't "Maya," but something else. Wait, the user's data says Evidence 3 is a receipt with "letters written in blood on the back." The testimonies say that the memo had "Maya" written in blood. So if the receipt (Evidence 3) is the memo, then the back should have "Maya," but the receipt's description doesn't specify. However, Testimony 2 claims the name was written, but perhaps the receipt's blood writing isn't the name. Wait, the receipt's purchase date is the day before. The murder was on 9/5. So the receipt was bought on 9/4. If the blood was written on the receipt on 9/5 (the murder day), that's possible. So maybe no contradiction here.

Alternatively, looking at the Thinker (Evidence 1). It's the murder weapon, a clock statue with gears removed. The autopsy says blunt force trauma. So the statue could be the weapon, which is possible.

Another angle: The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand bought the day before. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken light stand. So the receipt is for the stand that was broken. But if the receipt was bought the day before, and the murder happened the next day, that's okay. No contradiction here.

Wait, Testimony 3 says the blood on the memo (which is the receipt) is the victim's. That's possible if the victim wrote it. But if the victim wrote "Maya" in her own blood, but the receipt was purchased the day before, that's possible. So maybe no contradiction here.

Wait, but if the receipt was purchased the day before, and the victim wrote on it with her blood the next day (murder day), then the receipt's purchase date isn't an issue. So no contradiction there.

Hmm. Let me think again. The key contradiction could be between the autopsy report's time of death and the possibility of the victim writing. Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name before dying. The autopsy report (Evidence 5) says death was instantaneous. If death was instantaneous, then after being hit, she couldn't have written anything. Therefore, Testimony 5 (which says she wrote the name before dying) is contradicted by Evidence 5 (instant death). But wait, the autopsy report's description has conflicting info. The first line says death was instantaneous, but the second line says "may have lived for a few minutes after being hit." So which is it? That's a problem. But maybe the user intended that the autopsy report's first line is the official cause, and the second part is a correction. But in that case, if the victim lived a few minutes, she could have written the name. However, Testimony 5 claims she wrote it before dying. If she lived a few minutes, she could have written it after being hit but before dying. But Testimony 5 says "before she died, the victim wrote..." So that's possible. Therefore, maybe no contradiction here.

Alternatively, maybe the memo that Gumshoe found (Testimony 1) is Maya's Memo (Evidence 4). Evidence 4 says Maya's memo records a conversation with her sister on her cell phone. But Testimony 1 says the memo was a piece of paper next to the body. But Evidence 4 is a memo on a cell phone. That's a contradiction. Because if the memo was on paper (Testimony 1), but Evidence 4 is a cell phone memo, then they can't be the same. So Testimony 1 says a paper memo, but Evidence 4 is a cell phone memo. Therefore, Testimony 1 and Evidence 4 contradict. But the user wants a pair of evidence and testimony. So if Testimony 1 says paper memo, but Evidence 4 is a cell phone memo, then that's a contradiction. However, Evidence 3 is a receipt with blood writing, which could be the paper memo. So maybe Testimony 1 refers to Evidence 3, not Evidence 4. But the problem is that Testimony 2 says the memo has "Maya" written in blood, which would be the receipt (Evidence 3), but Evidence 4 is a different memo. So perhaps the contradiction is that the memo Testimony refers to is a paper with blood (Evidence 3), but Evidence 4 is a cell phone memo. So perhaps Testimony 1 and 2 refer to Evidence 3, not 4. So no contradiction there.

Alternatively, looking at the wiretap (Evidence 7) found in April May's room. April May is a witness (Character 4) who testifies against Maya. The wiretap could indicate she was being monitored, which might affect her testimony's reliability. But that's not a direct contradiction between a testimony and evidence.

Another angle: The bellboy's affidavit (Evidence 12) describes a man with Miss May. If the man is Redd White (Character 7), but maybe that's not directly conflicting with any testimony.

Hmm. Let me consider Testimony 2: the memo has "Maya" written in blood. If the receipt (Evidence 3) is that memo, then the receipt's back has letters in blood. But the receipt's description doesn't mention "Maya" specifically. If the receipt's blood letters are not "Maya," then Testimony 2 would be contradicted by Evidence 3. But according to the data, Evidence 3's description says "letters written in blood on the back," but doesn't specify what the letters are. Testimony 2 claims they are "Maya." So if the receipt's letters are not "Maya," then that's a contradiction. But since the user's data doesn't specify the letters' content in Evidence 3, but Testimony 2 says it's "Maya," perhaps there's a contradiction if the actual letters are different. Wait, but how would we know? The user hasn't provided that info. Alternatively, maybe the receipt's purchase date is the day before the murder. If the receipt was purchased the day before, and the victim wrote on it with her blood on the day of the murder, that's possible. So no contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the receipt (Evidence 3) is for the glass light stand purchased the day before. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from the broken stand. If the murder happened on 9/5, the receipt was bought on 9/4. The light stand was broken during the murder. So that's consistent. No contradiction there.

Another possibility: The Thinker (Evidence 1) is the murder weapon, a statue clock with gears removed. The cause of death is blunt force trauma (Evidence 5). The gears being removed might mean the statue was lighter, affecting the force. But that's not a contradiction with any testimony.

Wait, Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name before dying. If the victim wrote "Maya," but Mia's Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) says death was instantaneous, then she couldn't have written after being struck. But the autopsy report also says she may have lived a few minutes. So there's inconsistency in the autopsy report itself. But the testimony is that she wrote before dying. If she lived a few minutes, she could write. So maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and the first part of Evidence 5 (instant death). But the evidence's description has conflicting info. However, the user may consider the first line as the official cause. If so, then Testimony 5 (she wrote before dying) contradicts the autopsy's instant death. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 5 and Testimony 5. But in the JSON, we have to pick the evidence and testimony numbers. Evidence 5 is Mia's Autopsy Report. Testimony 5 is Gumshoe's testimony that the victim wrote the name before dying.

Yes, that makes sense. Because if the death was instantaneous (as per first part of Evidence 5), then the victim couldn't have written anything after the blow. Therefore, Testimony 5 is contradicted by Evidence 5. However, the second part of Evidence 5 says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit," which supports Testimony 5. But the first line says death was instantaneous, which contradicts. So which part takes precedence? The user may have intended the first line as the main cause, hence the contradiction.

So the answer would be {"evidence": 5, "testimony": 5}.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by looking at all the testimonies from April May.

Testimony 0: She claims she saw everything. Testimony 1 says the victim dodged the first attack and ran to the right. Testimony 2 mentions the girl in hippie clothes (Maya) ran after her. Testimony 3 states she hit her with the weapon. Testimony 4 refers to The Thinker clock statue as the weapon.

Now, looking at the evidence. Evidence 1 is The Thinker, which is a clock statue. But the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says Mia died from a single blunt force trauma, and death was instantaneous. However, in another part, it says "may have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Wait, that's a bit conflicting in itself. But maybe that's not the contradiction here.

Testimony 1 and 2 suggest that Mia dodged, ran to the right, and Maya chased and hit her. But the floor plans (Evidence 8) might show the layout. If the office layout from the floor plans shows that running to the right would lead to a dead end or a place where the attack couldn't happen as described, that could be a contradiction. Alternatively, the receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken light stand. The receipt's date matches the purchase before the murder. But April's testimony talks about the statue being the weapon, but if the glass shards were part of the murder, maybe the real weapon was the glass stand, not The Thinker. Wait, the autopsy says blunt force trauma. The Thinker is a heavy statue, which could cause that. But the glass shards are broken, maybe indicating the light stand was used. Hmm.

Wait, the receipt is for the glass light stand bought the day before. If the murder weapon was The Thinker, but there's a broken glass stand at the scene, maybe the actual weapon was the light stand. April's testimony says The Thinker was used, but the receipt and glass shards suggest the light stand was involved. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 4 (April saying the weapon was The Thinker) and Evidence 3 (the receipt for the glass light stand, which was broken, implying it was used). But how does that directly contradict? Because if the murder weapon was the light stand, but April says it's The Thinker, that's a contradiction. Also, the autopsy says blunt force, which both could cause, but maybe the Thinker's gears were removed, making it lighter? Or perhaps the time of death. Wait, the autopsy (Evidence 5) says time of death 9:00 PM. But maybe the phone call in Maya's memo (Evidence 4 or 6) shows a different timeline? Alternatively, the Thinker's gears being removed (Evidence 1 description) might mean it's not heavy enough to cause such a fatal blow. If the gears are removed, the statue might be hollow or lighter, making it less likely to be the murder weapon. So April's testimony 4 says the weapon was The Thinker, but Evidence 1 shows it's a clock with gears removed, which might contradict the ability to cause the fatal injury. That could be the contradiction. So the testimony (Testimony 4) claims the weapon was The Thinker, but the evidence shows that the Thinker's gears were removed, making it not heavy enough to cause the fatal blow. Therefore, they contradict each other.

{"evidence": 1, "testimony": 4}

Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all listed here. Let's go through the testimonies first.

The testimonies are all from Larry Butz (Testimony 0 to 5). Testimony 3 says he heard a "bang" just as he was thinking about going home. Then Testimony 5 states that after hearing a single gunshot, he went home. Wait, the testimony mentions a "bang" and then a "single gunshot". But looking at the evidence, Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard two gunshot sounds after midnight. But that's Lotta's testimony. However, Larry's Testimony 5 says he heard a single gunshot. But maybe there's another contradiction.

Looking at Evidence 2: Lotta's Camera, which was set to take a picture when a loud noise is detected. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) was taken on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. The Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) was taken on 12/24 at 11:50 PM. So the camera took two photos. But according to Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11), she heard two gunshots after midnight. If the camera took a photo at 12:15 AM, that's after midnight. But Larry's Testimony 3 and 5 mention hearing a single bang/gunshot. Wait, but in his Testimony 3, he heard a "bang", which he might think is a gunshot, but Evidence 1 is a Popper, which makes a bang sound. So maybe the contradiction is between Larry's Testimony 5 saying he heard a single gunshot and the evidence that there were two shots (from Lotta's Deposition and the camera taking photos triggered by two loud noises). Wait, but Lotta's Camera is set to take pictures when a loud noise is detected. If two loud noises occurred, the camera would take two pictures? But Evidence 4 is a photo taken at 12:15 AM, and Evidence 16 is another photo at 11:50 PM on the 24th. The 11:50 PM one is before midnight, and 12:15 AM is after. So maybe the camera took two photos because two loud noises happened. But Larry's Testimony 5 says he heard a single gunshot. So if there were two shots, Larry's testimony contradicts that. But Larry's Testimony 3 says he heard a "bang", then Testimony 5 says he heard a single gunshot. Wait, but the "bang" in Testimony 3 could be the first shot, and then maybe another shot he didn't hear? Or perhaps the camera's two photos indicate two loud noises, but Larry only mentions one. Alternatively, the camera's two photos might be triggered by two different sounds. Let me check the timings. The Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) is at 11:50 PM on 12/24, which is before midnight. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) is 12:15 AM on 12/25. So those are two separate times. Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard two gunshots just after midnight, which would be around 12:15 AM. So maybe the 12:15 AM photo was triggered by one gunshot, and another gunshot around the same time. But Larry's Testimony 5 says he heard a single gunshot. So if there were two gunshots, Larry's testimony contradicts that. But wait, Evidence 11 is Lotta's deposition stating she heard two sounds like gunshots after midnight. Larry says he heard one. So that would be a contradiction between Testimony 5 (Larry's single gunshot) and Evidence 11 (two sounds). But the question is to pair an evidence and a testimony. So maybe Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition) contradicts Testimony 5 (Larry's single gunshot). But Evidence 11 isn't in the testimonies given here. Wait, the problem states that the testimonies provided are the ones to check. The testimonies listed here are all from Larry Butz. So we need to look at Larry's testimonies and see which one contradicts any of the evidence. Let's look again.

Testimony 5: "So after I heard that single gunshot I went home." So he claims hearing one gunshot. Evidence 11 is Lotta's deposition saying two sounds like gunshots after midnight. That's a contradiction. But the user wants a pair of evidence and testimony. So Evidence 11 and Testimony 5. But Evidence 11 is not in the list of testimonies provided here. Wait, no, the user is asking for evidence and testimony that contradict each other. So the testimony is from Larry (Testimony 5) and the evidence is Lotta's deposition (Evidence 11). That's possible. But another angle: the camera (Evidence 2) took a photo at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4) which is after midnight, so that would be triggered by a loud noise. If there were two gunshots, the camera would have taken two photos. But in the evidence list, there are two photos: Evidence 4 and 16. Evidence 16 is at 11:50 PM (before midnight), and Evidence 4 is at 12:15 AM (after). So two loud noises: one at 11:50 PM and another at 12:15 AM. Larry's Testimony 3 says he heard a bang (time not specified, but he was thinking of going home after returning the boat). If he returned the boat at 11:50 PM, then the 12:15 AM gunshot would be after. But he says he heard a single gunshot. So maybe the camera's photos indicate two loud noises, but Larry's testimony says one. But the problem is that Larry's Testimony 3 mentions hearing a "bang" at the time he was thinking of going home. Then Testimony 5 says after hearing the single gunshot, he went home. So maybe the "bang" in Testimony 3 is the same as the gunshot in Testimony 5. But the camera's two photos (Evidence 4 and 16) would imply two loud noises. So Larry's Testimony 5 (single shot) contradicts the two photos (two loud noises). But the camera's photos are from different times. The 11:50 PM photo (Evidence 16) is before midnight, and 12:15 AM (Evidence 4) after. So if the two loud noises are separated by time, maybe Larry only heard the 12:15 AM one. But according to Testimony 3 and 5, he heard one. However, the Popper (Evidence 1) makes a bang sound, which could be the first noise. Let's think: Larry returned the boat (Testimony 2), then heard a bang (Testimony 3). Then after that, he heard a gunshot (Testimony 5). Wait, but Testimony 3 says he heard a bang, then Testimony 4 says he didn't see the boat, and Testimony 5 says after hearing the gunshot he went home. Wait, maybe he heard two sounds: the bang (which is the popper) and then a gunshot. But in his testimony, he refers to them as separate events. But the problem is that he says he heard a single gunshot, but there might have been two. Alternatively, the contradiction is between the camera's photo at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4) and Testimony 4 where Larry says he didn't notice the boat. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) might show a boat, which Larry didn't notice. But in Testimony 4, Larry says he looked out over the lake but didn't notice the boat. If the photo shows a boat, that would contradict his testimony. Let's check Evidence 4's description: it's a lake photo taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. The details would show if there's a boat. If the photo shows a boat, but Larry says he didn't notice it, that's a contradiction. But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the photo details, but the testimony says he didn't notice the boat. So if the photo (Evidence 4) shows a boat, then Testimony 4 (saying he didn't notice it) would contradict. But the user has to assume that the photo does show a boat. Alternatively, the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) taken at 11:50 PM shows an empty lake. Then the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) at 12:15 AM might show something. But Larry's Testimony 4 says he didn't notice the boat. If the camera took a photo at 12:15 AM showing a boat, then Larry's Testimony 4 is contradicted because the photo would show a boat, meaning there was a boat there even though he claims he didn't see it. Therefore, the evidence would be the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) contradicting Testimony 4. That could be the pair. Alternatively, maybe the pistol was fired three times (Evidence 10: fired 3 times), which would mean three shots. But Testimony 5 says single gunshot, and Lotta's deposition (Evidence 11) says two. So the pistol being fired three times contradicts both. But the problem is to find one pair. So the most direct contradiction is between Larry's Testimony 5 (single gunshot) and Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) stating two. But the user wants one pair. However, Evidence 11 is not a testimony but an evidence. So pairing Evidence 11 (two gunshots) with Testimony 5 (single) would be a contradiction. Alternatively, the Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times. If the Pistol was fired three times, but Larry says one shot and Lotta says two, then the pistol's three shots contradict both. But which testimony does that contradict? Larry's Testimony 5 says one shot. So Evidence 10 (fired three times) contradicts Testimony 5 (one shot). But the autopsy report (Evidence 3) says the victim was killed by one bullet. So the three shots could mean two misses and one hit. But Larry only heard one. So Evidence 10 (three shots fired) would contradict Testimony 5 (heard one). But maybe the three shots were fired at different times. Alternatively, the camera's two photos (Evidence 4 and 16) indicate two loud noises. But the Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times. So three shots, but the camera only captured two. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let me try to focus on the most straightforward contradiction. Larry's Testimony 5 says he heard a single gunshot. But the Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times. So that's a contradiction. So Evidence 10 and Testimony 5. That would be a valid pair. But wait, the Pistol's description says it was fired three times. So three shots fired, but Larry only heard one. Therefore, this is a contradiction. So the evidence is 10 (Pistol) and testimony is 5. Alternatively, if the camera took two photos (Evidence 4 and 16) due to two loud noises, and Larry only heard one, that's a contradiction. But the camera's photos are two, but the Pistol was fired three times. So which is it? The problem is to find one pair. Let me check the options again. The answer should be in the format {"evidence": X, "testimony": Y}. Let me think: Larry says he heard a single gunshot (Testimony 5). The Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 10. Because if the gun was fired three times, Larry should have heard three shots, but he only mentions one. Therefore, that's the contradiction. So the pair is evidence 10 and testimony 5. Alternatively, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) states that the victim was shot once, which matches the Pistol being fired three times (so three shots, one hit). So maybe Larry heard one, but there were three. So that's a contradiction. Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is {"evidence": 10, "testimony": 5}.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by going through the given information.

First, the characters. There's a list, but maybe they won't be directly relevant unless their relationships matter. The evidences are numbered 0 to 21, and the testimonies 0 to 5. All testimonies are from Larry Butz.

Looking at the testimonies, Larry claims he heard a gunshot when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" which would be around midnight. Specifically, testimony 5 says the gunshot was heard when the DJ made that announcement. Testimony 3 is him being sure he heard the gunshot. 

Now, the evidence. Let me check what evidence could relate to the timing of the gunshot. Evidence 2 is Lotta's Camera, which automatically takes a picture when a loud noise is detected. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) was taken on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. But there's also Evidence 16, the Second Lake Photo, taken on 12/24 at 11:50 PM. Evidence 11 is Lotta's Deposition where she says she heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. 

Wait, Larry's testimony says the gunshot happened when the DJ said "It's almost Christmas!" which would be right before midnight on the 24th turning into the 25th. But Lotta's camera took a photo at 12:15 AM on the 25th (Evidence 4), which is after midnight. However, if the camera is triggered by loud noises, then the gunshot should have triggered it. But if Larry heard the gunshot around midnight, then why did the camera take a photo at 12:15 AM? Also, Evidence 16 is a photo taken at 11:50 PM on the 24th, which is before midnight. But Larry's testimony is about the gunshot at almost Christmas, which is midnight. 

Wait, but Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) states she heard two gunshot sounds just after midnight on 12/25. That's conflicting with Larry's testimony where he heard it when the DJ said "It's almost Christmas!" which would be just before midnight. So Larry's testimony is about a gunshot around midnight (the transition from 24th to 25th), but Lotta's camera took a photo at 12:15 AM, which is 15 minutes after midnight. However, if the camera was set to trigger on loud noises, then the actual gunshot (if it was at 12:15) would be caught by the camera, but Larry's testimony claims it was right when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" which is at midnight. So that's a contradiction. Because if the camera took the photo at 12:15, that's when the gunshot happened, but Larry says it was at midnight. 

But wait, the camera's photo (Evidence 4) is at 12:15 AM, which would be 15 minutes after midnight. However, Larry's testimony 5 says he heard the gunshot exactly when the DJ made the announcement, which would be at midnight. So the timing here contradicts. Therefore, the camera's photo being taken at 12:15 suggests the gunshot was at that time, but Larry's testimony says it was at midnight. However, the camera is supposed to take a picture when a loud noise is detected. So if the gunshot was at midnight, the camera should have triggered then. But the photo was taken 15 minutes later. That's a discrepancy. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another evidence. Let's check the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3). The time of death is sometime on the 24th or 25th. Not sure if that helps. The pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times. Maybe two shots at midnight and one later? But Lotta's deposition says two sounds after midnight. Larry says one at midnight. But this might not directly contradict. 

Another angle: The Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) was taken at 11:50 PM on the 24th. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) at 12:15 AM on the 25th. If Larry heard the gunshot at midnight, the camera should have taken a photo then. But there's no photo at midnight. Instead, the camera took one at 12:15. So the camera's evidence (Evidence 4) contradicts Larry's testimony (Testimony 5) about the timing of the gunshot. Therefore, Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera, which is set to take pictures when a loud noise is detected) and Testimony 5 (Larry saying the gunshot was at midnight) would be conflicting with the actual photo taken at 12:15. Wait, but Evidence 4 is the Lake Photo taken at 12:15. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (gunshot at midnight) and Evidence 4 (photo taken at 12:15). But the user is asking for which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So maybe Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) and Testimony 5. But Evidence 4's name is Lake Photo, but the evidence list says Evidence 2 is Lotta's Camera. Wait, the camera is the one that took the photo. So the camera (Evidence 2) is set to take pictures when a loud noise occurs. The photo (Evidence 4) shows the time when the noise happened. So if Larry's testimony says he heard the gunshot at midnight (Testimony 5), but the camera took the photo at 12:15, which is 15 minutes later, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the photo (Evidence 4) and Testimony 5. But according to the problem statement, which pair is contradicting? Let me check the options again.

Wait, the problem says "Which evidence and testimony contradict each other?" So one evidence and one testimony. Let's look at Testimony 5: "Just when she said 'Hey! It's almost Christmas!' I heard the gunshot!" The DJ's statement would be at midnight, as that's when Christmas starts. So Larry is saying the gunshot was at midnight. But the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) was taken at 12:15 AM. However, if the camera was triggered by the gunshot, then the gunshot would have happened at 12:15, which contradicts Larry's testimony. Therefore, Evidence 4 (Lake Photo taken at 12:15) and Testimony 5 (heard at midnight) contradict. But the Evidence 2 is Lotta's Camera which is set to take photos automatically when a loud noise is detected, facing the lake. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) is the result of that. So the actual evidence that shows the time is Evidence 4. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 4 and Testimony 5. But according to the user's list, Evidence 4's name is Lake Photo, and Testimony 5 is the one with the timing.

Alternatively, maybe another angle. The camera's deposition (Evidence 11) says Lotta heard two gunshots just after midnight. That's in line with the photo taken at 12:15. But Larry's testimony is about a gunshot at midnight. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 11 (Lotta's deposition), but Evidence 11 is not the photo. Alternatively, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) is taken at 12:15, which would be when the gunshot was heard, but Larry says it was at midnight. So the photo's timestamp (12:15 AM) contradicts Larry's Testimony 5 (midnight). Therefore, Evidence 4 and Testimony 5. But Evidence 4 is the Lake Photo. However, the problem might have other possibilities.

Wait, the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) is taken on 12/24 at 11:50 PM. That's 10 minutes before midnight. If the gunshot was at midnight, the camera would have taken a photo then, but there's no photo at midnight. The next photo is at 12:15 AM. So the absence of a photo at midnight contradicts Larry's testimony. But the camera is set to take a photo when a loud noise is detected. So if Larry heard a gunshot at midnight, the camera should have captured it. But since there's no photo at midnight, that's a contradiction. But the only photos are at 11:50 PM and 12:15 AM. Therefore, the absence of a photo at midnight implies that the gunshot wasn't then. But the camera's existence (Evidence 2) which is set to take photos automatically when a loud noise happens. If there's no photo at midnight, that contradicts Larry's testimony. However, how to pair that? The camera (Evidence 2) is the device that should have captured it. The testimony (Testimony 5) claims a gunshot at midnight. The camera didn't take a photo at midnight, implying no loud noise then. Therefore, Evidence 2 (the camera's capability) and Testimony 5 (claim of gunshot at midnight) contradict. But the photo evidence (Evidence 4) at 12:15 would then show that the gunshot was at that time. But the user's question is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other.

So, the contradiction is that the camera (Evidence 2) was set to take photos when a loud noise occurs, but there's no photo at midnight. However, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM would be triggered by a noise then. Therefore, if Larry's testimony says the gunshot was at midnight, but the camera took a photo at 12:15, that would imply the gunshot was at 12:15, contradicting Larry's testimony. Therefore, the evidence is the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) and Testimony 5. But Evidence 4's description says "Taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Click here for details." So the time is 12:15, which is 15 minutes after midnight. So that's 15 minutes after Larry claims he heard the gunshot. Therefore, the existence of the photo at 12:15 contradicts Larry's testimony that the gunshot was at midnight. So the correct pair would be Evidence 4 and Testimony 5.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the user says "You must only answer one pair." So I need to pick the most direct contradiction. Another possibility: The Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) says time of death is 24th or 25th. But that's a wide range. Not directly conflicting. The pistol was fired three times. Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) says two sounds after midnight. If Larry heard one at midnight, and Lotta heard two after, that's three, matching the three shots. But that's possible. However, the camera's photo at 12:15 would correspond to a gunshot then. So if Larry says the gunshot was at midnight, but the camera didn't take a photo until 12:15, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) and Testimony 5. So Evidence 4 and Testimony 5. But in the evidence list, Evidence 2 is Lotta's Camera. The camera's existence (Evidence 2) is what's responsible for taking the photos. But the actual timestamp is in Evidence 4. So the contradiction is between the timestamp of the photo (Evidence 4) and Larry's Testimony 5. Therefore, the answer would be {"evidence": 4, "testimony":5}.

But let me check if there's any other possible contradictions. Let's see. The pistol bullet (Evidence 9) was found in the victim's body. The pistol (Evidence 10) has Edgeworth's prints. But that doesn't directly contradict any testimony here. Larry's testimonies are all about hearing the gunshot. So the main contradiction is the timing.

Alternatively, maybe the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) taken at 11:50 PM shows the lake was empty. Then the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) at 12:15 AM would show something. But how does that relate? Maybe if Larry said he saw someone, but no. The key contradiction is the time of the gunshot. Since the camera automatically takes a photo when a loud noise is detected, the photo at 12:15 AM indicates the gunshot happened then. Larry's testimony says it was at midnight, which is 15 minutes earlier. Therefore, Evidence 4 (Lake Photo at 12:15) contradicts Testimony 5 (heard at midnight). So the JSON should be {"evidence":4, "testimony":5}.

But wait, the user might have a different answer. Let me verify again. Testimony 5 says the gunshot was at the moment the DJ said "It's almost Christmas," which would be midnight. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) is taken at 12:15 AM, which is after. Therefore, the camera's photo shows that the gunshot was at 12:15, contradicting Larry's testimony. So the answer is Evidence 4 and Testimony 5. So the JSON would be {"evidence": 4, "testimony":5}.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 5}

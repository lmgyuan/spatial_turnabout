Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts Lotta Hart's testimony. Her testimony (Testimony 0) says she saw Edgeworth on the boat. The relevant evidence might be the Lake Photo (Evidence 4), taken automatically by Lotta's camera (Evidence 2) on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. The camera faces the lake, so if the photo shows the lake empty or someone else, that contradicts her claim. Evidence 16 is the Second Lake Photo taken on 12/24 at 11:50 PM, but that's earlier. The Lake Photo (4) at 12:15 AM would be just after midnight on the 25th. If the photo shows no one on the boat, then Lotta's testimony about seeing Edgeworth there would be contradicted by her own camera's evidence. So the Lake Photo (4) contradicts Testimony 0.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 0}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies provided. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all listed here. Let me start by going through each testimony and checking against the evidence.

First, looking at the testimonies from Lotta Hart. Testimony 3 says her camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower. Now, checking the evidence, Evidence 2 is Lotta's Camera, which is described as being set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected, facing the lake. Wait, so the testimony says the camera was for a meteor shower, but the evidence says it's triggered by loud noises. That seems contradictory. If she set it up for meteor showers, then the trigger should be based on motion or a timer, not sound. But the camera's actual setup is noise-activated. So the purpose stated in the testimony doesn't match the evidence of how the camera was configured. That's a contradiction. 

Let me check other possibilities to make sure. Testimony 4 mentions using binoculars when she heard a noise. Evidence 2's camera took photos automatically when a loud noise happened. The camera's photo (Evidence 4) was taken at 12:15 AM on 12/25, which matches the time of the gunshots mentioned in Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11). But the key contradiction is Testimony 3 stating the camera's purpose was for meteor showers versus Evidence 2 stating it's triggered by loud noises. That's the main inconsistency here. Other testimonies about the mist or using binoculars don't directly conflict with any evidence. So the correct pair should be Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) and Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by going through the testimonies and evidences one by one.

Looking at the testimonies first. Testimony 3 says "That's why I was camping out by the lake." It's from Lotta Hart. She's talking about why she was there. The evidence list includes Lotta's Camera (Evidence 2), which is set to take pictures when a loud noise happens, facing the lake. There's also the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken automatically at 12:15 AM on 12/25. Then there's the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) taken at 11:50 PM on 12/24, showing an empty lake. 

Wait, Lotta's Testimony 6 says she watched the boat the whole time because there wasn't much else to look at. But if her camera was set up to take photos automatically when a loud noise is detected, and the camera was facing the lake, then the photos should capture any activity. However, the Second Lake Photo at 11:50 PM shows an empty lake. But according to the autopsy report, the time of death is 24th or 25th. 

Wait, the testimonies where she mentions hearing two gunshots after midnight on 12/25 (Testimony 11 maybe? Wait, no, Testimony 7 says she saw a flash and heard another gunshot. Let me check the testimonies again. Testimony 7: "Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot." That's from Lotta. So she's saying she heard two gunshots after midnight. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) is taken at 12:15 AM on 12/25. But the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) is at 11:50 PM on 12/24, which is before midnight. If Lotta was watching the boat the whole time from before midnight, but the lake photo at 11:50 PM shows the lake empty, then her testimony about seeing the boat and the men during the time when the photo shows nothing might contradict. Wait, but the time of the photo is 11:50 PM, which is before midnight. The shooting happened after midnight according to Lotta's deposition (Evidence 11: heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight). So the 12:15 AM photo (Evidence 4) might show something, but the 11:50 PM photo (Evidence 16) shows empty. But Lotta's testimony 6 says she watched the boat the whole time. If the boat was there after midnight, then the 12:15 photo should show it. But maybe during the time she was watching, the boat wasn't there. Wait, but the contradiction could be between her saying she watched the boat the whole time (Testimony 6) and the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) showing the lake empty at 11:50 PM. If she was there before midnight, and the lake was empty, but she claims to have been watching the boat, that would be a contradiction. But maybe she started watching after midnight. Wait, the testimonies: Testimony 3 says she was camping out by the lake. Testimony 5 says when she heard the "bang" she looked out at the lake. Testimony 6 says there wasn't much else to look at, so she watched the boat the whole time. If the boat wasn't there at 11:50 PM (Evidence 16), but she says she was watching the boat the whole time after midnight when the camera took a photo at 12:15 AM, then maybe there's no contradiction. Unless during the time she was watching, the boat wasn't present. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM should show the boat, but if the Second Lake Photo shows it empty at 11:50 PM, then maybe the boat appeared later. But that might not directly contradict. Alternatively, Lotta's camera took a photo at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4) which might show the boat, but her testimony says she heard a gunshot and saw a flash. The camera was set to take a photo when a loud noise is detected, so if there were gunshots, the camera should have captured them. But maybe the number of photos. Wait, the camera's set to take a picture when a loud noise is detected. She heard two gunshots after midnight (Testimony 11, which is Evidence 11: Lotta's Deposition says two sounds like gunshots just after midnight). So the camera should have taken two photos? But there's only one Lake Photo (Evidence 4) at 12:15. Hmm, but maybe the two gunshots were close in time and the camera only triggered once. Alternatively, maybe the first gunshot was at 12:15, but the second was later. But the autopsy report says the victim was shot once. Wait, the Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times. So maybe the two gunshots Lotta heard were part of the three. 

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 7: she saw a flash and heard another gunshot. So two instances. If the camera is set to trigger on loud noises, then there should be two photos. But the evidences include two Lake Photos: one at 11:50 PM (empty) and one at 12:15 AM. But if she heard two gunshots after midnight, why is there only one photo? That could be a contradiction. But the camera's description (Evidence 2) says it's set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected. So two loud noises should result in two photos. But there's only Evidence 4 (12:15 AM) and Evidence 16 (11:50 PM). So maybe there's a contradiction between Lotta's testimony about hearing two gunshots (Evidence 11: her deposition) and the camera only capturing one photo. Wait, but Evidence 11 is her deposition, which says she heard two sounds. So the camera should have taken two photos, but only one is present. However, maybe the first gunshot was at 11:50 PM, which triggered the 11:50 photo (but that's empty). Wait, the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) is taken at 11:50 PM, which is before midnight, and the Lake Photo (4) is 12:15 AM. But Lotta's deposition (Evidence 11) says the two sounds were just after midnight on 12/25. So the 12:15 photo would correspond to one of the gunshots, but where's the other photo? If the camera was active, then two gunshots after midnight should produce two photos. But there's only one. That's a contradiction between Evidence 11 (Lotta's deposition) and the camera's photos. But Evidence 11 is not a testimony, it's a separate evidence. Wait, the testimonies are numbered 0-7. Let's check the testimonies again. Testimony 7 is Lotta saying she saw a flash and heard another gunshot. Testimony 5 says when she heard the "bang" she looked out. So she heard two bangs: Testimony 5 (first bang) and Testimony 7 (another). So two gunshots. The camera should have taken two photos. But in the evidence, only two lake photos are present: 4 (12:15 AM) and 16 (11:50 PM). The 11:50 PM photo is before midnight, so that's irrelevant to the two after-midnight gunshots. The 12:15 AM photo is one. So where's the second photo? That's missing. Therefore, the testimony about hearing two gunshots (Testimony 7) contradicts the camera's evidence (Evidence 2) which should have taken two photos, but only one is present (Evidence 4). However, the user may have to pick an explicit pair. Alternatively, maybe the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) shows the lake with no boat, but Lotta's testimony says she was watching the boat. Wait, but in the Lake Photo (4), does it show a boat? The description just says "Taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Click here for details." Maybe the photo actually shows the boat, which is not empty. But if Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo) shows an empty lake at 11:50 PM, and the Lake Photo (4) at 12:15 AM shows something, but Lotta's Testimony 6 says she watched the boat the whole time. If the boat wasn't there at 11:50 PM, but she started watching after midnight, then the boat could have appeared later. However, Testimony 3 says she was camping out by the lake, which could have been over a period including both times. Hmm, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 6, where Lotta says she watched the boat the whole time, and Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo) which shows the lake empty at 11:50 PM. If she was watching the boat the whole time during her stay, but the photo at 11:50 PM shows no boat, that would contradict. But Testimony 6 says "there wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time." So she's implying the boat was there during her watch. If the photo at 11:50 PM shows the lake empty, but she was there then, that's a contradiction. However, if her camping started after midnight, then the 11:50 PM photo is before she was there, so no contradiction. But we don't know the exact time she was there. Let's check the testimonies again. Testimony 3: "That's why I was camping out by the lake." Testimony 4: "But, that's all I was hiding." Testimony 5: When I heard the "bang" I looked right straight out at that lake. Testimony 6: There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time. So the "bang" she heard was the first gunshot. She then looked out and watched the boat the whole time. If the camera took a photo at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4) which is after midnight, and the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) at 11:50 PM shows empty. If she started watching after midnight, then the boat was there during her watch, but the camera at 12:15 shows something. But perhaps the contradiction is that the camera's photo at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4) shows something that contradicts her testimony. Alternatively, if the camera was facing the lake and took a photo at 12:15 AM, but her testimony says she saw a flash and heard another gunshot (Testimony 7), which would have triggered the camera again. But there's no second photo. Therefore, the testimony that she heard another gunshot (Testimony 7) would mean the camera should have taken another photo, but only one is present (Evidence 4). So the contradiction is between Testimony 7 and Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera's capability). But the problem is that the camera's description (Evidence 2) says it's set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected. If there were two loud noises (two gunshots), then there should be two photos. However, the evidence list includes two Lake Photos: Evidence 4 (12:15) and Evidence 16 (11:50). Evidence 16 is before midnight, so unrelated to the two after-midnight gunshots. So the camera should have taken two photos after midnight (12/25) but only one exists (Evidence 4). Therefore, the contradiction is between Lotta's Testimony 7 (hearing another gunshot) and the lack of a second photo. But the camera (Evidence 2) is supposed to take a photo each time. However, the available photos only show one. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 7 and Evidence 2. But the user is asking for a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. Alternatively, maybe the Lake Photo (4) shows no boat, but her Testimony 6 says she watched the boat. Wait, but the Lake Photo (4) is at 12:15 AM, which is after midnight. If the boat was there then, the photo should show it. If the photo shows no boat, then her testimony is contradicted. But the description of the Lake Photo (4) doesn't specify content. However, the Second Lake Photo (16) at 11:50 PM shows empty. So if the boat arrived after midnight, then the 12:15 photo would show it. But if the camera took the photo at 12:15, and she was watching the boat from after midnight, the photo would show the boat. Unless the photo doesn't show the boat, which would contradict her testimony. But without the photo's details, we can't say. Alternatively, maybe the camera's setup: it's facing the lake (Evidence 2). If she was watching the boat the whole time (Testimony 6), then the camera's photo should have captured the boat. But if the photo shows something else, that's a contradiction. But since the photo details are not given, perhaps another angle. Let's think about the timing. The murder occurred on the 24th or 25th (Autopsy Report, Evidence 3). The gunshots Lotta heard were on the 25th after midnight. The Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times. The camera took a photo at 12:15 AM, which would correspond to one of the gunshots. But the other two gunshots would have triggered the camera. However, there's no evidence of those. Therefore, Lotta's testimony about hearing two gunshots (Testimony 7 and her deposition, Evidence 11) contradicts the camera's function (Evidence 2) which should have taken two photos, but only one is present (Evidence 4). But the user might want the testimony (Testimony 7) to be contradicted by the camera's evidence (Evidence 2). Alternatively, the camera's photo (Evidence 4) shows something that contradicts her testimony. For example, if the photo was taken at 12:15 AM and shows the boat, but she claims to have seen a flash and another gunshot after that. Hmm. Alternatively, the Lake Photo (4) was taken at 12:15 AM, which is after the first gunshot (Testimony 5: when she heard the "bang"). Then Testimony 7 says she saw another flash and gunshot. So the second gunshot should trigger another photo, but there's no such evidence. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 7 (another gunshot) and the camera's capability (Evidence 2) which should have taken a second photo. But in the evidence list, there's no second photo after 12:15. So the pair would be Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) and Testimony 7 (another gunshot). But according to the problem, the answer must be a pair. So the JSON would be {"evidence": 2, "testimony": 7} because the camera should have taken another photo when the second gunshot happened, but there's no such photo. However, the existing photos are 4 and 16, but 16 is before midnight. Alternatively, maybe the Lake Photo (4) at 12:15 AM is the one taken when the first gunshot happened, and the second gunshot didn't trigger a photo. But the camera's description says it's set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected. So two gunshots should result in two photos. The absence of the second photo contradicts Testimony 7. Therefore, the pair is Evidence 2 (the camera) and Testimony 7 (hearing another gunshot). The camera should have captured both, but there's only one photo, hence a contradiction.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 7}

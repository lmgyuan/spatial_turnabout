The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 9 (May Testimony) and Testimony 8 (by White).

Evidence 9 describes May's testimony as saying the victim dodged an attack and then ran to the right. However, Testimony 8 by White claims that the victim ran to the left. This is a contradiction because the two testimonies describe the victim's direction of movement differently.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 1 (by White).

Evidence 2 describes the broken remains of a glass light stand, but does not specify when it was broken. However, Testimony 1 by White claims that the light stand was lying on the floor when he looked, implying that it was already broken before the murder occurred. However, Testimony 0 by White says he looked at the other window when he heard that thing fall, implying that the light stand fell during the murder, not before.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 3 (by White).

Evidence 2 describes the broken remains of a glass light stand, implying that it was broken at some point. However, Testimony 3 by White claims that he saw the glass light stand intact when he entered the Fey & Co. Law Offices a week before the murder. This is a contradiction because the glass light stand was broken, but White claims to have seen it intact.

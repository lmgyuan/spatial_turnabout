According to the Floor Plans, the stand is blocked from view looking from the office. However, White testified that he saw the victim running to the left and being chased by the defendant, which implies that he had a clear view of the area where the crime took place.

The contradiction is between Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 2 (White's testimony about the victim being hit savagely).

According to Mia's Autopsy Report, the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, and death was instantaneous. However, White testified that the victim was hit twice, first being hit savagely and then being chased and delivered the final blow.

The contradiction is between Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 1 (White's testimony about the light stand).

According to White's testimony, when he looked at the other window, he saw a light stand lying on the floor. However, Evidence 2 describes the light stand as being broken beyond all recognition, which suggests that it was not intact as White claimed.

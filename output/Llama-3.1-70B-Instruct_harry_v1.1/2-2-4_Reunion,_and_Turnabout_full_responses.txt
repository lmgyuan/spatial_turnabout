The contradiction is between Evidence 11 (Maya's Costume) and Testimony 4 (Ini's testimony about her sister's costume looking normal).

According to the evidence, Maya's costume had blood splatters on it. However, Ini testified that her sister's costume looked totally normal, which contradicts the fact that the costume had blood splatters.

The contradiction is between Evidence 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2) and Testimony 6 (Ini's testimony about not having her license).

According to the newspaper clipping, Mimi Miney died in a car accident after falling asleep at the wheel. However, Ini testified that she didn't have her license, which implies that she was not driving at the time of the accident. However, Ini also testified that she was in the passenger's seat and fell asleep, and that she woke up due to a jolt and escaped the flames. This implies that Mimi Miney was driving, not Ini. However, Ini also testified that she couldn't take over driving for her sister because she didn't have her license, which implies that Ini was supposed to be driving at some point.

However, a more direct contradiction is between Evidence 7 (Floor Plans (Crime Scene)) and Testimony 5 (Ini's testimony about opening the door and escaping).

According to Ini's testimony, she was in a car accident and escaped by opening the door. However, the floor plans show the channeling chamber, which is not a car. Ini's testimony about the car accident does not match the crime scene.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 10 (Pistol) and Testimony 5 (by Edgeworth).

Evidence 10 states that the pistol was fired 3 times, but Testimony 5 by Edgeworth claims that there was only a single gunshot. This is a contradiction because the pistol's description suggests that it was fired multiple times, but Edgeworth claims to have only heard one gunshot.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 13: Crime Photo and Testimony 5.

In Testimony 5, Bikini claims that she saw the crime scene after she finished her bath and was heading back. However, Evidence 13: Crime Photo shows that the courtyard where Elise Deauxnim was murdered was covered in snow, and there are no footprints leading to or from the scene. This suggests that Bikini could not have seen the crime scene as she claimed, since she would have left footprints in the snow.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 11: Elise's Autopsy Report and Testimony 5.

In Testimony 5, Bikini claims that the stabbing she saw must have occurred after Elise was pushed out of her window. However, Evidence 11: Elise's Autopsy Report shows that the time of death was between 10-11 PM, and the cause of death was loss of blood from a stab in the back. This suggests that Elise was stabbed before she fell out of the window, not after. This contradicts Bikini's claim that the stabbing occurred after Elise was pushed out of her window.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 11: Elise's Autopsy Report and Testimony 5.

In Testimony 5, Bikini claims that when she awoke, she saw Mystic Ami stabbing Mystic Elise through the back. However, Evidence 11: Elise's Autopsy Report shows that Elise was stabbed in the back and died between 10-11 PM. This suggests that Elise was already dead when Bikini claims to have seen the stabbing, which contradicts Bikini's testimony.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 7: Weather Data and Testimony 2.

In Testimony 2, Bikini claims that she saw tracks at the Main Gate that indicated the snowmobile had been used. However, Evidence 7: Weather Data shows that the snow stopped falling at approximately 10:50 PM, and the lightning stopped at approximately 11 PM. This suggests that the snow would have covered up any tracks from the snowmobile, making it unlikely that Bikini would have been able to see them.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 7: Weather Data and Testimony 3.

In Testimony 3, Butz claims that there was still some thunder when he went to check out the fire on Dusky Bridge. However, Evidence 7: Weather Data shows that the lightning stopped at approximately 11 PM, and Butz's testimony suggests that he went to check out the fire at around 10:30 PM. This suggests that there should not have been any thunder at that time, which contradicts Butz's claim.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 15: Larry's Sketch and Testimony 2.

In Testimony 2, Butz claims that he saw Iris flying with her white hood fluttering. However, Evidence 15: Larry's Sketch shows a drawing of a person with a hood, but the hood is not fluttering, and the person is not flying. This suggests that Butz's testimony may be exaggerated or inaccurate.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 3 (Hazakura Temple Map) and Testimony 2 (by Bikini).

Evidence 3 states that the Hazakura Temple map shows the temple and the surrounding area, but Testimony 2 by Bikini claims that her back likes to act up violently, implying that she may not be able to move around easily. However, this is not a strong contradiction.

A better answer would be that the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 9 (Victim's Staff) and Testimony 0 (by Bikini).

Evidence 9 states that the victim's staff had no crystal sphere attached, but Testimony 0 by Bikini claims that she saw Iris with a staff and a crystal sphere attached to it. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the staff had no crystal sphere attached, but Bikini claims that she saw Iris with a staff and a crystal sphere.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 0}
The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) and Testimony 3 (by Bikini).

Evidence 6 states that Iris's hood is a magical hood said to offer protection from evil spirits, but Testimony 3 by Bikini claims that Iris didn't have her hood on. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that Iris's hood is important for protection, but Bikini claims that Iris wasn't wearing it.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}
The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 10 (Shichishito) and Testimony 5 (by Bikini).

Evidence 10 states that the Shichishito is the apparent murder weapon, but Testimony 5 by Bikini claims that Mystic Ami was stabbing Mystic Elise through the back. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the Shichishito was the murder weapon, but Bikini claims that Mystic Ami was the one who stabbed Mystic Elise, not the person who used the Shichishito.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 5}
The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 7 (Weather Data) and Testimony 0 (by Bikini).

Evidence 7 states that the lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45, but Testimony 0 by Bikini claims that she saw the murder at around 11 PM. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45, but Bikini claims that she saw the murder at 11 PM.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 0}
The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo) and Testimony 2 (by Butz).

Evidence 14 states that there is a track leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge, but Testimony 2 by Butz claims that he didn't see a snowmobile. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that there was a snowmobile track leading to Dusky Bridge, but Butz claims that he didn't see a snowmobile.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 2}
The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 7 (Weather Data) and Testimony 1 (by Butz).

Evidence 7 states that the lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45, but Testimony 1 by Butz claims that he was lying under his bedding when a white flash almost blinded him, implying that the lightning occurred at 10:30 PM. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45, but Butz claims that he saw a white flash at 10:30 PM.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 1}
The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) and Testimony 2 (by Butz).

Evidence 6 states that Iris's hood is a magical hood said to offer protection from evil spirits, but Testimony 2 by Butz claims that he saw Iris flying with her white hood fluttering. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that Iris's hood is a protective device, but Butz claims that he saw Iris flying, which would imply that the hood is not providing protection.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 2}
The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 16 (Crystal Sphere) and Testimony 3 (by Butz).

Evidence 16 states that the crystal sphere was found half-covered in snow near Dusky Bridge the night of the crime, with blood on it, but Testimony 3 by Butz claims that he is sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood, implying that the crystal sphere was not lost. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the crystal sphere was found near Dusky Bridge with blood on it, but Butz claims that it was not lost.

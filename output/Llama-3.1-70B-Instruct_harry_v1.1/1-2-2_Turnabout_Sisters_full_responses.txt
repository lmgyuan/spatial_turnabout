The contradiction is between Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 5 (Gumshoe's testimony about the victim writing the killer's name).

According to Mia's Autopsy Report, the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, and death was instantaneous. This suggests that the victim did not have time to write the killer's name before dying. However, Gumshoe testified that the victim wrote the killer's name in blood before she died.

The contradiction is between Evidence 9 (May Testimony) and Testimony 1 (April's testimony about the victim dodging the attack).

According to May Testimony (Evidence 9), the victim dodged an attack and ran to the right, but was caught and struck. However, April testified that the victim dodged the first attack and ran off to the right, but was then hit by the girl in hippie clothes (Maya). This implies that Maya was the one who struck the victim, but May Testimony (Evidence 9) does not mention Maya being involved in the attack.

However, a more direct contradiction is between Evidence 1 (The Thinker) and Testimony 4 (April's testimony about the murder weapon). 

According to Evidence 1, The Thinker is actually a clock, but April testified that it is a "statue-y clock", and did not seem to know its actual name. But more importantly, Evidence 1 states that The Thinker was made by Larry Butz, which is not mentioned in Testimony 4.

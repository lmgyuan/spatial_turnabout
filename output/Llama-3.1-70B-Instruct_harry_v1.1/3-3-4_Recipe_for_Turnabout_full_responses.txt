The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 11: Tres Bien Floor Plans and Testimony 0.

In Testimony 0, Armstrong claims that the mirror was in the middle of the restaurant, dividing the two halves. However, Evidence 11: Tres Bien Floor Plans shows that the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio, which suggests that the mirror was not in a position to divide the two halves of the restaurant. Additionally, the floor plans do not show a mirror in the middle of the restaurant, which contradicts Armstrong's claim.

The contradiction is between Evidence 10 (Pistol) and Testimony 0 (Lotta's testimony about seeing Mr. Edgeworth on the boat).

According to the evidence, the pistol bears prints from Edgeworth's right hand, which suggests that Edgeworth was the one who fired the pistol. However, Lotta testified that she saw Edgeworth on the boat, but the evidence does not confirm that Edgeworth was on the boat at the time of the murder.

However, a more direct contradiction is between Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) and Testimony 0 (Lotta's testimony about seeing Mr. Edgeworth on the boat).

According to the evidence, the lake photo shows an empty lake, with no one on the boat. However, Lotta testified that she saw Edgeworth on the boat.

The contradiction is between Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) and Testimony 3 (Lotta's testimony about the camera being set up to take pictures of a meteor shower).

According to the evidence, Lotta's camera was set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected. However, Lotta testified that the camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower, which implies that it was not set to take pictures in response to loud noises.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
The contradiction is between Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) and Testimony 5 (Lotta's testimony about looking straight out at the lake when she heard the "bang").

According to the evidence, Lotta's camera was set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected, and it faces the lake. However, Lotta testified that she looked straight out at the lake when she heard the "bang", which implies that she was actively watching the lake, rather than relying on the camera to capture the scene.

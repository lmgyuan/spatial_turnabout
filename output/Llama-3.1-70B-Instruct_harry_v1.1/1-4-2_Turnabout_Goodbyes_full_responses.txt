The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) and Testimony 0 (by Lotta).

Evidence 4 states that the photo was taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM, and it shows the scene of the crime, but it does not show Edgeworth on the boat. However, Testimony 0 by Lotta claims that she saw Edgeworth on the boat. This is a contradiction because the photo does not show Edgeworth on the boat, but Lotta claims to have seen him there.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) and Testimony 3 (by Lotta).

Evidence 2 states that the camera was set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected, but it does not mention anything about a meteor shower. However, Testimony 3 by Lotta claims that the camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower. This is a contradiction because the camera's description suggests that it was set up to take pictures of loud noises, not meteor showers.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) and Testimony 7 (by Lotta).

Evidence 4 states that the photo was taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM, and it shows an empty lake, but it does not show a flash or a gunshot. However, Testimony 7 by Lotta claims that she saw a flash near one of the men's hands and heard another gunshot. This is a contradiction because the photo does not show any signs of a flash or a gunshot, but Lotta claims to have seen and heard them.

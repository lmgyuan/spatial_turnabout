The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 4: Sacred Urn and Testimony 3.

In Testimony 3, Gumshoe claims that Mask☆DeMasque always goes after the most precious art pieces. However, Evidence 4: Sacred Urn describes the urn as looking like a "plain old pot", which suggests that it may not be as valuable or precious as Gumshoe claims.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 15: Kane's Autopsy Report and Testimony 4.

In Testimony 4, Atmey claims that he notified the police 30 minutes after he was attacked by Mask☆DeMasque. However, Evidence 15: Kane's Autopsy Report states that Kane Bullard, the CEO, died at 1 AM due to cerebral hemorrhaging from blunt trauma to the head. If Atmey was attacked at 1 AM and notified the police 30 minutes later, it would have been 1:30 AM. However, the buzzer record in Evidence 19 shows that the CEO's office buzzer went off at 1:02 AM, which suggests that the crime may have occurred earlier than Atmey claimed.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 6: Shichishito and Testimony 2.

In Testimony 2, Atmey claims that the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and struck him. However, Evidence 6: Shichishito states that the ceremonial sword held in the hand of Ami Fey's statue was bent after the crime, suggesting that it may have been used as the weapon. This contradicts Atmey's claim that the thief grabbed a weapon from the side, as the Shichishito was already present in the room, held by the statue.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 20: Ron's Testimony and Testimony 3.

In Testimony 3, Ron claims that he donned his costume and descended upon the scene of the crime. However, Evidence 20: Ron's Testimony states that from DeMasque's 2nd heist on, he was stealing as directed by blackmail letters. This suggests that Ron may not have been the mastermind behind the heists, but rather a pawn in someone else's game. This contradicts his claim in Testimony 3 that he was the one who descended upon the scene of the crime.

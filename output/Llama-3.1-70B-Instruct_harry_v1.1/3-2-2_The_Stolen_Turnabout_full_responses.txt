The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 4 (Sacred Urn) and Testimony 3 (by Gumshoe).

Evidence 4 states that the Sacred Urn is a priceless treasure, but it looks like a plain old pot, implying that it may not be a particularly valuable or precious art piece. However, Testimony 3 by Gumshoe claims that Mask☆DeMasque always goes after only the most precious art pieces, which would suggest that the Sacred Urn is a valuable and precious item. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the Sacred Urn may not be a particularly valuable or precious item, but Gumshoe claims that it fits Mask☆DeMasque's pattern of targeting only the most precious art pieces.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 15 (Kane's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 4 (by Atmey).

Evidence 15 states that Kane's time of death was 10/12 at 1 AM, but Testimony 4 by Atmey claims that he used an emergency phone to notify the police 30 minutes after he was struck, which would be around 1:30 AM. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that Kane was already dead by 1 AM, but Atmey claims that he was still alive and able to notify the police 30 minutes later.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 6 (Shichishito) and Testimony 2 (by Atmey).

Evidence 6 states that the Shichishito was a ceremonial sword held in the hand of Ami Fey's statue, and it wasn't bent before the crime, implying that it was used as a weapon during the crime. However, Testimony 2 by Atmey claims that the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and rendered him senseless, but does not mention the Shichishito. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the Shichishito was used as a weapon, but Atmey does not mention it.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 14 (DeMasque's Broach) and Testimony 5 (by Ron).

Evidence 14 states that DeMasque's Broach was found in the shadow of Ami Fey's statue, but Testimony 5 by Ron claims that his broach got torn off on the door handle. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the broach was found in a different location, but Ron claims that it was torn off on the door handle.

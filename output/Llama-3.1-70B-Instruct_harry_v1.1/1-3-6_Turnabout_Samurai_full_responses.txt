The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 18 (Van) and Testimony 3 (by Vasquez).

Evidence 18 states that Manella used the van to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer. However, Testimony 3 by Vasquez claims that Sal took him to Studio One. This is a contradiction because the van's description suggests that Manella was the one driving Vasquez, but Vasquez claims that Sal took him.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 10 (Script) and Testimony 7 (by Vasquez).

Evidence 10 states that the script is a Steel Samurai script for Episode 13, but does not mention any action scenes being left behind. However, Testimony 7 by Vasquez claims that he knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so he left them behind. This is a contradiction because the script does not mention any action scenes being left behind, but Vasquez claims that he left them behind.

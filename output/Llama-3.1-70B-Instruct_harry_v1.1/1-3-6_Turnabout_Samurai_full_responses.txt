The contradiction is between Evidence 18 (Van) and Testimony 3 (Vasquez's testimony about Sal taking her to Studio One).

According to Vasquez's testimony, Sal took her to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer. However, Evidence 18 describes the van as being used by Manella to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer, which implies that Vasquez was not taken by Manella, but rather rode in the van with him.

The contradiction is between Evidence 16 (Steak Plate) and Testimony 7 (Vasquez's testimony about leaving the action scenes behind).

According to Vasquez's testimony, she knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so she left them behind. However, Evidence 16 describes a steak plate found in the employee area with traces of sleeping pills and a large bone, which suggests that Vasquez and Manella had eaten a meal together, including a steak, before the murder. This implies that Vasquez was not planning to leave the action scenes behind, but rather was planning to proceed with the rehearsal.

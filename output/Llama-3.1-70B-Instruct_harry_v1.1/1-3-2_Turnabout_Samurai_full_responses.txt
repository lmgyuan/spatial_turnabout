The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 5 (Powers'(?) Photo) and Testimony 7 (by Oldbag).

Evidence 5 shows a photo of Steel Samurai (Will Powers) taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios at 2:00 PM, with the photo caption stating it was taken at 2:00 PM. However, Testimony 7 by Oldbag claims that she saw Powers walking by her at 2:00 PM, heading toward the studio, implying that Powers was not at the gate at 2:00 PM, but rather was passing by Oldbag. This is a contradiction because the photo shows Powers at the gate at 2:00 PM, but Oldbag claims to have seen him passing by her at the same time.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head) and Testimony 2 (by Oldbag).

Evidence 11 states that Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, implying that no one could have passed through that area during that time. However, Testimony 2 by Oldbag claims that no one else went to the studio before 2:30 PM, and that she would have seen them if they had. This is a contradiction because Mr. Monkey's Head would have prevented anyone from passing through, but Oldbag claims that she would have seen anyone who tried to go to the studio.

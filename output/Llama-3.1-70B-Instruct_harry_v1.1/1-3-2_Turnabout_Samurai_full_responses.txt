The contradiction is between Evidence 5 (Powers'(?) Photo) and Testimony 7 (Oldbag's testimony about seeing Powers at 2:00 PM).

According to the photo, the Steel Samurai (who is Powers) was seen walking at the gate between the entrance and the Studios at 2:00 PM, as evidenced by the timestamp on the photo. However, Oldbag testified that she saw Powers heading toward the studio at 2:00 PM, which implies that he was not yet at the studio, but rather walking towards it. This is a contradiction because the photo shows Powers already at the studio at 2:00 PM.

The contradiction is between Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head) and Testimony 2 (Oldbag's testimony about no one else going to the studio).

According to the evidence, Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. However, Oldbag testified that no one else went to the studio before 2:30 PM, which implies that the path was not blocked and that she would have seen anyone who went to the studio.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 5: DeMasque's Calling Card and Testimony 3.

In Testimony 3, Atmey claims that he sent his card 10 days beforehand. However, Evidence 5: DeMasque's Calling Card states that the card was sent to the Security at Lordly Tailor, and it specifically mentions that the heist will take place at the "Treasures of Kurain" exhibit. This contradicts Atmey's claim that he sent the card, as the card appears to be from Mask DeMasque, not Atmey.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 10: Blackmail Letter and Testimony 2.

In Testimony 2, Atmey claims that Kane Bullard wrote the blackmail letter and sent it to Ron DeLite. However, Evidence 10: Blackmail Letter states that the letter was written with a fountain pen and found in Ron's room, but it does not mention Kane Bullard as the author. Furthermore, the letter's content suggests that the author is someone who knows Ron's true identity as Mask DeMasque and is trying to blackmail him, which contradicts Atmey's claim that Kane Bullard was the one who wrote the letter.

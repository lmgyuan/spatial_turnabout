The contradiction is between Evidence 15 (Max G. Bust) and Testimony 0 (Acro's testimony about lifting something the size of the bust).

According to Acro's testimony, he could have lifted something the size of the bust, but he also stated that lifting the bust and looking out of the window would have been impossible due to his injured legs. However, the bust is described as looking rather heavy, which suggests that it would be difficult for Acro to lift, especially with his injured legs.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 15 (Max G. Bust) and Testimony 2 (by Acro).

Evidence 15 states that the Max G. Bust is a bronze statue that looks rather heavy, but Testimony 2 by Acro claims that lifting the bust and looking out of the window would have been impossible. However, Acro also states in Testimony 0 that he could have lifted something the size of the bust, which suggests that he is physically capable of lifting the bust. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the bust is heavy, but Acro claims that he could have lifted it, but also claims that lifting it and looking out of the window would have been impossible.

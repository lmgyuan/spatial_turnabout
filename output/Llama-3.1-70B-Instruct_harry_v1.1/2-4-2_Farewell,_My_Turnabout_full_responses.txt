The contradiction is between Evidence 14 (Juan's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 5 (Gumshoe's testimony about the defendant buying the knife for the crime).

According to the autopsy report, the victim was strangled to death with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife. However, Gumshoe testified that the defendant bought the knife for the crime, which implies that the knife was the primary murder weapon. This contradicts the fact that the victim was strangled to death with a scarf before being stabbed with the knife.

The contradiction is between Evidence 17 (Lotta's Photo) and Testimony 3 (Oldbag's testimony about seeing someone show up).

According to the photo, a person in samurai garb is standing outside the door, but Oldbag testified that she saw a man coming out of Juan's room, which implies that the person in the photo is not the same person Oldbag saw.

The contradiction is between Evidence 17 (Lotta's Photo) and Testimony 1 (Oldbag's testimony about seeing the Nickel Samurai).

According to the photo, a person in samurai garb is standing outside the door, but Oldbag testified that she saw the Nickel Samurai, which implies that the person in the photo is the Nickel Samurai. However, the Nickel Samurai is a specific character played by Engarde, and the photo does not necessarily confirm that the person in the photo is Engarde.

The contradiction is between Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 3 (Andrews' testimony about seeing the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo).

According to the crime scene photo, the glass of juice is sitting behind the victim on the dresser, but Andrews testified that she poured herself a glass of juice after discovering the body, which implies that the glass of juice was not already there.

The contradiction is between Evidence 7 (Guitar Case) and Testimony 1 (Andrews' testimony about opening the guitar case).

According to the evidence, the guitar case was empty, but there was some water on top of the lid. However, Andrews testified that she opened the guitar case after knocking the vase over, which implies that the water on the lid was not there before she opened the case.

The contradiction is between Evidence 16 (Jammin' Ninja's Button) and Testimony 5 (Andrews' testimony about the button being torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt).

According to Andrews' testimony, the button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt, but the evidence does not confirm that the button was torn off during a fight. The button was found in Engarde's "hakama" and was covered in Corrida's blood, which suggests that it may have been planted there by the killer.

The contradiction is between Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 2 (Andrews' testimony about seeing Juan slumped over and tired-looking in the corner).

According to the crime scene photo, Juan Corrida's body is sitting on a chair with a knife sticking out of his chest, which suggests that he was not slumped over in the corner. Andrews testified that she saw Juan sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner, which contradicts the crime scene photo.

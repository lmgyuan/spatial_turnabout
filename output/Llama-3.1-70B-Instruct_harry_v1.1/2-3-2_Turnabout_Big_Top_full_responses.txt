The contradiction is between Evidence 10 (Ring) and Testimony 2 (Trilo's testimony about planning to give an engagement ring to Regina).

According to Trilo's testimony, he planned to give an engagement ring to Regina. However, the ring found in the evidence is a cheap ring with an eerie sparkle, and the engraving "From T to R" is not consistent with Trilo's claim of giving a ring to Regina.

The contradiction is between Evidence 3 (Silk Hat) and Testimony 3 (Moe's testimony about seeing Max's face silhouetted).

According to Moe's testimony, he saw Max's face silhouetted, but Evidence 3 describes a silk hat that was found at the crime scene, which suggests that Max was wearing a hat that would have obscured his face.

The contradiction is between Evidence 4 (Max G. Promo Poster) and Testimony 0 (Moe's testimony about there being no white roses that night).

According to the promo poster, Max's three famous symbols are a silk hat, cloak, and white roses. However, Moe testified that there were no white roses that night, which contradicts the fact that white roses are one of Max's symbols.

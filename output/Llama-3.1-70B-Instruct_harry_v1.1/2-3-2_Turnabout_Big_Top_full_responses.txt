The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 10 (Ring) and Testimony 5 (by Trilo).

Evidence 10 states that the ring was found with an eerie sparkle, and it was engraved with "From T to R", but Testimony 5 by Trilo claims that he still has the engagement ring in his pocket. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the ring was found at the crime scene, but Trilo claims that he still has it.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 3 (Silk Hat) and Testimony 5 (by Trilo).

Evidence 3 states that the silk hat was found at the crime scene, but Testimony 5 by Trilo claims that he saw Max wearing the three symbols, including the silk hat, at the scene. However, the evidence suggests that the silk hat was left behind at the crime scene, which would be inconsistent with Trilo's testimony that he saw Max wearing it.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 3 (Silk Hat) and Testimony 2 (by Moe).

Evidence 3 states that the silk hat was found at the crime scene, but Testimony 2 by Moe claims that he saw Max's silk hat on his head at the scene. However, the evidence suggests that the silk hat was left behind at the crime scene, which would be inconsistent with Moe's testimony that he saw Max wearing it.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 3 (Silk Hat) and Testimony 3 (by Moe).

Evidence 3 states that the silk hat was found at the crime scene, but Testimony 3 by Moe claims that he saw Max wearing the silk hat the entire time he was on the scene.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 3 (Victim's Note) and Testimony 2 (by Gumshoe).

Evidence 3 states that the victim was supposed to meet Fawles at 4:30 PM at Dusky Bridge and was supposed to wear a white scarf for identification, but Testimony 2 by Gumshoe claims that the victim was brutally murdered at Dusky Bridge, but does not mention the white scarf. However, this is not a strong contradiction.

A better answer would be that the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 5 (Scarf) and Testimony 4 (by Gumshoe).

Evidence 5 states that the scarf was worn by the victim at the time of the incident and was found on Dusky Bridge, but Testimony 4 by Gumshoe claims that the victim was not wearing a scarf in the trunk of Fawles's car. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the victim was wearing a scarf, but Gumshoe claims that she was not.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 4 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 1 (by Gumshoe).

Evidence 4 states that the victim was not wearing a scarf in the trunk of Fawles's car, but Testimony 1 by Gumshoe claims that the victim was wearing a scarf, as shown in the Witness's Photo. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the victim was not wearing a scarf, but Gumshoe claims that she was.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 1 (Valerie's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 6 (by Melissa).

Evidence 1 states that the victim died from blood loss between 4 and 5 PM, but Testimony 6 by Melissa claims that the victim was stabbed in the back and only got about 10 yards before she was stabbed. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the victim died from blood loss, but Melissa claims that the victim was stabbed in the back and died immediately.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 4 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 3 (by Melissa).

Evidence 4 states that the trunk opener appears to be tampered, but Testimony 3 by Melissa claims that the killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the trunk opener was tampered with, but Melissa claims that the killer broke into the trunk, which would imply that the trunk opener was not tampered with.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 5 (Scarf) and Testimony 5 (by Melissa).

Evidence 5 states that the victim's scarf was found on Dusky Bridge, but Testimony 5 by Melissa claims that she's lucky she wasn't wearing a white scarf. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the victim was wearing a white scarf, but Melissa claims that she would have been lucky if she wasn't wearing one.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 5}
The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 8 (Diamond) and Testimony 1 (by Dahlia).

Evidence 8 states that the diamond was lost to Eagle River 5 years ago, but Testimony 1 by Dahlia claims that the ransom price was a raw diamond, and her sister, Valerie, brought it to the bridge. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the diamond was lost, but Dahlia claims that it was used as ransom.

{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 1}
The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 3 (Victim's Note) and Testimony 5 (by Fawles).

Evidence 3 states that the victim was supposed to meet Fawles at 4:30 PM at "that" bridge and was supposed to wear a white scarf for identification, but Testimony 5 by Fawles claims that the woman he met was Valerie, not Dahlia. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the victim was supposed to meet Fawles at the bridge and wear a white scarf, but Fawles claims that he met Valerie, not the victim.

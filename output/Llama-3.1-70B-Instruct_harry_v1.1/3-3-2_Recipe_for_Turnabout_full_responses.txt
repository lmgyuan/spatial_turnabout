The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 11: Trés Bien Floor Plans and Testimony 5.

In Testimony 5, Gumshoe claims that there was nothing else missing from the crime scene. However, Evidence 11: Trés Bien Floor Plans shows that there are two vases on the tables, but in the Crime Photo (Evidence 12), one of the vases is knocked over and the other one is intact. Additionally, the floor plans do not show any broken vase, but in Testimony 18, Victor claims that he broke the vase at his seat. This suggests that there was indeed something else missing or broken at the crime scene, which contradicts Gumshoe's claim.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 3: Sports Paper and Testimony 0.

In Testimony 0, Kudo claims that the young man was reading the sports paper. However, Evidence 3: Sports Paper shows that it has a doodle of 'MC Bomber' with an arrow pointing to '100,000' that was crossed out, 'Ahahahaha' and a laughing face are written next to it. This suggests that the sports paper was not simply being read, but was being used for something else, possibly as a message or a note.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 3: Sports Paper and Testimony 1.

In Testimony 1, Kudo claims that the young man was rustling the pages of a newspaper. However, Evidence 3: Sports Paper shows that it has a doodle of 'MC Bomber' with an arrow pointing to '100,000' that was crossed out, 'Ahahahaha' and a laughing face are written next to it. This suggests that the newspaper was not simply being read, but was being used for something else, possibly as a message or a note. Additionally, the doodle and writings on the sports paper do not seem to be something that would be typically found in a newspaper, which contradicts Kudo's claim.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 12: Crime Photo and Testimony 2.

In Testimony 2, Kudo claims that the young boy upset the vase and knocked it right over. However, Evidence 12: Crime Photo shows that there are two intact vases on the tables, one on each table. This contradicts Kudo's claim that the vase was knocked over and broken.

The contradiction is between Evidence 9 (Pistol) and Testimony 3 (Gumshoe's testimony about the defendant attacking a person who was not fighting back).

According to the evidence, the pistol was fired twice, and it bears both Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. However, Gumshoe testified that the defendant attacked and killed a person who was not fighting back, which implies that the victim was not defending himself. This contradicts the fact that Grey's fingerprints were found on the pistol, suggesting that he may have been holding the pistol at some point.

The contradiction is between Evidence 8 (Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 3 (Gumshoe's testimony about the victim missing the shot).

According to the autopsy report, Dr. Grey was shot in the forehead at point-blank range. However, Gumshoe testified that the victim took a shot but missed because they were too close, which contradicts the fact that the victim was shot at point-blank range.

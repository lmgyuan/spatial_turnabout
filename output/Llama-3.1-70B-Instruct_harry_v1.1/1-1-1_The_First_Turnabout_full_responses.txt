The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 4 (Blackout Record) and Testimony 6 (by Sahwit). 

Evidence 4 states that the electricity to Ms. Stone's building was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime. However, Testimony 6 by Sahwit states that the phone in her apartment wasn't working, implying that the blackout had already occurred. However, Testimony 8 states that Sahwit reported the crime at 1:00 PM, and Testimony 6 was before Testimony 8. This means the phone should still have been working when Sahwit tried to call, but it was not. This is not a contradiction, however.

A better answer would be that the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 1 (Cindy's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 8 (by Sahwit). 

Evidence 1 states that Cindy's time of death was between 4 PM and 5 PM. However, Testimony 8 states that Sahwit reported the crime at 1:00 PM, and Testimony 3 states that Sahwit saw Cindy's dead body. This means Cindy was already dead by 1:00 PM, which contradicts the autopsy report.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 4 (Blackout Record) and Testimony 1 (by Sahwit).

Evidence 4 states that the electricity to Ms. Stone's building was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime. However, Testimony 1 states that Sahwit heard the time from the television when he found the body. This is a contradiction because if the electricity was out, the television would not have been working.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 2 (Statue) and Testimony 2 (by Sahwit).

Evidence 2 describes the statue as a potential object, but does not imply that it was used as a murder weapon. However, Testimony 2 by Sahwit explicitly states that the killer used the table clock as the murder weapon. This is a contradiction because the statue is implied to be the murder weapon by its description as being "rather heavy", but Sahwit claims the table clock was the murder weapon.

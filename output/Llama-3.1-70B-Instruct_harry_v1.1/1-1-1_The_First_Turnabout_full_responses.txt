The contradiction is between Evidence 1 (Cindy's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 8 (Sahwit's testimony about the time he called the police).

According to Cindy's Autopsy Report, the time of death was between 4 PM and 5 PM on 7/31. However, Sahwit testified that he called the police at 1:00 PM, which is before the estimated time of death. This raises questions about the accuracy of Sahwit's testimony, as he claimed to have seen the defendant fleeing the scene and then called the police, but the victim may not have been dead yet.

The contradiction is between Evidence 4 (Blackout Record) and Testimony 1 (Sahwit's testimony about hearing the time from the television).

According to the Blackout Record, the electricity to Ms. Stone's building was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime. However, Sahwit testified that he heard the time from the television, which would have required electricity to be working.

The contradiction is between Evidence 2 (Statue) and Testimony 2 (Sahwit's testimony about the murder weapon).

According to Sahwit's testimony, the murder weapon was the table clock. However, the statue "The Thinker" is described as being rather heavy, which could imply that it might have been used as the murder weapon instead of the table clock.

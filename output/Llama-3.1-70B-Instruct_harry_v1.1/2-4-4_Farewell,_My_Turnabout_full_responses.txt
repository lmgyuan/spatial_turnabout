The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 5: Lotta's Camera and Testimony 5.

In Testimony 5, Powers claims that the bellboy is the assassin. However, Evidence 5: Lotta's Camera suggests that Lotta's camera was stolen around the time of the murder, which could imply that the killer might be someone who wanted to take the camera, possibly to destroy evidence. This does not necessarily point to the bellboy.

However, a better answer would be:
{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 4}
The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 16: Jammin' Ninja's Button and Testimony 5.

In Testimony 5, de Killer claims that the button was planted as part of a setup to frame someone for the crime. However, Evidence 16: Jammin' Ninja's Button states that it was ripped from the victim's costume and found in Engarde's "hakama", which suggests that it may have been torn off during the murder, rather than being planted as part of a setup.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 13: Attempted Suicide Report and Testimony 3.

In Testimony 3, de Killer claims that he was asked to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews. However, Evidence 13: Attempted Suicide Report states that Adrian Andrews attempted to commit suicide due to shock from Celeste Inpax's death, and it is implied that Andrews had a close relationship with Inpax. This suggests that Andrews may have already had the figurine, as it was found with a note from Inpax, and de Killer's testimony about giving it to Andrews may be false.

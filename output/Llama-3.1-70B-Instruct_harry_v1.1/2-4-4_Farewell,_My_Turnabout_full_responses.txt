The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 30 (Bellboy's Uniform) and Testimony 5 (by Powers).

Evidence 30 states that the bellboy's uniform was worn by De Killer on the night of the murder, but Testimony 5 by Powers claims that the bellboy was the assassin. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that De Killer, not the bellboy, was the one wearing the uniform, but Powers claims that the bellboy was the assassin.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 25 (Figurine) and Testimony 2 (by Powers).

Evidence 25 states that the figurine is a wooden bear-shaped figurine, but Testimony 2 by Powers claims that the object given to Matt was some sort of wooden statue, but does not specify that it was a bear-shaped figurine. However, this is not a strong contradiction.

A better answer would be that the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 25 (Figurine) and Testimony 3 (by Powers).

Evidence 25 states that the figurine was found inside Engarde Mansion, but Testimony 3 by Powers claims that the bellboy gave the wooden statue to Matt, implying that the statue was given to Matt before the murder, which contradicts the evidence that the figurine was found inside Engarde Mansion.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 15 (Knife) and Testimony 5 (by de Killer).

Evidence 15 states that the knife bears the victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints, but Testimony 5 by de Killer claims that the knife was planted by Adrian Andrews to frame another for the crime. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the knife was used by Engarde, but de Killer claims that it was planted by Andrews.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 30 (Bellboy's Uniform) and Testimony 0 (by de Killer).

Evidence 30 states that the bellboy's uniform was worn by De Killer on the night of the murder, but Testimony 0 by de Killer claims that he met with his client at a bar to discuss and finalize a few matters, implying that he was not wearing the bellboy's uniform at the time. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that De Killer was wearing the bellboy's uniform, but de Killer claims that he was not.

{"evidence": 30, "testimony": 0}
The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 27 (Celeste's Suicide Note) and Testimony 3 (by de Killer).

Evidence 27 states that the suicide note was found inside the figurine, but Testimony 3 by de Killer claims that he was asked to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the figurine was already in the possession of the person who wrote the suicide note, but de Killer claims that he was asked to find it.

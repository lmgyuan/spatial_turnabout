The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 1: Mia Fey and Testimony 0.

In Testimony 0, Iris claims that she saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff. However, Evidence 1: Mia Fey states that Mia Fey is Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law, who passed away 2 years ago. This suggests that Mia Fey was already deceased at the time of the incident, which contradicts Iris's claim that she saw Mia Fey being struck by Elise.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 11: Elise's Autopsy Report and Testimony 3.

In Testimony 3, Iris claims that Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise. However, Evidence 11: Elise's Autopsy Report states that Elise was stabbed in the back, which suggests that the killer was behind her. This contradicts Iris's claim that Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise, as Mystic Maya would have been in front of Mystic Elise, not behind her.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 7: Weather Data and Testimony 6.

In Testimony 6, Iris claims that the snow had already stopped by the time the murder took place. However, Evidence 7: Weather Data shows that the snow stopped at approximately 10:50 PM, and the murder occurred between 10-11 PM. This suggests that it is possible that the snow had not completely stopped by the time of the murder, which contradicts Iris's claim.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 20: Stone Lantern and Testimony 4.

In Testimony 4, Maya claims that she could see a man behind her attacker by the light of the stone lantern. However, Evidence 20: Stone Lantern states that the lantern was not lit the night of the crime. This suggests that there would not have been any light from the lantern to illuminate the area, which contradicts Maya's claim that she could see a man behind her attacker by the light of the lantern.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 7: Weather Data and Testimony 0.

In Testimony 0, Maya claims that Pearl was stuck on the Inner Temple side that night. However, Evidence 7: Weather Data shows that the snow stopped at approximately 10:50 PM, and the bridge was likely impassable due to the snow and lightning. This suggests that Pearl would not have been able to cross the bridge, which contradicts Maya's claim that Pearl was stuck on the Inner Temple side.

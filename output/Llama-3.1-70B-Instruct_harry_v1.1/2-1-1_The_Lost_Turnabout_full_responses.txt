The contradiction is between Evidence 6 (Baseball Glove) and Testimony 5 (Gumshoe's testimony about the victim writing with his right hand).

According to the evidence, the baseball glove was custom-made to be worn on the right hand, which suggests that the victim was right-handed. However, the fact that the victim wrote "Maggie" in the sand with his right hand, as confirmed by Gumshoe, is not necessarily a contradiction. 

However, a more direct contradiction is between Evidence 2 (Dustin's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 4 (Gumshoe's testimony about the victim's skin).

According to the autopsy report, the victim's body was covered in bruises, which suggests that he may have been in a fight or experienced some kind of trauma before his death. However, Gumshoe testified that the scratches on the victim's skin were caused by him writing on the ground, which implies that the scratches were not caused by any kind of trauma.

The contradiction is between Evidence 6 (Baseball Glove) and Testimony 5 (Wellington's testimony about the banana).

According to the evidence, the baseball glove was custom-made to be worn on the right hand and looks kind of like a banana. However, Wellington testified that he saw a banana fall with the police officer, which implies that he actually saw the baseball glove, not a real banana.

The contradiction is between Evidence 2 (Dustin's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 2 (Wellington's testimony about the time he made the call).

According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 6:28 PM. However, Wellington testified that he made the call at 6:45 PM, which implies that the police arrived at the scene at least 17 minutes after the victim's death. This raises questions about the accuracy of Wellington's testimony, as it is unclear how he knew the exact time he made the call.

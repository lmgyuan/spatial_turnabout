The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 5 (Crime Photo 2) and Testimony 3 (by Gumshoe).

Evidence 5 shows a photo of the area around the victim's hand, with the victim having written 'Maggie' in the sand. However, Testimony 3 by Gumshoe claims that the victim wrote the defendant's name, "Maggie", on the ground where he landed, implying that the victim was accusing Maggie of the crime. This is a contradiction because the photo does not necessarily imply that the victim was accusing Maggie of the crime, but rather that the victim wrote Maggie's name for some other reason.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 6 (Baseball Glove) and Testimony 5 (by Gumshoe).

Evidence 6 states that the baseball glove was custom-made to be worn on the right hand, implying that the victim was right-handed. However, Testimony 5 by Gumshoe claims that the victim wrote the name with his right hand, but this is not necessarily a contradiction. However, considering the victim's body was covered in bruises and had a broken neck, it is likely that the victim's right hand was injured or unable to write. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the victim was likely unable to write with his right hand, but Gumshoe claims that he did.

However, a better answer would be that the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 3 (Glasses) and Testimony 1 (by Gumshoe).

Evidence 3 states that the glasses were found under the victim's body, and pieces of near-sighted lenses were found nearby, implying that the victim was near-sighted. However, Testimony 1 by Gumshoe claims that they couldn't confirm that the handwriting was the victim's, but this is not necessarily a contradiction. However, considering the victim's glasses were near-sighted lenses, it is likely that the victim would have had trouble writing without his glasses, and the fact that the glasses were found under the victim's body suggests that the victim may not have been wearing them when he wrote the name. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the victim may not have been able to write without his glasses, but Gumshoe claims that they couldn't confirm that the handwriting was the victim's.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 2 (Dustin's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 2 (by Wellington).

Evidence 2 states that the victim was a police officer, but Testimony 2 by Wellington claims that the person who fell from above was a police officer, but the victim's name was Dustin Prince, not a police officer. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the victim was not a police officer, but Wellington claims that he was.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 2}
The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 2 (Dustin's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 2 (by Wellington).

Evidence 2 states that the time of death was 6:28 PM, but Testimony 2 by Wellington claims that he made the call to the police station at 6:45 PM. This is a contradiction because the evidence suggests that the victim was already dead by 6:28 PM, but Wellington claims that he made the call 17 minutes after the time of death.

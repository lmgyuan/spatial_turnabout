The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head) and Testimony 5 (by Cody).

Evidence 11 states that Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, implying that no one could have passed through that area during that time. However, Testimony 5 by Cody claims that he came out by the studio and saw the Steel Samurai, which would have been around the same time. This is a contradiction because Cody claims to have seen the Steel Samurai, but Mr. Monkey's Head would have prevented him from getting to the studio.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 15 (Cody's Camera) and Testimony 3 (by Cody).

Evidence 15 states that Cody always carries his camera, but is still learning how to use it. However, Testimony 3 by Cody claims that he held up his camera to take a picture, but the lens wouldn't open in time, so he missed it. This is a contradiction because Cody claims to have tried to take a picture, but the camera's description suggests that he is not yet proficient in using it.

However, a better answer would be that the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 15 (Cody's Camera) and Testimony 5 (by Cody).

Evidence 15 states that Cody always carries his camera, but is still learning how to use it. However, Testimony 5 by Cody claims that he took a few shots, but it was too late, so he erased them. This is a contradiction because Cody claims to have taken pictures, but the camera's description suggests that he is not yet proficient in using it, and it is unlikely that he would know how to erase pictures.

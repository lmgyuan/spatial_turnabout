The contradiction is between Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head) and Testimony 5 (Cody's testimony about seeing the Steel Samurai).

According to the evidence, Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. However, Cody testified that he saw the Steel Samurai rehearsal, which implies that he was able to access the area where the rehearsal was taking place. If Mr. Monkey's Head was blocking the path, it would have been impossible for Cody to see the rehearsal.

The contradiction is between Evidence 15 (Cody's Camera) and Testimony 5 (Cody's testimony about erasing the photos).

According to Cody's testimony, he took a few shots, but it was too late, so he erased them. However, Evidence 15 describes Cody's camera as a new digital camera that Cody always carries, but is still learning how to use. This implies that Cody may not have known how to erase the photos, contradicting his testimony.

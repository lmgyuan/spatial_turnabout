Dammit! ...Why me? I can't get caught... Not like this! I-I've gotta find someone to pin this on... Someone like... him! I'll make it look like HE did it!August 3, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix: (Boy am I nervous!)Mia: Wright!Phoenix: Oh, h-hiya, Chief.Mia: Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix: Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia: A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix: Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia: Well, that's news to me!Phoenix: I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???: (It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia: ... Is that your client screaming over there? (Changed from [Isn't that your client screaming over there?] in the original release)Phoenix: Yeah... it's him. (Changed from [Yeah... that's him.] in the original release)???: (Death! Despair! Ohhhh! I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die!!!)Mia: It sounds like he wants to die...Phoenix: Um, yeah. *sigh*Butz: Nick!!!Phoenix: Hey. Hey there, Larry.Butz: Dude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!Phoenix: What!? What's wrong, Larry?Butz: Oh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?Phoenix: (Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix: My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix: The, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge: Ahem. Mr. Wright? This is your first trial, is it not?Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.Judge: Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.Phoenix: Thank... thank you, Your Honor.Judge: ... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)Judge: The test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright Phoenix: Um... the defendant... is me... right? (Changed from [Um... the defendant... is me, right?] in the original release) Mia: Wright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You're his lawyer! Phoenix: Um, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh. Mia: This is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn't you? Judge: Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more: Leads back to: \"Please state the name of the defendant in this case.\"Larry Butz Leads to: \"The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.\"Mia Fey Phoenix: The, um, defendant? That's... er... Mia Fey? Mia: Wrong, Wright. Look, I have to leave. I have to go home. I'm... I'm expecting a delivery. Phoenix: Aw, c'mon Chief. There's no need to be going so soon, is there? Mia: Listen, Wright! (Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client! (Changed from [Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client!] in the original release) I mean, that's about as basic as you can get! Phoenix: (I put my foot in it this time! I've got to relax!) Judge: Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more: Leads back to: \"Please state the name of the defendant in this case.\"Phoenix: The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge: Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix: (Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia: Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix: Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily. (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia: I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.Judge: Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?Mia Fey Phoenix: Um... Mia Fey? Mia: W-W-What!? How can I be the victim!? Phoenix: Oh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and-- Mia: The Court Record button! Remember to use it when you're in a pinch with [the R Button / Tab]. (Changed from [Remember to use it when you're in a pinch.] in the original release) Judge: Let me ask that one again: Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?\"Cinder Block Phoenix: Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block? Judge: The person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright. Mia: Wright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory. (Changed from [If you forget something, [just touch the Court Record button to help you remember.] in the original release) A mistake in court could cost you the case. Judge: I'll ask you again: Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?\"Cindy Stone Leads to: \"Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.\"Phoenix: Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.Judge: Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned Phoenix: Oh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison? Judge: You're asking me!? Phoenix: Um... Chief! Help me out! Mia: Check the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release) Phoenix: (Geez. Give a guy a break!) Judge: Let me ask again. Leads back to: \"She died because she was...?\"Hit with a blunt object Leads to: \"She was struck once, by a blunt object.\"Strangled Phoenix: Right... she was strangled, wasn't she? Mia: Please tell me that was you talking to yourself. Judge: If you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try: Leads back to: \"She died because she was...?\"Phoenix: She was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge: Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix: Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge: Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne: Yes, Your Honor?Judge: As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?Payne: The murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge: I see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia: Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. Use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record frequently. (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button to check the Court Record frequently.] in the original release)Judge: Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne: The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix: Um, Chief, what do I do now?Mia: Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix: (Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne: Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz: Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix: (Um... didn't they all die?)Butz: I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne: Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz: Whaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne: Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge: Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz: Dude... no way...Payne: The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz: Daddies? Sugar?Payne: Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz: Duuude!Payne: We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia: Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix: (Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens Phoenix: (Might be better not to get involved in this one...) Payne: Well, Mr. Butz? Butz: Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog! Leads to: \"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Stop him from answering Phoenix: My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case! Payne: Oof! *wince* Butz: Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, \"irrelevant\"!? That cheatin' she-dog! Leads to: \"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Butz: I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge: Let's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne: I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge: Yes, quite.Phoenix: (Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne: Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz: Gulp!Payne: Well, did you, or did you not?Butz: Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix: (Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly Phoenix: (I know! I'll send him a signal...) (TELL THE TRUTH) Butz: Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went! Judge: Order! Well, Mr. Butz? Butz: Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her. Payne: Payne: Your Honor, the defendant is lying. Judge: Lying? Payne: The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying. Leads to: \"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Stop him from answering Phoenix: (I'll send him a signal...) (LIE LIKE A DOG) Butz: Um, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember. Payne: You \"don't remember\"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you! Phoenix: (I got a bad feeling about this...) Payne: We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day! Leads to: \"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Judge: Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne: The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge: Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne: Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix: (This is bad...)Payne: On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne: Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit: Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge: Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit: I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment. I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him. Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment. Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead! I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside. I thought to call the police immediately! However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working. I went to a nearby park and found a public phone. I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM. The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge: Hmm...Phoenix: (Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge: Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne: Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge: Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne: Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge: Now, Mr. Wright...Phoenix: Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge: You may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix: C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia: Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix: Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia: Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix: Lies! What?! He was lying!?Mia: Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix: !!! How do I prove he's not?Mia: You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix: Um... okay.Mia: Open the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Witness's Account --Sahwit: I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Isn't a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him... Sahwit: Er... heh. I don't know. He just seemed strange to me, that's all. Like he was mad, and yet frightened at the same time. Just like... a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime! Phoenix: The defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture! Payne: Of course. What the witness means is that the man he saw looked suspicious. So, what happened next?Sahwit: I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Half-open... you say? Sahwit: Yes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes. I watched for a moment, but no one came to close the door. \"That's odd, in a big city like this,\" I thought... Payne: I see. And what happened next?Sahwit: Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What gave you the idea to do that? Sahwit: Well, the door was half-open, you see. Isn't it only human to want to... peek? We climb mountains because they are there! It's the same thing. Payne: Truer words have never been spoken! Anyone would look inside! Phoenix: (Hmm... why did Payne cut him off so quickly?) Payne: So, you looked into the apartment. What happened then?Sahwit: Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure she was dead? Sahwit: W-Well, no, I guess I wasn't. But, she wasn't moving at all, and there was blood everywhere. Phoenix: (I guess that would look fatal to anyone...) Very well, what happened next?Sahwit: I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you didn't touch ANYTHING in the apartment? Sahwit: Um, yes. I mean no! Nothing. Phoenix: Okay. What happened next?Sahwit: I thought to call the police immediately!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You \"thought\" to call the police? Does that mean you didn't actually call them!? Payne: Please, please... Listen to the rest of the testimony. You thought to call the police... What happened next?Sahwit: However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The phone in her apartment wasn't working? Sahwit: Yes. I mean, no. No, it wasn't. Right. (Changed from [Yes. I mean, no, no it wasn't. Right.] in the original release) Phoenix: But you said you didn't go into the apartment... or did you!? Sahwit: Oh, oh, that? I can explain that! There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway. I reached inside and tried using that to call... Payne: And the phone wasn't working, correct? What happened next?Sahwit: I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why use a public phone? Sahwit: Well, you see, I don't have a cell phone. And, being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments. Phoenix: Ah, right... what time did you call again?Sahwit: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: 1:00 PM! Are you certain? Sahwit: Yes. Absolutely. Phoenix: (Hmm... He seems really confident.) Mia: 1:00 PM? Wright. Doesn't that seem strange to you? Present some evidence to contradict him!Present Cindy's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?\"Sahwit: The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely, 100% positive? Sahwit: Yes, it was him.

There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television. Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it? I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program! That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM! Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Judge: Hmm... I see. You heard a voice saying the time on a taped program.

So you're saying you \"heard\" something. But if you were so shocked by the body, you wouldn't hear anything at all! Payne: Payne: The witness did say he actually heard the time. It's ludicrous to suggest he \"wouldn't hear anything\"! Judge: Hmm... I have to agree with the prosecution.

Payne: Incidentally, there was no radio on the premises. There was only one large television. Mia: Wright! I can't put my finger on it, but something about this seems fishy.

Can you explain this?Present Blackout Record Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold it right there!\"Sahwit: I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A... video? Sahwit: Yes, that would explain why the time was wrong! Phoenix: True, true... Mia: Wright! I think the problem lies someplace else... Judge: We're agreed that you heard the time at the scene, then.Present Blackout Record Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold it right there!\"Sahwit: That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure the voice you heard said it was 1:00 PM?

I only remembered it just now.Present Blackout Record Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold it right there!\"Sahwit: Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, you just watch it!

This is because the blackout record indicates that the electricity was out from noon to 6 PM, which means that the victim's TV would not have been working during that time. Sahwit's testimony that the victim was watching a video of a taped program, which would have required the TV to be working, is therefore contradictory.\n"

Do you have an explanation for this, Mr. Sahwit?Sahwit: No, I... I find it quite puzzling myself! Quite! ... Aah! W-wait! I remember now!Judge: Mr. Sahwit?

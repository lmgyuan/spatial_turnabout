A country torn in two. One to the west... ...and one to the east. When those which were split are made whole again... ...the truth will reveal itself. I-It's the Yatagarasu! The Yatagarasu's here! Edgeworth: You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! Edgeworth: (It's so nice, almost dreamlike, to finally have the chance to relax and sip some tea. Especially after what a whirlwind the past few days have been.) On my return flight, I was dragged into a case involving an Interpol agent's murder. The next day, I investigated a kidnapping and a murder at the Gatewater Land theme park. And later that night, a detective's dead body welcomed me back to my office... ...along with a thief who was out to pilfer files related to a case from 10 years ago. (How did I manage to find myself in the middle of so many cases back to back? Well, at least I have today. All I ask is that I be allowed to spend it quietly.) ???: Mr. Edgewooooorth! This is big! Big, I tell you! ...Hey, what's wrong with you? Where's your enthusiasm...? Edgeworth: And suddenly, the phrase \"the fragility of dreams\" comes to mind... Kay: What are you talking about, \"fragile dreams\"!? Come on, let's go! The fake Yatagarasu isn't going to just find herself, you know! Edgeworth: Well, if you must know... it's possible that I was paid a visit last night by your \"fake\". Kay: Say what? Edgeworth: ......... Edgeworth: Unfortunately for us, the thief managed to escape. But even now, we're still looking for this criminal. However, I must warn you that we've only had a few hours to search so far... ...so I must insist that you be patient on this one, Kay. Kay: Wh-What's with you today...? Are you sure you aren't sleep-talking to me right now? Anyway, I've got something much more important that I want you to see! Edgeworth: Oh, and that is? Kay: Take a look at this! Edgeworth: \"On March 14th, I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" That's quite a bold declaration to send to an embassy... (I suppose it was inevitable that a newspaper would catch wind of this.) Kay: The date the card mentions is today! Edgeworth: Today, huh... Kay: Come on, we've gotta hurry! The embassy awaits! Edgeworth: I suppose it IS quite an urgent matter... ...however, do you know which country's embassy we should be investigating? Kay: Well, it's some really special country, and I'm actually really fuzzy on the details... But never mind that! Where's all your energy!? Why are you so lackadaisical today!? Edgeworth: I'm not, Kay. You're just too wound up. Kay: Well, then you should get too wound up, too! Because this just might be our chance to catch that woman! Edgeworth: You mean Ms. Yew? (The woman who killed Kay's father, Byrne Faraday, seven years ago... Calisto Yew... She claimed to be the Great Thief Yatagarasu... ...and then disappeared from the courtroom.) Kay: Argh! She makes me so mad! The phony! Everyone knows that the real Yatagarasu would never send something like a calling card! Until a company's underhanded dealings are made public... ...the target is always totally unaware that the Yatagarasu has paid them a visit. That's what makes the real Yatagarasu so awesome! Edgeworth: Hmm... The Yatagarasu's card that's shown in this article... It looks to me as though it could be genuine. Kay: See, that's the thing. Whoever it is, that person isn't the real deal, but has knowledge of the Yatagarasu. If this isn't a clue that that woman's involved, then nothing is! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Out the door you go! Edgeworth: Wait, there are a few preparations I must make before we go... (There's something interesting about this card we found last night here in my office... It's of a different color than the one in the article, which makes me wonder why.) Kay: What's up? Any reason why you're boring a hole through the newspaper with your eyes? Edgeworth: No... No reason at all. Very well. Seeing as how Ms. Yew is also someone of a special nature to me... ...I agree there is some merit to be found in investigating this. Kay: I knew you'd come around! ???: By the light of this night's glorious moon... We are ready! Pink Princess: Ready to embark on our nightly outing. Steel Samurai: And this is where... ...our tale begins! Edgeworth: Heh... What a coincidence. Who would've thought that a Steel Samurai stage show... ...would ever be held at such an elegant theater inside a foreign embassy? Kay: Yeah! The climax was really awesome! \"Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!\" I got chills down my spine when he pulled that move out! Edgeworth: I suppose it really is more impactful to watch a show in person than on television. Kay: I have to say, though, this embassy is set up kinda funny. I mean, they have two countries sharing the same building! Edgeworth: Well, as you said yourself, this place and the countries it houses are very special. Even this theater is special in that it is a neutral zone shared by the two countries. Kay: Umm... So, let me get this straight... The Steel Samurai show just now is being sponsored by one of the two countries. The one that's called the Kingdom of Allebahst, right? Edgeworth: Yes, it would appear that the Steel Samurai is very popular in that country as well. Kay: Seems that way! But you know who I'M really into? The Jammin' Ninja! The Republic of Babahl is sponsoring a Jammin' Ninja stage show! That's something for fangirls like me! We've totally gotta see that too, Mr. Edgeworth! The Jammin' Ninja's show is gonna kick the Steel Samurai show's rear end! Edgeworth: (You know, ever since I first met this girl, I've always had this inkling... ...that what she really wants to be... ...is not a thief, but rather, a ninja...) Kay: So anyway, about today's event... umm... What's it called again? Edgeworth: \"The Kingdom of Allebahst versus The Republic of Babahl Goodwill Jubilee\". The small, European countries of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...and the Republic of Babahl. These two countries used to be a single entity that was abundant with nature. And it was called... the Principality of Cohdopia. .................. Kay: Hm? Is everything alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Yes, I'm alright. Moving on... After a period of civil unrest, the country split in two, though signs of their past remain. For example, their flags preserve the flower and butterfly motifs to this day. ......... (Cohdopia, huh... The KG-8 Incident... and what was referred to as the second KG-8 Incident... ...in which an Embassy staff member was murdered... Both of these cases were related to the Principality of Cohdopia. In the seven years that have passed, the country may have split into two... ...however, the Yatagarasu still sent a calling card here. What could it all mean?) ......... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I know you're thinking about something! Edgeworth: Oh, excuse me. What were we talking about again? Kay: Argh, if you could please stop spacing out on me! Anyway, we were talking about the Allebahst versus Babahl Goodwill Jubilee. The two countries have had a pretty bad relationship with each other... ...but supposedly, they've been trying really hard to make up recently. That's why they decided to hold this event. Edgeworth: (If that's the case, then why the \"versus\"...?) Kay: Also, both countries claim to own the real \"Primidux Statue\", a national treasure to both. They're planning to have them publicly evaluated today, to see which one's the real deal. Edgeworth: Kay, need I remind you to take care and not succumb to your thieving desires? Kay: Well, when it comes to treasure, I can't help myself. You know that! Edgeworth: (Nngh... She had better be saying that in jest...) Kay: Hey! I can read your body language, you know! And you've got it all wrong! Look! I'm here to do some investigating! INVESTIGATING, I tell you! Edgeworth: Heh, I know. And although we don't know if the Yatagarasu will really make an appearance... ...I suppose we should still spend some time examining this place. After examining pamphlets: Edgeworth: I suppose I'll just help myself to one of these... Embassy Guide stuck into the pages of my Organizer. Edgeworth: (Hm? What is all the hubbub?) Ack! Kay: Hey, look! It's the Steel Samurai! And he's got his son, the Iron Infant, with him!! Edgeworth: May I speak with you for a second? (...It's... the Steel Samurai...) Steel Samurai: ......... Edgeworth: ......... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! What are you glaring at him for!? Edgeworth: Ahem, please excuse me. It's just that I've never seen a super-hero up close before. Steel Samurai: ......... Kay: It looks like he's written something down for you! Edgeworth: \"To Edgeworth, From Steel Samurai Daddy: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo\" Kay: Wow, an autograph! Pretty cool that you got one, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Heh... Steel Samurai's Autograph received. Guard: Mr. Steel Samurai! Ambassador Alba is waiting for you! Reporter: And now the Steel Samurai... ...will proceed to enter the Kingdom of Allebahst to shake the hand of the ambassador. The Steel Samurai isn't only here for the two countries tonight... ...but rather, can be thought of as a goodwill ambassador from our own country as well! Kay: There he goes. Off to spread goodwill to the world. Edgeworth: He really does seem like a goodwill ambassador, doesn't he? Cameraman: OK! We're shooting the next segment now! Cue camera! Reporter: In just a few seconds, the Jammin' Ninja stage show is set to begin. After the show, the Jammin' Ninja will enter the Republic of Babahl. He is set to meet with the Ambassador of Babahl at that time. Kay: AHH! The Jammin' Ninja's show is about to start! We've gotta get back to our seats! Edgeworth: Regrettably... I don't have much of an interest in ninjas... Kay: Well, this show will change your mind! Come on, we have to hurry! If we miss even a second of the Jammin' Ninja's awesome playing, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I suppose you're not about to give me much of a choice here, are you, Kay?) Kay: Ahhh! I could listen to that \"A Ninja Marked for Death's Lullaby\" song all day! His superb playing and that sad melody really brought a tear to my eye! And his heart-wrenching voice! Now THAT'S the Jammin' Ninja's greatest weapon! Edgeworth: .................. Kay: Ahh! Those pieces of Jammin' Ninja merchandise over there! I've got to have them! I especially want the hair sticks they're selling exclusively at these shows. They're exactly like the ones the heroine, Princess Misola, wears in her hair! Edgeworth: ...Anyway. Kay: Anyway!? ANYWAY!? Hold it right there, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: You're thinking of going home, aren't you!? Edgeworth: Well, it doesn't seem likely that the Yatagarasu will be making an appearance tonight. Most likely, it was simply a prank. Kay: No way! I just know the Yatagarasu will show! Edgeworth: But I thought you said that the Yatagarasu doesn't send calling cards. Kay: Yeah, I did, but... Edgeworth: I figured from the very beginning that this would wind up being a wild goose chase. Kay: But that card she sent was a genuine fake calling card! Edgeworth: A genuine fake...? Kay: Well, how can I word this...? The Yatagarasu's mark that's on the calling card is exactly the same as my mark. Get it now? Officer: W-We've got a problem! Th-The Yatagarasu has been spotted in Allebahst! Edgeworth: What!? Kay: You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Hah! So you finally decided to show yourself, you phony! Hey, what gives!? Guard: I'm sorry but I will need to search you before you may enter. Kay: What the!? Hey! The Steel Samurai just waltzed straight on through without one! Now if you don't hurry up and let me through, my phony is going to escape! Edgeworth: Kay, a country's embassy is considered to be a part of the country itself. If you don't go through the proper procedures to enter the country... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I'm going to enter through Babahl and climb over the wall into Allebahst! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You would tell a prosecutor straight out that you intend to illegally enter another... Kay, are you listening to me!? Kay: Kay Faraday, and I'm coming through! Guard: Yes, and welcome! Edgeworth: Someone stop her! Anyone! Edgeworth: *huff, huff, huff*... Kay... Where are you? Don't tell me you really did find some way over this fence... Ack! Guard: Fire! This is too big for us to handle! Looks like the Yatagarasu came to Babahl, too! Edgeworth: You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! You had better be alright, wherever you are! Kay: I told you! It wasn't me! Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: *huff, huff, huff*... Kay! Are you alright!? Kay: Do I look alright to you!? Now, can you do something about this woman!? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe! What is the meaning of this!? Gumshoe: *sigh* Well, sir... it's um, this. Edgeworth: He's...! Kay: It wasn't me! He was already dead when I ran in here, hot on the heels of the fake Yatagarasu! Look, I only came in here because I saw a suspicious person at the open-air stage! Edgeworth: A suspicious person? Kay: A long, black coat and a hood over their head -- I dare you to tell me that's not suspicious! When I saw that person, I immediately thought that they must be the fake Yatagarasu. So I chased after them into the Embassy, then into here, and then lost sight of them... But I just KNOW that person is the one who did it! Shih-na: What are you so worked up over? There is no reason for you to be this loud. Edgeworth: Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're Agent Lang's secretary... ...Shih-na, I believe your name is, correct? Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: And if you are making an arrest... ...I assume you have evidence that it was Kay who committed the crime, is that also correct? Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: You refuse to answer!? Shih-na: I don't need to answer. Edgeworth: ! Shih-na: You are merely a prosecutor in this country, meaning you have no investigative authority. Gumshoe: H-Hey, pal! Just what the heck does what you just said mean!? If it happened here, it's under Mr. Edgeworth's jurisdiction. The end. And seeing as how this building is sitting on our soil, we can investigate wherever we'd like! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, Detective, embassies are a different matter. Gumshoe: Huh? Edgeworth: This office is considered to be a part of the Republic of Babahl. Which means that anything that happens in here... ...defaults to the control of the Babahlese government and Babahlese law... ...giving them exclusive extraterritorial rights. Gumshoe: Extraterrestrial (changed from [Extraterristrial] in the original release, correcting the typo) rights? Sir, do you really believe that the truth is out there!? Edgeworth: *sigh* Basically, our country's laws do not apply inside the embassy of another country. That's what was agreed to by our respective governments. Our authority to investigate was effectively nullified the second we entered this place. Which means we can do little here in this situation... Gumshoe: N-No way, sir! Shih-na: Please leave this matter in Interpol's hands and go home. Edgeworth: N...Nnnnngh... Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Kay: H-Hey, you're not...!? Mr. Edgeworth! ???: ???: In that case... allow me to join your investigation. Gumshoe: M-Ms. von Karma! Eeek! Franziska: Ambassador Palaeno, I truly appreciate you allowing me to join the investigation. Palaeno: It's really nothing. Manny was my secretariat, so of course I want to help you as much as I can. In fact, it's a blessing that Interpol agents were able to make it so quickly. Edgeworth: Franziska... Franziska: Well, well. I never imagined that I'd meet you here of all places. This is an embassy, meaning that you have no authority to conduct... Edgeworth: Franziska: A-Already!? What is it!? Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno. Palaeno: Hm? And you are? Edgeworth: I'm Miles Edgeworth, public prosecutor. I ask that you please allow me to investigate this case as Ms. von Karma's assistant. Gumshoe: A...Assistant? Franziska: Miles!? What the heck do you think you're...!? Edgeworth: Please, I implore you, Ambassador Palaeno. Palaeno: Very well. I'll be counting on the two of you, Ms. von Karma and Mr. Edgeworth. Gumshoe: Umm... What did you mean by you'll be Ms. von Karma's assistant...? Edgeworth: I don't exactly have a choice, do I, Detective? If I don't become Franziska's assistant, I can't participate in this investigation. Franziska: Hmph. There you go again, running at the mouth with that aloof expression on your face. Edgeworth: Franziska, please... Franziska: I don't know what you're planning quite yet... ...but at least I do know one thing -- that you are now my subordinate. Just remember that my whip is always ready to wake you, should you have a brain lapse. Edgeworth: Of course. I'll keep that in mind. Shih-na: ...If you are done playing games...! Edgeworth: Right. let's begin the investigation. Edgeworth: By the way, Detective... I suppose it's a bit late to be asking, but why are you here? Gumshoe: Well, better late than never, I guess, sir. I was placed on guard duty for the Babahlese Embassy today! Edgeworth: And why are our police guarding an embassy? Gumshoe: Well, on account of the card they got from the Yatagarasu... ...they called us up and asked for our help, sir. Oh, and because we've been searching for the Yatagarasu these past seven years! It was a more or less mutually beneficial arrangement, if you ask me! Edgeworth: Except for how mutually unbeneficial this has all turned out to be, I suppose. It looks like you failed to competently perform your guard duty yet again. Gumshoe: Ack...! Edgeworth: Look forward to your next salary negotiation... although, it's out of my hands. Gumshoe: But sir! If it gets cut any more, I won't be able to buy even instant (changed from [packet] in the original release) noodles anymore... After connecting \"Locked safe\" and \"Key used at Embassy\" Logic: Edgeworth: We know for a fact that the Yatagarasu's Key was used at this embassy. Furthermore, we found it in the victim, Mr. Coachen's pocket. Which leads me to think that perhaps it is the key to the personal safe in this office. Gumshoe: Good thinking, sir! Let's go try it out! Edgeworth: ...It appears I was correct. (The key that was left to us in the victim's pocket... It literally turned out to be the key to the next piece of the truth!) Hmm... What do we have here? Gumshoe: Hey! There's nothing inside! D-Do you think the Yatagarasu made off with everything, sir? Edgeworth: No, Detective, I believe all we need is a closer look. Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: What is this here? Gumshoe: It looks like the ripped corner of a piece of paper, sir. Edgeworth: No, I don't think it's ripped; it seems more, to me, like it's stuck in the safe. Gumshoe: Hey, you're right! It won't budge an inch, not even when I tug on it! But I don't think I've ever seen paper stuck on the inside of a safe before... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective, I think you have it backwards. It's not the paper that's strange... It's the safe. Gumshoe: What do you mean? Edgeworth: What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that... Edgeworth: Even just eye-balling it, you can see that the inside is a bit too shallow. Furthermore, with the unnatural way the paper is stuck at the back of the safe... ...I'd say that there is an extra bit of space behind the back wall of this safe! In other words, this safe has a second compartment. Gumshoe: Wh-Whaaaaaaat!? Franziska: I suppose that you are correct in asserting that the paper is stuck in an unnatural manner. However, if what you say is correct and there is a second compartment... ...how do we go about opening the door to it then? As you can see, there is no other lock or keyhole in sight. Edgeworth: Actually, there is one more spot of interest to me on this safe. Franziska: Oh? Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe that spot is the keyhole to our mystery second lock! Franziska: The safe and its locks... Alright then, since you are so sure of yourself, show me how you deduced your answer! Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: Doesn't the shape of this keyhole remind you of something, Franziska? Franziska: The shape? It does look very familiar... However, I believe it's simply a latch hole for the safe's lock mechanism. It's just for keeping the door shut, nothing more. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is that so? The person who used this safe... ...Mr. Coachen, made sure this safe had two compartments, in order to hide something. Do you honestly think someone like that would allow the keyhole to the hidden half... ...to look so obviously like a keyhole that even the average person could figure it out? Franziska: ! ...You can't be serious...! Are you saying that this hole is the keyhole to the hidden compartment of this safe? Edgeworth: That's precisely what I'm saying. Franziska: ...! Edgeworth: And I will prove to you right now... ...that the Yatagarasu's Key is the key that will open it! Franziska: Franziska: The Yatagarasu's Key!? Miles Edgeworth! This had better be a very bad joke! Edgeworth: Sorry, but this is no joke. The Yatagarasu's Key... ...is the very key that will open the second compartment of this safe. Franziska: We know that this key opens the first compartment of the safe. But the keyhole you're talking about... ...is of an entirely different shape than that of the key! Leads to examination of Yatagarasu's Key Edgeworth: Let's go over this again, shall we? The Yatagarasu's Key... ...was originally made to open Mr. Coachen's safe in the Cohdopian Embassy. We confirmed that as fact by opening the door to his safe with it. Now, let's take a look at the back end of the key. Looking at the knife portion head on, what do you see? Franziska: What are you talking... Aaah! Edgeworth: It appears that you've come to understand what I'm talking about. When viewed head-on, the knife's blade is the exact same shape as the keyhole! The real function of the knife portion is to act as the key to the hidden portion of the safe. Franziska: B-But that's... preposterous! Edgeworth: Because it looks like a knife and was used like one to kill Mr. Faraday seven years ago... ...we fell under the misconception that it was always meant to be a knife. But for both the safe and its key to conceal such clever tricks... ...whatever is hidden inside the secret section must be of incredible importance. Franziska: .........Then, it's even possible that what I've been searching for is inside! Scruffy! Hurry up and open that safe! Gumshoe: Eeeek! Y-Yes, sir! Opening it now, sir! Edgeworth: These items... They're...! Gumshoe: It's a bunch of funny-shaped things. I guess they're pieces of art, huh, siiiiir!? Franziska: You're in the way! Now, move, Scruffy! Gumshoe: I didn't think I was in the way... *sniffle* Franziska: These pieces of art...! They're identical to ones that have been stolen from various countries around the world! Edgeworth: I figured as much... These are the treasures this section of the safe was to hide from view! Hmm... I believe a more thorough examination is required. Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: Take a good look at these documents, Franziska. Franziska: It says that there are three pages in total, and yet, there are only two here. Edgeworth: Correct. Now take a look at the smuggling activity document in your possession. Tell me, is it not possible that your page was taken from this set of three? Franziska: Well, well... It certainly looks that way. Edgeworth: By putting our multi-part puzzle together, we seem to have arrived at an answer. And it seems that you have now found what you were looking for. Franziska: Yes, and with this, it has become crystal clear... ...that Mr. Coachen himself was responsible for the mass smuggling of Babahlese ink! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink? Franziska: Babahlese ink is a special product of the Republic of Babahl. However, due to a special reason, only a limited volume is ever exported. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And that reason is...? Franziska: That's classified. It's on a need to know basis, and you don't need to know. In any case, it seems that the head of the smuggling ring was our victim, Mr. Manny Coachen. Edgeworth: His base was in an embassy, thus, it was hard for both our country and his to interfere. Making it the ideal conditions under which to run a smuggling operation. Franziska: Argh... but it's so frustrating. I lost the person I was to rain judgment down upon with my Whip of Justice. Edgeworth: Well, even if he is dead, we still have a responsibility to look into his misdeeds. Franziska: You expect me to whip a dead man? ...Well, I'm not interested. Edgeworth: Franziska... You must know... ...that Manny Coachen was the suspect in the KG-8 Incident... Franziska: Of course I know! On top of being the head of the smuggling ring... ...there is the matter of what really happened in that case that needs to be resolved. After connecting \"Motif on knife handle\" and \"Butterfly of Babahl\" Logic, and examining golden statue and knife rack: Shih-na: ...Are you done investigating? Edgeworth: .................. Shih-na: You realize now, don't you? That this girl is the only one it could be. Now come along quietly, Yatagarasu... Kay Faraday. You are under arrest for the murder of Manny Coachen. Kay: M...Mr. Edgeworth! Please, you have to believe me! I didn't do it! I chased the fake Yatagarasu in here... and he... he was already... Shih-na: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'd like to help you reduce the number of mistaken arrests Interpol makes. Shih-na: ...What is that supposed to mean? Edgeworth: I believe I told you that Kay Faraday is not the culprit of this crime. Shih-na: ...Very well. I suppose I have no choice. I'll show you just how foolish your claims are! Shih-na: Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight. Utilizing the confusion caused by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy. Furthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu. And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body. Edgeworth: Your reason for suspecting Kay is because you think she is the Yatagarasu? Shih-na: ...Exactly. But it isn't just me. She calls herself the Yatagarasu. Kay: Argh! Look, how many times do I have to tell you!? I was only out to capture the fake Yatagarasu! Shih-na: Imposter or not... it matters not. A Yatagarasu is a Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: Very well. Then I shall prove that Kay is not the Yatagarasu who killed Mr. Manny Coachen! Shih-na: ...Go ahead and try. Show me what the prosecutors of this country are made of. Shih-na: Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight. Shih-na: Utilizing the confusion caused by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy. Shih-na: Furthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu. Shih-na: She wanted to steal documents regarding smuggling, so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Shih-na: And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body. Edgeworth: (So Agent Shih-na suspects Kay of murder simply because Kay is the Yatagarasu. But if I can prove that the Yatagarasu's goal is not related to murder... ...then I may be able to begin to reason with her!) Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na. I regret to inform you, but there is a flaw in your logic. Shih-na: Oh? Edgeworth: Even if you claim that she is the killer, and the Yatagarasu... ...I am certain that securing the smuggling documents is not the motive behind the murder! The key to the safe in this room was found on Mr. Coachen's body. Furthermore, the Yatagarasu would not be so stupid as to leave without the documents. Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: By the simple fact that the documents were still in the safe when we looked... ...it's obvious that the killer's target was not the safe at all! Shih-na: Shih-na: Then perhaps she didn't know that Mr. Coachen had the key on him. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If that's the case, then why would she have needed to kill him? Because I can think of no reason for her to kill him if she had not known that fact! Shih-na: Shih-na: Need, reason... All of this is simply our conjecturing after the fact. It's entirely possible that she accidentally killed him when she was sneaking him. Edgeworth: .........! Shih-na: Perhaps she didn't notice the safe's second compartment before returning the key. Edgeworth: Arngh! Shih-na: But the fact still remains... that Mr. Coachen was stabbed to death. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But you have no definitive proof that it was Kay who committed the act! Shih-na: Shih-na: ...Actually, I do. I saw her holding the knife she used on the victim with my own eyes. Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? Shih-na: ...Allow me to tell you a bit more about the evidence that will put her away behind bars. Shih-na: The knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife. The knife with the butterfly handle is the murder weapon, which the killer was holding. I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim. The knife is a part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other. The evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument. Edgeworth: Nnnnnrrrrrgh... Th-That is your definitive evidence...!? Shih-na: You see now that she is definitely the killer, right? Kay: No! Mr. Edgeworth, you've gotta believe me! I saw a suspicious person in a long black coat outside the Embassy, I swear! Edgeworth: And you came in here because you were chasing this suspicious person? Kay: That's right. I ran into this office only because I was chasing after that person... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the lights, but then... Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ???: ...Who's there!? Shih-na: This is... Shih-na: I came to this room upon hearing the girl's scream. And when I saw her holding the knife, I immediately restrained her. Edgeworth: So the object Kay felt by her feet on the floor was the murder weapon...!? Shih-na: I had the knife analyzed right away, but we failed to find anyone's (changed from [anyone] in the original release, correcting the typo) prints on it. Kay: But the suspicious person in the black coat who came into this room before me...! Shih-na: Shih-na: You continue to insist there was such a person, but if there was, where did they go? Kay: That... I don't know. But I know they came in here! Shih-na: Shih-na: That sounds like the desperate excuses of a suspected killer, not a trustworthy testimony. You understand, don't you? We can't trust this girl's words, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Gnnrk! (She has a point. Even if Kay's words are the truth... ...I must show that they are with some solid evidence!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I really didn't...! Edgeworth: ! Kay... Don't worry. If you didn't do it, then there must exist a way for me to prove that. Shih-na: Shih-na: Still not giving up, I see. In that case, try to counter my argument, if you can. Edgeworth: Don't worry, I can and I will! Shih-na: The knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife. Shih-na: The knife with the butterfly handle is the murder weapon, which the killer was holding. Shih-na: I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim. Shih-na: The knife is a part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other. Shih-na: The evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument. Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na's proof is the Babahlese knife that Kay was allegedly holding. Gumshoe: Yeah... So, um, how are you going to prove that Kay didn't do it, sir? Edgeworth: If Agent Shih-na wants to suspect Kay merely because Kay was the only one here... ...then I must show with evidence that Kay couldn't have committed the murder! Gumshoe: Um, but do you have such evidence, sir? Edgeworth: Yes. There is one piece of evidence that seems very unnatural to me. ...And I believe it is my duty to point that out to Agent Shih-na. Edgeworth: So the murder weapon was the knife with the butterfly design on it. But is that really the truth? Shih-na: What are you getting at? Edgeworth: I'd like for you to take a look at this. There is blood on the blade, and yet, there's not a speck of blood on the handle. This signifies that at the time of the crime, a different handle was attached to this blade. The knife that Kay was holding... ...had its handle switched, and was, in fact, not the real murder weapon! Shih-na: It wasn't... the real murder weapon!? Edgeworth: This knife can be taken apart. Shall we give it a go? Leads to examination of Babahlese knife Edgeworth: As you can see, the Babahlese knife has now been disassembled into two parts. The killer must have pulled the murder weapon out of the victim's body... ...and proceeded to swap the knife's original handle with this butterfly one. It was all to create the illusion that Mr. Coachen was killed with the butterfly-themed knife! Shih-na: Uurrnngh... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: (This should clear up any and all suspicion surrounding Kay.) Babahlese Knife Handle data jotted down in my Organizer. Shih-na: Your argument isn't airtight yet! Edgeworth: How so? Shih-na: It's possible... that the girl herself is the one who switched the handles. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! For what purpose would she do such a thing!? Shih-na: I don't care to know how a criminal thinks. The way they view the world is beyond the comprehension of a normal person like myself. Therefore, I wouldn't put anything past them, no matter how odd it may seem. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Heh. The truth is right there in front of you, and this knife will show you the way! You will come to see that Kay is not and could not have been Mr. Coachen's killer! Leads to examination of Babahlese knife Shih-na: What is this mark on here? Edgeworth: It's the mark of a flower. I assume you know what this means? Shih-na: No, not really. Butterflies rest on flowers all the time to drink their sweet nectar. Edgeworth: ...And so they do. (However, would this butterfly really drink the nectar of this flower? The answer is clearly... not a chance! Now to prove the relationship between the butterfly and the flower with this!) Shih-na: ! Y-You can't be serious...! Edgeworth: Hmph... It appears that you've made the connection. The flower on this blade is designed after a certain country's national symbol. That's right... The Kingdom of Allebahst. In other words... This blade is from one of Allebahst's ornamental knives! Shih-na: Aah! Edgeworth: This part of the knife handle... ...has Babahl's national symbol of the butterfly on it. Therefore, it is undeniably Babahlese in origin! But as we both know, you can't kill someone with just a knife handle. Incidentally, when exactly did the murder occur again, Agent Shih-na? Shih-na: Ack! After the fire had broken out... Edgeworth: That's right. Kay entered the Babahlese Embassy after the fire had taken place. Furthermore, she had not been to the Allebahstian side of the building before then. On top of that, not a single person passed between the two countries during the fire... ...which means that Kay could not have transported an Allebahstian object over here! This makes it impossible for her to be the true killer! Shih-na: ..................! Gumshoe: Whooooop! Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! What a great victory! Edgeworth: .................. Franziska: .................. Shih-na: .................. Gumshoe: Huh? Hey, why is everyone so quiet...? Edgeworth: (I'm happy we got this far and cleared Kay's name... ...but what worries me now is what will happen next.) Franziska: Franziska: What is the meaning of this!? An Allebahstian knife, here...!? Edgeworth: Do you mean... how did this find its way to the Republic of Babahl? It didn't just find its way over. Rather, we should focus on how it was smuggled over! Kay: You know what!? My brain hurts thinking about it while we're just standing around! Thinking while you're on the run? Now THAT'S the way a real Great Thief operates! Edgeworth: Kay...? Kay: Oh, thanks a bunch, Mr. Edgeworth! For proving me innocent, I mean! You believed in me the whole time, right? Tell me you did! Edgeworth: Umm, not really, but... Kay: Ha ha. Come on, you don't have to be shy about it! Shih-na: Shih-na: ...Your argument is still not airtight. Edgeworth: Would you care to elaborate? Shih-na: I understand now that the girl didn't commit the murder. However, there is still the possibility that she is the Yatagarasu. Kay: That again!? Look, how many times do I have to explain it to you!? I am the real Yatagarasu! I'm not like that fake one that goes around setting fires, OK!? Shih-na: Whether you're the real deal or a fake, it doesn't really matter. All I have to say is this: I have my suspicions that this girl is the one who started the fire. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Preposterous! On what grounds do you suspect her of such a thing!? Shih-na: The fact that she calls herself the Yatagarasu. That in itself is the (changed from [a] in the original release) most elegant proof. Kay: Ms. Shih-na. Shih-na: Yes? Kay: I... have no intention of taking back any of what I've said. Shih-na: ...? Kay: I am the Great Thief Yatagarasu. And I refuse to allow some imposter to claim that name as their own! The path of justice that my father pointed me towards... I will walk it the best I can! Shih-na: It's not good to be so stubborn. I hope you can understand that. Kay: Thanks a lot for the concern, Ms. Shih-na! Let me share something with you, too, as a token of my appreciation! Those sunglasses totally do nothing for you, so I'll steal them from you next time, OK!? Shih-na: Wh--!? Kay: Well, I guess we'd better get going! Franziska: Going...? To where? Kay: To the Kingdom of Allebahst! If we don't go, we won't know for sure, right? Franziska: I suppose not... We won't get anywhere simply by standing here thinking. To see where the Allebahstian knife came from... ...we'll have to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. Let's go, Miles Edgeworth. As you are my subordinate... I will not tolerate you bringing the investigation to a halt. Edgeworth: Hmph... Understood. To be continued MIB: Count off! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! ...1! 1! MIB: Shifu! 99 callouts! So all 99 members are most likely here and accounted for, sir! Lang: ...Hey, you. Yeah, you, the second #1 from my right. Officer: Sir! Yes, sir!? Lang: Here... A birthday present for you. Officer: Wha...?? MIB: Shifu! I didn't know that you knew all of our birthdays...! Officer: What a kind heart you have! Shifu, you are more of a man than we'll ever be, sir! Officer: Umm... I'm really sorry, but it's not my birthday... Lang: Lang Zi says: \"A cub who disrespects others soon feels the disciplinary bite of an elder.\" That present isn't for you. It's for your younger brother's wife's younger brother. ...Tell him I said \"hi\", and \"happy birthday\", won't you? Officer: Y...Yes, sir! MIB: Shifu! I can't believe you remember that much about each of us! Officer: Shifu! I... I'm so moved that I can't stop crying! Edgeworth: (...I should probably leave them to their \"alone time\".) Lang: Alright, meeting's over. Everyone... head for your posts! Dismissed! Sir! Lang: Yo, were you guys there the whole time? I got a call from Shih-na, and she's already filled me in. It sounds like you're out to get in my way again. Edgeworth: I have absolutely no intention of interrupting your investigation. I simply request that you grant me permission to investigate the Allebahstian Embassy. Lang: Hmph. And what if I say no? Franziska: Franziska: Agent Lang! This man is my subordinate. As I have received permission from the ambassador, he is to be extended the same rights. Lang: Sorry, sis, but it's not that simple. Allebahst has the strictest immigration regulations in the world, or didn't you know? Even among my elite men, about only half of them were admitted into the country. Besides, any more cooks in the kitchen, and we might spoil the soup, if you get what I mean. Franziska: How dare you make such assumptions!? Lang: Don't take this the wrong way, but I thought I was in charge of Allebahst, Ms. von Karma. Franziska: Grrr! Lang: Look, try to understand, OK? Things over in Allebahst are a bit of a mess right now. Edgeworth: What do you mean by \"a bit of a mess\"? Lang: No one told you? We had an \"incident\" in Allebahst as well. This is what we call a decision based on the investigation, Mr. Prosecutor. Kay: Look, Wolfy! Just let us in already! ???: ???: Is there a problem here, Agent Lang? Lang: Not really. Just having a \"discussion\" about whether or not to let these guys in. Franziska: Ambassador Alba, I ask that you please allow these people to join the investigation. Alba: Having a debate because of my country... I'm terribly sorry for placing you good people in that kind of situation... It is all because I lacked the strength to govern well. Edgeworth: Please, it is nothing of the sort, Ambassador... Alba: You weakling, Quercus! Curse your frailty and inability to affect change in your country! Edgeworth: Wh-What are you--!? Alba: The thing is, investigations conducted in my country have been under Agent Lang. And it is my judgment that in order to minimize disruption in the investigation... ...I should leave everything up to Agent Lang. Lang: ...There, you see? Kay: Oh, no way! ???: Palaeno: Ambassador Alba, I ask you to please reconsider letting them into Allebahst. Alba: What's that...? Palaeno: My very own secretary has been murdered in the Babahlese Embassy. And he was apparently caught up in some very shady dealings completely unbeknownst to me. So I ask for your cooperation in our investigation. These aren't much, but I hope they can cover your travel expenses to Babahl someday. Lang: Alright, alright. I get it. Even if you beg Ambassador Alba, I still have to give the final OK anyway. Kay: Alright! You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? We're in! Lang: Not so fast, my little crow-girl. You're still a witness in the Babahl murder. So I'd like you to please stay in the Republic of Babahl. Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Please take good care of Kay for me. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Lang: Sounds good to me. The fewer troublemakers, the better. Kay: ......... *rasp!* Gumshoe: *rasp!* Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: So I wanted to ask for a while now, but... ...that lady over there, is she who I think she is!? Edgeworth: Ah, that's right. I didn't introduce the two of you yet. Franziska: Franziska von Karma, the prosecutorial prodigy. ...It's nice to see you again. Kay: Ooh, I knew it! You're the whip lady! Franziska: .........You may address me as Ms. von Karma. Kay: Ms. von Karma, I leave the investigation of Allebahst in your hands! Franziska: Thanks. Rest assured, I will outsmart both the smuggling ring and the Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: (The smuggling ring, huh... Perhaps I should ask Franziska a bit more about them before I head into Allebahst. Ah, and I mustn't forget to thank Ambassador Palaeno for all that he has done for me.) After talking with Franziska von Karma and Colias Palaeno: Edgeworth: Well, shall we get going? ???: Edgeworth: What's wrong, Kay? Kay: I didn't get permission to enter Allebahst... ...so we're going to go gather whatever info we can over on the Babahlese side, OK!? Edgeworth: Alright, I'm counting on you two. Kay: Right, and I'm counting on you and Ms. von Karma to sniff out clues in Allebahst! Oh, and Mr. Edgeworth! If you happen to come across my phony, you let me know, OK!? If you tell me, I'll rush on over straight away no matter where you are! Edgeworth: .................. I'll let you know when the time comes. Edgeworth: (...Hm?) Gwoooooooh! Franziska: What do you think you're doing to my subordinate!? Edgeworth: Y...You're...! ???: Edgey...! Oh, thank the heavens you're here...! I'm in a really, really big pickle, Your Lordship! The Raven, it appeared, poof! And then disappeared, swoosh! And though I am the Steel Samurai, my sword, it... Waaaaaaaaah! I'm so confused, I don't know what anything means anymore! Franziska: Who is this fruitcake!? Larry: I am Larry of the House of Butz: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo, m'lady! Franziska: Now I remember. This... person is one of your friends, isn't he, Miles? Edgeworth: Yes, frighteningly enough... he is. Larry: Hey! What's up with that answer!? Your best bud is in a bind, and you act like it's no big deal! Edgeworth: What sort of \"bind\" are we talking about here...? Larry: The suspect kind! I accidentally became a suspect in a murdeeeeeer! Edgeworth: I see. That is quite the bind. Franziska: ...Not that we're in the least bit surprised. Edgeworth: Yes, I pretty much expected this news... ...from the instant I saw this unlucky face. (His name is Larry Butz. I've known him since grade school, and for as long as I've known him... ...he has been the world's largest source of Trouble with a capital T.) Larry: Hey! What kind of introduction is that!? You're so mean, Edgey! If you're not careful, you might find your tiny number of friends go down by one! Edgeworth: That was uncalled for. Besides, you're............ Wait, hold on. Laaaaaaryyyy! It was you!? YOU'RE the one who wrote my Steel Samurai autograph!? Larry: Hm? Oh, you didn't notice earlier? I even winked at you through my headpiece. Franziska: .........What's going on? And why are you beet-red? Edgeworth: Sorry... but could you not speak to me right now...? ???: Lang: Oh, sorry, am I interrupting your comical, yet melodramatic play? Edgeworth: ! .........Aha. So this is the incident you mentioned earlier. Lang: Mr. Prosecutor, this man... this childhood friend of yours... is our prime suspect. Of what, you ask? Of the murder of a man who had snuck into this embassy, Mask\u2606DeMasque II! Edgeworth: Mask\u2606DeMasque II...? .................. (Only Larry could get himself into yet another mess as fine as this. But no matter what the facts seem to say, Larry is not the type to commit murder. Still, it's a rather daunting stroke of misfortune I've struck. I have to prove... that Larry Butz is innocent of all wrongdoing!) MIB: Shifu! We've identified the victim! Lang: Good work. I'll take that report now. Edgeworth: Agent Lang, would you mind if I took a peek at it as well? Lang: What did I tell you earlier, Mr. Prosecutor? Don't get in my way! There's only enough flesh here to feed one wolf, and that one is me! So, no, you may not take a \"peek\". Edgeworth: But Agent Lang...! ???: Badd: ...Agent Lang. Will you... allow an investigator such as myself... to take a look? Lang: Ah, yes. Of course. ...You, let the detective see the file. Edgeworth: You're... Detective Badd! Badd: You're... the prosecutor, Mr. Edgeworth, right? Edgeworth: Fancy meeting you here, Detective. Badd: You weren't expecting me...? Ever since that day seven years ago... I've chased after the Yatagarasu... non-stop. I even pressured Interpol... into keeping me in the loop... in case a card was ever found. Edgeworth: (What incredible dedication to the case.) Lang: Detective Badd knows the Yatagarasu's M. O. very well. And his passion for the chase hasn't died down in these seven long years. It's something... I can respect. But, Detective Badd, I must ask: are you going to make an ally out of this prosecutor? Badd: My only goal is to arrest the Yatagarasu. If he can get to the bottom of this case, then I'm willing to share info with him. Edgeworth: I am in your debt, Detective Badd. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: In any case, I believe it's high time for me to start my investigation. After correctly deducing spear and golden statue, and examining knife rack, paper in hand, Mask\u2606DeMasque II's head, sword, and flowers on windowsill: Edgeworth: Hmm... I guess that about wraps up my investigation. Hm? That's... Larry: Yo! Pink Princess! How're you feeling? Still feeling ill? Pink Princess: .................. Franziska: ...And yet another strange character comes out of the woodwork. Edgeworth: And so the Pink Princess also comes to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. (I believe I may need to speak with her as well...) After clearing all Talk options with Wendy Oldbag: Officer: Prosecutor von Karma! I've brought the police dog, as you requested, sir! Franziska: Good work. You may leave now, Officer. Edgeworth: Hmm... This dog... Franziska: I requested the assistance of a dog in our search for the Yatagarasu. Lang: Looks like you guys have some pretty bright dogs in this country, too. ???: Woof! Woof! Lang: Hey... You're a real cutie, aren't you? Yeah! That's a good boy! Badd: ...That's the police dog Gumshoe's been taking care of... I think its name is... Missile. Franziska: What a fitting name for a police dog that dashes out in front and attacks. Edgeworth: (That action alone isn't exactly what's going to solve the case for us, you know.) Franziska: Now, Missile. I want you to find some clues! Go! Missile: Woof! Franziska: Good dog. You really are quite bright, aren't you? ...Unlike a certain someone I know. Now, what do we have here? What... is this? It looks like a small hot dog, but... Edgeworth: Hm? Wait, Franziska, isn't that... an official Samurai Dog? Missile: Grrraaaaaaarh! Franziska: Ah! No! Bad Missile! .........He ate it. I wonder if it's alright for him to eat that? Edgeworth: It's just a meat-substance snack featuring the Steel Samurai. I'm sure he'll be fine. Franziska: That's quite a bit of information you gathered there in a single, quick glance. Edgeworth: (We should really be focusing on why there was a Samurai Dog there in the first place.) Franziska: Hm? It looks like that snack wasn't all Missile found. Edgeworth: Oh? And what do we have... here...? Franziska: It appears to be a lady's undershirt. I wonder if Ambassador Alba might have an interest in cross-dressing? Edgeworth: I somehow doubt that. It doesn't look like the shirt would even fit him. (A Samurai Dog and a lady's undershirt... What are these two items doing in a room like this? Given the circumstances, the lady's undershirt could only belong to one person. I suppose I should get this over with and ask the owner of said undershirt about it...) Lady's Undershirt data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: If you could please take a look at this brown-colored undershirt... Oldbag: Oh, Edgey-poo... What is the meaning of this!? Edgeworth: ? Oldbag: Why did you steal that thing from my bags...? All you had to do was ask, and I would've gladly given you as many as you'd like! Edgeworth: Nnnrghk! Th-Thanks, but no thanks! This shirt was found here at this crime scene. Oldbag: What!? Edgeworth: Come now, why don't you just confess... and explain what it's doing here. Oldbag: I know nothing! NOTHING, I tell you! Edgeworth: What!? Oldbag: Oh, I admit that I used the fireplace to dry that shirt! But I can't really help the fact that I had to, you know! Wearing that Pink Princess costume was like being in a sauna! And on top of that, I get fingered as a suspect!? You're too cruel, Edgey-poo! Edgeworth: Are you claiming that you never once set foot inside this room? Oldbag: Of course I am! If I had been the one to find the body, do you think I'd be as calm and relaxed as I am!? I tell you, it's always like this! It's always my fault for some reason or another. That weekly tabloid article is missing? The camera is missing? That lawyer always makes sure it's my fault they're missing. Speaking of missing, there's the matter of my husband. Can you believe when we got married, he said, \"I guess I'm stuck marrying you.\" What kind of way to propose is that!? What he should've done is he should've whispered in my ear, \"I don't deserve you... but I can't help it. Will you marry me?\" Honestly, men these days! Edgeworth: Umm... Well... (I don't believe she is lying about her actions... So I can safely assume she really was drying her shirt by the fireplace on her break. And somehow, the undershirt managed to move from the next room into this one (Undershirt from next door - The undershirt was found in the office fireplace, but how did it get there?)...) I assume the Samurai Dog was also yours...? Oldbag: Ah, that brilliant mind of yours. You really can see through everything about me! Edgeworth: (And so the feeling of dread continues... But I suppose I should ask for more details...) After connecting all possible Logic and clearing \"Samurai Dogs\" Talk option with Wendy Oldbag: Edgeworth: (It would appear that the answer has made itself known.) Lang: You're making quite a confident face there, Mr. Prosecutor. Bring it on! I'm ready to counter any argument you may have! Edgeworth: Very well, then. If you are prepared... ...I'll show you exactly where my deductions have led me! Larry: Good! I'm counting on you, Edgey! Edgeworth: Leave it to me, Larry. My first attack will be... to expose your lie for what it really is. Larry: M-My liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!? Edgeworth: I know that there is still something you are keeping from the rest of us. Larry: Wh-What's wrong with you!? Why is it you won't believe me no matter what I say, Edgey!? Curse you! I should just hurry up and die already if that's how it's gonna be! I'll confess to every murder in the whole world, and then kill myself... ...and throw everything into mass confuuuuuuuuusion! Lang: Heh, you made some wonderful friends as a child, I see. Edgeworth: Larry, I only have one thing to say to you. Larry: Even if you make that face at me, it's no use! A man who is ready to die is strong-willed, you know! Edgeworth: Larry, it doesn't matter what sort of harebrained trouble you've caused... ...I only ask that you do not lie to me. If you cause an innocent person to be judged unfairly because of some insipid lie... ...I will never forgive you! Larry: E...Edgey... Edgeworth: Although, allow me to say... ...that I consider you to be among the innocent in this case. And that I will draw the real killer out. You can trust me on this. Larry: Alright. I... I... This time... This time, I'll tell you the whole truth, OK!? What happened, what didn't happen, the works! Edgeworth: Just what happened will do! Now then, if you would please testify as to what you did up on the roof tonight. Larry: After the show, I left the pushcart in the Rose Garden, and came into the embassy. Then, they took a picture of me shaking hands with the ambassador. After that, and until my next appearance, I had some free time, so I wandered around. That's when I spotted the chimney. A chimney like that is a rare thing, you know. So then, I wanted to play Santa and decided to give it a try. Edgeworth: Larry, I thought I just finished telling you to not lie anymore. Larry: Umm......... But it's... kinda, ultra-embarrassing. Edgeworth: And what exactly is so ultra-embarrassing that you can't tell me!? Larry: Edgey, man! I just said it was embarrassing, so of course I can't just blurt it out! So you're just gonna have to reason it ouuuuuuuuuuuuut of me! Franziska: As your superior, I command you to hurry up and expose this man's lie! Edgeworth: I have every intention to, for I'm not about to let us waste time on such a trifling matter. Larry: After the show, I left the pushcart in the Rose Garden, and came into the embassy. Larry: Then, they took a picture of me shaking hands with the ambassador. Larry: After that, and until my next appearance, I had some free time, so I wandered around. Larry: That's when I spotted the chimney. A chimney like that is a rare thing, you know. Larry: So then, I wanted to play Santa and decided to give it a try. Edgeworth: As I suspected, you do have something to hide, Larry. But what could be so embarrassing that you'd be willing to go to jail for it!? Franziska: This man's mind is a complete mystery to me. Edgeworth: I believe it's a secret to everyone of a normal mindset how Larry's mind works. However, taking into account his usual, women-obsessed way of thinking... ...I believe that his lie this time is also related to a woman, and this is what I intend to prove. Edgeworth: Actually, I believe in the case of this man, playing Santa is actually quite a big deal. Lang: Are you saying that your buddy isn't exactly made of Santa-quality stuff? Edgeworth: Precisely. You hit the nail on the head, Agent Lang. Larry: Hey, Edgey! That's so incredibly mean! Edgeworth: Tell me something, Larry. Did you know that Santa's job is to deliver presents to people all over the world? Larry: Of course I know that! I DID graduate from junior high, you know! Edgeworth: In that case, it's your turn to tell me something. I want you to tell me to whom you were delivering a present to. Larry: Umm... I was, ah... delivering a present to a child not basking in the warm glow (changed from [glow] in the original release) of love? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That must be the most elegant description of you I've ever heard, but a lie is still a lie. Larry: Y-You sure know how to kick a guy when he's down, you know that!? Edgeworth: In any case, the person you wished to deliver a present unto was most certainly this! Lang: Heh, interesting tastes you have there, Mr. Suspect. Larry: D-D-Don't spread lies about me! I totally didn't want to see Ms. Oldbag so much that I'd try to go down a chimney! Owww! Franziska: I advise you to stop right there in your bashing of a lady. Edgeworth: Well, I must admit that I, myself, hardly ever have the want to run into that lady. However... what if you were misinformed, and under the wrong impression? Then what? Lang: Define \"wrong impression\". Edgeworth: I simply mean that the man before you thought to enter the old lady's room... ...without knowing one very important fact. And that fact... is best summed up with this! Edgeworth: This is something the old lady received from her employer for the night. The girl who normally plays the Pink Princess... Mindy, was it again? It seems that this man is quite taken with that actress. Larry: Larry: But that's not true, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...? Larry: She's the one with the hots for me! I just know it! I can feel her sexy beam piercing my heart when she's watching me! Seeeeeexy beam, I tell you! Franziska: You filthy, despicable, inconsiderate, fickle, idiotic, cowardly... ...apparition of a man! You haven't matured at all since we last met! Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: Yes? Lang: This guy... He's got bigger problems than just getting involved in murders, I take it? Edgeworth: I suppose you could put it that way. Larry: Hey! What the heck, man!? I don't get you guys at all! Why do you all have to make me out to be some sort of bad guy!? Edgeworth: To return to the original topic, I propose that at least this much has been made clear. Without any knowledge that Ms. Mindy had fallen ill... ...Larry tried to make his way into the Pink Princess's room. That much we know for sure! Larry: Larry: Hey, Edgey... Looks like I've got the hang of this court thing now. Edgeworth: But we're not in court at the moment... Larry: Shut up! I see what's going on here, and it looks just like what you do in court! Lang: I guess old boy here still has something he'd like to say. Lang Zi says: \"Until the root of the tongue dries, one never knows the whole truth.\" You shouldn't form conclusions until everything is out in the open, which is why I'll listen. Larry: Alright! Then get ready to listen to me defeat Edgey in a battle of wits! Edgeworth: (Larry, have you forgotten that should I \"lose\", your victory prize will be your arrest?) Larry: So you think that all I wanted to do was to go visit Mindy? Well, I dressed up as Santa and climbed up to the chimney, but the smoke was really thick. It was a case of mistaken identity, and that mistake made me late for the speech. Then, to top it all off, I became a suspect in a murder. THAT'S what you really meant. But why would I ever put myself through so much humiliation on purpose!? Edgeworth: .................. Lang: .................. Larry: ..................Hey! Someone say something! Edgeworth: Larry, are you seriously trying to submit this, not as a confession, but as testimony? Larry: So what if I am!? Is there something wrong with that!? My claim is a claim claiming my claim. Do you have a problem with that!? Oldbag: So it was you! You're my stalker! But I should warn you, it doesn't matter what kind of flattery you throw at me. I'm the devoted type of woman who's wholly focused on one man, and one man only! And as long as Edgey-poo is alive, I can't just drop him and be unfaithful! No, I can't! Although, earlier, I was tempted just a tiny-winy bit by that wolf-man! But that was just a test of my love for my dear Edgey-poo, which I passed with flying colors! But from now on, I will stay completely true to my beloved Edgey-poo for the rest of eternity! I swear it! Larry: Aaaaah! I-I'm so inspired! Franziska: You're such an inconsiderate, cowardly, idiotic, and all-around completely worthless man! Edgeworth: (I thought I heard something ominous just now, but perhaps it was just my imagination.) I believe there is nothing further for me to prove at this point... Larry: What do you mean!? Of course you've still got something to prove! You still have to show some proof that I was trying to meet up with Mindy! Edgeworth: \"Proof\", you say? Larry: Remember, Edgey!? Everything is evidence in court, right!? Edgeworth: You mean, \"Evidence is everything in court,\" Larry, but I understand your point. Larry: Yeah, see! I'm totally a pro at this now! Edgeworth: Very well. If you wish to see the evidence... ...then let me show you the last piece of evidence you'll ever wish to see. Larry: So you think that all I wanted to do was to go visit Mindy? Larry: Well, I dressed up as Santa and climbed up to the chimney, but the smoke was really thick. Larry: It was a case of mistaken identity, and that mistake made me late for the speech. Larry: Then, to top it all off, I became a suspect in a murder. THAT'S what you really meant. Larry: But why would I ever put myself through so much humiliation on purpose!? Edgeworth: (This whole testimony is one giant confession of all that he's done tonight. He's practically begging me to show why he bothered to put himself through all of this.) Edgeworth: Larry, don't even think about denying that you have knowledge of this letter. Larry: H-H-H-H-H-Hey! Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Why are you showing that thing to me!? Franziska: \"W\u00e9ndy, I'll be descending on you from above tonight. Your loving knight\" Well, isn't that just romantic? Edgeworth: But you weren't able to \"descend on her from above\", were you... Mr. Loving Knight? Larry: Aaaaaaaaaaaarghn! I-I have no idea what you're talking about! I don't remember a thing! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You can pretend to be ignorant all you'd like, but it's written right here. This letter proves that you were not out to meet the old lady... ...but rather, that you were attempting to pay Ms. Mindy a visit! (What part of this letter shows that the person Larry had intended to meet was Mindy?) Edgeworth: Larry, I suggest you take up penmanship lessons. That is... ...if you never wish to experience this level of embarrassment ever again. Larry: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the heck!? What are you talking about!? Speak English! Edgeworth: You wrote \"Mindy\" so sloppily that it became \"W\u00e9ndy\" to the average eye. Larry: ...Hey, stop picking on me... It's so embarrassiiiiiiiiiing! Lang: There, there. Isn't that what childhood friends are for? They're the best, aren't they? ...For punching. But that will have to wait until we're off of this crime scene. Larry: Eek! Edgey! Save me from the scary man! Edgeworth: Sure, if you're willing to make amends. Starting with your incredibly embarrassing mistake! Larry: .........That... That... That wasn't me! Edgeworth: Come again? Larry: It's a fake! Someone's out to get me, so they made that fake letter... ...to set me uuuuuuuuup! Franziska: Accept your defeat graciously! Larry: But... you guys are being so mean... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Penmanship analysis. Larry: What's that? Edgeworth: No matter who, all people have certain unique features to their handwriting. Ergo, all we have to do is compare the handwriting in this letter to a sample of yours... ...and we'll know soon enough who it was that sent this letter. Larry: I...I...I... I'll never write another thing in my life! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Tsk, tsk, tsk... It's no use, Mr. Loving Knight. For you've already graciously provided me with a sample of your handwriting! Edgeworth: This autograph and our mysterious letter... If we compare the handwriting, we'll know the answer to our questions soon enough. Larry: Gnn...nnn... Nnnnnnnn...! Edgeworth: Confess now, Larry... to your miserable failure! Larry: I...I'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorry! I... I... I did it... It was me causing trouble again... I admit it. You hit the nail right on the head... Edgey... Edgeworth: (So, he finally confesses...) Larry: I saw the Pink Princess being carried around in a stretcher, and got worried, alright!? I wanted to go into Mindy's room, but the doctors wouldn't let me in. So what choice did I have!? It was the chimney or bust, Edgey! Franziska: Your mind jumped from the door to the chimney? What a criminally overactive imagination. Larry: Well, at least I was honest and wrote Mindy a letter, and stuck it under the door. That way, she wouldn't be so shocked when I came down through the chimney! Edgeworth: (Except for the fact that the letter was an utter failure at conveying said sentiment...) Larry: I'm really, really sorry... Edgeworth: Larry, you may be a shameful, good-for-nothing blight on the face of humanity... ...however, I always knew you weren't the killer. I told you to trust me... ...because, at the very least, I can attest to that about you. Larry: Edgey... You're... Aaaack! Franziska: We've lost a lot of valuable time because of you...! Larry: Owwwwwwwww! Franziska: In any case, I believe we can say that we now know exactly what happened. Mr. Larry Butz sought to climb down the chimney... ...not for access to the crime scene... ...but to enter the room of the elderly lady next door. Lang: Lang: Great job, Mr. Prosecutor. Although, I still find it a bit unbelievable that the two of you are friends. Edgeworth: .................. Lang: But the suspicion on that guy over there... ...isn't completely resolved yet, so don't get any funny ideas about running off, OK? Larry: Owwwww...w? H-Hey... What--? Edgey... What does the wolf-man mean when he says I'm not off the hook yet? Edgeworth: .........He means the murder weapon. Larry, did you forget? There are two layers of suspicion hanging over your head. Lang: That's exactly what I mean. We can't only rely on the words of the suspect, after all. We may have figured out where he was and what he was doing all night... ...but the blood-stained Samurai Sword that was left at the crime scene... As long as there is no satisfactory explanation for that... ...this wolf will refuse to ease up on his bite! Larry: Eeeeeek! Edgey! That guy... He looks like he's seriously about to take a bite out of me! Edgeworth: I'm well aware. And you should be as well, that this upcoming battle will be crucial. Lang: Thanks to the cooperation of our lovely bumbler... ...I've been dealt a very nice hand, and a sweet trump card. Looks like we're about to enter the final bout! Now, Mr. Prosecutor! Let's see what you've got! Edgeworth: (I can easily point out the contradiction in the supposed \"murder weapon\"... ...but the real problem for me is figuring out what the real murder weapon is. This will be a high-stakes gamble! But this is one game I can't afford to lose!) Lang: I was the one who found the body of the victim, DeMasque II. Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood. It was supposed to be in the Steel Samurai's dressing room, but I found it here instead. Plus, I found the murder weapon's owner, the suspect, Larry Butz in here, too. Edgeworth: Isn't it a bit far-fetched to accuse someone simply on the basis of ownership? Lang: But this owner wanted to sneak onto the crime scene. I think that's plenty to go on, don't you? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you're alluding to his reason for being by the chimney, we've already established that! Lang: Lang: Hold on there, Mr. Prosecutor. You two are long-time friends, right? Who's to say you didn't fabricate the evidence to give him an alibi? Edgeworth: .........You're accusing me of fabricating evidence? Lang: You think I can believe anything you produce? Forging evidence is all you prosecutors do! Edgeworth: .........! (This man has some serious issues with prosecutors...) Larry: But come on, I can't think up something as complicated as that! Right, Edgey!? Edgeworth: Larry, I can agree because I know you and your personality well. However, Agent Lang knows nothing about you... or me, for that matter. (I sense his hatred for my entire profession emanating from his entire being. Meaning that the only way I can prove Larry's innocence is to present irrefutable evidence.) Lang: I was the one who found the body of the victim, DeMasque II. Lang: Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood. Lang: Beside him was the Samurai Sword... covered in the victim's blood. Lang: I suspect he beat the victim to death with that thing. Lang: It was supposed to be in the Steel Samurai's dressing room, but I found it here instead. Lang: Plus, I found the murder weapon's owner, the suspect, Larry Butz in here, too. Edgeworth: (It's simply not possible that the Samurai Sword is the real murder weapon. So I should focus on proving that point to Agent Lang first.) Edgeworth: Do you know what this is, Agent Lang? Lang: Heh, it's a long spear, right? We used to use those a lot in my country a long time ago. Piercing, mowing people down... Spears are the weapon of heroes throughout history. Franziska: It's the next most effective weapon after the whip. Edgeworth: (I think the whip is in a slightly different category...) Lang: So, what's your point? Are you going to tell me that the spear is the real weapon? Edgeworth: No. I simply want you to take a look at this section here. Lang: The way it's bent...? Edgeworth: Precisely. Apparently, a certain troublemaker hit it against a wall in this embassy earlier. And as you can clearly see, the insides of the Steel Samurai's weapons are hollow. In other words, they're replicas that aren't strong enough to deliver a damaging blow... ...let alone the multiple strikes necessary to bludgeon someone to death. And yet, there is not even a dent in the Samurai Sword. How do you explain that!? Lang: A...Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Larry: Oh, yeah... The sword and the spear are made of the same stuff, so they bend easily! But I wish they'd make them out of better stuff! Because the spear got bent... ...I wasn't able to do my special \"Early Summer Rain Jab!\" move! Man, I got such an earful from the director of the play for not doing it in the show! Edgeworth: (The Steel Samurai's special move was changed tonight because of him...!?) Samurai Spear data updated in my Organizer. Larry: Yeoooooooooowch! Franziska: That's more than enough of your whiny whimpering! Now... back on the topic of the spear. Edgeworth: Yes, let's return to the real topic of discussion. (This is where the real gamble begins. I don't have a real strategy, per se... ...so all I can do for now is let the chips fall where they may.) Franziska: Using guesswork and taking risks in place of real logic is hardly the Von Karma way. It's neither smart nor very clever. Edgeworth: Ms. von Karma, as you know, unlike your father, I am not a genius prosecutor. Plus, I doubt his record of a 40-year win streak will ever be broken. Franziska: .................. Edgeworth: But perhaps, it is for the best if it remains unbroken. For no one should've conceived of the notion to \"convict all defendants\" in the first place! Franziska: Franziska: What a foolishly foolish statement from a foolish fool who hates to lose... It's the job of a prosecutor to make sure that all defendants are found guilty in court. There is nothing more important in this world than a perfect victory! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That may be your opinion, however, I don't believe that's all we are. Lang: .........! Edgeworth: As a prosecutor, what I pursue is not the perfect victory, but the perfect truth. And if that means that the bridge I must cross will crumble beneath my feet... ...then let it crumble as I walk on towards the truth! Lang: Lang: You're good at keeping me entertained, Mr. Prosecutor! But you know... humans are delicate creatures. The slightest bump and we expire. I'd like you to consider, if you will, the possibility that... ...the sword was used in such a way that the attack killed DeMasque II without bending it. Edgeworth: .................. Lang: So, what do you think of my hypothetical scenario? I think you know what to do here, right? And what you need! Edgeworth: Of course. (What I need is evidence even he (changed from [Agent Lang] in the original release) can't refute! This is it! It's time to bring this to a close!) Lang: It's possible to use the Samurai Sword to kill someone. And under these circumstances, it's the only logical conclusion. We searched the Embassy, top to bottom, but the victim's blood is only on that weapon. So isn't it only natural that suspicion would fall onto the owner of said weapon? Edgeworth: How long do you intend to cling onto that preposterous theory? Lang: As long as I want, because we examined every corner within the walls of this Embassy. There's no stone we've left unturned! And we have managed to come up with only one logical conclusion! That the only place inside this embassy with the victim's blood on it is this sword. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You left no stone unturned? Is that a fact? Lang: Lang: If you've got something to say, then say it in the only way I respect, Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: Yes, of course. In that case, allow me to make it all crystal clear for you! Lang: It's possible to use the Samurai Sword to kill someone. Lang: And under these circumstances, it's the only logical conclusion. Lang: We searched the Embassy, top to bottom, but the victim's blood is only on that weapon. Lang: So isn't it only natural that suspicion would fall onto the owner of said weapon? Edgeworth: ...I can prove to you... the possibility that the murder weapon is something else... ...but I cannot do so on my strength alone. Franziska: Franziska: Miles Edgeworth. What are you running straight into a quagmire for? I thought you said that you were busy in pursuit of the perfect truth. And if that's the case, then show me this perfect truth, if it exists at all! Edgeworth: Don't worry. Thanks to you, I've already prepared myself to do just that. Franziska: There's no need to thank me. I'm simply doing what any good superior would. Edgeworth: Heh... I suppose you are. Very well, then. I will show you the possibility of a different murder weapon. Edgeworth: If you believe that there is no other door of possibility left to open... ...then allow me to force one open for you! Lang: Lang: Hmph! And how do you plan to do that? Edgeworth: By showing you what may possibly be the real murder weapon. Lang: Lang: Ha! Ha ha ha ha! The \"real\" murder weapon? I hate to repeat myself... ...but my men have already searched every last inch of this embassy! And they've concluded that nothing else could've been used as the weapon! Knowing these facts, do you still want to press forward with your little hypothesis? Edgeworth: Of course. Because it's not possible that your men inspected everything in their investigation. Lang: Lang: What are you talking about!? I don't appreciate mind games, and I don't appreciate it when people like you slander my men! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not slandering them, I assure you! I'm merely pointing out that their investigative dragnet has a few holes in it! Namely, that there is something your men couldn't even lay a finger on. And that item is the real murder weapon! Lang: Aaaaaaaalright then! I'll play along for now! This \"real\" weapon that killed DeMasque II... What exactly is it!? Edgeworth: The real murder weapon, which not a single person has yet to touch, is this! Edgeworth: .........The national treasure of Allebahst. Lang: Lang: You mean the Primidux Statue? Edgeworth: Yes, and as you know, only the ambassador and his secretariat may touch it. Which, I believe, means that neither you nor your men were able to examine it, correct? Lang: Lang: Ha... ha ha ha ha... You know very well that if we did that, there'd be an international incident... ...between the Kingdom of Allebahst and the Republic of Babahl. The two countries' precarious relationship teeters in the balance... ...over a stupid fight related to a sovereignty statue! But I'll be damned if I let something go unexamined! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang, if you could take a look at this... The direction the statue is facing just before and after the crime are different...! And there is only one conclusion I can draw from that. Lang: .................. Go look for Ambassador Alba, and get him to give us the OK to examine the statue. MIB: Shifu! You can't listen to this infidel's words! He is most definitely trying to trick you! Shifu! Please, let's be rational about this! Lang: Grr! Lang Zi says: .........Just go already! MIB: Y-Yes, sir! MIB: Shifu... Lang: Yeah? MIB: I'm really sorry, sir, but I was unable to convince the ambassador. I was unable to obtain permission for us to examine the Primidux Statue. Lang: ...Hmph. I see. Franziska: Wait...! But then, the investigation is at a standstill! Agent Lang! I will go and speak with the ambassador personally! Lang: Save your breath. He may act all weak and frail, but that old man's one tough cookie. But I guess you've gotta be tough when you're representing a whole country, you know? Edgeworth: Agent Lang... Lang: What do you want? Let's just hurry up and examine the statue already. MIB: Wh--!? But Shifu! What about causing an international incident!? Lang: Quiet! I'll take the fall if I have to later! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang, the hypothesis is mine, so if someone is to take the responsibility, let it be me! Lang: Responsibility? If we're going to talk in such heavy terms, maybe I should let you. It'd be a real problem for my men if something were to happen to me. Alright then... Less talk and more investigating! Edgeworth: (If we want to know the truth, we can't stop here! Action must be taken!) Agent Lang, I'd like to run a Luminol chemiluminescence test on the statue. Lang: A Luminol test...? Ah, good thinking. If the statue is the murder weapon, then some of the victim's blood should be on it. Okaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! Let's get the forensics team in here! Lang: Heh! Looks like you hit the jackpot, Mr. Prosecutor. I guess this means that this is the real weapon that killed DeMasque II. Edgeworth: Indeed...! Lang: But I wouldn't celebrate yet if I were you. This doesn't let your friend off the hook. It doesn't prove that he didn't kill DeMasque II, so the charge remains! Edgeworth: ...We are hardly done examining this statue, Agent Lang! Knowing that it IS the real weapon, I believe further examination is required. Lang: Hah, you think so? OK then, knock yourself out! Leads to examination of Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: ...Nngh. Lang: And what do we have here? This dirty smudge... It looks like... a handprint? Heh heh heh heh... Haaa hahahahahahaha! What's a definitive bit of evidence like you doing under here!? Looks like we've got some fingerprints to analyze! Edgeworth: Gnrk! (Worst case scenario, these prints belong to Larry... But it looks like it's too late for me to do anything about that now...!) Lang: Hey! Forensics guy! I want results on these fingerprints ASAP, you hear me!? Forensics: Agent Lang! I have the analysis results, sir! Lang: Good! And!? Forensics: Sir! About the prints we lifted from the bottom of the statue... Well, um... You know the victim of the murder in the Babahlese Embassy...? The prints belong to him, to Mr. Manny Coachen, sir! Lang: But that's--! Wh-What's going on around here!? Edgeworth: No... That's... impossible! (Each Primidux Statue can only be handled by someone of that country. But by the very fact that Mr. Coachen's fingerprints are on this one... ...it leads me to only one conclusion...!) This statue... is actually Babahl's Primidux Statue! Franziska: Impossible! It can't be...! Lang: A...! Aaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiya! Edgeworth: (Larry never once set foot on Babahlese soil, so he was free to go... However... this new piece of information only served to confuse us even further. The ringleader of a smuggling operation was killed with an Allebahstian knife in Babahl... ...and DeMasque II was killed on Allebahstian soil with Babahl's national treasure... ...and the mystery of the Great Thief Yatagarasu, who visited both countries. The pieces were there, but I had yet to see the big picture they were to form.) To be continued Edgeworth: (I've left the DeMasque II investigation to Franziska and returned to Babahl. I suppose my first order of business should be to look into Babahl's statue...) Kay: Mr. Edgewoooorth! Edgeworth: So, Kay, what's the situation? Kay: Oh, it's great! Investigating is so much fun! Edgeworth: (...In other words, they've made absolutely no progress.) Gumshoe: W-We weren't goofing off! Honest, sir! We've been investigating our hearts out! Edgeworth: Very well, then. Would you care to give me an update on your investigation? Gumshoe: ...Ummmmm... Oh! We've had a really fun time, sir! Edgeworth: (I knew it. Zero progress...) In any case, Detective Gumshoe... Gumshoe: Yes, sir? Edgeworth: You have permission to enter the Allebahstian Embassy, is that correct? Gumshoe: Yup! As a local detective, I'm helping out with investigations on both sides, sir! Edgeworth: Good. In that case, I can leave these... pieces of evidence with you. They belong to the lady under the Pink Princess's mask. Gumshoe: The Pink Princess? What kind of lady was playing her, sir? Edgeworth: The kind that was also playing the role of the Pink Badger yesterday. Gumshoe: Ugh! Ooonnngh... Understood, sir... If I happen to run into her, I'll give them back to her. And if I don't... then I guess I'll unload them somewhere... Edgeworth: (He doesn't seem all that enthused to go find her, but I can't blame him.) Evidence that has lost their value given to Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: Now then, I don't believe I'll be needing this anymore either. Kay: Whaaaat!? Are you really going to throw that autograph away!? Edgeworth: Yes, because that Steel Samurai was a fake. Steel Samurai's Autograph scrunched up into a ball and disposed of. Kay: Wait, what? What do you mean by \"fake\"? Edgeworth: (Now then, I believe it's time for a little housekeeping.) Unnecessary evidence has been removed. Remaining evidence has been re-arranged. After clearing Talk option with Dick Gumshoe and presenting Babahl's Primidux Statue or Allebahst's Primidux Statue to Colias Palaeno: Kay: Hey, where are you going? Are you heading back to Allebahst? Edgeworth: Yes, but before I do, I suppose I should give you a summary of what's happened. Kay: ...Oh, I see. So there's been a murder in both countries using an object from the other country...? Edgeworth: That's the gist of it. Babahl is just as strict as Allebahst... ...in their inspection of the people and things that enter their country. Meaning that somehow, both murder weapons were smuggled into the two countries. That's the only logical conclusion that can be drawn. Perhaps the key to the weapon smuggling is the person who traversed both countries... Kay: You mean the fake Yatagarasu!? Edgeworth: In one way or another, the Yatagarasu is connected... Of this I am sure! Now then, where was the Yatagarasu first spotted? Palaeno: I believe it was the rose garden on the Allebahstian side of the embassy. The garden is just on the other side of this boundary. It's where Ambassador Alba was to give a speech tonight. At least, that's where I heard the Yatagarasu had appeared. Edgeworth: In that case, I believe it's vital that I investigate the rose garden posthaste. Kay: Wait, before you go... Take a look at this, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What... is it? Kay: My guess is that it's a guitar pick. I picked it up just now over there. Do you think it'll be of any use? Edgeworth: (There is a little water on it... but how did the water get on it? It doesn't look like there's anything it could get wet from around here...) Kay: I was thinking, they have concerts here at this open-air stage from time to time, right? Edgeworth: Alright, I'll find its owner later... Pick data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Oh, yeah! There's one more thing... Mr. Edgeworth, would you be willing to hold onto this? Edgeworth: What is this? Kay: It's Ms. Yew's perfume. It's the bottle that woman left behind and that I found seven years ago. I thought that one day, it'd be of some use in tracking her down... ...so I kept it safe all this time. Edgeworth: Thank you. I'd be honored to hold onto it for you. Ms. Yew's Perfume data jotted down in my Organizer. Theatrum Neutralis Open-air stage (before approaching door on left side in Theatrum Neutralis) ???: I see you're back, Miles Edgeworth. How are things in Babahl? Although, I can't really say I expect much from Scruffy and that girl. Edgeworth: The investigation into Manny Coachen's death hasn't really progressed any... ...however, the investigation into the Yatagarasu has. Franziska: Ah, yes, the Yatagarasu. Even now, I find it hard to believe. A person who can freely traverse between the two countries at will? Preposterous. Edgeworth: Well, that's what I came here to investigate. I heard that this is where witnesses claim to have seen the Yatagarasu. Franziska: That's correct. Ambassador Alba was to give a speech tonight here in Allebahst. And that's when the Yatagarasu appeared. The shadow of the mysterious thief appeared, and just as suddenly, it vanished... After that, there was the fire at the Babahlese Embassy that the Yatagarasu started. Edgeworth: (I vow that not a single feather from the Yatagarasu shall escape my diligence!) After clearing Talk option with Shi-Long Lang and examining statue of man, pool, and statue of woman: Edgeworth: The suddenly appearing and disappearing shadow of the Yatagarasu... I believe I've figured out its true origin. Franziska: I expected no less from my subordinate. Now, let's hear what you know on the subject. What really cast the shadow of the Yatagarasu? Edgeworth: The suddenly appearing and disappearing shadow of the Yatagarasu... Is it not possible that it was created by this statue? Franziska: Franziska: Are you playing me for a fool, Miles Edgeworth!? This statue bears absolutely no resemblance to the shadow of the Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: You are correct, however, this statue is but one part of the whole picture. Franziska: What do you mean by \"only one part\"...? Edgeworth: What is the other part to the real form of the Yatagarasu's shadow? Franziska: It's... another statue? Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu's shadow was made from the shadows of these two statues. Franziska: Made? What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: Right now, the spotlights are all over the place. This is because they were moved when the guests were in a panicked state. However, if we were to restore the lights to where they were when the thief appeared... Franziska: You believe that the two shadows will create the Yatagarasu's shadow? Edgeworth: Precisely. Now then, watch as I reveal the true form of the Yatagarasu! First, if we set up a spotlight to cast a shadow of \"King Primidux and the Battlefield\"... ...the shadow of the king's statue would appear on the backdrop of the stage. Likewise, if we set a light up on \"The Queen Who Spoke of Love To King Primidux\"... ...her silhouette would also appear on the backdrop to the stage. Franziska: Aha! So if we were to combine the two shadows...! Franziska: ............ It looks nothing like the Yatagarasu's shadow! Miles Edgeworth! How do you explain this grotesque shape!? Edgeworth: C-Calm down, Franziska! The way the light needs to be shone on the queen's statue is wrong... Franziska: What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: I believe that the whole of the king's shadow needs to be used for this to work. However, in the case of the queen, I don't believe her whole shadow is needed. Rather, the person who created the shadow only used one part of her shadow. Franziska: Only one part? Edgeworth: Yes, and that one part alone is enough to fill in the rest of the Yatagarasu's shadow. Franziska: Why didn't you say that in the first place!? Edgeworth: You're right. I-I apologize... Franziska: Now, what part of the queen's statue was used to complete the Yatagarasu's shadow? Edgeworth: Think back to what is missing in our shadow. Five long, thin areas, correct? Now, what does that remind you of? Franziska: Ah! Edgeworth: That's right. It can only be the shadow of the queen's left hand. Franziska, can we please adjust the spotlight's position... ...so that it only shines on the queen's left hand? Franziska: Alright. Let's give it a try and see what we get. Franziska: It's...! Lang: Hmph... Yeah, this is exactly like the shadow I saw. Edgeworth: The culprit must've changed the spotlights' positioning beforehand... ...and then pulled the plug after people saw what the culprit wanted them to see. In their panic, the guests must have moved the spotlights around... ...which we can assume was also a part of the culprit's plan. By the time the lights came back on, the Yatagarasu's shadow had vanished. Franziska: Which means that the shadow was a construct from the very beginning. Edgeworth: So you see, the Yatagarasu never did visit Allebahst tonight. The only country that thief visited was Babahl, although it can be assumed... ...that the Yatagarasu had an accomplice in Allebahst. Franziska: An accomplice? But who...? Edgeworth: I haven't figured that out yet, but I assume it was the person who set up the shadow show. (I sense that the biggest clue yet to solving this case is the existence of this accomplice!) ???: .........How's the investigation going? Edgeworth: Detective Badd, have you come to join us in investigating the Yatagarasu? Badd: I've left the murder... in Agent Lang's charge... And my only target... from the very beginning is the Yatagarasu... so yes... Edgeworth: So... what have you found out? Badd: ...I got a piece of evidence. Edgeworth: May I see it...? Badd: ...Sure, but you might regret it... Franziska: We're here because we are ready to face whatever may come. ...So if you please. Badd: ...When people heard the commotion, bystanders... started gathering. And one woman... claimed, \"I'm tellin' ya I'm a genuine international journalist!\"... She gave me... an interesting picture. Edgeworth: A journalist...? Badd: Well, actually... she's a freelance... cameraman. This... is the photo I got from her. Edgeworth: Wh-What in the world!? Franziska: The Yatagarasu... is flying through the air...! Badd: ...The times, they are a-changing... It's... not just man... ...but evidence... even they lie to us now... Edgeworth: Wh-When was this photo taken? Badd: ...Apparently, right after the fires... on the fourth and fifth floors were put out... It was taken... from a near-by building... that you can see the embassy from. Edgeworth: I see. So this was taken after the fire... Photo of Yatagarasu data jotted down in my Organizer. Badd: The blur in this picture... took off from the Babahlese Embassy... ...flew over the boundary... and headed for the Embassy of Allebahst... Franziska: Franziska: This is simply not possible! People are incapable of flight! Edgeworth: Is that a fact? I've had the \"pleasure\" of dealing with a case involving a \"flying person\" once. Franziska: .............................. Actually, come to think of it, I've come across a case like that as well. Two, actually. Badd: ...Maybe it happens more often than we think... Edgeworth: (Am I up to the task of solving the mystery behind this photograph? Well, the Yatagarasu took off from the Babahlese Embassy, so I should start from there.) Franziska, I need to return to the Babahl investigation for a bit. Franziska: ...Alright. Theatrum Neutralis Kay: Welcome back, Mr. Edgeworth! Now come on! Let's get back to our investigation! Edgeworth: Yes, let's. Rose Garden Franziska: I see you're back. Well, let's continue with the investigation, shall we? Edgeworth: Yes, let's. Kay: To think, after all that running around, we're right back where we started. Edgeworth: It would appear that way... Palaeno: Hi, Mr. Edgeworth. Have you found Manny's killer yet? Edgeworth: I'm terribly sorry, Ambassador Palaeno, but I have yet to find his killer. Palaeno: Then I guess his murder... really was the work of the Yatagarasu... Kay: Let's get one thing straight. It was the work of the FAKE Yatagarasu. The real Yatagarasu is a noble vigilante who is only out to steal the truth... Palaeno: Ms. Faraday... Please don't make such a sad face. If there's anything I can do for you, all you have to do is ask, alright? Kay: Mr. Palaeno... Edgeworth: Actually, there is one thing you can do. Will you allow us to take another look around? We didn't have enough time to conduct a thorough investigation earlier. Palaeno: Oh, sure! Please feel free to investigate to your heart's content. Edgeworth: Also, there are a few questions I'd like to ask you personally, Ambassador. Palaeno: If it will bring a smile back to Ms. Faraday's face, then I'll gladly answer anything. Kay: Thank you, Mr. Palaeno! You're a total gentleman! Palaeno: Ha ha ha. You don't have to waste such nice words on me, little miss! Kay: Hey, Sir Palaeno! Edgeworth: (...Those two sure got chummy awfully quickly.) Kay: You know, it's easy to say we're going to investigate, but where should we begin? Edgeworth: We should probably start by comparing the state of this room before and after the fire. And then, we should look into the matter of the suspicious person you spotted. Kay: Yeah. When I came into this room, that person was already gone. But I'm willing to bet that the person I was chasing is Mr. Coachen's killer. Edgeworth: We don't know that yet; however, it's hard to believe that person is unrelated. Furthermore, because the key the Yatagarasu stole seven years ago was found here... ...it signals that perhaps Ms. Yew is also somehow involved. Kay: I knew it! That woman is almost definitely Mr. Coachen's killer! Edgeworth: Yet again, we don't know that! (There are too many mysteries to be solved here (changed from [in this case] in the original release).) Speaking of the Yatagarasu and mysteries... ...I received a most mysterious photo from Detective Badd. Kay: Uncle Badd!? He's taking part in the investigation, too!? Edgeworth: Yes. He has been chasing after the Yatagarasu for all these years. Kay: Uncle Badd......... Edgeworth: Now then, I was told that this photo was taken just after the fire... Kay: Wh-What--!? This kinda looks like the person in the long coat I was chasing...! Does this mean... that I was chasing the fake Yatagarasu after all? Edgeworth: I don't know the answer to your question, but I don't think people can fly either... Kay: But this could be how that person escaped! Edgeworth: Well, we'll need to investigate a bit more before we can say anything about that. In any case, let's not dawdle any more and pick up our investigation where we left off. After clearing all Talk options with Colias Palaeno: Gumshoe: Oh! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe, have you collected the information that I requested? Gumshoe: Yup! Got it all right here, sir! Here you go, Kay. Feel free to take a look! It's for you, after all. Kay: What is all this, Gummy...? Gumshoe: It's all the information on this room that I got from the Embassy and Interpol people. Now we know exactly how this room was before and after the fire! Edgeworth: Good work, Detective. Gumshoe: Aww, it was nothing, sir! I'm an expert at getting people to talk! Kay: Wow... You two remind me so much of my father and Uncle Badd... Edgeworth: What do you mean? Kay: As prosecutor and detective, your dynamic is just like theirs back in the day. Edgeworth: ......... Kay: Well, don't you worry! I'm going to find my own wonderful partner someday! And when I do, I'm going to become a good Yatagarasu, just like my father, right? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Please don't ask me questions to which I have no answers to, Kay. However, I can say that is truly a wonderful thing to find a partner you can trust. Kay: Heh heh, you bet! So, what now, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Well... I'd like to ask you for a favor. Kay: Yes? Edgeworth: That gadget... Mr. Thief, is it? That thing you call your secret weapon. Kay: Oh, you mean \"Little Thief\"! Heh, you're coming to rely on it, aren't you? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I-I don't need a crutch like that! I'm only asking because I need it for the investigation! From the information Detective Gumshoe gathered, and the ambassador's testimony... ...I'd like you to please re-create this room as it was during the third floor fire. Kay: You got it! Alright, here we go! Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! Now, witness the true power of a real, modern-day Robin Hood! Edgeworth: It seems there are other things besides what the ambassador mentioned that have changed. It's possible that we might find the escape route the person Kay saw used as well. Palaeno: Oooh! Wh-What is this? Is it some sort of light show I was not told about? Kay: This is the power of a true vigilante! It's re-creating the room with the info I inputted! Palaeno: Really!? That is certainly one interesting device you have there, Ms. Faraday! Edgeworth: Ahem. I believe it's about time we returned to our investigation. After examining flames: Edgeworth: These must have been the large green flames Ambassador Palaeno saw. Kay: With flames like these, it's no wonder he couldn't get in! Edgeworth: Kay, by the time you came into this room, had the fire already been put out? Kay: Yeah, the fire had died out or something by that time. Edgeworth: Then this fire in here only burned from the time the fire started on the third floor... ...until the Yatagarasu appeared and caused a stir in Babahl, I suppose. Kay: I guess Mr. Palaeno was just lucky enough to run into this fire as it was burning, huh? Edgeworth: Yes, you could put it that way. And since you were the first to discover the body... ...we can assume that no one else entered the room until that time. No one other than the person you were chasing, of course. Kay: I knew it! That person I saw was definitely up to no good! I mean, that person could even be Mr. Coachen's killer! Edgeworth: That is very likely to be the case. After all, that person came into this room before you... ...and must have chosen this room precisely because they knew no one would be in here. Kay: OK, then maybe the green fire was where it was to prevent anyone from coming in? But then, what did the person set on fire to make the green flames? Edgeworth: Hmm... Well, whatever it is that person burned, it made a rather sizable fire. Kay: And since the fire's green... well, we've seen something that burns green, right!? It's a bit tinier than these flames, but you get what I mean. Edgeworth: Yes, and I do believe that what you are thinking is exactly why these flames are green. Which fire-related piece of evidence burns the same color as these green flames? Edgeworth: This silhouette lantern... Its green flame comes from the whitcrystal oil it's burning. Kay: Yeah! That's the fire I was thinking of, too! I love the green it gives off. Edgeworth: I think we've now established that the green flames were caused by whitcrystal oil. Furthermore, we know that there is only one other thing made from whitcrystal oil. Kay: Oh! You mean that thing Mr. Palaeno was mistaken about, right!? Edgeworth: Yes, precisely... as we found out earlier in our investigation. Gumshoe: Um, what? I don't get it. Can you fill me in, sir!? Edgeworth: Fine, I suppose. I'll explain it in a way that even you can understand. This is the thing made from whitcrystal oil that Ambassador Palaeno was mistaken about! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink is made from whitcrystal oil. Gumshoe: Ohhhh! So, it should burn the same color as the flames in the lantern, right!? Edgeworth: Yes, precisely. However, the green flames in this room were not from a bottle of Babahlese ink. Kay: Because we found the ink Mr. Coachen used on his desk, right!? Edgeworth: Yes. However... we know that Mr. Coachen was smuggling the ink in massive quantities. Now, what do you suppose he made using all that ink? I believe what he made with that ink is the answer to what gave birth to the green flames. Kay: Oh, yeah! I'm beginning to really feel the energy coming from you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Heh... It would appear that I've finally found it, the smuggling ring's real goal!) Made of Babahlese ink, this is the source of the green flames! Edgeworth: What would consume that great of a volume of ink to make...? That would be... ...the counterfeit bills that the smuggling ring made and are circulating in Zheng Fa. Kay: You're kidding!? You're saying that it was Mr. Coachen who made the counterfeit bills...? Edgeworth: I am. I believe you could even go so far as to say that he \"stole\" Babahl's printing press. Ambassador, Mr. Coachen had permission to freely use the printing press, correct? Palaeno: Why, yes. And I do remember seeing him use it in the middle of the night... ...but never did I think he was using it for such a foul deed...! Edgeworth: Ambassador! Because of your secretary's crimes, you will need to be investigated as well! Palaeno: Ah, yes, I suppose so. We've caused a bit of trouble for a few countries, haven't we? Edgeworth: It's my duty to search out all who shielded Mr. Coachen and concealed his crime. For they are the ones who started the fire in order to destroy the evidence! Counterfeit Bills data updated in my Organizer. After clearing \"What you saw\" Talk option with Dick Gumshoe and examining grandfather clock: Edgeworth: (We've examined everything in this office, but there is one thing that bothers me. Perhaps I should ask Ambassador Palaeno about it.) Ambassador Palaeno, there is something I'd like to ask you about. Palaeno: Yes? Edgeworth: About this office, it appears, to me, to be very similar to Ambassador Alba's office. For example, the location of the fireplace and the position of the grandfather clock. Palaeno: Ah, that's right. You've also paid a visit to the Allebahstian side of the embassy. Our two embassies actually used to be one. Edgeworth: (Yes, I know. Even the pamphlet mentioned that.) Palaeno: Which is why the building is bilaterally symmetrical (Bilateral symmetry - Because this used to be one embassy, offices on the two sides are symmetrical.). So no matter which room, the location of the fireplace and the like are exactly the same. Even where the art is located is the same. As my room is currently under renovation... ...we worked hard to make Manny's room look like the ambassador's office. Kay: You mean for your hand shake photo op with the Jammin' Ninja? Palaeno: Yes, that's right. I mean, what's a photo like that worth if it's not taken in the ambassador's office right? Edgeworth: (Yet another odd expression of Babahl's obsessively competitive spirit with Allebahst, I take it?) Thank you, Ambassador. That piece of information is all I needed to connect the dots. Palaeno: ? ...Connect what dots? Well, anyway, I'm glad I was able to be of some help. Edgeworth: The Allebahstian and Babahlese sides of the building are symmetrical to each other. As we know that to be a fact, then this room's fireplace may also hide a secret passageway. Kay: A secret passageway? Edgeworth: In Allebahst, the fireplace turned out to have a revolving back wall. Kay: A revolving wall!? It sounds like something out of a ninja house! Gumshoe: Wow, there was a trick like that built into the fireplace, sir!? Palaeno: What!? Th-This embassy holds THAT kind of secret!? Edgeworth: There seems to be a lot about this room that you don't know about, Ambassador... Palaeno: I guess it's time to pay the bill for letting Manny do so much work for me. Please, I really want to know about the real Manny and what you know about this room. Kay: What are you waiting for, Mr. Edgeworth!? Let's get to the bottom of this! Edgeworth: Agreed. And my first thought is that it's likely the killer used the revolving fireplace (Revolving fireplace used? - It's possible someone used the revolving fireplace wall. I need to examine it more.). Kay: It looks like just another fireplace, though, doesn't it? So, how do you turn it again? Edgeworth: In Allebahst, I had to push where the X was on the far wall of the fireplace. Gumshoe: Oh! I see an X back there, sir! Let's see what happens when I push it... Edgeworth: Gumshoe: Aaaaah! You scared me, sir! Edgeworth: There is something about this fireplace that lies in contradiction to the facts. Kay: Huh? But we found an X where you thought there'd be one, right? Edgeworth: We did, but that's not what I was referring to. Something is missing from this scene. (What does this contradiction mean for us...?) Leads to examination of fireplace Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, you said that you burned some old files in this fireplace today, correct? Palaeno: Yes, I burned quite a few files this morning, actually. Edgeworth: And after you did, you forgot to clean out the ashes from the fireplace, correct? Palaeno: Th-That's right. But why are you asking? And why are you making such a scary face...? Edgeworth: I'm sorry, I admit I am a bit intimidating when I'm serious. ...In any case! Take a good look at this fireplace, and tell me what you find odd about it. Palaeno: Let's see... Huh? Where did all the ashes go...? (Missing ashes - The ashes that should still be in the fireplace are missing. Where did they go...?) Kay: What is the meaning of this, Mr. Edgeworth!? Gumshoe: You don't really think... that Ambassador Palaeno is lying, do you? Edgeworth: No, there is no reason for him to lie. And I don't believe his testimony is wrong, either. It is the fireplace that is causing the contradiction. Kay, I wonder if you might update the fireplace data for me. Kay: You got it! I'll add in the ashes from the burnt files and... Kay: Sounds like we've pretty much figured everything out now, huh!? Edgeworth: Hmph... Well, it was nothing. All I did was follow where our leads led us. Kay: Oh, I sense it coming on! You're about to dazzle us again, right!? Gumshoe: Oh, you mean that!? Well, it's what Mr. Edgeworth is known for, you know! Edgeworth: ...There is really no need for you two to dance around the name of what I'm about to do. Edgeworth: The reason as to why the ashes are missing is simple. Kay: It's not because someone cleaned them up, right? Edgeworth: No, because even if someone did sweep them up, the fireplace is too clean for that. Ambassador Palaeno said that he spilled some Babahlese ink while he was burning the files. And yet, there is not a trace of the spilled ink on the back wall anywhere! Kay: Well then, I don't know what happened. Edgeworth: Well, I'll tell you what happened. The two sides were switched. By using the revolving fireplace wall, the ashes were moved into the neighboring room. Which means that this is a clear indication that the fireplace was used! Revolving Fireplace Wall data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Then, you mean... the person I was chasing... ...disappeared from this room through there...? Edgeworth: Yes, I believe the person you were in pursuit of is Mr. Coachen's killer. And after committing the murder, escaped through the fireplace (Escaped through revolving fireplace - The person Kay was chasing used the fireplace to escape into the room next door.)! Kay: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth! You figured out the killer's escape route! Edgeworth: (I have, but this is only the beginning. Now we have to chase the killer down!) Edgeworth: If the killer used the fireplace in this room to escape into the next... ...then it's only logical for us to \"talk\" with the person who was in the neighboring room. Gumshoe: Well, the person that was in the next room was... Oh! It was that person, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, Detective... Agent Shih-na. Kay: It's looking more and more like Ms. Shih-na is the killer, isn't it? Edgeworth: Let's not jump to conclusions yet. We need to go through what we know so far. She came running straight into this room from the next one, and instantly accused you. Furthermore, she claimed that it could only have been you that killed Mr. Coachen. I don't have any proof yet, however, I KNOW she is hiding something from us! Kay: OK, then! Why don't we go ask Ms. Shih-na herself!? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: No, not yet. There's something that needs to be done first. ...Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Sir! Is it my turn to do something, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Yes. I have a two-part special assignment for you. First, I need you to run a handwriting analysis on DeMasque II's note. Gumshoe: OK! I'll get the lab boys on that right away! Edgeworth: Second, I want you to see if you can fit through the revolving fireplace wall. Gumshoe: R-Right now, sir!? Edgeworth: No, next decade... Of course now! We need to test our hypothesis first, don't we? Kay: Go on, Gummy! You can do it! Gumshoe: Alright. I'm gonna do this like a real man! Here I go, through the fireplace and back! Edgeworth: (You shouldn't need to psych yourself up that much for such a simple task, Detective...) Gumshoe: Wow! The wall inside the fireplace really DID turn! Kay: That's so neat! Now, I wanna try going through there, too! Palaeno: Th-There really IS a secret passageway through there... I had no idea...! Edgeworth: Hmm... It would appear that the ash really was pushed into the other room. Furthermore, the Babahlese ink you spilled, Ambassador, is there on the back wall. Gumshoe: OK, here I go, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective, I'd like you to go through there under the same conditions as the killer. Gumshoe: Huh? But there's all that ash and stuff... Edgeworth: And your point is? Now, we're short on time, so if you could please hurry on through. Gumshoe: Nngh... Y-Yes, sir... Kay: OK! So NOW we pretty much have the whole picture, right!? Edgeworth: No, not yet. There remains a few more mysteries to solve... ...such as the Yatagarasu's whereabouts, the other smuggling ring members... ...the two weapons that made it across the border, the key Ms. Yew stole 7 years ago... In fact, we haven't figured out a thing regarding how Ms. Yew is related to these embassies! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: A number of pieces connect in a very complicated way in this case... It's almost enough to make one completely mentally exhausted. Kay: What are you saying, Mr. Edgeworth!? I thought you were the one who said that it's easy if you follow the leads? Edgeworth: Hmph... Was that supposed to be an impression of me, Kay? Kay: If it's info gathering you need, Gummy and I can help with that! Then, all you'd have to do is show off your fancy-schmancy logical deductions! Edgeworth: \"Show off\"...? (Does it seem like I'm being boastful when I do that...?) Kay: Let's not over-complicate matters, OK, Mr. Edgeworth!? We've been so focused, like a laser, on only what seems strange and out of place... ...it's no wonder nothing's clicked and we haven't unlocked anything yet. But, if we think things through calmly, the answer should come to us! Edgeworth: Kay... Kay: That's the sort of thing I say to myself... ...when I'm practicing how to unlock padlocks, you know! Edgeworth: ...That is something that I hope practice doesn't make perfect, for your sake. Kay: Ha ha ha! Yay! Looks like you're back to your straight-laced self again! Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm back, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, I can see that. Good work, Detective. Gumshoe: *cough* *cough* *cough* L-Looks like you can use that fireplace like a door, sir! Kay: Are you alright, Gummy...? Gumshoe: I-I'm OK! It's just a bit of ash and dust, that's all! Edgeworth: Your jacket has gotten quite filthy. I see the hem has practically turned black. Gumshoe: Yeah, well, quite a bit of the unburned ink got on it, sir. Edgeworth: Hmm... I see. Thank you, Detective. You did a fine job. I'll even pay the cleaning bill for the trench coat. Gumshoe: What!? Oh, no, sir! I could never! This is just my old coat, sir! If it was [sic] a coat I actually cared about, then I'd get it cleaned, but, you know... Edgeworth: ...? I see. Very well, then. As you wish. Kay: So because Gummy was able to climb through the fireplace, we know it can be used, right? Edgeworth: Yes, but that's not all we learned. We actually learned one other important fact. Kay: And that is...? Edgeworth: I will have to explain it to you later. Right now, we need to deal with the handwriting analysis. Detective Gumshoe... Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I'll be back before you know it! Edgeworth: The handwriting analysis on Mr. Coachen's handwriting will take a bit of time. Let us go and wait in the Theatrum Neutralis, along with Agent Lang and Agent Shih-na! To be continued Edgeworth: Agent Lang... Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Little cubs, never do they know the real fury of the Elder wolves.\" Edgeworth: (These quotes are definitely becoming increasingly difficult to decipher...) And what does that mean? Lang: It means that you'll never really know how angry I can get. Mr. Prosecutor... The counterfeit bills made with Babahlese ink... they were all of Zheng Fa denominations. Edgeworth: Yes, so I heard from Ms. von Karma. Franziska: But we don't know where the play money has gone. Edgeworth: (They must not have figured out that it was all burned yet...) Lang: Ever since those things showed up in circulation, my country's economy has taken a big hit. Zheng Fa is in financial chaos as we speak... ...because we can't tell the difference between our own bills and the fakes! But it's not just the money; the citizens are also worried. I've staked the honor of the house of Lang on this... ...and have come to this land to capture the mastermind behind this whole mess. I investigated how the bills were made and how the ink was smuggled into Zheng Fa... ...and I pursued the smuggling ring all the way here. But tonight... this is where the final chapter was written. Despite my frantic efforts to chase the smuggler down, someone got to him first... ...and now I'm called to return home without a single answer! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, I... Lang: Don't start. It's not your fault. It's not anyone's fault, Mr. Prosecutor. Ambassador Alba, I'm sorry for all the trouble tonight. Alba: Oh, no, no. It is I who should apologize. It was all because I was not strong enough. If only I was able to think of a better solution... Quercus, you fool! Curse your empty brain! Lang: Heh, you're being too hard on yourself, Ambassador. I take full responsibility for tonight, end of story. Shih-na, let's go. Time to return to our den. Shih-na: .........Yes. Franziska: I don't like to admit it, but there's not much else for us to do but to go home as well. Edgeworth: Agent Lang! A moment, if you ???: Gumshoe: You, Wolf-man and the secretary lady! Hold it! Objection! Pal! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe...! Have you got the results of the handwriting analysis already? Gumshoe: Yup, and that note... was definitely written by Mr. Coachen, sir! Edgeworth: Hmm, just as I thought... Good work, Detective. DeMasque II's Note data updated in my Organizer. Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... How long do you intend to hold us up for? Edgeworth: Hmph... Sorry to have made you wait, but I believe that now everyone is finally here. Agent Shih-na. I'd like to ask you something, if you don't mind. Shih-na: .........Yes? Edgeworth: How exactly did you fail to see the Yatagarasu... ...when you were in the neighboring room to where Mr. Coachen was killed!? I'd like you to explain THAT to us. Lang: What...? Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! What are you doing asking her about something she didn't see? Edgeworth: (Agent Lang hasn't touched the Babahl investigation at all. So I suppose I will need to explain a few things to him first.) Franziska: Miles Edgeworth... I can't even begin to imagine what's going on in that head of yours. Edgeworth: The only thing going on in my head... is the pursuit of the truth! Franziska: Oh? It sounds like you have some sort of plan. Very well, I'll supervise you until the end. Edgeworth: (*sigh* Is she seriously going to treat me as a subordinate for the rest of the day...?) Lang: You're not trying to pick a fight with my subordinate on some flimsy guess, are you? Edgeworth: I'm not trying to \"pick a fight\" and the evidence is hardly flimsy, as you will see. Lang: Hah! I should've known... ...that you and I are destined to fight it out to the very end! Edgeworth: It would appear that way. Lang: Well, I'll prove her innocence, so let's see what you've got, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hmph... With pleasure. (For my opening argument, I'll discuss the Yatagarasu that appeared in Babahl... ...and establish exactly who it was that Kay saw.) Agent Lang. I assume you've been briefed on Kay's testimony? Lang: You mean the \"suspicious person in a coat\" that she saw? Edgeworth: That's right. That person is one of the keys to solving this case. The person who pretended to be the Yatagarasu! Lang: \"Pretended\"? And what do you mean by that!? Edgeworth: I'll get to that in a second. But first, I want to review what Kay's mystery person did (changed from [second, but first, I want to review what this person Kay saw did] in the original release). Kay, if you could please explain for us what the person you were chasing did (changed from [what the person you were chasing did for us] in the original release)... Kay: OK! You got it! I first spotted the suspicious person near the open-air stage on the Babahlese side. I called out to the person, but as soon as I did, that person ran off. I thought it was rather suspicious, so I immediately gave chase. Edgeworth: For the sake of argument, let's call this suspicious person the Yatagarasu. Now, please tell us what happened when you chased the Yatagarasu up to the 3rd floor. Kay: Can do! I chased the Yatagarasu all the way up to the third floor of the Babahlese Embassy. It was a pretty straight chase down the hallway, until the sudden turn. The Yatagarasu disappeared around the corner, so I did my best to catch up. When I turned the corner, I saw the Yatagarasu run into Mr. Coachen's office. I gave chase and ran into the room... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the light, but then... Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Shih-na: ...Who's there!? Kay: By the time I had turned on the lights, the Yatagarasu had disappeared. Edgeworth: When Kay entered the room, the person she was chasing was already gone. Why do you suppose that was, Agent Lang? Lang: ...What do you mean, \"Why do you suppose?\" Isn't it obvious!? The person slipped out through the door behind the girl under the cover of darkness. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Sorry, but I know for a fact that the person didn't escape through that door! Lang: Oh? And how do you know that with such certainly!? Edgeworth: Hmph... That's easy. If the Yatagarasu had left through that door, they would have run right into this person! Lang: Y-Your answer is Shih-na...? Edgeworth: Yes, because let's consider what would've happened if the Yatagarasu had used the door. When Kay screamed upon discovering Mr. Coachen's body... ...the Yatagarasu would've run right into Agent Shih-na, who was in the next room over. Lang: ...Arngh! Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na. Would you mind telling us if you saw the suspicious person in question? Shih-na: .........No, I didn't see anyone. Edgeworth: You see? Therefore, the Yatagarasu could not have escaped through the door as Lang: Lang: It just means that the creep slipped out before Shih-na made it out into the hallway! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. I doubt that, as there was another person in that hallway. A certain detective. Detective Gumshoe, where were you exactly at that time? Gumshoe: M-Me, sir? Well, when I heard Kay's scream... ...I ran towards Mr. Coachen's office from the opposite direction of Agent Shih-na, sir! Edgeworth: So, Agent Lang, can YOU explain how someone could've eluded both of them!? Even you must concede that under these circumstances, the door was not a viable route! Lang: Grr...rrrnoooooooooh! Kay: Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! You nailed him with just an explanation of what happened! Edgeworth: Yes... I've eliminated one of the possible escape routes from that room. (But this is far from over. I need to make Agent Lang aware as well... ...of yet another possible escape route the Yatagarasu could've taken.) Lang: .........! Ha ha ha ha! I get it! So that's what you were trying to show me. Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... Let me guess. This is what you're trying to say, right? Because the door was not a viable escape route, then there must've been another way out! Edgeworth: Precisely. Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! It's time to bust out with our revolving fireplace wall explanation, right!? Edgeworth: No, not quite yet. Kay: Huh!? But why? I thought this would be the perfect time... Edgeworth: The revolving wall on the Babahlese side is known only to four people. And if we use this information unwisely, the truth may escape us in the end. Lang: What's with all the whispering over there? Scared I'll figure out your tactics? Edgeworth: Hmph, nothing of the sort, Agent Lang. Come, let's continue where we left off. Lang: That smug, haughty attitude of yours... You really rub me the wrong way, you know that!? ...Hmph. Well, no matter. I've figured you out already anyway. The only other possible escape route besides the door... is the room's lone window! And since an eerie picture of said escape route exists... Are you saying that this photo captures the moment of the Yatagarasu's escape!? Edgeworth: (I guess Detective Badd must have filled him in on this photo... I have to admit that at first, I thought the window to be a possible escape route as well. However, I now know that to be impossible!) Lang: Now, I realize you may not know this, but... ...humans can't fly. Edgeworth: Of course I know that! That's bloody common sense! Besides, I never said I thought that photo to be of the Yatagarasu's escape route. Lang: ...I suppose not. Alright then, explain yourself. Edgeworth: The shadow in this photo is not the Yatagarasu that Kay was chasing after. Lang: Lang: You can say whatever you'd like in whatever language you want... ...but there's only one language I really understand: the language of evidence! Edgeworth: Very well, then. I present to you, proof that the person Kay saw is not the same as the one in this photo! Edgeworth: Let me explain to you precisely why the shadow in this photo is not the Yatagarasu Kay saw. Kay spotted the Yatagarasu heading for the third floor during the second fire. However, the photo in question was taken just after the first fire! Lang: Grr...rrrnoooooooooooh! Kay: Yeah! Way to go! That's TWICE you've bit him in the butt now! Lang: Lang: We're not done yet! You still have to explain what that shadow is... ...and how the Yatagarasu escaped! I don't suppose you can answer both, can you!? Edgeworth: Regarding the photo, I admit that we don't understand what it means quite yet. Lang: Hah! As I thought. Edgeworth: However, the Yatagarasu's escape route? Now, THAT I can answer. Lang: You can? Well, then, Mr. Prosecutor, go on! Enlighten me! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Even if I explain it, you'll try to find some flaw with what I have to say. You were busy heading up the Allebahstian investigation, correct? In that case, I doubt you'd have much knowledge about the Babahlese side of the case... ...so wouldn't it be best if the lead on that side, Agent Shih-na, explained in my stead? Lang: .........Argh! Shih-na is my subordinate...! If I don't stick up for her, how can I look her in the eyes and call myself her boss...!? Shih-na: .........Lang, it's alright. I can take care of him. Lang: Shih-na. Shih-na: You've shielded me a lot as my boss... ...but it's time for me to prove my worth. Lang: ...Alright. If you're OK with it, then you have my support. Edgeworth: (Finally, it's down to just Agent Shih-na and myself. This is where the battle really begins!) Shih-na: Now then, what is it you'd like to ask? Edgeworth: Hmm, let's see... Why don't we start with your movements inside the Babahlese Embassy? Shih-na: During the first Babahlese fire, I assisted in putting out the fire. During the second fire, I was searching for the Yatagarasu that had appeared in Babahl. While I was searching, I heard a scream coming from the next room over. Although I was in the next room, I was unable to catch a glimpse of the Yatagarasu. To be honest, I'm actually very skeptical that the girl's \"Yatagarasu\" even exists. Shih-na: And that is all I have to say. Kay: But I'm not lying when I say I saw the suspicious person run into Mr. Coachen's office! Like I said earlier... ...I have no intention of retracting my testimony. Shih-na: .........Good. Edgeworth: Just to confirm, did you have a partner when you were on your investigation? Shih-na: No, I moved alone. Edgeworth: In that case, you have no one to corroborate your alibi. Is that correct? Lang: Lang: Are you calling her suspicious because she was in a room by herself!? How pathetic! Edgeworth: ...And it wasn't when Agent Shih-na tried to arrest Kay under the same rationale? Lang: ............! Edgeworth: And how about when you accused Larry because he was the weapon's owner? Lang: ............Grr! Franziska: Not that it's unexpected for that useless lump to get into such a situation. Although, I suppose it's never a good idea to let mistakes go uncorrected. Lang: I will make no excuse for what I did in that situation. Gumshoe: Then you should apologize right now for making Kay out to be the killer, pal! Lang: .........I'm sorry. Shih-na, apologize. Shih-na: ............... .........I'm sorry. Kay: I-It's really OK! I mean, I'm not under suspicion anymore! Right, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Hmph. Well, I never doubted you. Not for one second. Lang: .........And the same goes for me. I believe in Shih-na. Edgeworth: Then let's put that to the test, and see if she is really worthy of your trust. Shih-na: Heh heh... This promises to be interesting. Shih-na: During the first Babahlese fire, I assisted in putting out the fire. Shih-na: During the second fire, I was searching for the Yatagarasu that had appeared in Babahl. Shih-na: While I was searching, I heard a scream coming from the next room over. Shih-na: Although I was in the next room, I was unable to catch a glimpse of the Yatagarasu. Shih-na: To be honest, I'm actually very skeptical that the girl's \"Yatagarasu\" even exists. Edgeworth: Hmph... There seems to be a very large flaw in her testimony. Kay: Oh? Then why don't you show her using what we found out with Little Thief? Edgeworth: Heh... I will, in due time. (The escape route of the Yatagarasu that Kay was in pursuit of... If it turns out that it really does lead right to Agent Shih-na... ...then what is it that she is keeping from us right now?) Edgeworth: Being in the room next to Mr. Coachen's office is the problem with your testimony. Shih-na: .........! Lang: Lang: Mr. Prosecutor... I don't see what problem you're talking about at all! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, do you recall the secret we discovered about the Allebahstian office fireplace? Lang: Huh? Oh, you mean how it connects the office with the room next door? What about it? Edgeworth: Well... Allebahst isn't the only country with secret connecting fireplaces. Lang: Wha--!? Edgeworth: The fireplace in Mr. Coachen's office holds the exact same secret! Lang: Wh...Whaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu didn't escape through the door to the room or the window. The escape route was through the revolving fireplace wall and into the next room over! Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: Now do you see? If the Yatagarasu had escaped into the next room... ...then the thief would've run straight into Agent Shih-na! Meaning that it's impossible for her to have missed the Yatagarasu! Lang: A.........Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaa! Franziska: Wh-What is the meaning of this, Miles!? Edgeworth: Well? Would you care to explain, Agent Shih-na... ...how you managed to completely miss the fleeing Yatagarasu, or shall I? Shih-na: ............ Edgeworth: Your claim that you were in the next room was a lie all along, wasn't it? The truth is, you were the one Kay saw in the coat... ...pretending to be the Yatagarasu, and you were the one she chased after. As you tried to lose her, you ran into Mr. Coachen's office, and headed for the fireplace. Then, you shed your coat in the next room, leaving it there to emerge as \"Agent Shih-na\". After that, you came back around to place Kay under arrest. Does that sound about right? If not, then speak now or forever hold your peace. Shih-na: ............ Gumshoe: How dare you make Kay look like the bad guy when you're the suspicious one, pal!? Shih-na: .........Phwwh... Phwwwwh... Edgeworth: .........! Lang: ...Shih-na...? Shih-na: Hee... hee hee hee......... ...Hee hee hee hee hee... hee hee......... Aha! Ahaha! Ahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Edgeworth: ! (That... That laugh...!) Franziska: I remember this irritating laugh... Gumshoe: Brr... I'm getting chills down my spine...! Kay: .........It can't be... But it has to be...! Lang: Shih-na... What's wrong with you...? Shih-na: Phwwh... I'm sorry. It was so funny that I couldn't help but laugh. Edgeworth: ...\"Funny\", you say? Shih-na: Yes, that you would accuse me of being the Yatagarasu. ...The prosecutors of this country really are all so very strange. Franziska: Do you think you can get away with this by simply laughing it off!? Shih-na: Phwwh... You think I'M taking things too lightly? I think not. It's that prosecutor who is. Edgeworth: .........! Shih-na: Look, everything you said earlier is nothing more than mere speculation. The Yatagarasu fled through the fireplace? Do you have any proof to back up your claim? If you don't, then you haven't proven a thing regarding the Yatagarasu's escape route! Edgeworth: The tone of voice you're taking with me now has certainly changed. Shih-na: Heh heh... That's because it's been a while since I've had this much fun. I think I'll let loose, and then we can have a real battle of wits. Edgeworth: For an agent of Interpol to show me the true power of her mind, it is a great honor. Shih-na: Phwwwh... Don't underestimate me; I'm not some foolish broad, you know. Edgeworth: I know. And that is why I won't hold anything back either as I answer your question. Shih-na: My question...? Edgeworth: Here is your proof that the revolving fireplace wall in Babahl was used recently! Shih-na: I'm sorry, but is this really your honest answer to my question? Edgeworth: Yes. According to Ambassador Palaeno's testimony... ...he said that he was burning some documents in the fireplace with Mr. Coachen. Shih-na: ...Oh? Edgeworth: The ashes of what they burned were left in the fireplace, so they should've been there. However, when we went to investigate the room, the ashes weren't there. Shih-na: Shih-na: Why is that a problem? Maybe someone cleaned them up? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph......... Unfortunately for you, Ambassador Palaeno said that he forgot to. And so the question remains: Why were the ashes missing? ...The answer is simple. When the Yatagarasu went through the fireplace wall... ...the ashes were pushed into the next room by the wall as well! The movement of the ashes that were in Mr. Coachen's office is my proof! Shih-na: Ahah! Ahaha! Ahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Edgeworth: .........And just what is so funny!? Shih-na: Ash as proof...? Are you even allowed to submit such flakey evidence in court? Franziska: You... still wish to fight us? Shih-na: Of course. Why wouldn't I? Edgeworth: In that case, let's hear your counterargument. Shih-na: Phwwwh... My counterargument, huh? This really is just like being in court. Edgeworth: Well, to me, we're simply continuing from where we left off all those years ago. Shih-na: ...Phwwwh. I have no idea what you're talking about. Edgeworth: It doesn't matter if we're at a crime scene or in court, let's finish this here and now! Shih-na: I suppose. I've had a lot of fun today, but I grow weary of this game of cat and mouse. Edgeworth: ...! Shih-na: Let's make this the last testimony, and wrap up this absurd case once and for all! Shih-na: In my eyes, all you've proved is that the rotating fireplace wall was used... ...but you can't really call that proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace, now can you? So then, who was it that used the rotating wall? Show me your answer with real evidence. Remember, we've already finished our very thorough investigation... ...and we found not a single suspicious thing in Mr. Coachen's office. Shih-na: Phwwwh... And there you have it, my counterargument. Edgeworth: ...Arngh! (That's very... impressive. She has seen through to the fact that I have yet to gather that one piece of evidence...) Kay: ............ Gumshoe: What is it, Kay? I haven't heard a peep out of you in quite a while now. Franziska If you don't think you can handle it, feel free to leave the rest of it to us. Kay: But I...! Edgeworth: Kay... Pull yourself together. You are the true heir to the Yatagarasu name, are you not? Kay: ...! Edgeworth: If you want to steal the truth, then you must never take your eyes off of it. This chase you're running to catch the truth... you must see it through to the very end. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... You're right. I... I will see this through to the end. So...... You go get her for me, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hmph... With pleasure. Shih-na: Looks like a lack of evidence has left you wide open, doesn't it? Lang: ...Shih-na. Please... show me you're someone I can trust. Shih-na: ......... Don't worry. This will be the deciding match. You'll see. Edgeworth: (I'm truly sorry, Agent Lang, but I simply can't allow her to escape me again.) Very well then, Agent Shih-na. Shall we begin? Shih-na: Phwwh... I'm ready whenever you are. Shih-na: In my eyes, all you've proved is that the rotating fireplace wall was used... Shih-na: ...but you can't really call that proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace, now can you? Shih-na: So then, who was it that used the rotating wall? Show me your answer with real evidence. Shih-na: Remember, we've already finished our very thorough investigation... Shih-na: ...and we found not a single suspicious thing in Mr. Coachen's office. Kay: So... do you actually have any proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace passageway? Edgeworth: No, I haven't found any yet. Kay: Then what are we going to do!? Edgeworth: Hmph. There's no need to worry. Because there is a loophole in Ms. Interpol Agent's argument we can exploit first. (The one in charge of the Babahlese investigation was not Agent Lang. Which means that with Agent Shih-na in charge... ...it's possible she may have tampered with the evidence. That piece of evidence that we found... If there is one thing I DO know, it is that someone tried to hide it from us!) Edgeworth: And that this throws doubt on the purity of your investigation into the Yatagarasu! Shih-na: ...! You still suspect me, I see. Alright then, I ask that you point out what part of my investigation is incomplete. Edgeworth: (The other Interpol agents worked under the command of Agent Shih-na. And is it not possible that the reason the person Kay was chasing chose the third floor... ...was because that person knew there would be no other agents on that floor? Furthermore, we've come to see that Agent Shih-na... ...was only pretending to be investigating the Yatagarasu, to the point of arresting Kay. In that case, there is one location that no one has yet to inspect!) Your team's investigation was incomplete because they failed to inspect this location! Edgeworth: The location, Agent Shih-na, is of course, the room you claimed to have examined. I believe the room next to Mr. Coachen's office warrants a thorough inspection. Shih-na: Even if you do that, I doubt you'll find anything of use to you there. Edgeworth: Hmph. I will be the one to decide that! Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I'm on it! I'll be right back after I check out that room next to the office! Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth... Do you really think that Ms. Shih-na's the Yatagarasu? Edgeworth: ...Yes, if my logic is sound, I believe she is. Kay: Then, I'm not going to let her get away with ruining the name of the Yatagarasu! Franziska: But can you prove she's the Yatagarasu is the question. Edgeworth: If Detective Gumshoe can find what I'm hoping he will find, then I should be able to. Franziska: And just what are you hoping he'll find? Edgeworth: Let's just say this. I had Detective Gumshoe do a little experiment for me earlier. Franziska: An experiment? As if that detective has the brains for high science. Edgeworth: It wasn't that mentally taxing. I had him use the same escape route as the Yatagarasu. Franziska: And what did you find out by doing that? Edgeworth: First, that it's possible for a person to fit through the revolving wall \"door\". Second, that by going through there, his coat was covered in ash and Babahlese ink. Franziska: Who cares what his coat was covered in? It's not worth that much anyway! Edgeworth: Ah, but is it really worth so little? I believe that it's actually quite a meaningful result, the value of which I'm about to prove. Franziska: ...? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! I've found some things you really need to see, sir! Edgeworth: Oh? So what are these things that you found? Gumshoe: Ummm... Some make-up, a coat, and a pair of shoes, sir. Kay: You found a coat!? You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Maybe it's the one the person I was chasing was wearing! Edgeworth: Yes, the possibility does exist. Agent Shih-na. Were these pieces of evidence not in that room when you examined it? Shih-na: Phwwwh... Unfortunately for you, those aren't \"suspicious items\" of any sort. They all belong to me. They were getting in the way, so I stored them in that room. Gumshoe: Aww...! Shih-na: Thank you for bringing them to me. It saves me a trip. May I have them back now? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: These items that the detective brought back are incredibly significant. I request that we be allowed to examine them. Shih-na: Shih-na: They're my personal belongings, so you have no right to touch them without my permission. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I wish to examine them for the sake of the investigation. But if you wish to deny us access to them... Agent Lang, let's hear your opinion on this. Lang: I say, let them look at your stuff, Shih-na. Shih-na: Lang! Lang: Shih-na, let's put it all out in the open. If you're really innocent, then you have nothing to worry about, right? Shih-na: .........I guess so, Alright, go ahead and examine whatever you'd like. After all, I have nothing to hide. Edgeworth: Hmph... Good. Now let us begin. Gumshoe: So which of Agent Shih-na's belongings are you going to examine, sir? Edgeworth: Let's examine the coat. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: It appears you managed to stain your coat rather badly... ...Agent Shih-na. Shih-na: ............ Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu that Kay saw was wearing a coat. And I'm beginning to wonder if this stain wasn't created when you went through the fireplace. Shih-na: Ahah... No, you have it wrong. That soot probably got on my coat when I was helping the police put out the fire. Edgeworth: And what about this dark substance around the hem of your coat? Shih-na: Oh! I didn't realize that the hem was that dirty. I'm sure it's just some water mixed with soot from when I was helping with the fire. Kay: I don't think so! You think you can get away with such a transparent lie!? Gumshoe: Yeah! Don't lie to us, pal! This is the same pattern of dirt that got on my coat when I went through the fireplace! Shih-na: Shih-na: Your words ring hollow in the absence of evidence, you know. So unless you can prove that the dirt on my coat is from the fireplace... Edgeworth: Which I can. Shih-na: Wh...!? How...!? Edgeworth: You did a great job, Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Me, sir? What did I do? Edgeworth: This coat... This is exactly the piece of evidence I was searching for. I had been hoping to find the coat that the person Kay saw was wearing. And thanks to you, we proved that going through the fireplace would sully a coat. Gumshoe: I don't quite get what you're saying, but I'm happy for the praise, sir! Edgeworth: All that remains... ...is for us to show what the dark substance on the coat hem is. Shih-na: Oh? And you think you can do that? Edgeworth: Of course I can. This is the dark substance that sullied the hem of this coat! Shih-na: B-Babahlese ink? Edgeworth: Yes. This is what will prove that the coat went through that fireplace! According to Ambassador Palaeno, he burned some files in the fireplace this morning. Shih-na: You told us about that already, so I don't really see the point in mentioning it again. Edgeworth: My point is that he spilled some ink onto the back wall of the fireplace at that time. Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: If the dark substance on this coat turns out to be Babahlese ink... ...it would prove that you and this coat went through the revolving fireplace wall! Shih-na: ...Ack! Edgeworth: (Sorry to have clipped one of your wings, \"Yatagarasu\", but we're not finished yet.) Shih-na: But you have no way of proving whether or not this is Babahlese ink on the coat hem! Edgeworth: Oh, but I do. And I intend to show that it IS ink in a few seconds. Shih-na: How...!? Edgeworth: How, you ask? Well, since you don't seem to know, allow me to show you. This is how I will prove that the dark substance on the coat is Babahlese ink! Edgeworth: We can find out whether that is Babahlese ink or not by lighting it on fire. Lang: That's how you're going to prove that it's Babahlese ink? Edgeworth: Yes. If you could please cut a section of the dark, stained area for me, I'd appreciate it. Because I will show you, here and now, what the dark substance is! Lang: Shih-na... Sorry to do this, but I'm going to have to cut off a bit of your coat. Shih-na: Go ahead. I wasn't planning to wear it anymore anyway. Edgeworth: Now then, if someone could loan me a lighter or something... Kay: Oh! I've got some matches! I always carry them with me so I can light smoke bombs! Edgeworth: Then, if I could please have one, Kay, we can get this experiment underway. Franziska: The flame...! Lang: It's the same color as the flames whitcrystal oil produces... Which means...! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink is a product of whitcrystal oil. And when lit, the ink produces a green flame. Shih-na: ......... Edgeworth: (Hmph. I believe the time has come to clip the Yatagarasu's other wing.) Kay: Ms. Shih-na... You're the fake Yatagarasu...! The one who killed my father! Shih-na: ......... Edgeworth: It's about time you came clean, Agent Shih-na. Or should I say... ...Calisto Yew!? Lang: Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... You're not serious, are you? Edgeworth: Do I look like the joking type to you? Shih-na: ...Ahah. Phwwwh... \"Calisto Yew\"? I've never heard that name before in my life. Franziska: That manner of speaking, and that attitude...! You haven't changed a bit in seven years! Gumshoe: You're the defense attorney that killed Mr. Faraday, and then tried to frame me for it! Shih-na: Oh really, and you have proof? You insist that I am this \"Calisto Yew\" woman, but you can't prove it! If you have no proof, then I'm afraid you won't be able to lay a single finger on me. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The raven is a very unique bird, one that flies by the darkness of night. However! The light of dawn has arrived, and it will reveal your true, ugly form to the world! Shih-na: Shih-na: Enough poetry! I want to see some evidence! Franziska: Do you really have something that can prove that she is Calisto Yew? Edgeworth: I do. It's something that the 2nd Yatagarasu has preserved for us these last seven years! Kay: Do me the honor, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: I will, Kay. For we have finally come to the end. We'll prove her to be Calisto Yew with this, and clip this Yatagarasu's wings for good! Edgeworth: This perfume... This will prove you to be Calisto Yew. Shih-na: It will...!? Edgeworth: Kay has preserved it perfectly for us. Surely you remember this bottle? This belonged to Ms. Yew just before she disappeared seven years ago. Naturally, this means that a few of her fingerprints are on here as well. Kay: This is that bottle of perfume you spilled, which I have preserved ever since. Shih-na: ...! Kay: I heard from my father, Byrne Faraday... ...that if stored under the right conditions, a fingerprint can be preserved for decades. Which means that your fingerprints are still on here. Every last one. Shih-na: ......... Edgeworth: We can clear everything up if we were to compare the prints on this to your own! Now come, Agent Shih-na! Will you submit yourself to a fingerprint test!? Shih-na: ...Ahah. Edgeworth: ! Shih-na: Hee... hee hee hee... Ahah. Ahah! Ahah! Ahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! ???: It looks like... you've seen right through me yet again... Ahah... You're sending the biggest chill down my spine, Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Calisto... Yew...! Franziska: So you've shown your true face at last. Yew: This feeling of thrill... it's even greater than that time, seven years ago. Lang: Shih-na! You're...! Yew: Lang, I really enjoyed our days together. You're an insanely strong, nice, kind-hearted... idiot of a man. Lang: So, you were a spy all along? A mole sent by the smuggling ring I've been chasing after... Someone who has been feeding them intel on Interpol all this time!? Yew: Ahah! Very good! Maybe you're not as big of an idiot as I thought! Kay: Calisto Yew... The woman who killed my father seven years ago...! You're her, aren't you!? The fake Yatagarasu! Yew: That's right. Calisto Yew... That's just one of my many names. But even that is just a fa\u00e7ade. .........Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I am... the Great Thief Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: Calisto Yew, this time you won't escape, for this is the end of the road for you. Now come along quietly! Yew: You know, you're the one who left the strongest impression on me... Kay Faraday. And had you not used the Yatagarasu's gadgets, I might've never known who you were. But here you are, being a thorn in my side... just like your father always was. Kay: ...! Edgeworth: Kay! Don't! Kay: Yew! I'll never forgive you for what you did to my father! Yew: Phwwwh... You really are just like him. Mr. Faraday, too, possessed such laughable honesty! Edgeworth: Kay! Gumshoe: Aaaaaaah! You let Kay go right now, pal! Franziska: You despicable...! Kay: Let go of me! You filthy... Arngh! Yew: You think I'm a fake, don't you? Well, unfortunately for you, I'm the real Yatagarasu. Kay: But that's impossible! My father was the one who created Little Thief! Yew: Ahaha! Hey, Edgeworth. The Yatagarasu has three legs. Do you know why that is? Edgeworth: Why it has three legs...? Badd: There are three main reasons why the Yatagarasu will always be one step ahead! First! The Yatagarasu always knows the exact location of the target object. Second! The Yatagarasu always knows exactly how to disarm the security system. Edgeworth: No, it can't be! Yew: Did you finally figure it out? Do you finally know the real identity of the Yatagarasu!? Edgeworth: The real identity of the Yatagarasu is... Edgeworth: The real identity of the Yatagarasu is neither Byrne Faraday nor Calisto Yew. But by the same token, they are also both the real Yatagarasu. Yew: Ha ha! How very perceptive of you! Kay: N-No way! Edgeworth: The single person known as the Great Thief Yatagarasu never existed. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I... No! I refuse to believe this! Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu is known to have three special skills. Skill number one. The Yatagarasu always knows the exact location of the target object. And a lawyer would have the opportunity to learn the layout of client corporations. Skill number two. The Yatagarasu always knows exactly how to disarm the security system. And a good prosecutor would be well-versed in the ways of a criminal. ???: And skill number three... The Yatagarasu doesn't leave a single shred of evidence behind... ever... Edgeworth: D-Detective Badd! Badd: ...It was only natural for the Yatagarasu to never leave evidence behind. Because the lead detective on the case... hid it all away... Edgeworth: Y-You're the third member of the Yatagarasu!? Badd: ...Yew. ...I've been looking for you for a long time. Seven long years, but I've finally got you... Yew: Ahah! Why, Mr. Badd! Long time no see. What happened to us? We used to be such a great team. Kay: If you were such a great team, then why did you kill my father seven years ago!? Yew: Ha ha ha. Why indeed? It was nothing personal, really. He was just another person I had to kill. Kay: ...! How can you say that...!? Yew: I grow weary of this, and it's about time for everything to come to an end. And this time, I won't miss. Edgeworth: Stop! Badd: Yeeeeeeeeew! Edgeworth: Kay! Lang: It's over, Shih-na. Kay: Y...! Your leg...! Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Yew: Grrrnk! Badd: You idiot...! What were you thinking, jumping in front of my gun like that...!? What are you risking your life for!? Lang: I'm sorry, Detective Badd, but no matter what sort of past she may have had... ...or even if she is a spy, it doesn't change the fact that she is my subordinate. And as long as she is, I can't allow any harm to come to her, not even from you! Yew: You really are... an idiot, you know that...? Lang: Hah! That's fine with me. You should know by now that this is just how I am. Hey, sis... Franziska: Yes...? Lang: I want you to conduct a full body search. Shih-na might have another weapon on her. Franziska: Alright. Detective Gumshoe, your assistance, please. Gumshoe: Sir! Gumshoe: Hey, I found something! What is this, sir? It looks like the blade of a knife, but it doesn't have a handle. Edgeworth: This is a great find, Detective. Gumshoe: Huh? It is, sir? Edgeworth: Let's try pairing up this blade with this handle. Edgeworth: I believe this blade actually belongs with the handle that was on the murder weapon. Gumshoe: Hey, they fit together perfectly! Edgeworth: This blade must've been taken from the crime scene when the knife handles were switched. Gumshoe: I'm going to go return this Babahlese knife now! Edgeworth: Alright. I trust that you'll make sure that it is returned to Ambassador Palaeno. Babahlese Knife Handle given to Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: I believe this makes it perfectly clear who did it, Calisto Yew! For the only time the handles could've been switched is just after Mr. Coachen's murder. Yew: Ahah...! Edgeworth: Which means that you must be Mr. Coachen's killer! You killed Mr. Coachen with the Allebahstian knife... ...switched the handles, and then took the original blade of the Babahlese knife with you. Later, you allowed yourself to be spotted by Kay near the open-air stage. You used the fireplace to lose her, and then you went back to accuse her of the murder. Does that about sum it up? Yew: Yew: Ahah... You craft an engaging tale, Edgeworth, but there are two problems with it. Edgeworth: Problems? In what respect? Yew: What do you think my real reason was in allowing her to chase after me? Edgeworth: .........? Yew: Phwwh... It was all so I could capture Kay Faraday. Kay: What!? Yew: When I saw you using that device at Gatewater Land, I knew right away... ...that you were Byrne Faraday's daughter. Ahah! I became curious, so I researched a little into your background. That's how I found out that you were on the trail of the Yatagarasu. Kay: So that's why you tried to pin Mr. Coachen's murder on me? Yew: Yes... I knew you would show up at this embassy tonight. So I thought to use you. But pinning the murder on you wasn't my only goal. Kay: You had another? Yew: Heh heh, yes. Once I had you under arrest, I had planned to search you... ...and take back the device that rightfully belongs to me, the true Yatagarasu. Kay: You were going to take Little Thief away from me!? Yew: Seven years ago, it was thanks to that device that Faraday was able to infiltrate this place. But he stole more than he should've. I had a tough time recovering that precious key. Edgeworth: Then, the person who stole the Yatagarasu's Key was Mr. Faraday...!? Badd: Yew... That incident seven years ago... What was the catalyst behind it? Yew: In the eyes of the smuggling ring, the Yatagarasu was becoming a bit of a problem. ...It wasn't an especially pleasant assignment. Kay: ......... Edgeworth: Then why!? Why did you become a member of the Yatagarasu!? Yew: Why? There is no \"why\". I was destined to betray everyone from the very beginning. Edgeworth: From the beginning? What is that supposed to mean? Yew: The person I take orders from hasn't changed... Even now, to this day. Edgeworth: ! (Does this mean that the leader of the smuggling ring wasn't Mr. Coachen? Then... the real ringleader is still out there pulling the strings!) Lang: Are you done asking what you need to know? Because if so, we should probably get going. And you're going to tell me everything you did tonight. Do you understand, Shih-na? Yew: I guess I should tell you, then, that I was the one who set the Babahlese Embassy on fire. Edgeworth: And why did you do that? Yew: Ahah... I suppose it was to destroy all evidence of the counterfeit bills. Lang: That was what the smuggling ring was trying to do...? But then, why start two fires!? Yew: Sorry, but I can't tell you anything about the ring. It's your job to complete your investigation, after all. I've had my fun. Now, it's your turn to enjoy the ride. Kay: ...Wait! Ye... I mean, Ms. Shih-na. Yew: Yes? Kay: When I fell to the floor earlier, these fell at my feet. Yew: What about them...? Kay: They're such pretty hair sticks that I thought... well, that I should return them to you. Yew: Ha ha... You can have them. They're of no use to me anymore. If you don't want them, you can always just throw them away. Kay: .........No, I want to keep them. Yew: Ahah... Suit yourself. .........Oh, that's right. I almost forgot, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hm...? Yew: About the second problem I had with your story... I didn't kill anyone tonight. Edgeworth: What...? Yew: I'm not saying that as a sore loser. Think of it as a hint, if you will. Lang: Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: Yes, Agent Lang? Lang: Mark my words, I'm not done here, and I'll be back! And it's got nothing to do with duty or anything, because this has become my personal case. I may have been shot... ...but I'll show you just how dangerous a wounded wolf can be! Edgeworth: (His anger appears to have negated the sensation of pain in his injured leg...) It's finally over, Kay. Kay: I feel like I've peered into her heart a little, you know? And it's so cold, and dark... and incredibly lonely. The person who was giving her all these commands... ...the one who thought my father was a problem to be removed... Edgeworth: That person is the real ringleader behind the smuggling ring! Kay: Um, Mr. Edgeworth, I have a favor to ask. Can you... hold onto these hair sticks for me? They're really pretty, just like the ones they were selling for the Jammin' Ninja show... ...but until this case is over, I don't think I can look at them without being overcome. Edgeworth: ...I understand. I'll take good care of them for you. (Hm...? There is a bit of soil stuck on the ends of these sticks...) Hair Sticks data jotted down in my Organizer. Gumshoe: Oh! I guess it's that time already, huh!? Franziska: So it's midnight... the dawn of another day. Gumshoe: Hey, pops! Thanks a bunch! You've really done a lot for everyone all these years! Edgeworth: Detective Badd, don't tell me today is the day...? Badd: Yeah... it is. With this... I can retire in peace. ...It was down to the wire, and we almost didn't make it... ...but we did it... we solved everything. Edgeworth: But that's just it; we haven't solved everything yet. The ringleader of the smuggling ring you, the Yatagarasu, were chasing after... Badd: ...The legend of that Yatagarasu... is now over. Mr. Edgeworth... That bit of logic earlier... it was brilliant. Edgeworth: ... Badd: I feel like... I can leave it all in your hands. ...I'm counting on you. Kay: Is it really true, Uncle Badd? Were you also a part of the Yatagarasu...? Badd: As I said to you earlier... Kay... I'm truly sorry. I wanted... nothing but a peaceful life for you... Kay: Uncle Badd... Gumshoe: Hey, don't take it so seriously! It's all just one big joke, right!? Franziska: ...Unfortunately, it isn't. Gumshoe: O-Oh, come on, sir! She's just yanking on my chain, isn't she, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Detective Badd... Wait, no, you are no longer a detective... Mr. Badd, I'd like to ask you about the Yatagarasu. Gumshoe: ...Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth... Badd: Mr. Edgeworth... ...Here, I should give these back to you. Edgeworth: These are... ...the pages from my KG-8 case files that the Yatagarasu stole from my office! Gumshoe: Huh? Wait? WHAT!? Badd: Mr. Edgeworth, I must apologize for last night. Edgeworth: So the Yatagarasu who stole into my room was you, was it? Gumshoe: Wait... then that means... WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? T-Tell me it's not true...! Th-That's too insane for me to believe, sir! Badd: It's true... Even if it's not something you want to hear. The KG-8 Incident... It was a very emotionally trying case. We stood in that courtroom... Faraday as the prosecutor... and I as the lead detective. Faraday had... evidence in his possession... that would prove the defendant guilty. However... because it was stolen, the defendant... was found innocent. Yew was... the elder sister... of the victim in the case. When the defendant was pronounced \"not guilty\"... she... let out a great wail. That's when we realized... that there was a limit... to what the law could do. The only way to bring someone like that to justice was to do so outside of the courts... That's what we thought... at the time. ...That's how we... formed the Yatagarasu... ...and vowed to bring to light... any dirty dealings companies had with the ring... ...including companies that dealt with... the Amano Group... Edgeworth: Mr. Amano's conglomerate...? Badd: We called ourselves the Yatagarasu... and flexed our collective muscle... We exposed all sorts of shady dealings... as a warning to the business world as a whole... By doing that... we were able to stop... the higher ups from covering things up. And then... it was finally time... We had finally arrived at the moment when... we'd find out the ringleader's true identity. It was then that Yew literally stabbed us in the heart... and Faraday... he died for it... Edgeworth: .................. Kay: But why...? Wasn't she the sister of the victim in the KG-8 Incident? Badd: ...After Faraday's death, I looked into her past... And that's when I found out... that she was a phony. The victim of the KG-8 Incident, Cece Yew... ...she ...never had a sister. Edgeworth: What? Then that means... Badd: \"Shih-na\" wasn't the only fake name she used! \"Calisto Yew\" was also another pseudonym! From the very beginning... that woman was a spy sent by the smuggling ring! Franziska: She said it herself; \"I was destined to betray everyone from the very beginning.\" Badd: Anyway... Let's return to the real topic at hand... Mr. Edgeworth... this \"trump card\" that we stuck onto this page of the case file... ...please use it wisely. Edgeworth: \"Trump card\"...? Badd: That photo that we stuck on there... Try peeling it off. Behind it... slumbers a piece of evidence... that Faraday hid away all those years ago. Edgeworth: It's the mark of the Yatagarasu... But why? Badd: This is... a \"directives card\"... from the big boss. Take a look... at the back. This was something... Coachen had on him at the time of the KG-8 Incident... ten years ago. That blood... is from the victim of the incident, Ms. Cece Yew... Edgeworth: But why is the card adorned with the mark of the Yatagarasu? Badd: The reason why... we called ourselves... the Yatagarasu... ...was because... of the three-legged raven mark that the smuggling ring's boss used. Apparently, orders from the boss... would come on these cards, without fail. The person who received the order... was supposed to burn it immediately after reading it. And apparently... it burns a bright green flame when set ablaze... Edgeworth: So you mean, the cards were written in Babahlese ink...? Badd: The fact that the card that Coachen was sent made it into Faraday's hand at all... ...is nothing short of a miracle. We decided... that whenever we stole anything... ...we would send a \"card\" along with it... to the police. Edgeworth: So that's what those white cards are! Badd: The Great Thief that used the mark... that only those within the ring would know... It was our message... to the ringleader... ...that we were only a few steps behind. Trump Card data jotted down in my Organizer. Badd: And one more thing... Detective Gumshoe. I'm entrusting this to you. Gumshoe: What is this, sir? Badd: This is what I was talking about earlier. During the KG-8 Incident trial, Faraday had this in his possession... ...this important, definitive piece of evidence... Edgeworth: But I thought it was stolen, How do you have it...? Badd: The person who stole it from us... ten years ago... ...was a man by the name of Ernest Amano... And he had it locked and hidden away... for all this time. But we forced him to tell us where it was finally... after the other day's kidnapping case. Video Tape data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: This video...! Portsman: Wh--! Don't come any closer! I'm warning you! Edgeworth: This is the same video as the one Mr. Portsman was trying to conceal from me! Badd: Yeah, it would seem that even he was caught up in the ring's web. Amano was preparing to take on the boss someday... ...and the video was his insurance. That's where that prosecutor comes in... He was to retrieve the video. On top of that... he was apparently instructed to sneak into your office... ...and steal the trump card... You saw it for yourself, right? The card that told him to preserve the evidence. Edgeworth: Then, that card was not the calling card of the Yatagarasu... ...but rather, a directives card from the ringleader to Mr. Portsman? Badd: The two pieces together make for a strong weapon for whoever holds them. Edgeworth: The evidence Mr. Portsman thought to withhold from me... ...and the one that you stole from my office last night... Both pieces are illegal, and for me to use either one is... Badd: Whether you use them or not... is up to you. But they will be of help to you... when you take on someone who is above the law. Edgeworth: (Is the boss one of those who \"cannot be brought to court\" that Mr. Faraday spoke of?) Detective Badd... There is no limit to the law, for it is the people who determine the limits to them. Badd: You still insist that, even now? You really are something else. I leave the rest in your hands. Now then, Detective Gumshoe. The handcuffs. It's time to lock up... the last remaining member of the Yatagarasu. Gumshoe: Pops... Badd: ...Don't ever lose your detective's spirit. Gumshoe: Nnnnrrrgh... Pops! Why is this happening!? This isn't justice! Badd: Like I always told you... do not get emotionally involved. ...Now let's go. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Is this really the end of a legend...? To be continued \nLang: One of Allebahst's knives was used in Babahl to murder Mr. Coachen. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I concur that this knife crossed over country lines. Lang: Good, but that's not the only thing that did. We mustn't forget about the other weapon! The knife was only one. Lang: And the murder weapon in the killing of DeMasque II is Babahl's Primidux Statue. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you're saying that the Primidux Statue was also brought over by Franziska? Lang: Like I told you before, that's the only way it makes sense! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And how exactly did she bring it over? Lang: I... haven't figured that out yet. Edgeworth: Hmph... That's a rather weak statement, considering how sure you are. Lang: Maybe, but there is one thing I do know for sure. Lang: Somehow, these two objects were able to penetrate the two countries' impenetrable security. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Impenetrable\"...? I should hardly think so. Lang: Lang: You've seen the top of the wall between the two countries, right? Who in the world could cross over that? Kay: Yeah, not even I could climb over that thing with all that barbed wire... Lang: The only way into either embassy is through the doors in the Theatrum Neutralis. So the only way for the knife and the Primidux Statue to traverse the two countries... ...is through those security camera-equipped, well-guarded doors. Present Babahl's Primidux Statue or Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Agent Lang, those two items are not the only two to cross the border tonight.\" Lang: The only one who traversed the two countries just before and after the crimes was you. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was Franziska really the only person to have traveled between the two countries? Lang: According to the guards at both doors, she is the only one to go back and forth. The sis there was in Allebahst when the Yatagarasu showed. And then, just before you guys found Mr. Coachen's body, she entered Babahl. I think we can assume that's when she brought the knife into Babahl. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Then how do you explain the Primidux Statue? Lang: ...I haven't quite figured that out yet. However, the fact that the two weapons crossed the border... ...proves that the killer must have also traveled across the country lines! Edgeworth: (The only things to cross the border are the Primidux Statue and the knife? I should hardly think that those are the only two items, Agent Lang...!) Edgeworth: Agent Lang, those two items are not the only two to cross the border tonight. Lang: Oh? Edgeworth: DeMasque II was killed with Babahl's Primidux Statue, yes. But if that's the case, then tell me, where did Allebahst's Primidux Statue go? Lang: To Babahl...! Edgeworth: Precisely. And if the two statues really were switched... ...then this means that both statues were smuggled across the border at some point. Which means that a total of three items were smuggled across the embassies! Lang: Hmm... I guess so. But you know what? It doesn't matter the number of items, only that the sis is the only one who could've done it! Because the only person who went back and forth between Allebahst and Babahl is her! Edgeworth: (Is that really true? Was there no one else who traveled between the two countries? Actually, there was definitely another person; one who paid a visit to both sides of the wall!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Is that really so, Agent Lang? Lang: Ha ha ha ha! What a lousy time to try and bluff your way out of this! I checked out what the guards said, along with the security cameras' footage. You're not going to overturn my hypothesis that easily! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But suppose there was some other way other than through the theater doors? Lang: What other way...? Edgeworth: (The other entity that managed to cross the border unharmed... If I point it out, it would open up a whole new possibility! And though I hesitate to bring this out... ...as long as this entity exists, the impossible road becomes a possibility.) Lang: It looks like you've got some clever idea in mind. Edgeworth: I do, and I can show it to you through a single piece of evidence. Lang: Tch! Fine, then. Let's see this piece of evidence that will show me this \"other route\"! Edgeworth: This piece of evidence will show us another way to move between the two countries! Present Photo of Yatagarasu Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Agent Lang, I'm sure you are familiar with this unforgettable photo.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I believe this is the piece of evidence that will show you how! Lang: ......... What about it? You're going to have to explain because I don't see another road or anything here (changed from [else] in the original release)! Edgeworth: B-But how can you not see!? Wolves are known for their keen eyesight! Lang: Sorry, but the only thing I see is the crud that you're hoping will stick to the wall. Edgeworth: (I need to think calmly about this and find that other road the smuggled goods took...) Leads back to: \"This piece of evidence will show us another way to move between the two countries!\" Edgeworth: Agent Lang, I'm sure you are familiar with this unforgettable photo. Lang: Tch...! That supernatural photo!? Like I said before... Humans can't fly. Edgeworth: No, of course not. I understand that perfectly well. Lang: And don't start claiming that Shih-na somehow grew wings, either. Edgeworth: I wouldn't dream of claiming that. Lang: And I won't allow you to take back what you've said either! I'll say it again; it's not humanly possible to fly through the air without wings! So you'd better have a good explanation for this, Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: ...Arngh! (But how can I prove who it was that flew through the air in this photo!? Wait. \"Not humanly possible\"...? Eureka...!) Very well. You will have your explanation! Lang: It sounds like you have a good idea simmering inside that head of yours... Let's hear it! The face hidden within this photo's blurry, trailed shadow is...!? Present Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Naturally, the shadow is the third smuggled object, the Primidux Statue replica.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is the face behind the shadow! Lang: Lang: I thought I said that you'd better have a GOOD explanation. I can't make heads or tails of what you're trying to say with that! Edgeworth: Nnrgh! (W-Was I wrong...?) Lang: Come on... Hurry up and show me what that shadow that's flying through the air is! Edgeworth: Even had you not barked that at me, I would've gladly done so, Agent Lang. (I need to go over it one more time. The man-shaped shadow that flew through the air, wrapped in the darkness of the night... Its real shape can only be this one thing!) Leads back to: \"Let's hear it! The face hidden within this photo's blurry, trailed shadow is...!?\" Edgeworth: Naturally, the shadow is the third smuggled object, the Primidux Statue replica. Lang: You can't be serious! Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu... or rather, Calisto Yew dressed as Agent Shih-na, was inside Babahl. She dressed the replica statue up in clothes, and launched it through the air. Lang: Lang: Hah... Mr. Prosecutooooooor! You left out a very crucial bit in your explanation. Edgeworth: I know I did. Lang: She \"launched it through the air\"!? Hah... And how exactly did she do thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (He is literally baring his fangs at me...! But he has a point. How exactly did it move through the air like that? As long as this remains unsolved, we won't be able to move any closer to the truth! Which reminds me, didn't he say this earlier...?) Lang: Hey, sis... I remember that just before Ambassador Alba went to give his speech... ...he called you into his office, right? Edgeworth: (So, just before the murder, Franziska was called here, right into this very room. If that's the case... then that may be another avenue I can pursue.) Agent Lang. In order for me to answer that question... ...I will need to hear testimony from Ms. von Karma. Franziska: ! Lang: Oh...? What are you up to now, pretty boy? Edgeworth: Earlier, you mentioned something of interest to me. You said that just before the murder occurred... ...Ms. von Karma had been in this room because Ambassador Alba had called for her. And for that reason alone, you believe her to be the killer. Lang: Yeah, I guess I did say something like that. Edgeworth: In that case, I believe it is my duty to ask her what her side of the story is. Lang: Hah! Do you really think a criminal would tell us the honest truth? Franziska: How dare you!? As I've said numerous times, there is absolutely no proof that I am the killer! Miles Edgeworth! Don't tell me you suspect me, too!? Edgeworth: I don't. However, I can't ignore the fact that you were in this room at one point in time. Which is why I would like to hear about it from you (changed from [your movements in this room] in the original release). Franziska: Krngh! Edgeworth: Franziska... I feel that I still don't have enough information... ...which is why your testimony is incredibly important to the outcome of this case. Franziska: ............ Alright. So? What would you like me to talk about? Edgeworth: Hmm... I'd like you to please testify to your movements up until you came into this room (changed from [in this room until the murder occurred] in the original release). Lang: Hmph... Alright, let's try this your way for a change. But if what she has to say turns out to be a waste of time... ...I'll place her under arrest faster than you can howl \"Nooooooooooooo!\" Edgeworth: Hmph... As you wish. Testimony -- Movements in Allebahst -- Franziska: As I said earlier, I was assigned to guard duty in the Allebahstian Embassy. After I saw the Steel Samurai off on his way towards the ambassador's office... ...I returned to the rose garden for a bit, and checked up on the security situation. After all the preparations were in place, I was called back by Ambassador Alba to his office. Edgeworth: Franziska, I want us to make this clear from the very beginning... ...so what I wish to confirm is that the only time span in which you were in this office... ...was before the murder occurred. Is that correct? Franziska: Yes, of course. Edgeworth: I see. (For now, the only way that I can see for us to break out of this situation... ...is to ask Franziska about her testimony in more detail.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I thought your duty was to fact-find anything you could about the smuggling ring? Franziska: Yes, that was my job. But upon hearing that the Yatagarasu had sent a calling card to the Embassy... ...Ambassador Alba called upon us to protect the Embassy instead. That incident seven years ago... Or have you forgotten what happened here back then? Edgeworth: Nngh... (Anything related to that case we were involved in appears to be rather painful for her. It's not exactly one I can readily forget myself...) Franziska: Hmph... It looks like you remember the case after all. Edgeworth: Of course I do. Franziska: I inspected every location, every possible escape route... ...and every aspect of the police's security detail. I did all that, then after that... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were at the theater as well? Franziska: Yes, and I suppose you were also there as well, watching that stage show? Edgeworth: Well, yes. (So Franziska was there...) Franziska: Hmph... Well, after the show was over and I saw the Steel Samurai off... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Why did you need to confirm the degree of preparation for even the speech? Franziska: For security's sake, of course. What other reason could I have had? No one knew just how the Yatagarasu had planned on getting in, right? Edgeworth: Yes, I suppose you're right. Franziska: And in the end, the Yatagarasu did choose to appear in the rose garden... Even if it did turn out to be nothing more than a shadow... Arngh... Who would've thought that she would use a shadow!? Edgeworth: Ack! C-Calm down, Franziska! (She must still be nursing a grudge over the fact that she couldn't figure it out herself.) Franziska: Hmph... Anyway, there was no one in the rose garden. And we were aware that the speech was set to start soon thereafter. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: At that time, DeMasque II's body had yet to be found in this room, is that correct? Franziska: That's right. But Ambassador Alba was here. One could hardly miss his rather large presence. Edgeworth: Hmm... Lang: Hmph! A criminal will say anything to get out of getting arrested! How do we know you're not lying!? Franziska: Well, if you need proof, I'd be happy to oblige you. Lang: Seriously!? Franziska: Like I keep telling you... ...when I arrived at this office, Ambassador Alba was already here. He was standing by the flower box on the windowsill, watering his plants. Alba: Ah, I can attest to that. I remember speaking with the lovely lady around that time here in my office. Lang: Grr! Alright, then... Add that statement to your testimony, and let's hear some details. Edgeworth: (So Ambassador Alba was in this room at the time, was he...?) Adds statement \"When I arrived, Ambassador Alba was watering the flowers on the windowsill.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: For the sake of being thorough, I'd like to ask you something. How did you know that Ambassador Alba was watering his plants at the windowsill? Franziska: What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: The entrance to this room is on this side, however, the window is on the opposite side. If what you say is true, then when you entered the room, his body would've been like a wall. He would've been blocking your view of what he was doing. Isn't that not correct? Franziska: I suppose it was a bit hard to see around him. But fortunately for me Ambassador Alba is not an immovable wall. Edgeworth: ...? Franziska: I knocked before I entered, and as I did, he turned around to greet me... ...with a watering can in his hand. So it's only natural to believe that he was watering his plants, right? Edgeworth: I suppose. Franziska: After his greeting, we spent a little time talking about his flowers. He had obtained them himself, and is growing them with the utmost care, you know. Alba: Yes... The plants in this room... They are all like my children. Franziska: The passionflowers in the flower box on the windowsill are growing beautifully, too. All four of them are in full bloom. Edgeworth: ! Ms. von Karma, what did you say just now? Franziska: I said that the flowers are growing beautifully. What about that statement do you not understand? Edgeworth: (What do I not understand? I do not understand why a certain thing is the way it is...) I'd like for you to append that statement to your testimony. Franziska: Very well. Adds statement \"There were four large passionflowers in full bloom in the flower box.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: For the sake of being thorough, I'd like to ask you something. How did you know that Ambassador Alba was watering his plants at the windowsill? Franziska: What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: The entrance to this room is on this side, however, the window is on the opposite side. If what you say is true, then when you entered the room, his body would've been like a wall. He would've been blocking your view of what he was doing. Isn't that not correct? Franziska: I suppose it was a bit hard to see around him. But fortunately for me Ambassador Alba is not an immovable wall. Edgeworth: ...? Franziska: I knocked before I entered, and as I did, he turned around to greet me... ...with a watering can in his hand. So it's only natural to believe that he was watering his plants, right? Edgeworth: I suppose. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'd like to confirm this with you one more time. There were four passionflowers in bloom in that box, correct? Franziska: Yes. I should hardly think I could have miscounted such eye-catching flowers. Edgeworth: (There must be a deeper meaning to this statement. And it appears that I must take a gamble on its meaning for me to make any progress!) Edgeworth: (The Primidux Statues were already switched by the time the murder happened. In light of that fact, what Franziska saw in this room before the crime... ...is of incredible importance!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Kay Faraday\nDescription: Young girl purporting to be the 2nd Yatagarasu.

A country torn in two. One to the west... ...and one to the east. When those which were split are made whole again... ...the truth will reveal itself. I-It's the Yatagarasu! The Yatagarasu's here! Edgeworth: You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! Edgeworth: (It's so nice, almost dreamlike, to finally have the chance to relax and sip some tea. Especially after what a whirlwind the past few days have been.) On my return flight, I was dragged into a case involving an Interpol agent's murder. The next day, I investigated a kidnapping and a murder at the Gatewater Land theme park. And later that night, a detective's dead body welcomed me back to my office... ...along with a thief who was out to pilfer files related to a case from 10 years ago. (How did I manage to find myself in the middle of so many cases back to back? Well, at least I have today. All I ask is that I be allowed to spend it quietly.) ???: Mr. Edgewooooorth! This is big! Big, I tell you! ...Hey, what's wrong with you? Where's your enthusiasm...? Edgeworth: And suddenly, the phrase \"the fragility of dreams\" comes to mind... Kay: What are you talking about, \"fragile dreams\"!? Come on, let's go! The fake Yatagarasu isn't going to just find herself, you know! Edgeworth: Well, if you must know... it's possible that I was paid a visit last night by your \"fake\". Kay: Say what? Edgeworth: ......... Edgeworth: Unfortunately for us, the thief managed to escape. But even now, we're still looking for this criminal. However, I must warn you that we've only had a few hours to search so far... ...so I must insist that you be patient on this one, Kay. Kay: Wh-What's with you today...? Are you sure you aren't sleep-talking to me right now? Anyway, I've got something much more important that I want you to see! Edgeworth: Oh, and that is? Kay: Take a look at this! Edgeworth: \"On March 14th, I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" That's quite a bold declaration to send to an embassy... (I suppose it was inevitable that a newspaper would catch wind of this.) Kay: The date the card mentions is today! Edgeworth: Today, huh... Kay: Come on, we've gotta hurry! The embassy awaits! Edgeworth: I suppose it IS quite an urgent matter... ...however, do you know which country's embassy we should be investigating? Kay: Well, it's some really special country, and I'm actually really fuzzy on the details... But never mind that! Where's all your energy!? Why are you so lackadaisical today!? Edgeworth: I'm not, Kay. You're just too wound up. Kay: Well, then you should get too wound up, too! Because this just might be our chance to catch that woman! Edgeworth: You mean Ms. Yew? (The woman who killed Kay's father, Byrne Faraday, seven years ago... Calisto Yew... She claimed to be the Great Thief Yatagarasu... ...and then disappeared from the courtroom.) Kay: Argh! She makes me so mad! The phony! Everyone knows that the real Yatagarasu would never send something like a calling card! Until a company's underhanded dealings are made public... ...the target is always totally unaware that the Yatagarasu has paid them a visit. That's what makes the real Yatagarasu so awesome! Edgeworth: Hmm... The Yatagarasu's card that's shown in this article... It looks to me as though it could be genuine. Kay: See, that's the thing. Whoever it is, that person isn't the real deal, but has knowledge of the Yatagarasu. If this isn't a clue that that woman's involved, then nothing is! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Out the door you go! Edgeworth: Wait, there are a few preparations I must make before we go... (There's something interesting about this card we found last night here in my office... It's of a different color than the one in the article, which makes me wonder why.) Kay: What's up? Any reason why you're boring a hole through the newspaper with your eyes? Edgeworth: No... No reason at all. Very well. Seeing as how Ms. Yew is also someone of a special nature to me... ...I agree there is some merit to be found in investigating this. Kay: I knew you'd come around! ???: By the light of this night's glorious moon... We are ready! Pink Princess: Ready to embark on our nightly outing. Steel Samurai: And this is where... ...our tale begins! Edgeworth: Heh... What a coincidence. Who would've thought that a Steel Samurai stage show... ...would ever be held at such an elegant theater inside a foreign embassy? Kay: Yeah! The climax was really awesome! \"Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!\" I got chills down my spine when he pulled that move out! Edgeworth: I suppose it really is more impactful to watch a show in person than on television. Kay: I have to say, though, this embassy is set up kinda funny. I mean, they have two countries sharing the same building! Edgeworth: Well, as you said yourself, this place and the countries it houses are very special. Even this theater is special in that it is a neutral zone shared by the two countries. Kay: Umm... So, let me get this straight... The Steel Samurai show just now is being sponsored by one of the two countries. The one that's called the Kingdom of Allebahst, right? Edgeworth: Yes, it would appear that the Steel Samurai is very popular in that country as well. Kay: Seems that way! But you know who I'M really into? The Jammin' Ninja! The Republic of Babahl is sponsoring a Jammin' Ninja stage show! That's something for fangirls like me! We've totally gotta see that too, Mr. Edgeworth! The Jammin' Ninja's show is gonna kick the Steel Samurai show's rear end! Edgeworth: (You know, ever since I first met this girl, I've always had this inkling... ...that what she really wants to be... ...is not a thief, but rather, a ninja...) Kay: So anyway, about today's event... umm... What's it called again? Edgeworth: \"The Kingdom of Allebahst versus The Republic of Babahl Goodwill Jubilee\". The small, European countries of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...and the Republic of Babahl. These two countries used to be a single entity that was abundant with nature. And it was called... the Principality of Cohdopia. .................. Kay: Hm? Is everything alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Yes, I'm alright. Moving on... After a period of civil unrest, the country split in two, though signs of their past remain. For example, their flags preserve the flower and butterfly motifs to this day. ......... (Cohdopia, huh... The KG-8 Incident... and what was referred to as the second KG-8 Incident... ...in which an Embassy staff member was murdered... Both of these cases were related to the Principality of Cohdopia. In the seven years that have passed, the country may have split into two... ...however, the Yatagarasu still sent a calling card here. What could it all mean?) ......... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I know you're thinking about something! Edgeworth: Oh, excuse me. What were we talking about again? Kay: Argh, if you could please stop spacing out on me! Anyway, we were talking about the Allebahst versus Babahl Goodwill Jubilee. The two countries have had a pretty bad relationship with each other... ...but supposedly, they've been trying really hard to make up recently. That's why they decided to hold this event. Edgeworth: (If that's the case, then why the \"versus\"...?) Kay: Also, both countries claim to own the real \"Primidux Statue\", a national treasure to both. They're planning to have them publicly evaluated today, to see which one's the real deal. Edgeworth: Kay, need I remind you to take care and not succumb to your thieving desires? Kay: Well, when it comes to treasure, I can't help myself. You know that! Edgeworth: (Nngh... She had better be saying that in jest...) Kay: Hey! I can read your body language, you know! And you've got it all wrong! Look! I'm here to do some investigating! INVESTIGATING, I tell you! Edgeworth: Heh, I know. And although we don't know if the Yatagarasu will really make an appearance... ...I suppose we should still spend some time examining this place. After examining pamphlets: Edgeworth: I suppose I'll just help myself to one of these... Embassy Guide stuck into the pages of my Organizer. Edgeworth: (Hm? What is all the hubbub?) Ack! Kay: Hey, look! It's the Steel Samurai! And he's got his son, the Iron Infant, with him!! Edgeworth: May I speak with you for a second? (...It's... the Steel Samurai...) Steel Samurai: ......... Edgeworth: ......... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! What are you glaring at him for!? Edgeworth: Ahem, please excuse me. It's just that I've never seen a super-hero up close before. Steel Samurai: ......... Kay: It looks like he's written something down for you! Edgeworth: \"To Edgeworth, From Steel Samurai Daddy: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo\" Kay: Wow, an autograph! Pretty cool that you got one, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Heh... Steel Samurai's Autograph received. Guard: Mr. Steel Samurai! Ambassador Alba is waiting for you! Reporter: And now the Steel Samurai... ...will proceed to enter the Kingdom of Allebahst to shake the hand of the ambassador. The Steel Samurai isn't only here for the two countries tonight... ...but rather, can be thought of as a goodwill ambassador from our own country as well! Kay: There he goes. Off to spread goodwill to the world. Edgeworth: He really does seem like a goodwill ambassador, doesn't he? Cameraman: OK! We're shooting the next segment now! Cue camera! Reporter: In just a few seconds, the Jammin' Ninja stage show is set to begin. After the show, the Jammin' Ninja will enter the Republic of Babahl. He is set to meet with the Ambassador of Babahl at that time. Kay: AHH! The Jammin' Ninja's show is about to start! We've gotta get back to our seats! Edgeworth: Regrettably... I don't have much of an interest in ninjas... Kay: Well, this show will change your mind! Come on, we have to hurry! If we miss even a second of the Jammin' Ninja's awesome playing, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I suppose you're not about to give me much of a choice here, are you, Kay?) Kay: Ahhh! I could listen to that \"A Ninja Marked for Death's Lullaby\" song all day! His superb playing and that sad melody really brought a tear to my eye! And his heart-wrenching voice! Now THAT'S the Jammin' Ninja's greatest weapon! Edgeworth: .................. Kay: Ahh! Those pieces of Jammin' Ninja merchandise over there! I've got to have them! I especially want the hair sticks they're selling exclusively at these shows. They're exactly like the ones the heroine, Princess Misola, wears in her hair! Edgeworth: ...Anyway. Kay: Anyway!? ANYWAY!? Hold it right there, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: You're thinking of going home, aren't you!? Edgeworth: Well, it doesn't seem likely that the Yatagarasu will be making an appearance tonight. Most likely, it was simply a prank. Kay: No way! I just know the Yatagarasu will show! Edgeworth: But I thought you said that the Yatagarasu doesn't send calling cards. Kay: Yeah, I did, but... Edgeworth: I figured from the very beginning that this would wind up being a wild goose chase. Kay: But that card she sent was a genuine fake calling card! Edgeworth: A genuine fake...? Kay: Well, how can I word this...? The Yatagarasu's mark that's on the calling card is exactly the same as my mark. Get it now? Officer: W-We've got a problem! Th-The Yatagarasu has been spotted in Allebahst! Edgeworth: What!? Kay: You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Hah! So you finally decided to show yourself, you phony! Hey, what gives!? Guard: I'm sorry but I will need to search you before you may enter. Kay: What the!? Hey! The Steel Samurai just waltzed straight on through without one! Now if you don't hurry up and let me through, my phony is going to escape! Edgeworth: Kay, a country's embassy is considered to be a part of the country itself. If you don't go through the proper procedures to enter the country... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I'm going to enter through Babahl and climb over the wall into Allebahst! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You would tell a prosecutor straight out that you intend to illegally enter another... Kay, are you listening to me!? Kay: Kay Faraday, and I'm coming through! Guard: Yes, and welcome! Edgeworth: Someone stop her! Anyone! Edgeworth: *huff, huff, huff*... Kay... Where are you? Don't tell me you really did find some way over this fence... Ack! Guard: Fire! This is too big for us to handle! Looks like the Yatagarasu came to Babahl, too! Edgeworth: You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! You had better be alright, wherever you are! Kay: I told you! It wasn't me! Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: *huff, huff, huff*... Kay! Are you alright!? Kay: Do I look alright to you!? Now, can you do something about this woman!? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe! What is the meaning of this!? Gumshoe: *sigh* Well, sir... it's um, this. Edgeworth: He's...! Kay: It wasn't me! He was already dead when I ran in here, hot on the heels of the fake Yatagarasu! Look, I only came in here because I saw a suspicious person at the open-air stage! Edgeworth: A suspicious person? Kay: A long, black coat and a hood over their head -- I dare you to tell me that's not suspicious! When I saw that person, I immediately thought that they must be the fake Yatagarasu. So I chased after them into the Embassy, then into here, and then lost sight of them... But I just KNOW that person is the one who did it! Shih-na: What are you so worked up over? There is no reason for you to be this loud. Edgeworth: Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're Agent Lang's secretary... ...Shih-na, I believe your name is, correct? Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: And if you are making an arrest... ...I assume you have evidence that it was Kay who committed the crime, is that also correct? Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: You refuse to answer!? Shih-na: I don't need to answer. Edgeworth: ! Shih-na: You are merely a prosecutor in this country, meaning you have no investigative authority. Gumshoe: H-Hey, pal! Just what the heck does what you just said mean!? If it happened here, it's under Mr. Edgeworth's jurisdiction. The end. And seeing as how this building is sitting on our soil, we can investigate wherever we'd like! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, Detective, embassies are a different matter. Gumshoe: Huh? Edgeworth: This office is considered to be a part of the Republic of Babahl. Which means that anything that happens in here... ...defaults to the control of the Babahlese government and Babahlese law... ...giving them exclusive extraterritorial rights. Gumshoe: Extraterrestrial (changed from [Extraterristrial] in the original release, correcting the typo) rights? Sir, do you really believe that the truth is out there!? Edgeworth: *sigh* Basically, our country's laws do not apply inside the embassy of another country. That's what was agreed to by our respective governments. Our authority to investigate was effectively nullified the second we entered this place. Which means we can do little here in this situation... Gumshoe: N-No way, sir! Shih-na: Please leave this matter in Interpol's hands and go home. Edgeworth: N...Nnnnngh... Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Kay: H-Hey, you're not...!? Mr. Edgeworth! ???: ???: In that case... allow me to join your investigation. Gumshoe: M-Ms. von Karma! Eeek! Franziska: Ambassador Palaeno, I truly appreciate you allowing me to join the investigation. Palaeno: It's really nothing. Manny was my secretariat, so of course I want to help you as much as I can. In fact, it's a blessing that Interpol agents were able to make it so quickly. Edgeworth: Franziska... Franziska: Well, well. I never imagined that I'd meet you here of all places. This is an embassy, meaning that you have no authority to conduct... Edgeworth: Franziska: A-Already!? What is it!? Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno. Palaeno: Hm? And you are? Edgeworth: I'm Miles Edgeworth, public prosecutor. I ask that you please allow me to investigate this case as Ms. von Karma's assistant. Gumshoe: A...Assistant? Franziska: Miles!? What the heck do you think you're...!? Edgeworth: Please, I implore you, Ambassador Palaeno. Palaeno: Very well. I'll be counting on the two of you, Ms. von Karma and Mr. Edgeworth. Gumshoe: Umm... What did you mean by you'll be Ms. von Karma's assistant...? Edgeworth: I don't exactly have a choice, do I, Detective? If I don't become Franziska's assistant, I can't participate in this investigation. Franziska: Hmph. There you go again, running at the mouth with that aloof expression on your face. Edgeworth: Franziska, please... Franziska: I don't know what you're planning quite yet... ...but at least I do know one thing -- that you are now my subordinate. Just remember that my whip is always ready to wake you, should you have a brain lapse. Edgeworth: Of course. I'll keep that in mind. Shih-na: ...If you are done playing games...! Edgeworth: Right. let's begin the investigation. Edgeworth: By the way, Detective... I suppose it's a bit late to be asking, but why are you here? Gumshoe: Well, better late than never, I guess, sir. I was placed on guard duty for the Babahlese Embassy today! Edgeworth: And why are our police guarding an embassy? Gumshoe: Well, on account of the card they got from the Yatagarasu... ...they called us up and asked for our help, sir. Oh, and because we've been searching for the Yatagarasu these past seven years! It was a more or less mutually beneficial arrangement, if you ask me! Edgeworth: Except for how mutually unbeneficial this has all turned out to be, I suppose. It looks like you failed to competently perform your guard duty yet again. Gumshoe: Ack...! Edgeworth: Look forward to your next salary negotiation... although, it's out of my hands. Gumshoe: But sir! If it gets cut any more, I won't be able to buy even instant (changed from [packet] in the original release) noodles anymore... After connecting \"Locked safe\" and \"Key used at Embassy\" Logic: Edgeworth: We know for a fact that the Yatagarasu's Key was used at this embassy. Furthermore, we found it in the victim, Mr. Coachen's pocket. Which leads me to think that perhaps it is the key to the personal safe in this office. Gumshoe: Good thinking, sir! Let's go try it out! Edgeworth: ...It appears I was correct. (The key that was left to us in the victim's pocket... It literally turned out to be the key to the next piece of the truth!) Hmm... What do we have here? Gumshoe: Hey! There's nothing inside! D-Do you think the Yatagarasu made off with everything, sir? Edgeworth: No, Detective, I believe all we need is a closer look. Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: What is this here? Gumshoe: It looks like the ripped corner of a piece of paper, sir. Edgeworth: No, I don't think it's ripped; it seems more, to me, like it's stuck in the safe. Gumshoe: Hey, you're right! It won't budge an inch, not even when I tug on it! But I don't think I've ever seen paper stuck on the inside of a safe before... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective, I think you have it backwards. It's not the paper that's strange... It's the safe. Gumshoe: What do you mean? Edgeworth: What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that... Edgeworth: Even just eye-balling it, you can see that the inside is a bit too shallow. Furthermore, with the unnatural way the paper is stuck at the back of the safe... ...I'd say that there is an extra bit of space behind the back wall of this safe! In other words, this safe has a second compartment. Gumshoe: Wh-Whaaaaaaat!? Franziska: I suppose that you are correct in asserting that the paper is stuck in an unnatural manner. However, if what you say is correct and there is a second compartment... ...how do we go about opening the door to it then? As you can see, there is no other lock or keyhole in sight. Edgeworth: Actually, there is one more spot of interest to me on this safe. Franziska: Oh? Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe that spot is the keyhole to our mystery second lock! Franziska: The safe and its locks... Alright then, since you are so sure of yourself, show me how you deduced your answer! Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: Doesn't the shape of this keyhole remind you of something, Franziska? Franziska: The shape? It does look very familiar... However, I believe it's simply a latch hole for the safe's lock mechanism. It's just for keeping the door shut, nothing more. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is that so? The person who used this safe... ...Mr. Coachen, made sure this safe had two compartments, in order to hide something. Do you honestly think someone like that would allow the keyhole to the hidden half... ...to look so obviously like a keyhole that even the average person could figure it out? Franziska: ! ...You can't be serious...! Are you saying that this hole is the keyhole to the hidden compartment of this safe? Edgeworth: That's precisely what I'm saying. Franziska: ...! Edgeworth: And I will prove to you right now... ...that the Yatagarasu's Key is the key that will open it! Franziska: Franziska: The Yatagarasu's Key!? Miles Edgeworth! This had better be a very bad joke! Edgeworth: Sorry, but this is no joke. The Yatagarasu's Key... ...is the very key that will open the second compartment of this safe. Franziska: We know that this key opens the first compartment of the safe. But the keyhole you're talking about... ...is of an entirely different shape than that of the key! Leads to examination of Yatagarasu's Key Edgeworth: Let's go over this again, shall we? The Yatagarasu's Key... ...was originally made to open Mr. Coachen's safe in the Cohdopian Embassy. We confirmed that as fact by opening the door to his safe with it. Now, let's take a look at the back end of the key. Looking at the knife portion head on, what do you see? Franziska: What are you talking... Aaah! Edgeworth: It appears that you've come to understand what I'm talking about. When viewed head-on, the knife's blade is the exact same shape as the keyhole! The real function of the knife portion is to act as the key to the hidden portion of the safe. Franziska: B-But that's... preposterous! Edgeworth: Because it looks like a knife and was used like one to kill Mr. Faraday seven years ago... ...we fell under the misconception that it was always meant to be a knife. But for both the safe and its key to conceal such clever tricks... ...whatever is hidden inside the secret section must be of incredible importance. Franziska: .........Then, it's even possible that what I've been searching for is inside! Scruffy! Hurry up and open that safe! Gumshoe: Eeeek! Y-Yes, sir! Opening it now, sir! Edgeworth: These items... They're...! Gumshoe: It's a bunch of funny-shaped things. I guess they're pieces of art, huh, siiiiir!? Franziska: You're in the way! Now, move, Scruffy! Gumshoe: I didn't think I was in the way... *sniffle* Franziska: These pieces of art...! They're identical to ones that have been stolen from various countries around the world! Edgeworth: I figured as much... These are the treasures this section of the safe was to hide from view! Hmm... I believe a more thorough examination is required. Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: Take a good look at these documents, Franziska. Franziska: It says that there are three pages in total, and yet, there are only two here. Edgeworth: Correct. Now take a look at the smuggling activity document in your possession. Tell me, is it not possible that your page was taken from this set of three? Franziska: Well, well... It certainly looks that way. Edgeworth: By putting our multi-part puzzle together, we seem to have arrived at an answer. And it seems that you have now found what you were looking for. Franziska: Yes, and with this, it has become crystal clear... ...that Mr. Coachen himself was responsible for the mass smuggling of Babahlese ink! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink? Franziska: Babahlese ink is a special product of the Republic of Babahl. However, due to a special reason, only a limited volume is ever exported. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And that reason is...? Franziska: That's classified. It's on a need to know basis, and you don't need to know. In any case, it seems that the head of the smuggling ring was our victim, Mr. Manny Coachen. Edgeworth: His base was in an embassy, thus, it was hard for both our country and his to interfere. Making it the ideal conditions under which to run a smuggling operation. Franziska: Argh... but it's so frustrating. I lost the person I was to rain judgment down upon with my Whip of Justice. Edgeworth: Well, even if he is dead, we still have a responsibility to look into his misdeeds. Franziska: You expect me to whip a dead man? ...Well, I'm not interested. Edgeworth: Franziska... You must know... ...that Manny Coachen was the suspect in the KG-8 Incident... Franziska: Of course I know! On top of being the head of the smuggling ring... ...there is the matter of what really happened in that case that needs to be resolved. After connecting \"Motif on knife handle\" and \"Butterfly of Babahl\" Logic, and examining golden statue and knife rack: Shih-na: ...Are you done investigating? Edgeworth: .................. Shih-na: You realize now, don't you? That this girl is the only one it could be. Now come along quietly, Yatagarasu... Kay Faraday. You are under arrest for the murder of Manny Coachen. Kay: M...Mr. Edgeworth! Please, you have to believe me! I didn't do it! I chased the fake Yatagarasu in here... and he... he was already... Shih-na: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'd like to help you reduce the number of mistaken arrests Interpol makes. Shih-na: ...What is that supposed to mean? Edgeworth: I believe I told you that Kay Faraday is not the culprit of this crime. Shih-na: ...Very well. I suppose I have no choice. I'll show you just how foolish your claims are! Shih-na: Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight. Utilizing the confusion caused by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy. Furthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu. And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body. Edgeworth: Your reason for suspecting Kay is because you think she is the Yatagarasu? Shih-na: ...Exactly. But it isn't just me. She calls herself the Yatagarasu. Kay: Argh! Look, how many times do I have to tell you!? I was only out to capture the fake Yatagarasu! Shih-na: Imposter or not... it matters not. A Yatagarasu is a Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: Very well. Then I shall prove that Kay is not the Yatagarasu who killed Mr. Manny Coachen! Shih-na: ...Go ahead and try. Show me what the prosecutors of this country are made of. Shih-na: Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight. Shih-na: Utilizing the confusion caused by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy. Shih-na: Furthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu. Shih-na: She wanted to steal documents regarding smuggling, so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Shih-na: And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body. Edgeworth: (So Agent Shih-na suspects Kay of murder simply because Kay is the Yatagarasu. But if I can prove that the Yatagarasu's goal is not related to murder... ...then I may be able to begin to reason with her!) Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na. I regret to inform you, but there is a flaw in your logic. Shih-na: Oh? Edgeworth: Even if you claim that she is the killer, and the Yatagarasu... ...I am certain that securing the smuggling documents is not the motive behind the murder! The key to the safe in this room was found on Mr. Coachen's body. Furthermore, the Yatagarasu would not be so stupid as to leave without the documents. Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: By the simple fact that the documents were still in the safe when we looked... ...it's obvious that the killer's target was not the safe at all! Shih-na: Shih-na: Then perhaps she didn't know that Mr. Coachen had the key on him. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If that's the case, then why would she have needed to kill him? Because I can think of no reason for her to kill him if she had not known that fact! Shih-na: Shih-na: Need, reason... All of this is simply our conjecturing after the fact. It's entirely possible that she accidentally killed him when she was sneaking him. Edgeworth: .........! Shih-na: Perhaps she didn't notice the safe's second compartment before returning the key. Edgeworth: Arngh! Shih-na: But the fact still remains... that Mr. Coachen was stabbed to death. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But you have no definitive proof that it was Kay who committed the act! Shih-na: Shih-na: ...Actually, I do. I saw her holding the knife she used on the victim with my own eyes. Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? Shih-na: ...Allow me to tell you a bit more about the evidence that will put her away behind bars. Shih-na: The knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife. The knife with the butterfly handle is the murder weapon, which the killer was holding. I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim. The knife is a part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other. The evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument. Edgeworth: Nnnnnrrrrrgh... Th-That is your definitive evidence...!? Shih-na: You see now that she is definitely the killer, right? Kay: No! Mr. Edgeworth, you've gotta believe me! I saw a suspicious person in a long black coat outside the Embassy, I swear! Edgeworth: And you came in here because you were chasing this suspicious person? Kay: That's right. I ran into this office only because I was chasing after that person... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the lights, but then... Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ???: ...Who's there!? Shih-na: This is... Shih-na: I came to this room upon hearing the girl's scream. And when I saw her holding the knife, I immediately restrained her. Edgeworth: So the object Kay felt by her feet on the floor was the murder weapon...!? Shih-na: I had the knife analyzed right away, but we failed to find anyone's (changed from [anyone] in the original release, correcting the typo) prints on it. Kay: But the suspicious person in the black coat who came into this room before me...! Shih-na: Shih-na: You continue to insist there was such a person, but if there was, where did they go? Kay: That... I don't know. But I know they came in here! Shih-na: Shih-na: That sounds like the desperate excuses of a suspected killer, not a trustworthy testimony. You understand, don't you? We can't trust this girl's words, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Gnnrk! (She has a point. Even if Kay's words are the truth... ...I must show that they are with some solid evidence!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I really didn't...! Edgeworth: ! Kay... Don't worry. If you didn't do it, then there must exist a way for me to prove that. Shih-na: Shih-na: Still not giving up, I see. In that case, try to counter my argument, if you can. Edgeworth: Don't worry, I can and I will! Shih-na: The knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife. Shih-na: The knife with the butterfly handle is the murder weapon, which the killer was holding. Shih-na: I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim. Shih-na: The knife is a part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other. Shih-na: The evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument. Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na's proof is the Babahlese knife that Kay was allegedly holding. Gumshoe: Yeah... So, um, how are you going to prove that Kay didn't do it, sir? Edgeworth: If Agent Shih-na wants to suspect Kay merely because Kay was the only one here... ...then I must show with evidence that Kay couldn't have committed the murder! Gumshoe: Um, but do you have such evidence, sir? Edgeworth: Yes. There is one piece of evidence that seems very unnatural to me. ...And I believe it is my duty to point that out to Agent Shih-na. Edgeworth: So the murder weapon was the knife with the butterfly design on it. But is that really the truth? Shih-na: What are you getting at? Edgeworth: I'd like for you to take a look at this. There is blood on the blade, and yet, there's not a speck of blood on the handle. This signifies that at the time of the crime, a different handle was attached to this blade. The knife that Kay was holding... ...had its handle switched, and was, in fact, not the real murder weapon! Shih-na: It wasn't... the real murder weapon!? Edgeworth: This knife can be taken apart. Shall we give it a go? Leads to examination of Babahlese knife Edgeworth: As you can see, the Babahlese knife has now been disassembled into two parts. The killer must have pulled the murder weapon out of the victim's body... ...and proceeded to swap the knife's original handle with this butterfly one. It was all to create the illusion that Mr. Coachen was killed with the butterfly-themed knife! Shih-na: Uurrnngh... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: (This should clear up any and all suspicion surrounding Kay.) Babahlese Knife Handle data jotted down in my Organizer. Shih-na: Your argument isn't airtight yet! Edgeworth: How so? Shih-na: It's possible... that the girl herself is the one who switched the handles. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! For what purpose would she do such a thing!? Shih-na: I don't care to know how a criminal thinks. The way they view the world is beyond the comprehension of a normal person like myself. Therefore, I wouldn't put anything past them, no matter how odd it may seem. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Heh. The truth is right there in front of you, and this knife will show you the way! You will come to see that Kay is not and could not have been Mr. Coachen's killer! Leads to examination of Babahlese knife Shih-na: What is this mark on here? Edgeworth: It's the mark of a flower. I assume you know what this means? Shih-na: No, not really. Butterflies rest on flowers all the time to drink their sweet nectar. Edgeworth: ...And so they do. (However, would this butterfly really drink the nectar of this flower? The answer is clearly... not a chance! Now to prove the relationship between the butterfly and the flower with this!) Shih-na: ! Y-You can't be serious...! Edgeworth: Hmph... It appears that you've made the connection. The flower on this blade is designed after a certain country's national symbol. That's right... The Kingdom of Allebahst. In other words... This blade is from one of Allebahst's ornamental knives! Shih-na: Aah! Edgeworth: This part of the knife handle... ...has Babahl's national symbol of the butterfly on it. Therefore, it is undeniably Babahlese in origin! But as we both know, you can't kill someone with just a knife handle. Incidentally, when exactly did the murder occur again, Agent Shih-na? Shih-na: Ack! After the fire had broken out... Edgeworth: That's right. Kay entered the Babahlese Embassy after the fire had taken place. Furthermore, she had not been to the Allebahstian side of the building before then. On top of that, not a single person passed between the two countries during the fire... ...which means that Kay could not have transported an Allebahstian object over here! This makes it impossible for her to be the true killer! Shih-na: ..................! Gumshoe: Whooooop! Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! What a great victory! Edgeworth: .................. Franziska: .................. Shih-na: .................. Gumshoe: Huh? Hey, why is everyone so quiet...? Edgeworth: (I'm happy we got this far and cleared Kay's name... ...but what worries me now is what will happen next.) Franziska: Franziska: What is the meaning of this!? An Allebahstian knife, here...!? Edgeworth: Do you mean... how did this find its way to the Republic of Babahl? It didn't just find its way over. Rather, we should focus on how it was smuggled over! Kay: You know what!? My brain hurts thinking about it while we're just standing around! Thinking while you're on the run? Now THAT'S the way a real Great Thief operates! Edgeworth: Kay...? Kay: Oh, thanks a bunch, Mr. Edgeworth! For proving me innocent, I mean! You believed in me the whole time, right? Tell me you did! Edgeworth: Umm, not really, but... Kay: Ha ha. Come on, you don't have to be shy about it! Shih-na: Shih-na: ...Your argument is still not airtight. Edgeworth: Would you care to elaborate? Shih-na: I understand now that the girl didn't commit the murder. However, there is still the possibility that she is the Yatagarasu. Kay: That again!? Look, how many times do I have to explain it to you!? I am the real Yatagarasu! I'm not like that fake one that goes around setting fires, OK!? Shih-na: Whether you're the real deal or a fake, it doesn't really matter. All I have to say is this: I have my suspicions that this girl is the one who started the fire. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Preposterous! On what grounds do you suspect her of such a thing!? Shih-na: The fact that she calls herself the Yatagarasu. That in itself is the (changed from [a] in the original release) most elegant proof. Kay: Ms. Shih-na. Shih-na: Yes? Kay: I... have no intention of taking back any of what I've said. Shih-na: ...? Kay: I am the Great Thief Yatagarasu. And I refuse to allow some imposter to claim that name as their own! The path of justice that my father pointed me towards... I will walk it the best I can! Shih-na: It's not good to be so stubborn. I hope you can understand that. Kay: Thanks a lot for the concern, Ms. Shih-na! Let me share something with you, too, as a token of my appreciation! Those sunglasses totally do nothing for you, so I'll steal them from you next time, OK!? Shih-na: Wh--!? Kay: Well, I guess we'd better get going! Franziska: Going...? To where? Kay: To the Kingdom of Allebahst! If we don't go, we won't know for sure, right? Franziska: I suppose not... We won't get anywhere simply by standing here thinking. To see where the Allebahstian knife came from... ...we'll have to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. Let's go, Miles Edgeworth. As you are my subordinate... I will not tolerate you bringing the investigation to a halt. Edgeworth: Hmph... Understood. To be continued MIB: Count off! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! ...1! 1! MIB: Shifu! 99 callouts! So all 99 members are most likely here and accounted for, sir! Lang: ...Hey, you. Yeah, you, the second #1 from my right. Officer: Sir! Yes, sir!? Lang: Here... A birthday present for you. Officer: Wha...?? MIB: Shifu! I didn't know that you knew all of our birthdays...! Officer: What a kind heart you have! Shifu, you are more of a man than we'll ever be, sir! Officer: Umm... I'm really sorry, but it's not my birthday... Lang: Lang Zi says: \"A cub who disrespects others soon feels the disciplinary bite of an elder.\" That present isn't for you. It's for your younger brother's wife's younger brother. ...Tell him I said \"hi\", and \"happy birthday\", won't you? Officer: Y...Yes, sir! MIB: Shifu! I can't believe you remember that much about each of us! Officer: Shifu! I... I'm so moved that I can't stop crying! Edgeworth: (...I should probably leave them to their \"alone time\".) Lang: Alright, meeting's over. Everyone... head for your posts! Dismissed! Sir! Lang: Yo, were you guys there the whole time? I got a call from Shih-na, and she's already filled me in. It sounds like you're out to get in my way again. Edgeworth: I have absolutely no intention of interrupting your investigation. I simply request that you grant me permission to investigate the Allebahstian Embassy. Lang: Hmph. And what if I say no? Franziska: Franziska: Agent Lang! This man is my subordinate. As I have received permission from the ambassador, he is to be extended the same rights. Lang: Sorry, sis, but it's not that simple. Allebahst has the strictest immigration regulations in the world, or didn't you know? Even among my elite men, about only half of them were admitted into the country. Besides, any more cooks in the kitchen, and we might spoil the soup, if you get what I mean. Franziska: How dare you make such assumptions!? Lang: Don't take this the wrong way, but I thought I was in charge of Allebahst, Ms. von Karma. Franziska: Grrr! Lang: Look, try to understand, OK? Things over in Allebahst are a bit of a mess right now. Edgeworth: What do you mean by \"a bit of a mess\"? Lang: No one told you? We had an \"incident\" in Allebahst as well. This is what we call a decision based on the investigation, Mr. Prosecutor. Kay: Look, Wolfy! Just let us in already! ???: ???: Is there a problem here, Agent Lang? Lang: Not really. Just having a \"discussion\" about whether or not to let these guys in. Franziska: Ambassador Alba, I ask that you please allow these people to join the investigation. Alba: Having a debate because of my country... I'm terribly sorry for placing you good people in that kind of situation... It is all because I lacked the strength to govern well. Edgeworth: Please, it is nothing of the sort, Ambassador... Alba: You weakling, Quercus! Curse your frailty and inability to affect change in your country! Edgeworth: Wh-What are you--!? Alba: The thing is, investigations conducted in my country have been under Agent Lang. And it is my judgment that in order to minimize disruption in the investigation... ...I should leave everything up to Agent Lang. Lang: ...There, you see? Kay: Oh, no way! ???: Palaeno: Ambassador Alba, I ask you to please reconsider letting them into Allebahst. Alba: What's that...? Palaeno: My very own secretary has been murdered in the Babahlese Embassy. And he was apparently caught up in some very shady dealings completely unbeknownst to me. So I ask for your cooperation in our investigation. These aren't much, but I hope they can cover your travel expenses to Babahl someday. Lang: Alright, alright. I get it. Even if you beg Ambassador Alba, I still have to give the final OK anyway. Kay: Alright! You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? We're in! Lang: Not so fast, my little crow-girl. You're still a witness in the Babahl murder. So I'd like you to please stay in the Republic of Babahl. Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Please take good care of Kay for me. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Lang: Sounds good to me. The fewer troublemakers, the better. Kay: ......... *rasp!* Gumshoe: *rasp!* Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: So I wanted to ask for a while now, but... ...that lady over there, is she who I think she is!? Edgeworth: Ah, that's right. I didn't introduce the two of you yet. Franziska: Franziska von Karma, the prosecutorial prodigy. ...It's nice to see you again. Kay: Ooh, I knew it! You're the whip lady! Franziska: .........You may address me as Ms. von Karma. Kay: Ms. von Karma, I leave the investigation of Allebahst in your hands! Franziska: Thanks. Rest assured, I will outsmart both the smuggling ring and the Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: (The smuggling ring, huh... Perhaps I should ask Franziska a bit more about them before I head into Allebahst. Ah, and I mustn't forget to thank Ambassador Palaeno for all that he has done for me.) After talking with Franziska von Karma and Colias Palaeno: Edgeworth: Well, shall we get going? ???: Edgeworth: What's wrong, Kay? Kay: I didn't get permission to enter Allebahst... ...so we're going to go gather whatever info we can over on the Babahlese side, OK!? Edgeworth: Alright, I'm counting on you two. Kay: Right, and I'm counting on you and Ms. von Karma to sniff out clues in Allebahst! Oh, and Mr. Edgeworth! If you happen to come across my phony, you let me know, OK!? If you tell me, I'll rush on over straight away no matter where you are! Edgeworth: .................. I'll let you know when the time comes. Edgeworth: (...Hm?) Gwoooooooh! Franziska: What do you think you're doing to my subordinate!? Edgeworth: Y...You're...! ???: Edgey...! Oh, thank the heavens you're here...! I'm in a really, really big pickle, Your Lordship! The Raven, it appeared, poof! And then disappeared, swoosh! And though I am the Steel Samurai, my sword, it... Waaaaaaaaah! I'm so confused, I don't know what anything means anymore! Franziska: Who is this fruitcake!? Larry: I am Larry of the House of Butz: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo, m'lady! Franziska: Now I remember. This... person is one of your friends, isn't he, Miles? Edgeworth: Yes, frighteningly enough... he is. Larry: Hey! What's up with that answer!? Your best bud is in a bind, and you act like it's no big deal! Edgeworth: What sort of \"bind\" are we talking about here...? Larry: The suspect kind! I accidentally became a suspect in a murdeeeeeer! Edgeworth: I see. That is quite the bind. Franziska: ...Not that we're in the least bit surprised. Edgeworth: Yes, I pretty much expected this news... ...from the instant I saw this unlucky face. (His name is Larry Butz. I've known him since grade school, and for as long as I've known him... ...he has been the world's largest source of Trouble with a capital T.) Larry: Hey! What kind of introduction is that!? You're so mean, Edgey! If you're not careful, you might find your tiny number of friends go down by one! Edgeworth: That was uncalled for. Besides, you're............ Wait, hold on. Laaaaaaryyyy! It was you!? YOU'RE the one who wrote my Steel Samurai autograph!? Larry: Hm? Oh, you didn't notice earlier? I even winked at you through my headpiece. Franziska: .........What's going on? And why are you beet-red? Edgeworth: Sorry... but could you not speak to me right now...? ???: Lang: Oh, sorry, am I interrupting your comical, yet melodramatic play? Edgeworth: ! .........Aha. So this is the incident you mentioned earlier. Lang: Mr. Prosecutor, this man... this childhood friend of yours... is our prime suspect. Of what, you ask? Of the murder of a man who had snuck into this embassy, Mask\u2606DeMasque II! Edgeworth: Mask\u2606DeMasque II...? .................. (Only Larry could get himself into yet another mess as fine as this. But no matter what the facts seem to say, Larry is not the type to commit murder. Still, it's a rather daunting stroke of misfortune I've struck. I have to prove... that Larry Butz is innocent of all wrongdoing!) MIB: Shifu! We've identified the victim! Lang: Good work. I'll take that report now. Edgeworth: Agent Lang, would you mind if I took a peek at it as well? Lang: What did I tell you earlier, Mr. Prosecutor? Don't get in my way! There's only enough flesh here to feed one wolf, and that one is me! So, no, you may not take a \"peek\". Edgeworth: But Agent Lang...! ???: Badd: ...Agent Lang. Will you... allow an investigator such as myself... to take a look? Lang: Ah, yes. Of course. ...You, let the detective see the file. Edgeworth: You're... Detective Badd! Badd: You're... the prosecutor, Mr. Edgeworth, right? Edgeworth: Fancy meeting you here, Detective. Badd: You weren't expecting me...? Ever since that day seven years ago... I've chased after the Yatagarasu... non-stop. I even pressured Interpol... into keeping me in the loop... in case a card was ever found. Edgeworth: (What incredible dedication to the case.) Lang: Detective Badd knows the Yatagarasu's M. O. very well. And his passion for the chase hasn't died down in these seven long years. It's something... I can respect. But, Detective Badd, I must ask: are you going to make an ally out of this prosecutor? Badd: My only goal is to arrest the Yatagarasu. If he can get to the bottom of this case, then I'm willing to share info with him. Edgeworth: I am in your debt, Detective Badd. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: In any case, I believe it's high time for me to start my investigation. After correctly deducing spear and golden statue, and examining knife rack, paper in hand, Mask\u2606DeMasque II's head, sword, and flowers on windowsill: Edgeworth: Hmm... I guess that about wraps up my investigation. Hm? That's... Larry: Yo! Pink Princess! How're you feeling? Still feeling ill? Pink Princess: .................. Franziska: ...And yet another strange character comes out of the woodwork. Edgeworth: And so the Pink Princess also comes to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. (I believe I may need to speak with her as well...) After clearing all Talk options with Wendy Oldbag: Officer: Prosecutor von Karma! I've brought the police dog, as you requested, sir! Franziska: Good work. You may leave now, Officer. Edgeworth: Hmm... This dog... Franziska: I requested the assistance of a dog in our search for the Yatagarasu. Lang: Looks like you guys have some pretty bright dogs in this country, too. ???: Woof! Woof! Lang: Hey... You're a real cutie, aren't you? Yeah! That's a good boy! Badd: ...That's the police dog Gumshoe's been taking care of... I think its name is... Missile. Franziska: What a fitting name for a police dog that dashes out in front and attacks. Edgeworth: (That action alone isn't exactly what's going to solve the case for us, you know.) Franziska: Now, Missile. I want you to find some clues! Go! Missile: Woof! Franziska: Good dog. You really are quite bright, aren't you? ...Unlike a certain someone I know. Now, what do we have here? What... is this? It looks like a small hot dog, but... Edgeworth: Hm? Wait, Franziska, isn't that... an official Samurai Dog? Missile: Grrraaaaaaarh! Franziska: Ah! No! Bad Missile! .........He ate it. I wonder if it's alright for him to eat that? Edgeworth: It's just a meat-substance snack featuring the Steel Samurai. I'm sure he'll be fine. Franziska: That's quite a bit of information you gathered there in a single, quick glance. Edgeworth: (We should really be focusing on why there was a Samurai Dog there in the first place.) Franziska: Hm? It looks like that snack wasn't all Missile found. Edgeworth: Oh? And what do we have... here...? Franziska: It appears to be a lady's undershirt. I wonder if Ambassador Alba might have an interest in cross-dressing? Edgeworth: I somehow doubt that. It doesn't look like the shirt would even fit him. (A Samurai Dog and a lady's undershirt... What are these two items doing in a room like this? Given the circumstances, the lady's undershirt could only belong to one person. I suppose I should get this over with and ask the owner of said undershirt about it...) Lady's Undershirt data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: If you could please take a look at this brown-colored undershirt... Oldbag: Oh, Edgey-poo... What is the meaning of this!? Edgeworth: ? Oldbag: Why did you steal that thing from my bags...? All you had to do was ask, and I would've gladly given you as many as you'd like! Edgeworth: Nnnrghk! Th-Thanks, but no thanks! This shirt was found here at this crime scene. Oldbag: What!? Edgeworth: Come now, why don't you just confess... and explain what it's doing here. Oldbag: I know nothing! NOTHING, I tell you! Edgeworth: What!? Oldbag: Oh, I admit that I used the fireplace to dry that shirt! But I can't really help the fact that I had to, you know! Wearing that Pink Princess costume was like being in a sauna! And on top of that, I get fingered as a suspect!? You're too cruel, Edgey-poo! Edgeworth: Are you claiming that you never once set foot inside this room? Oldbag: Of course I am! If I had been the one to find the body, do you think I'd be as calm and relaxed as I am!? I tell you, it's always like this! It's always my fault for some reason or another. That weekly tabloid article is missing? The camera is missing? That lawyer always makes sure it's my fault they're missing. Speaking of missing, there's the matter of my husband. Can you believe when we got married, he said, \"I guess I'm stuck marrying you.\" What kind of way to propose is that!? What he should've done is he should've whispered in my ear, \"I don't deserve you... but I can't help it. Will you marry me?\" Honestly, men these days! Edgeworth: Umm... Well... (I don't believe she is lying about her actions... So I can safely assume she really was drying her shirt by the fireplace on her break. And somehow, the undershirt managed to move from the next room into this one (Undershirt from next door - The undershirt was found in the office fireplace, but how did it get there?)...) I assume the Samurai Dog was also yours...? Oldbag: Ah, that brilliant mind of yours. You really can see through everything about me! Edgeworth: (And so the feeling of dread continues... But I suppose I should ask for more details...) After connecting all possible Logic and clearing \"Samurai Dogs\" Talk option with Wendy Oldbag: Edgeworth: (It would appear that the answer has made itself known.) Lang: You're making quite a confident face there, Mr. Prosecutor. Bring it on! I'm ready to counter any argument you may have! Edgeworth: Very well, then. If you are prepared... ...I'll show you exactly where my deductions have led me! Larry: Good! I'm counting on you, Edgey! Edgeworth: Leave it to me, Larry. My first attack will be... to expose your lie for what it really is. Larry: M-My liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!? Edgeworth: I know that there is still something you are keeping from the rest of us. Larry: Wh-What's wrong with you!? Why is it you won't believe me no matter what I say, Edgey!? Curse you! I should just hurry up and die already if that's how it's gonna be! I'll confess to every murder in the whole world, and then kill myself... ...and throw everything into mass confuuuuuuuuusion! Lang: Heh, you made some wonderful friends as a child, I see. Edgeworth: Larry, I only have one thing to say to you. Larry: Even if you make that face at me, it's no use! A man who is ready to die is strong-willed, you know! Edgeworth: Larry, it doesn't matter what sort of harebrained trouble you've caused... ...I only ask that you do not lie to me. If you cause an innocent person to be judged unfairly because of some insipid lie... ...I will never forgive you! Larry: E...Edgey... Edgeworth: Although, allow me to say... ...that I consider you to be among the innocent in this case. And that I will draw the real killer out. You can trust me on this. Larry: Alright. I... I... This time... This time, I'll tell you the whole truth, OK!? What happened, what didn't happen, the works! Edgeworth: Just what happened will do! Now then, if you would please testify as to what you did up on the roof tonight. Larry: After the show, I left the pushcart in the Rose Garden, and came into the embassy. Then, they took a picture of me shaking hands with the ambassador. After that, and until my next appearance, I had some free time, so I wandered around. That's when I spotted the chimney. A chimney like that is a rare thing, you know. So then, I wanted to play Santa and decided to give it a try. Edgeworth: Larry, I thought I just finished telling you to not lie anymore. Larry: Umm......... But it's... kinda, ultra-embarrassing. Edgeworth: And what exactly is so ultra-embarrassing that you can't tell me!? Larry: Edgey, man! I just said it was embarrassing, so of course I can't just blurt it out! So you're just gonna have to reason it ouuuuuuuuuuuuut of me! Franziska: As your superior, I command you to hurry up and expose this man's lie! Edgeworth: I have every intention to, for I'm not about to let us waste time on such a trifling matter. Larry: After the show, I left the pushcart in the Rose Garden, and came into the embassy. Larry: Then, they took a picture of me shaking hands with the ambassador. Larry: After that, and until my next appearance, I had some free time, so I wandered around. Larry: That's when I spotted the chimney. A chimney like that is a rare thing, you know. Larry: So then, I wanted to play Santa and decided to give it a try. Edgeworth: As I suspected, you do have something to hide, Larry. But what could be so embarrassing that you'd be willing to go to jail for it!? Franziska: This man's mind is a complete mystery to me. Edgeworth: I believe it's a secret to everyone of a normal mindset how Larry's mind works. However, taking into account his usual, women-obsessed way of thinking... ...I believe that his lie this time is also related to a woman, and this is what I intend to prove. Edgeworth: Actually, I believe in the case of this man, playing Santa is actually quite a big deal. Lang: Are you saying that your buddy isn't exactly made of Santa-quality stuff? Edgeworth: Precisely. You hit the nail on the head, Agent Lang. Larry: Hey, Edgey! That's so incredibly mean! Edgeworth: Tell me something, Larry. Did you know that Santa's job is to deliver presents to people all over the world? Larry: Of course I know that! I DID graduate from junior high, you know! Edgeworth: In that case, it's your turn to tell me something. I want you to tell me to whom you were delivering a present to. Larry: Umm... I was, ah... delivering a present to a child not basking in the warm glow (changed from [glow] in the original release) of love? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That must be the most elegant description of you I've ever heard, but a lie is still a lie. Larry: Y-You sure know how to kick a guy when he's down, you know that!? Edgeworth: In any case, the person you wished to deliver a present unto was most certainly this! Lang: Heh, interesting tastes you have there, Mr. Suspect. Larry: D-D-Don't spread lies about me! I totally didn't want to see Ms. Oldbag so much that I'd try to go down a chimney! Owww! Franziska: I advise you to stop right there in your bashing of a lady. Edgeworth: Well, I must admit that I, myself, hardly ever have the want to run into that lady. However... what if you were misinformed, and under the wrong impression? Then what? Lang: Define \"wrong impression\". Edgeworth: I simply mean that the man before you thought to enter the old lady's room... ...without knowing one very important fact. And that fact... is best summed up with this! Edgeworth: This is something the old lady received from her employer for the night. The girl who normally plays the Pink Princess... Mindy, was it again? It seems that this man is quite taken with that actress. Larry: Larry: But that's not true, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...? Larry: She's the one with the hots for me! I just know it! I can feel her sexy beam piercing my heart when she's watching me! Seeeeeexy beam, I tell you! Franziska: You filthy, despicable, inconsiderate, fickle, idiotic, cowardly... ...apparition of a man! You haven't matured at all since we last met! Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: Yes? Lang: This guy... He's got bigger problems than just getting involved in murders, I take it? Edgeworth: I suppose you could put it that way. Larry: Hey! What the heck, man!? I don't get you guys at all! Why do you all have to make me out to be some sort of bad guy!? Edgeworth: To return to the original topic, I propose that at least this much has been made clear. Without any knowledge that Ms. Mindy had fallen ill... ...Larry tried to make his way into the Pink Princess's room. That much we know for sure! Larry: Larry: Hey, Edgey... Looks like I've got the hang of this court thing now. Edgeworth: But we're not in court at the moment... Larry: Shut up! I see what's going on here, and it looks just like what you do in court! Lang: I guess old boy here still has something he'd like to say. Lang Zi says: \"Until the root of the tongue dries, one never knows the whole truth.\" You shouldn't form conclusions until everything is out in the open, which is why I'll listen. Larry: Alright! Then get ready to listen to me defeat Edgey in a battle of wits! Edgeworth: (Larry, have you forgotten that should I \"lose\", your victory prize will be your arrest?) Larry: So you think that all I wanted to do was to go visit Mindy? Well, I dressed up as Santa and climbed up to the chimney, but the smoke was really thick. It was a case of mistaken identity, and that mistake made me late for the speech. Then, to top it all off, I became a suspect in a murder. THAT'S what you really meant. But why would I ever put myself through so much humiliation on purpose!? Edgeworth: .................. Lang: .................. Larry: ..................Hey! Someone say something! Edgeworth: Larry, are you seriously trying to submit this, not as a confession, but as testimony? Larry: So what if I am!? Is there something wrong with that!? My claim is a claim claiming my claim. Do you have a problem with that!? Oldbag: So it was you! You're my stalker! But I should warn you, it doesn't matter what kind of flattery you throw at me. I'm the devoted type of woman who's wholly focused on one man, and one man only! And as long as Edgey-poo is alive, I can't just drop him and be unfaithful! No, I can't! Although, earlier, I was tempted just a tiny-winy bit by that wolf-man! But that was just a test of my love for my dear Edgey-poo, which I passed with flying colors! But from now on, I will stay completely true to my beloved Edgey-poo for the rest of eternity! I swear it! Larry: Aaaaah! I-I'm so inspired! Franziska: You're such an inconsiderate, cowardly, idiotic, and all-around completely worthless man! Edgeworth: (I thought I heard something ominous just now, but perhaps it was just my imagination.) I believe there is nothing further for me to prove at this point... Larry: What do you mean!? Of course you've still got something to prove! You still have to show some proof that I was trying to meet up with Mindy! Edgeworth: \"Proof\", you say? Larry: Remember, Edgey!? Everything is evidence in court, right!? Edgeworth: You mean, \"Evidence is everything in court,\" Larry, but I understand your point. Larry: Yeah, see! I'm totally a pro at this now! Edgeworth: Very well. If you wish to see the evidence... ...then let me show you the last piece of evidence you'll ever wish to see. Larry: So you think that all I wanted to do was to go visit Mindy? Larry: Well, I dressed up as Santa and climbed up to the chimney, but the smoke was really thick. Larry: It was a case of mistaken identity, and that mistake made me late for the speech. Larry: Then, to top it all off, I became a suspect in a murder. THAT'S what you really meant. Larry: But why would I ever put myself through so much humiliation on purpose!? Edgeworth: (This whole testimony is one giant confession of all that he's done tonight. He's practically begging me to show why he bothered to put himself through all of this.) Edgeworth: Larry, don't even think about denying that you have knowledge of this letter. Larry: H-H-H-H-H-Hey! Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Why are you showing that thing to me!? Franziska: \"W\u00e9ndy, I'll be descending on you from above tonight. Your loving knight\" Well, isn't that just romantic? Edgeworth: But you weren't able to \"descend on her from above\", were you... Mr. Loving Knight? Larry: Aaaaaaaaaaaarghn! I-I have no idea what you're talking about! I don't remember a thing! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You can pretend to be ignorant all you'd like, but it's written right here. This letter proves that you were not out to meet the old lady... ...but rather, that you were attempting to pay Ms. Mindy a visit! (What part of this letter shows that the person Larry had intended to meet was Mindy?) Edgeworth: Larry, I suggest you take up penmanship lessons. That is... ...if you never wish to experience this level of embarrassment ever again. Larry: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the heck!? What are you talking about!? Speak English! Edgeworth: You wrote \"Mindy\" so sloppily that it became \"W\u00e9ndy\" to the average eye. Larry: ...Hey, stop picking on me... It's so embarrassiiiiiiiiiing! Lang: There, there. Isn't that what childhood friends are for? They're the best, aren't they? ...For punching. But that will have to wait until we're off of this crime scene. Larry: Eek! Edgey! Save me from the scary man! Edgeworth: Sure, if you're willing to make amends. Starting with your incredibly embarrassing mistake! Larry: .........That... That... That wasn't me! Edgeworth: Come again? Larry: It's a fake! Someone's out to get me, so they made that fake letter... ...to set me uuuuuuuuup! Franziska: Accept your defeat graciously! Larry: But... you guys are being so mean... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Penmanship analysis. Larry: What's that? Edgeworth: No matter who, all people have certain unique features to their handwriting. Ergo, all we have to do is compare the handwriting in this letter to a sample of yours... ...and we'll know soon enough who it was that sent this letter. Larry: I...I...I... I'll never write another thing in my life! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Tsk, tsk, tsk... It's no use, Mr. Loving Knight. For you've already graciously provided me with a sample of your handwriting! Edgeworth: This autograph and our mysterious letter... If we compare the handwriting, we'll know the answer to our questions soon enough. Larry: Gnn...nnn... Nnnnnnnn...! Edgeworth: Confess now, Larry... to your miserable failure! Larry: I...I'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorry! I... I... I did it... It was me causing trouble again... I admit it. You hit the nail right on the head... Edgey... Edgeworth: (So, he finally confesses...) Larry: I saw the Pink Princess being carried around in a stretcher, and got worried, alright!? I wanted to go into Mindy's room, but the doctors wouldn't let me in. So what choice did I have!? It was the chimney or bust, Edgey! Franziska: Your mind jumped from the door to the chimney? What a criminally overactive imagination. Larry: Well, at least I was honest and wrote Mindy a letter, and stuck it under the door. That way, she wouldn't be so shocked when I came down through the chimney! Edgeworth: (Except for the fact that the letter was an utter failure at conveying said sentiment...) Larry: I'm really, really sorry... Edgeworth: Larry, you may be a shameful, good-for-nothing blight on the face of humanity... ...however, I always knew you weren't the killer. I told you to trust me... ...because, at the very least, I can attest to that about you. Larry: Edgey... You're... Aaaack! Franziska: We've lost a lot of valuable time because of you...! Larry: Owwwwwwwww! Franziska: In any case, I believe we can say that we now know exactly what happened. Mr. Larry Butz sought to climb down the chimney... ...not for access to the crime scene... ...but to enter the room of the elderly lady next door. Lang: Lang: Great job, Mr. Prosecutor. Although, I still find it a bit unbelievable that the two of you are friends. Edgeworth: .................. Lang: But the suspicion on that guy over there... ...isn't completely resolved yet, so don't get any funny ideas about running off, OK? Larry: Owwwww...w? H-Hey... What--? Edgey... What does the wolf-man mean when he says I'm not off the hook yet? Edgeworth: .........He means the murder weapon. Larry, did you forget? There are two layers of suspicion hanging over your head. Lang: That's exactly what I mean. We can't only rely on the words of the suspect, after all. We may have figured out where he was and what he was doing all night... ...but the blood-stained Samurai Sword that was left at the crime scene... As long as there is no satisfactory explanation for that... ...this wolf will refuse to ease up on his bite! Larry: Eeeeeek! Edgey! That guy... He looks like he's seriously about to take a bite out of me! Edgeworth: I'm well aware. And you should be as well, that this upcoming battle will be crucial. Lang: Thanks to the cooperation of our lovely bumbler... ...I've been dealt a very nice hand, and a sweet trump card. Looks like we're about to enter the final bout! Now, Mr. Prosecutor! Let's see what you've got! Edgeworth: (I can easily point out the contradiction in the supposed \"murder weapon\"... ...but the real problem for me is figuring out what the real murder weapon is. This will be a high-stakes gamble! But this is one game I can't afford to lose!) Lang: I was the one who found the body of the victim, DeMasque II. Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood. It was supposed to be in the Steel Samurai's dressing room, but I found it here instead. Plus, I found the murder weapon's owner, the suspect, Larry Butz in here, too. Edgeworth: Isn't it a bit far-fetched to accuse someone simply on the basis of ownership? Lang: But this owner wanted to sneak onto the crime scene. I think that's plenty to go on, don't you? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you're alluding to his reason for being by the chimney, we've already established that! Lang: Lang: Hold on there, Mr. Prosecutor. You two are long-time friends, right? Who's to say you didn't fabricate the evidence to give him an alibi? Edgeworth: .........You're accusing me of fabricating evidence? Lang: You think I can believe anything you produce? Forging evidence is all you prosecutors do! Edgeworth: .........! (This man has some serious issues with prosecutors...) Larry: But come on, I can't think up something as complicated as that! Right, Edgey!? Edgeworth: Larry, I can agree because I know you and your personality well. However, Agent Lang knows nothing about you... or me, for that matter. (I sense his hatred for my entire profession emanating from his entire being. Meaning that the only way I can prove Larry's innocence is to present irrefutable evidence.) Lang: I was the one who found the body of the victim, DeMasque II. Lang: Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood. Lang: Beside him was the Samurai Sword... covered in the victim's blood. Lang: I suspect he beat the victim to death with that thing. Lang: It was supposed to be in the Steel Samurai's dressing room, but I found it here instead. Lang: Plus, I found the murder weapon's owner, the suspect, Larry Butz in here, too. Edgeworth: (It's simply not possible that the Samurai Sword is the real murder weapon. So I should focus on proving that point to Agent Lang first.) Edgeworth: Do you know what this is, Agent Lang? Lang: Heh, it's a long spear, right? We used to use those a lot in my country a long time ago. Piercing, mowing people down... Spears are the weapon of heroes throughout history. Franziska: It's the next most effective weapon after the whip. Edgeworth: (I think the whip is in a slightly different category...) Lang: So, what's your point? Are you going to tell me that the spear is the real weapon? Edgeworth: No. I simply want you to take a look at this section here. Lang: The way it's bent...? Edgeworth: Precisely. Apparently, a certain troublemaker hit it against a wall in this embassy earlier. And as you can clearly see, the insides of the Steel Samurai's weapons are hollow. In other words, they're replicas that aren't strong enough to deliver a damaging blow... ...let alone the multiple strikes necessary to bludgeon someone to death. And yet, there is not even a dent in the Samurai Sword. How do you explain that!? Lang: A...Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Larry: Oh, yeah... The sword and the spear are made of the same stuff, so they bend easily! But I wish they'd make them out of better stuff! Because the spear got bent... ...I wasn't able to do my special \"Early Summer Rain Jab!\" move! Man, I got such an earful from the director of the play for not doing it in the show! Edgeworth: (The Steel Samurai's special move was changed tonight because of him...!?) Samurai Spear data updated in my Organizer. Larry: Yeoooooooooowch! Franziska: That's more than enough of your whiny whimpering! Now... back on the topic of the spear. Edgeworth: Yes, let's return to the real topic of discussion. (This is where the real gamble begins. I don't have a real strategy, per se... ...so all I can do for now is let the chips fall where they may.) Franziska: Using guesswork and taking risks in place of real logic is hardly the Von Karma way. It's neither smart nor very clever. Edgeworth: Ms. von Karma, as you know, unlike your father, I am not a genius prosecutor. Plus, I doubt his record of a 40-year win streak will ever be broken. Franziska: .................. Edgeworth: But perhaps, it is for the best if it remains unbroken. For no one should've conceived of the notion to \"convict all defendants\" in the first place! Franziska: Franziska: What a foolishly foolish statement from a foolish fool who hates to lose... It's the job of a prosecutor to make sure that all defendants are found guilty in court. There is nothing more important in this world than a perfect victory! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That may be your opinion, however, I don't believe that's all we are. Lang: .........! Edgeworth: As a prosecutor, what I pursue is not the perfect victory, but the perfect truth. And if that means that the bridge I must cross will crumble beneath my feet... ...then let it crumble as I walk on towards the truth! Lang: Lang: You're good at keeping me entertained, Mr. Prosecutor! But you know... humans are delicate creatures. The slightest bump and we expire. I'd like you to consider, if you will, the possibility that... ...the sword was used in such a way that the attack killed DeMasque II without bending it. Edgeworth: .................. Lang: So, what do you think of my hypothetical scenario? I think you know what to do here, right? And what you need! Edgeworth: Of course. (What I need is evidence even he (changed from [Agent Lang] in the original release) can't refute! This is it! It's time to bring this to a close!) Lang: It's possible to use the Samurai Sword to kill someone. And under these circumstances, it's the only logical conclusion. We searched the Embassy, top to bottom, but the victim's blood is only on that weapon. So isn't it only natural that suspicion would fall onto the owner of said weapon? Edgeworth: How long do you intend to cling onto that preposterous theory? Lang: As long as I want, because we examined every corner within the walls of this Embassy. There's no stone we've left unturned! And we have managed to come up with only one logical conclusion! That the only place inside this embassy with the victim's blood on it is this sword. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You left no stone unturned? Is that a fact? Lang: Lang: If you've got something to say, then say it in the only way I respect, Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: Yes, of course. In that case, allow me to make it all crystal clear for you! Lang: It's possible to use the Samurai Sword to kill someone. Lang: And under these circumstances, it's the only logical conclusion. Lang: We searched the Embassy, top to bottom, but the victim's blood is only on that weapon. Lang: So isn't it only natural that suspicion would fall onto the owner of said weapon? Edgeworth: ...I can prove to you... the possibility that the murder weapon is something else... ...but I cannot do so on my strength alone. Franziska: Franziska: Miles Edgeworth. What are you running straight into a quagmire for? I thought you said that you were busy in pursuit of the perfect truth. And if that's the case, then show me this perfect truth, if it exists at all! Edgeworth: Don't worry. Thanks to you, I've already prepared myself to do just that. Franziska: There's no need to thank me. I'm simply doing what any good superior would. Edgeworth: Heh... I suppose you are. Very well, then. I will show you the possibility of a different murder weapon. Edgeworth: If you believe that there is no other door of possibility left to open... ...then allow me to force one open for you! Lang: Lang: Hmph! And how do you plan to do that? Edgeworth: By showing you what may possibly be the real murder weapon. Lang: Lang: Ha! Ha ha ha ha! The \"real\" murder weapon? I hate to repeat myself... ...but my men have already searched every last inch of this embassy! And they've concluded that nothing else could've been used as the weapon! Knowing these facts, do you still want to press forward with your little hypothesis? Edgeworth: Of course. Because it's not possible that your men inspected everything in their investigation. Lang: Lang: What are you talking about!? I don't appreciate mind games, and I don't appreciate it when people like you slander my men! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not slandering them, I assure you! I'm merely pointing out that their investigative dragnet has a few holes in it! Namely, that there is something your men couldn't even lay a finger on. And that item is the real murder weapon! Lang: Aaaaaaaalright then! I'll play along for now! This \"real\" weapon that killed DeMasque II... What exactly is it!? Edgeworth: The real murder weapon, which not a single person has yet to touch, is this! Edgeworth: .........The national treasure of Allebahst. Lang: Lang: You mean the Primidux Statue? Edgeworth: Yes, and as you know, only the ambassador and his secretariat may touch it. Which, I believe, means that neither you nor your men were able to examine it, correct? Lang: Lang: Ha... ha ha ha ha... You know very well that if we did that, there'd be an international incident... ...between the Kingdom of Allebahst and the Republic of Babahl. The two countries' precarious relationship teeters in the balance... ...over a stupid fight related to a sovereignty statue! But I'll be damned if I let something go unexamined! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang, if you could take a look at this... The direction the statue is facing just before and after the crime are different...! And there is only one conclusion I can draw from that. Lang: .................. Go look for Ambassador Alba, and get him to give us the OK to examine the statue. MIB: Shifu! You can't listen to this infidel's words! He is most definitely trying to trick you! Shifu! Please, let's be rational about this! Lang: Grr! Lang Zi says: .........Just go already! MIB: Y-Yes, sir! MIB: Shifu... Lang: Yeah? MIB: I'm really sorry, sir, but I was unable to convince the ambassador. I was unable to obtain permission for us to examine the Primidux Statue. Lang: ...Hmph. I see. Franziska: Wait...! But then, the investigation is at a standstill! Agent Lang! I will go and speak with the ambassador personally! Lang: Save your breath. He may act all weak and frail, but that old man's one tough cookie. But I guess you've gotta be tough when you're representing a whole country, you know? Edgeworth: Agent Lang... Lang: What do you want? Let's just hurry up and examine the statue already. MIB: Wh--!? But Shifu! What about causing an international incident!? Lang: Quiet! I'll take the fall if I have to later! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang, the hypothesis is mine, so if someone is to take the responsibility, let it be me! Lang: Responsibility? If we're going to talk in such heavy terms, maybe I should let you. It'd be a real problem for my men if something were to happen to me. Alright then... Less talk and more investigating! Edgeworth: (If we want to know the truth, we can't stop here! Action must be taken!) Agent Lang, I'd like to run a Luminol chemiluminescence test on the statue. Lang: A Luminol test...? Ah, good thinking. If the statue is the murder weapon, then some of the victim's blood should be on it. Okaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! Let's get the forensics team in here! Lang: Heh! Looks like you hit the jackpot, Mr. Prosecutor. I guess this means that this is the real weapon that killed DeMasque II. Edgeworth: Indeed...! Lang: But I wouldn't celebrate yet if I were you. This doesn't let your friend off the hook. It doesn't prove that he didn't kill DeMasque II, so the charge remains! Edgeworth: ...We are hardly done examining this statue, Agent Lang! Knowing that it IS the real weapon, I believe further examination is required. Lang: Hah, you think so? OK then, knock yourself out! Leads to examination of Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: ...Nngh. Lang: And what do we have here? This dirty smudge... It looks like... a handprint? Heh heh heh heh... Haaa hahahahahahaha! What's a definitive bit of evidence like you doing under here!? Looks like we've got some fingerprints to analyze! Edgeworth: Gnrk! (Worst case scenario, these prints belong to Larry... But it looks like it's too late for me to do anything about that now...!) Lang: Hey! Forensics guy! I want results on these fingerprints ASAP, you hear me!? Forensics: Agent Lang! I have the analysis results, sir! Lang: Good! And!? Forensics: Sir! About the prints we lifted from the bottom of the statue... Well, um... You know the victim of the murder in the Babahlese Embassy...? The prints belong to him, to Mr. Manny Coachen, sir! Lang: But that's--! Wh-What's going on around here!? Edgeworth: No... That's... impossible! (Each Primidux Statue can only be handled by someone of that country. But by the very fact that Mr. Coachen's fingerprints are on this one... ...it leads me to only one conclusion...!) This statue... is actually Babahl's Primidux Statue! Franziska: Impossible! It can't be...! Lang: A...! Aaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiya! Edgeworth: (Larry never once set foot on Babahlese soil, so he was free to go... However... this new piece of information only served to confuse us even further. The ringleader of a smuggling operation was killed with an Allebahstian knife in Babahl... ...and DeMasque II was killed on Allebahstian soil with Babahl's national treasure... ...and the mystery of the Great Thief Yatagarasu, who visited both countries. The pieces were there, but I had yet to see the big picture they were to form.) To be continued Edgeworth: (I've left the DeMasque II investigation to Franziska and returned to Babahl. I suppose my first order of business should be to look into Babahl's statue...) Kay: Mr. Edgewoooorth! Edgeworth: So, Kay, what's the situation? Kay: Oh, it's great! Investigating is so much fun! Edgeworth: (...In other words, they've made absolutely no progress.) Gumshoe: W-We weren't goofing off! Honest, sir! We've been investigating our hearts out! Edgeworth: Very well, then. Would you care to give me an update on your investigation? Gumshoe: ...Ummmmm... Oh! We've had a really fun time, sir! Edgeworth: (I knew it. Zero progress...) In any case, Detective Gumshoe... Gumshoe: Yes, sir? Edgeworth: You have permission to enter the Allebahstian Embassy, is that correct? Gumshoe: Yup! As a local detective, I'm helping out with investigations on both sides, sir! Edgeworth: Good. In that case, I can leave these... pieces of evidence with you. They belong to the lady under the Pink Princess's mask. Gumshoe: The Pink Princess? What kind of lady was playing her, sir? Edgeworth: The kind that was also playing the role of the Pink Badger yesterday. Gumshoe: Ugh! Ooonnngh... Understood, sir... If I happen to run into her, I'll give them back to her. And if I don't... then I guess I'll unload them somewhere... Edgeworth: (He doesn't seem all that enthused to go find her, but I can't blame him.) Evidence that has lost their value given to Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: Now then, I don't believe I'll be needing this anymore either. Kay: Whaaaat!? Are you really going to throw that autograph away!? Edgeworth: Yes, because that Steel Samurai was a fake. Steel Samurai's Autograph scrunched up into a ball and disposed of. Kay: Wait, what? What do you mean by \"fake\"? Edgeworth: (Now then, I believe it's time for a little housekeeping.) Unnecessary evidence has been removed. Remaining evidence has been re-arranged. After clearing Talk option with Dick Gumshoe and presenting Babahl's Primidux Statue or Allebahst's Primidux Statue to Colias Palaeno: Kay: Hey, where are you going? Are you heading back to Allebahst? Edgeworth: Yes, but before I do, I suppose I should give you a summary of what's happened. Kay: ...Oh, I see. So there's been a murder in both countries using an object from the other country...? Edgeworth: That's the gist of it. Babahl is just as strict as Allebahst... ...in their inspection of the people and things that enter their country. Meaning that somehow, both murder weapons were smuggled into the two countries. That's the only logical conclusion that can be drawn. Perhaps the key to the weapon smuggling is the person who traversed both countries... Kay: You mean the fake Yatagarasu!? Edgeworth: In one way or another, the Yatagarasu is connected... Of this I am sure! Now then, where was the Yatagarasu first spotted? Palaeno: I believe it was the rose garden on the Allebahstian side of the embassy. The garden is just on the other side of this boundary. It's where Ambassador Alba was to give a speech tonight. At least, that's where I heard the Yatagarasu had appeared. Edgeworth: In that case, I believe it's vital that I investigate the rose garden posthaste. Kay: Wait, before you go... Take a look at this, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What... is it? Kay: My guess is that it's a guitar pick. I picked it up just now over there. Do you think it'll be of any use? Edgeworth: (There is a little water on it... but how did the water get on it? It doesn't look like there's anything it could get wet from around here...) Kay: I was thinking, they have concerts here at this open-air stage from time to time, right? Edgeworth: Alright, I'll find its owner later... Pick data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Oh, yeah! There's one more thing... Mr. Edgeworth, would you be willing to hold onto this? Edgeworth: What is this? Kay: It's Ms. Yew's perfume. It's the bottle that woman left behind and that I found seven years ago. I thought that one day, it'd be of some use in tracking her down... ...so I kept it safe all this time. Edgeworth: Thank you. I'd be honored to hold onto it for you. Ms. Yew's Perfume data jotted down in my Organizer. Theatrum Neutralis Open-air stage (before approaching door on left side in Theatrum Neutralis) ???: I see you're back, Miles Edgeworth. How are things in Babahl? Although, I can't really say I expect much from Scruffy and that girl. Edgeworth: The investigation into Manny Coachen's death hasn't really progressed any... ...however, the investigation into the Yatagarasu has. Franziska: Ah, yes, the Yatagarasu. Even now, I find it hard to believe. A person who can freely traverse between the two countries at will? Preposterous. Edgeworth: Well, that's what I came here to investigate. I heard that this is where witnesses claim to have seen the Yatagarasu. Franziska: That's correct. Ambassador Alba was to give a speech tonight here in Allebahst. And that's when the Yatagarasu appeared. The shadow of the mysterious thief appeared, and just as suddenly, it vanished... After that, there was the fire at the Babahlese Embassy that the Yatagarasu started. Edgeworth: (I vow that not a single feather from the Yatagarasu shall escape my diligence!) After clearing Talk option with Shi-Long Lang and examining statue of man, pool, and statue of woman: Edgeworth: The suddenly appearing and disappearing shadow of the Yatagarasu... I believe I've figured out its true origin. Franziska: I expected no less from my subordinate. Now, let's hear what you know on the subject. What really cast the shadow of the Yatagarasu? Edgeworth: The suddenly appearing and disappearing shadow of the Yatagarasu... Is it not possible that it was created by this statue? Franziska: Franziska: Are you playing me for a fool, Miles Edgeworth!? This statue bears absolutely no resemblance to the shadow of the Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: You are correct, however, this statue is but one part of the whole picture. Franziska: What do you mean by \"only one part\"...? Edgeworth: What is the other part to the real form of the Yatagarasu's shadow? Franziska: It's... another statue? Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu's shadow was made from the shadows of these two statues. Franziska: Made? What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: Right now, the spotlights are all over the place. This is because they were moved when the guests were in a panicked state. However, if we were to restore the lights to where they were when the thief appeared... Franziska: You believe that the two shadows will create the Yatagarasu's shadow? Edgeworth: Precisely. Now then, watch as I reveal the true form of the Yatagarasu! First, if we set up a spotlight to cast a shadow of \"King Primidux and the Battlefield\"... ...the shadow of the king's statue would appear on the backdrop of the stage. Likewise, if we set a light up on \"The Queen Who Spoke of Love To King Primidux\"... ...her silhouette would also appear on the backdrop to the stage. Franziska: Aha! So if we were to combine the two shadows...! Franziska: ............ It looks nothing like the Yatagarasu's shadow! Miles Edgeworth! How do you explain this grotesque shape!? Edgeworth: C-Calm down, Franziska! The way the light needs to be shone on the queen's statue is wrong... Franziska: What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: I believe that the whole of the king's shadow needs to be used for this to work. However, in the case of the queen, I don't believe her whole shadow is needed. Rather, the person who created the shadow only used one part of her shadow. Franziska: Only one part? Edgeworth: Yes, and that one part alone is enough to fill in the rest of the Yatagarasu's shadow. Franziska: Why didn't you say that in the first place!? Edgeworth: You're right. I-I apologize... Franziska: Now, what part of the queen's statue was used to complete the Yatagarasu's shadow? Edgeworth: Think back to what is missing in our shadow. Five long, thin areas, correct? Now, what does that remind you of? Franziska: Ah! Edgeworth: That's right. It can only be the shadow of the queen's left hand. Franziska, can we please adjust the spotlight's position... ...so that it only shines on the queen's left hand? Franziska: Alright. Let's give it a try and see what we get. Franziska: It's...! Lang: Hmph... Yeah, this is exactly like the shadow I saw. Edgeworth: The culprit must've changed the spotlights' positioning beforehand... ...and then pulled the plug after people saw what the culprit wanted them to see. In their panic, the guests must have moved the spotlights around... ...which we can assume was also a part of the culprit's plan. By the time the lights came back on, the Yatagarasu's shadow had vanished. Franziska: Which means that the shadow was a construct from the very beginning. Edgeworth: So you see, the Yatagarasu never did visit Allebahst tonight. The only country that thief visited was Babahl, although it can be assumed... ...that the Yatagarasu had an accomplice in Allebahst. Franziska: An accomplice? But who...? Edgeworth: I haven't figured that out yet, but I assume it was the person who set up the shadow show. (I sense that the biggest clue yet to solving this case is the existence of this accomplice!) ???: .........How's the investigation going? Edgeworth: Detective Badd, have you come to join us in investigating the Yatagarasu? Badd: I've left the murder... in Agent Lang's charge... And my only target... from the very beginning is the Yatagarasu... so yes... Edgeworth: So... what have you found out? Badd: ...I got a piece of evidence. Edgeworth: May I see it...? Badd: ...Sure, but you might regret it... Franziska: We're here because we are ready to face whatever may come. ...So if you please. Badd: ...When people heard the commotion, bystanders... started gathering. And one woman... claimed, \"I'm tellin' ya I'm a genuine international journalist!\"... She gave me... an interesting picture. Edgeworth: A journalist...? Badd: Well, actually... she's a freelance... cameraman. This... is the photo I got from her. Edgeworth: Wh-What in the world!? Franziska: The Yatagarasu... is flying through the air...! Badd: ...The times, they are a-changing... It's... not just man... ...but evidence... even they lie to us now... Edgeworth: Wh-When was this photo taken? Badd: ...Apparently, right after the fires... on the fourth and fifth floors were put out... It was taken... from a near-by building... that you can see the embassy from. Edgeworth: I see. So this was taken after the fire... Photo of Yatagarasu data jotted down in my Organizer. Badd: The blur in this picture... took off from the Babahlese Embassy... ...flew over the boundary... and headed for the Embassy of Allebahst... Franziska: Franziska: This is simply not possible! People are incapable of flight! Edgeworth: Is that a fact? I've had the \"pleasure\" of dealing with a case involving a \"flying person\" once. Franziska: .............................. Actually, come to think of it, I've come across a case like that as well. Two, actually. Badd: ...Maybe it happens more often than we think... Edgeworth: (Am I up to the task of solving the mystery behind this photograph? Well, the Yatagarasu took off from the Babahlese Embassy, so I should start from there.) Franziska, I need to return to the Babahl investigation for a bit. Franziska: ...Alright. Theatrum Neutralis Kay: Welcome back, Mr. Edgeworth! Now come on! Let's get back to our investigation! Edgeworth: Yes, let's. Rose Garden Franziska: I see you're back. Well, let's continue with the investigation, shall we? Edgeworth: Yes, let's. Kay: To think, after all that running around, we're right back where we started. Edgeworth: It would appear that way... Palaeno: Hi, Mr. Edgeworth. Have you found Manny's killer yet? Edgeworth: I'm terribly sorry, Ambassador Palaeno, but I have yet to find his killer. Palaeno: Then I guess his murder... really was the work of the Yatagarasu... Kay: Let's get one thing straight. It was the work of the FAKE Yatagarasu. The real Yatagarasu is a noble vigilante who is only out to steal the truth... Palaeno: Ms. Faraday... Please don't make such a sad face. If there's anything I can do for you, all you have to do is ask, alright? Kay: Mr. Palaeno... Edgeworth: Actually, there is one thing you can do. Will you allow us to take another look around? We didn't have enough time to conduct a thorough investigation earlier. Palaeno: Oh, sure! Please feel free to investigate to your heart's content. Edgeworth: Also, there are a few questions I'd like to ask you personally, Ambassador. Palaeno: If it will bring a smile back to Ms. Faraday's face, then I'll gladly answer anything. Kay: Thank you, Mr. Palaeno! You're a total gentleman! Palaeno: Ha ha ha. You don't have to waste such nice words on me, little miss! Kay: Hey, Sir Palaeno! Edgeworth: (...Those two sure got chummy awfully quickly.) Kay: You know, it's easy to say we're going to investigate, but where should we begin? Edgeworth: We should probably start by comparing the state of this room before and after the fire. And then, we should look into the matter of the suspicious person you spotted. Kay: Yeah. When I came into this room, that person was already gone. But I'm willing to bet that the person I was chasing is Mr. Coachen's killer. Edgeworth: We don't know that yet; however, it's hard to believe that person is unrelated. Furthermore, because the key the Yatagarasu stole seven years ago was found here... ...it signals that perhaps Ms. Yew is also somehow involved. Kay: I knew it! That woman is almost definitely Mr. Coachen's killer! Edgeworth: Yet again, we don't know that! (There are too many mysteries to be solved here (changed from [in this case] in the original release).) Speaking of the Yatagarasu and mysteries... ...I received a most mysterious photo from Detective Badd. Kay: Uncle Badd!? He's taking part in the investigation, too!? Edgeworth: Yes. He has been chasing after the Yatagarasu for all these years. Kay: Uncle Badd......... Edgeworth: Now then, I was told that this photo was taken just after the fire... Kay: Wh-What--!? This kinda looks like the person in the long coat I was chasing...! Does this mean... that I was chasing the fake Yatagarasu after all? Edgeworth: I don't know the answer to your question, but I don't think people can fly either... Kay: But this could be how that person escaped! Edgeworth: Well, we'll need to investigate a bit more before we can say anything about that. In any case, let's not dawdle any more and pick up our investigation where we left off. After clearing all Talk options with Colias Palaeno: Gumshoe: Oh! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe, have you collected the information that I requested? Gumshoe: Yup! Got it all right here, sir! Here you go, Kay. Feel free to take a look! It's for you, after all. Kay: What is all this, Gummy...? Gumshoe: It's all the information on this room that I got from the Embassy and Interpol people. Now we know exactly how this room was before and after the fire! Edgeworth: Good work, Detective. Gumshoe: Aww, it was nothing, sir! I'm an expert at getting people to talk! Kay: Wow... You two remind me so much of my father and Uncle Badd... Edgeworth: What do you mean? Kay: As prosecutor and detective, your dynamic is just like theirs back in the day. Edgeworth: ......... Kay: Well, don't you worry! I'm going to find my own wonderful partner someday! And when I do, I'm going to become a good Yatagarasu, just like my father, right? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Please don't ask me questions to which I have no answers to, Kay. However, I can say that is truly a wonderful thing to find a partner you can trust. Kay: Heh heh, you bet! So, what now, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Well... I'd like to ask you for a favor. Kay: Yes? Edgeworth: That gadget... Mr. Thief, is it? That thing you call your secret weapon. Kay: Oh, you mean \"Little Thief\"! Heh, you're coming to rely on it, aren't you? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I-I don't need a crutch like that! I'm only asking because I need it for the investigation! From the information Detective Gumshoe gathered, and the ambassador's testimony... ...I'd like you to please re-create this room as it was during the third floor fire. Kay: You got it! Alright, here we go! Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! Now, witness the true power of a real, modern-day Robin Hood! Edgeworth: It seems there are other things besides what the ambassador mentioned that have changed. It's possible that we might find the escape route the person Kay saw used as well. Palaeno: Oooh! Wh-What is this? Is it some sort of light show I was not told about? Kay: This is the power of a true vigilante! It's re-creating the room with the info I inputted! Palaeno: Really!? That is certainly one interesting device you have there, Ms. Faraday! Edgeworth: Ahem. I believe it's about time we returned to our investigation. After examining flames: Edgeworth: These must have been the large green flames Ambassador Palaeno saw. Kay: With flames like these, it's no wonder he couldn't get in! Edgeworth: Kay, by the time you came into this room, had the fire already been put out? Kay: Yeah, the fire had died out or something by that time. Edgeworth: Then this fire in here only burned from the time the fire started on the third floor... ...until the Yatagarasu appeared and caused a stir in Babahl, I suppose. Kay: I guess Mr. Palaeno was just lucky enough to run into this fire as it was burning, huh? Edgeworth: Yes, you could put it that way. And since you were the first to discover the body... ...we can assume that no one else entered the room until that time. No one other than the person you were chasing, of course. Kay: I knew it! That person I saw was definitely up to no good! I mean, that person could even be Mr. Coachen's killer! Edgeworth: That is very likely to be the case. After all, that person came into this room before you... ...and must have chosen this room precisely because they knew no one would be in here. Kay: OK, then maybe the green fire was where it was to prevent anyone from coming in? But then, what did the person set on fire to make the green flames? Edgeworth: Hmm... Well, whatever it is that person burned, it made a rather sizable fire. Kay: And since the fire's green... well, we've seen something that burns green, right!? It's a bit tinier than these flames, but you get what I mean. Edgeworth: Yes, and I do believe that what you are thinking is exactly why these flames are green. Which fire-related piece of evidence burns the same color as these green flames? Edgeworth: This silhouette lantern... Its green flame comes from the whitcrystal oil it's burning. Kay: Yeah! That's the fire I was thinking of, too! I love the green it gives off. Edgeworth: I think we've now established that the green flames were caused by whitcrystal oil. Furthermore, we know that there is only one other thing made from whitcrystal oil. Kay: Oh! You mean that thing Mr. Palaeno was mistaken about, right!? Edgeworth: Yes, precisely... as we found out earlier in our investigation. Gumshoe: Um, what? I don't get it. Can you fill me in, sir!? Edgeworth: Fine, I suppose. I'll explain it in a way that even you can understand. This is the thing made from whitcrystal oil that Ambassador Palaeno was mistaken about! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink is made from whitcrystal oil. Gumshoe: Ohhhh! So, it should burn the same color as the flames in the lantern, right!? Edgeworth: Yes, precisely. However, the green flames in this room were not from a bottle of Babahlese ink. Kay: Because we found the ink Mr. Coachen used on his desk, right!? Edgeworth: Yes. However... we know that Mr. Coachen was smuggling the ink in massive quantities. Now, what do you suppose he made using all that ink? I believe what he made with that ink is the answer to what gave birth to the green flames. Kay: Oh, yeah! I'm beginning to really feel the energy coming from you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Heh... It would appear that I've finally found it, the smuggling ring's real goal!) Made of Babahlese ink, this is the source of the green flames! Edgeworth: What would consume that great of a volume of ink to make...? That would be... ...the counterfeit bills that the smuggling ring made and are circulating in Zheng Fa. Kay: You're kidding!? You're saying that it was Mr. Coachen who made the counterfeit bills...? Edgeworth: I am. I believe you could even go so far as to say that he \"stole\" Babahl's printing press. Ambassador, Mr. Coachen had permission to freely use the printing press, correct? Palaeno: Why, yes. And I do remember seeing him use it in the middle of the night... ...but never did I think he was using it for such a foul deed...! Edgeworth: Ambassador! Because of your secretary's crimes, you will need to be investigated as well! Palaeno: Ah, yes, I suppose so. We've caused a bit of trouble for a few countries, haven't we? Edgeworth: It's my duty to search out all who shielded Mr. Coachen and concealed his crime. For they are the ones who started the fire in order to destroy the evidence! Counterfeit Bills data updated in my Organizer. After clearing \"What you saw\" Talk option with Dick Gumshoe and examining grandfather clock: Edgeworth: (We've examined everything in this office, but there is one thing that bothers me. Perhaps I should ask Ambassador Palaeno about it.) Ambassador Palaeno, there is something I'd like to ask you about. Palaeno: Yes? Edgeworth: About this office, it appears, to me, to be very similar to Ambassador Alba's office. For example, the location of the fireplace and the position of the grandfather clock. Palaeno: Ah, that's right. You've also paid a visit to the Allebahstian side of the embassy. Our two embassies actually used to be one. Edgeworth: (Yes, I know. Even the pamphlet mentioned that.) Palaeno: Which is why the building is bilaterally symmetrical (Bilateral symmetry - Because this used to be one embassy, offices on the two sides are symmetrical.). So no matter which room, the location of the fireplace and the like are exactly the same. Even where the art is located is the same. As my room is currently under renovation... ...we worked hard to make Manny's room look like the ambassador's office. Kay: You mean for your hand shake photo op with the Jammin' Ninja? Palaeno: Yes, that's right. I mean, what's a photo like that worth if it's not taken in the ambassador's office right? Edgeworth: (Yet another odd expression of Babahl's obsessively competitive spirit with Allebahst, I take it?) Thank you, Ambassador. That piece of information is all I needed to connect the dots. Palaeno: ? ...Connect what dots? Well, anyway, I'm glad I was able to be of some help. Edgeworth: The Allebahstian and Babahlese sides of the building are symmetrical to each other. As we know that to be a fact, then this room's fireplace may also hide a secret passageway. Kay: A secret passageway? Edgeworth: In Allebahst, the fireplace turned out to have a revolving back wall. Kay: A revolving wall!? It sounds like something out of a ninja house! Gumshoe: Wow, there was a trick like that built into the fireplace, sir!? Palaeno: What!? Th-This embassy holds THAT kind of secret!? Edgeworth: There seems to be a lot about this room that you don't know about, Ambassador... Palaeno: I guess it's time to pay the bill for letting Manny do so much work for me. Please, I really want to know about the real Manny and what you know about this room. Kay: What are you waiting for, Mr. Edgeworth!? Let's get to the bottom of this! Edgeworth: Agreed. And my first thought is that it's likely the killer used the revolving fireplace (Revolving fireplace used? - It's possible someone used the revolving fireplace wall. I need to examine it more.). Kay: It looks like just another fireplace, though, doesn't it? So, how do you turn it again? Edgeworth: In Allebahst, I had to push where the X was on the far wall of the fireplace. Gumshoe: Oh! I see an X back there, sir! Let's see what happens when I push it... Edgeworth: Gumshoe: Aaaaah! You scared me, sir! Edgeworth: There is something about this fireplace that lies in contradiction to the facts. Kay: Huh? But we found an X where you thought there'd be one, right? Edgeworth: We did, but that's not what I was referring to. Something is missing from this scene. (What does this contradiction mean for us...?) Leads to examination of fireplace Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, you said that you burned some old files in this fireplace today, correct? Palaeno: Yes, I burned quite a few files this morning, actually. Edgeworth: And after you did, you forgot to clean out the ashes from the fireplace, correct? Palaeno: Th-That's right. But why are you asking? And why are you making such a scary face...? Edgeworth: I'm sorry, I admit I am a bit intimidating when I'm serious. ...In any case! Take a good look at this fireplace, and tell me what you find odd about it. Palaeno: Let's see... Huh? Where did all the ashes go...? (Missing ashes - The ashes that should still be in the fireplace are missing. Where did they go...?) Kay: What is the meaning of this, Mr. Edgeworth!? Gumshoe: You don't really think... that Ambassador Palaeno is lying, do you? Edgeworth: No, there is no reason for him to lie. And I don't believe his testimony is wrong, either. It is the fireplace that is causing the contradiction. Kay, I wonder if you might update the fireplace data for me. Kay: You got it! I'll add in the ashes from the burnt files and... Kay: Sounds like we've pretty much figured everything out now, huh!? Edgeworth: Hmph... Well, it was nothing. All I did was follow where our leads led us. Kay: Oh, I sense it coming on! You're about to dazzle us again, right!? Gumshoe: Oh, you mean that!? Well, it's what Mr. Edgeworth is known for, you know! Edgeworth: ...There is really no need for you two to dance around the name of what I'm about to do. Edgeworth: The reason as to why the ashes are missing is simple. Kay: It's not because someone cleaned them up, right? Edgeworth: No, because even if someone did sweep them up, the fireplace is too clean for that. Ambassador Palaeno said that he spilled some Babahlese ink while he was burning the files. And yet, there is not a trace of the spilled ink on the back wall anywhere! Kay: Well then, I don't know what happened. Edgeworth: Well, I'll tell you what happened. The two sides were switched. By using the revolving fireplace wall, the ashes were moved into the neighboring room. Which means that this is a clear indication that the fireplace was used! Revolving Fireplace Wall data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Then, you mean... the person I was chasing... ...disappeared from this room through there...? Edgeworth: Yes, I believe the person you were in pursuit of is Mr. Coachen's killer. And after committing the murder, escaped through the fireplace (Escaped through revolving fireplace - The person Kay was chasing used the fireplace to escape into the room next door.)! Kay: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth! You figured out the killer's escape route! Edgeworth: (I have, but this is only the beginning. Now we have to chase the killer down!) Edgeworth: If the killer used the fireplace in this room to escape into the next... ...then it's only logical for us to \"talk\" with the person who was in the neighboring room. Gumshoe: Well, the person that was in the next room was... Oh! It was that person, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, Detective... Agent Shih-na. Kay: It's looking more and more like Ms. Shih-na is the killer, isn't it? Edgeworth: Let's not jump to conclusions yet. We need to go through what we know so far. She came running straight into this room from the next one, and instantly accused you. Furthermore, she claimed that it could only have been you that killed Mr. Coachen. I don't have any proof yet, however, I KNOW she is hiding something from us! Kay: OK, then! Why don't we go ask Ms. Shih-na herself!? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: No, not yet. There's something that needs to be done first. ...Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Sir! Is it my turn to do something, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Yes. I have a two-part special assignment for you. First, I need you to run a handwriting analysis on DeMasque II's note. Gumshoe: OK! I'll get the lab boys on that right away! Edgeworth: Second, I want you to see if you can fit through the revolving fireplace wall. Gumshoe: R-Right now, sir!? Edgeworth: No, next decade... Of course now! We need to test our hypothesis first, don't we? Kay: Go on, Gummy! You can do it! Gumshoe: Alright. I'm gonna do this like a real man! Here I go, through the fireplace and back! Edgeworth: (You shouldn't need to psych yourself up that much for such a simple task, Detective...) Gumshoe: Wow! The wall inside the fireplace really DID turn! Kay: That's so neat! Now, I wanna try going through there, too! Palaeno: Th-There really IS a secret passageway through there... I had no idea...! Edgeworth: Hmm... It would appear that the ash really was pushed into the other room. Furthermore, the Babahlese ink you spilled, Ambassador, is there on the back wall. Gumshoe: OK, here I go, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective, I'd like you to go through there under the same conditions as the killer. Gumshoe: Huh? But there's all that ash and stuff... Edgeworth: And your point is? Now, we're short on time, so if you could please hurry on through. Gumshoe: Nngh... Y-Yes, sir... Kay: OK! So NOW we pretty much have the whole picture, right!? Edgeworth: No, not yet. There remains a few more mysteries to solve... ...such as the Yatagarasu's whereabouts, the other smuggling ring members... ...the two weapons that made it across the border, the key Ms. Yew stole 7 years ago... In fact, we haven't figured out a thing regarding how Ms. Yew is related to these embassies! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: A number of pieces connect in a very complicated way in this case... It's almost enough to make one completely mentally exhausted. Kay: What are you saying, Mr. Edgeworth!? I thought you were the one who said that it's easy if you follow the leads? Edgeworth: Hmph... Was that supposed to be an impression of me, Kay? Kay: If it's info gathering you need, Gummy and I can help with that! Then, all you'd have to do is show off your fancy-schmancy logical deductions! Edgeworth: \"Show off\"...? (Does it seem like I'm being boastful when I do that...?) Kay: Let's not over-complicate matters, OK, Mr. Edgeworth!? We've been so focused, like a laser, on only what seems strange and out of place... ...it's no wonder nothing's clicked and we haven't unlocked anything yet. But, if we think things through calmly, the answer should come to us! Edgeworth: Kay... Kay: That's the sort of thing I say to myself... ...when I'm practicing how to unlock padlocks, you know! Edgeworth: ...That is something that I hope practice doesn't make perfect, for your sake. Kay: Ha ha ha! Yay! Looks like you're back to your straight-laced self again! Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm back, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, I can see that. Good work, Detective. Gumshoe: *cough* *cough* *cough* L-Looks like you can use that fireplace like a door, sir! Kay: Are you alright, Gummy...? Gumshoe: I-I'm OK! It's just a bit of ash and dust, that's all! Edgeworth: Your jacket has gotten quite filthy. I see the hem has practically turned black. Gumshoe: Yeah, well, quite a bit of the unburned ink got on it, sir. Edgeworth: Hmm... I see. Thank you, Detective. You did a fine job. I'll even pay the cleaning bill for the trench coat. Gumshoe: What!? Oh, no, sir! I could never! This is just my old coat, sir! If it was [sic] a coat I actually cared about, then I'd get it cleaned, but, you know... Edgeworth: ...? I see. Very well, then. As you wish. Kay: So because Gummy was able to climb through the fireplace, we know it can be used, right? Edgeworth: Yes, but that's not all we learned. We actually learned one other important fact. Kay: And that is...? Edgeworth: I will have to explain it to you later. Right now, we need to deal with the handwriting analysis. Detective Gumshoe... Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I'll be back before you know it! Edgeworth: The handwriting analysis on Mr. Coachen's handwriting will take a bit of time. Let us go and wait in the Theatrum Neutralis, along with Agent Lang and Agent Shih-na! To be continued Edgeworth: Agent Lang... Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Little cubs, never do they know the real fury of the Elder wolves.\" Edgeworth: (These quotes are definitely becoming increasingly difficult to decipher...) And what does that mean? Lang: It means that you'll never really know how angry I can get. Mr. Prosecutor... The counterfeit bills made with Babahlese ink... they were all of Zheng Fa denominations. Edgeworth: Yes, so I heard from Ms. von Karma. Franziska: But we don't know where the play money has gone. Edgeworth: (They must not have figured out that it was all burned yet...) Lang: Ever since those things showed up in circulation, my country's economy has taken a big hit. Zheng Fa is in financial chaos as we speak... ...because we can't tell the difference between our own bills and the fakes! But it's not just the money; the citizens are also worried. I've staked the honor of the house of Lang on this... ...and have come to this land to capture the mastermind behind this whole mess. I investigated how the bills were made and how the ink was smuggled into Zheng Fa... ...and I pursued the smuggling ring all the way here. But tonight... this is where the final chapter was written. Despite my frantic efforts to chase the smuggler down, someone got to him first... ...and now I'm called to return home without a single answer! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, I... Lang: Don't start. It's not your fault. It's not anyone's fault, Mr. Prosecutor. Ambassador Alba, I'm sorry for all the trouble tonight. Alba: Oh, no, no. It is I who should apologize. It was all because I was not strong enough. If only I was able to think of a better solution... Quercus, you fool! Curse your empty brain! Lang: Heh, you're being too hard on yourself, Ambassador. I take full responsibility for tonight, end of story. Shih-na, let's go. Time to return to our den. Shih-na: .........Yes. Franziska: I don't like to admit it, but there's not much else for us to do but to go home as well. Edgeworth: Agent Lang! A moment, if you ???: Gumshoe: You, Wolf-man and the secretary lady! Hold it! Objection! Pal! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe...! Have you got the results of the handwriting analysis already? Gumshoe: Yup, and that note... was definitely written by Mr. Coachen, sir! Edgeworth: Hmm, just as I thought... Good work, Detective. DeMasque II's Note data updated in my Organizer. Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... How long do you intend to hold us up for? Edgeworth: Hmph... Sorry to have made you wait, but I believe that now everyone is finally here. Agent Shih-na. I'd like to ask you something, if you don't mind. Shih-na: .........Yes? Edgeworth: How exactly did you fail to see the Yatagarasu... ...when you were in the neighboring room to where Mr. Coachen was killed!? I'd like you to explain THAT to us. Lang: What...? Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! What are you doing asking her about something she didn't see? Edgeworth: (Agent Lang hasn't touched the Babahl investigation at all. So I suppose I will need to explain a few things to him first.) Franziska: Miles Edgeworth... I can't even begin to imagine what's going on in that head of yours. Edgeworth: The only thing going on in my head... is the pursuit of the truth! Franziska: Oh? It sounds like you have some sort of plan. Very well, I'll supervise you until the end. Edgeworth: (*sigh* Is she seriously going to treat me as a subordinate for the rest of the day...?) Lang: You're not trying to pick a fight with my subordinate on some flimsy guess, are you? Edgeworth: I'm not trying to \"pick a fight\" and the evidence is hardly flimsy, as you will see. Lang: Hah! I should've known... ...that you and I are destined to fight it out to the very end! Edgeworth: It would appear that way. Lang: Well, I'll prove her innocence, so let's see what you've got, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hmph... With pleasure. (For my opening argument, I'll discuss the Yatagarasu that appeared in Babahl... ...and establish exactly who it was that Kay saw.) Agent Lang. I assume you've been briefed on Kay's testimony? Lang: You mean the \"suspicious person in a coat\" that she saw? Edgeworth: That's right. That person is one of the keys to solving this case. The person who pretended to be the Yatagarasu! Lang: \"Pretended\"? And what do you mean by that!? Edgeworth: I'll get to that in a second. But first, I want to review what Kay's mystery person did (changed from [second, but first, I want to review what this person Kay saw did] in the original release). Kay, if you could please explain for us what the person you were chasing did (changed from [what the person you were chasing did for us] in the original release)... Kay: OK! You got it! I first spotted the suspicious person near the open-air stage on the Babahlese side. I called out to the person, but as soon as I did, that person ran off. I thought it was rather suspicious, so I immediately gave chase. Edgeworth: For the sake of argument, let's call this suspicious person the Yatagarasu. Now, please tell us what happened when you chased the Yatagarasu up to the 3rd floor. Kay: Can do! I chased the Yatagarasu all the way up to the third floor of the Babahlese Embassy. It was a pretty straight chase down the hallway, until the sudden turn. The Yatagarasu disappeared around the corner, so I did my best to catch up. When I turned the corner, I saw the Yatagarasu run into Mr. Coachen's office. I gave chase and ran into the room... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the light, but then... Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Shih-na: ...Who's there!? Kay: By the time I had turned on the lights, the Yatagarasu had disappeared. Edgeworth: When Kay entered the room, the person she was chasing was already gone. Why do you suppose that was, Agent Lang? Lang: ...What do you mean, \"Why do you suppose?\" Isn't it obvious!? The person slipped out through the door behind the girl under the cover of darkness. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Sorry, but I know for a fact that the person didn't escape through that door! Lang: Oh? And how do you know that with such certainly!? Edgeworth: Hmph... That's easy. If the Yatagarasu had left through that door, they would have run right into this person! Lang: Y-Your answer is Shih-na...? Edgeworth: Yes, because let's consider what would've happened if the Yatagarasu had used the door. When Kay screamed upon discovering Mr. Coachen's body... ...the Yatagarasu would've run right into Agent Shih-na, who was in the next room over. Lang: ...Arngh! Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na. Would you mind telling us if you saw the suspicious person in question? Shih-na: .........No, I didn't see anyone. Edgeworth: You see? Therefore, the Yatagarasu could not have escaped through the door as Lang: Lang: It just means that the creep slipped out before Shih-na made it out into the hallway! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. I doubt that, as there was another person in that hallway. A certain detective. Detective Gumshoe, where were you exactly at that time? Gumshoe: M-Me, sir? Well, when I heard Kay's scream... ...I ran towards Mr. Coachen's office from the opposite direction of Agent Shih-na, sir! Edgeworth: So, Agent Lang, can YOU explain how someone could've eluded both of them!? Even you must concede that under these circumstances, the door was not a viable route! Lang: Grr...rrrnoooooooooh! Kay: Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! You nailed him with just an explanation of what happened! Edgeworth: Yes... I've eliminated one of the possible escape routes from that room. (But this is far from over. I need to make Agent Lang aware as well... ...of yet another possible escape route the Yatagarasu could've taken.) Lang: .........! Ha ha ha ha! I get it! So that's what you were trying to show me. Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... Let me guess. This is what you're trying to say, right? Because the door was not a viable escape route, then there must've been another way out! Edgeworth: Precisely. Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! It's time to bust out with our revolving fireplace wall explanation, right!? Edgeworth: No, not quite yet. Kay: Huh!? But why? I thought this would be the perfect time... Edgeworth: The revolving wall on the Babahlese side is known only to four people. And if we use this information unwisely, the truth may escape us in the end. Lang: What's with all the whispering over there? Scared I'll figure out your tactics? Edgeworth: Hmph, nothing of the sort, Agent Lang. Come, let's continue where we left off. Lang: That smug, haughty attitude of yours... You really rub me the wrong way, you know that!? ...Hmph. Well, no matter. I've figured you out already anyway. The only other possible escape route besides the door... is the room's lone window! And since an eerie picture of said escape route exists... Are you saying that this photo captures the moment of the Yatagarasu's escape!? Edgeworth: (I guess Detective Badd must have filled him in on this photo... I have to admit that at first, I thought the window to be a possible escape route as well. However, I now know that to be impossible!) Lang: Now, I realize you may not know this, but... ...humans can't fly. Edgeworth: Of course I know that! That's bloody common sense! Besides, I never said I thought that photo to be of the Yatagarasu's escape route. Lang: ...I suppose not. Alright then, explain yourself. Edgeworth: The shadow in this photo is not the Yatagarasu that Kay was chasing after. Lang: Lang: You can say whatever you'd like in whatever language you want... ...but there's only one language I really understand: the language of evidence! Edgeworth: Very well, then. I present to you, proof that the person Kay saw is not the same as the one in this photo! Edgeworth: Let me explain to you precisely why the shadow in this photo is not the Yatagarasu Kay saw. Kay spotted the Yatagarasu heading for the third floor during the second fire. However, the photo in question was taken just after the first fire! Lang: Grr...rrrnoooooooooooh! Kay: Yeah! Way to go! That's TWICE you've bit him in the butt now! Lang: Lang: We're not done yet! You still have to explain what that shadow is... ...and how the Yatagarasu escaped! I don't suppose you can answer both, can you!? Edgeworth: Regarding the photo, I admit that we don't understand what it means quite yet. Lang: Hah! As I thought. Edgeworth: However, the Yatagarasu's escape route? Now, THAT I can answer. Lang: You can? Well, then, Mr. Prosecutor, go on! Enlighten me! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Even if I explain it, you'll try to find some flaw with what I have to say. You were busy heading up the Allebahstian investigation, correct? In that case, I doubt you'd have much knowledge about the Babahlese side of the case... ...so wouldn't it be best if the lead on that side, Agent Shih-na, explained in my stead? Lang: .........Argh! Shih-na is my subordinate...! If I don't stick up for her, how can I look her in the eyes and call myself her boss...!? Shih-na: .........Lang, it's alright. I can take care of him. Lang: Shih-na. Shih-na: You've shielded me a lot as my boss... ...but it's time for me to prove my worth. Lang: ...Alright. If you're OK with it, then you have my support. Edgeworth: (Finally, it's down to just Agent Shih-na and myself. This is where the battle really begins!) Shih-na: Now then, what is it you'd like to ask? Edgeworth: Hmm, let's see... Why don't we start with your movements inside the Babahlese Embassy? Shih-na: During the first Babahlese fire, I assisted in putting out the fire. During the second fire, I was searching for the Yatagarasu that had appeared in Babahl. While I was searching, I heard a scream coming from the next room over. Although I was in the next room, I was unable to catch a glimpse of the Yatagarasu. To be honest, I'm actually very skeptical that the girl's \"Yatagarasu\" even exists. Shih-na: And that is all I have to say. Kay: But I'm not lying when I say I saw the suspicious person run into Mr. Coachen's office! Like I said earlier... ...I have no intention of retracting my testimony. Shih-na: .........Good. Edgeworth: Just to confirm, did you have a partner when you were on your investigation? Shih-na: No, I moved alone. Edgeworth: In that case, you have no one to corroborate your alibi. Is that correct? Lang: Lang: Are you calling her suspicious because she was in a room by herself!? How pathetic! Edgeworth: ...And it wasn't when Agent Shih-na tried to arrest Kay under the same rationale? Lang: ............! Edgeworth: And how about when you accused Larry because he was the weapon's owner? Lang: ............Grr! Franziska: Not that it's unexpected for that useless lump to get into such a situation. Although, I suppose it's never a good idea to let mistakes go uncorrected. Lang: I will make no excuse for what I did in that situation. Gumshoe: Then you should apologize right now for making Kay out to be the killer, pal! Lang: .........I'm sorry. Shih-na, apologize. Shih-na: ............... .........I'm sorry. Kay: I-It's really OK! I mean, I'm not under suspicion anymore! Right, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Hmph. Well, I never doubted you. Not for one second. Lang: .........And the same goes for me. I believe in Shih-na. Edgeworth: Then let's put that to the test, and see if she is really worthy of your trust. Shih-na: Heh heh... This promises to be interesting. Shih-na: During the first Babahlese fire, I assisted in putting out the fire. Shih-na: During the second fire, I was searching for the Yatagarasu that had appeared in Babahl. Shih-na: While I was searching, I heard a scream coming from the next room over. Shih-na: Although I was in the next room, I was unable to catch a glimpse of the Yatagarasu. Shih-na: To be honest, I'm actually very skeptical that the girl's \"Yatagarasu\" even exists. Edgeworth: Hmph... There seems to be a very large flaw in her testimony. Kay: Oh? Then why don't you show her using what we found out with Little Thief? Edgeworth: Heh... I will, in due time. (The escape route of the Yatagarasu that Kay was in pursuit of... If it turns out that it really does lead right to Agent Shih-na... ...then what is it that she is keeping from us right now?) Edgeworth: Being in the room next to Mr. Coachen's office is the problem with your testimony. Shih-na: .........! Lang: Lang: Mr. Prosecutor... I don't see what problem you're talking about at all! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, do you recall the secret we discovered about the Allebahstian office fireplace? Lang: Huh? Oh, you mean how it connects the office with the room next door? What about it? Edgeworth: Well... Allebahst isn't the only country with secret connecting fireplaces. Lang: Wha--!? Edgeworth: The fireplace in Mr. Coachen's office holds the exact same secret! Lang: Wh...Whaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu didn't escape through the door to the room or the window. The escape route was through the revolving fireplace wall and into the next room over! Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: Now do you see? If the Yatagarasu had escaped into the next room... ...then the thief would've run straight into Agent Shih-na! Meaning that it's impossible for her to have missed the Yatagarasu! Lang: A.........Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaa! Franziska: Wh-What is the meaning of this, Miles!? Edgeworth: Well? Would you care to explain, Agent Shih-na... ...how you managed to completely miss the fleeing Yatagarasu, or shall I? Shih-na: ............ Edgeworth: Your claim that you were in the next room was a lie all along, wasn't it? The truth is, you were the one Kay saw in the coat... ...pretending to be the Yatagarasu, and you were the one she chased after. As you tried to lose her, you ran into Mr. Coachen's office, and headed for the fireplace. Then, you shed your coat in the next room, leaving it there to emerge as \"Agent Shih-na\". After that, you came back around to place Kay under arrest. Does that sound about right? If not, then speak now or forever hold your peace. Shih-na: ............ Gumshoe: How dare you make Kay look like the bad guy when you're the suspicious one, pal!? Shih-na: .........Phwwh... Phwwwwh... Edgeworth: .........! Lang: ...Shih-na...? Shih-na: Hee... hee hee hee......... ...Hee hee hee hee hee... hee hee......... Aha! Ahaha! Ahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Edgeworth: ! (That... That laugh...!) Franziska: I remember this irritating laugh... Gumshoe: Brr... I'm getting chills down my spine...! Kay: .........It can't be... But it has to be...! Lang: Shih-na... What's wrong with you...? Shih-na: Phwwh... I'm sorry. It was so funny that I couldn't help but laugh. Edgeworth: ...\"Funny\", you say? Shih-na: Yes, that you would accuse me of being the Yatagarasu. ...The prosecutors of this country really are all so very strange. Franziska: Do you think you can get away with this by simply laughing it off!? Shih-na: Phwwh... You think I'M taking things too lightly? I think not. It's that prosecutor who is. Edgeworth: .........! Shih-na: Look, everything you said earlier is nothing more than mere speculation. The Yatagarasu fled through the fireplace? Do you have any proof to back up your claim? If you don't, then you haven't proven a thing regarding the Yatagarasu's escape route! Edgeworth: The tone of voice you're taking with me now has certainly changed. Shih-na: Heh heh... That's because it's been a while since I've had this much fun. I think I'll let loose, and then we can have a real battle of wits. Edgeworth: For an agent of Interpol to show me the true power of her mind, it is a great honor. Shih-na: Phwwwh... Don't underestimate me; I'm not some foolish broad, you know. Edgeworth: I know. And that is why I won't hold anything back either as I answer your question. Shih-na: My question...? Edgeworth: Here is your proof that the revolving fireplace wall in Babahl was used recently! Shih-na: I'm sorry, but is this really your honest answer to my question? Edgeworth: Yes. According to Ambassador Palaeno's testimony... ...he said that he was burning some documents in the fireplace with Mr. Coachen. Shih-na: ...Oh? Edgeworth: The ashes of what they burned were left in the fireplace, so they should've been there. However, when we went to investigate the room, the ashes weren't there. Shih-na: Shih-na: Why is that a problem? Maybe someone cleaned them up? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph......... Unfortunately for you, Ambassador Palaeno said that he forgot to. And so the question remains: Why were the ashes missing? ...The answer is simple. When the Yatagarasu went through the fireplace wall... ...the ashes were pushed into the next room by the wall as well! The movement of the ashes that were in Mr. Coachen's office is my proof! Shih-na: Ahah! Ahaha! Ahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Edgeworth: .........And just what is so funny!? Shih-na: Ash as proof...? Are you even allowed to submit such flakey evidence in court? Franziska: You... still wish to fight us? Shih-na: Of course. Why wouldn't I? Edgeworth: In that case, let's hear your counterargument. Shih-na: Phwwwh... My counterargument, huh? This really is just like being in court. Edgeworth: Well, to me, we're simply continuing from where we left off all those years ago. Shih-na: ...Phwwwh. I have no idea what you're talking about. Edgeworth: It doesn't matter if we're at a crime scene or in court, let's finish this here and now! Shih-na: I suppose. I've had a lot of fun today, but I grow weary of this game of cat and mouse. Edgeworth: ...! Shih-na: Let's make this the last testimony, and wrap up this absurd case once and for all! Shih-na: In my eyes, all you've proved is that the rotating fireplace wall was used... ...but you can't really call that proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace, now can you? So then, who was it that used the rotating wall? Show me your answer with real evidence. Remember, we've already finished our very thorough investigation... ...and we found not a single suspicious thing in Mr. Coachen's office. Shih-na: Phwwwh... And there you have it, my counterargument. Edgeworth: ...Arngh! (That's very... impressive. She has seen through to the fact that I have yet to gather that one piece of evidence...) Kay: ............ Gumshoe: What is it, Kay? I haven't heard a peep out of you in quite a while now. Franziska If you don't think you can handle it, feel free to leave the rest of it to us. Kay: But I...! Edgeworth: Kay... Pull yourself together. You are the true heir to the Yatagarasu name, are you not? Kay: ...! Edgeworth: If you want to steal the truth, then you must never take your eyes off of it. This chase you're running to catch the truth... you must see it through to the very end. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... You're right. I... I will see this through to the end. So...... You go get her for me, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hmph... With pleasure. Shih-na: Looks like a lack of evidence has left you wide open, doesn't it? Lang: ...Shih-na. Please... show me you're someone I can trust. Shih-na: ......... Don't worry. This will be the deciding match. You'll see. Edgeworth: (I'm truly sorry, Agent Lang, but I simply can't allow her to escape me again.) Very well then, Agent Shih-na. Shall we begin? Shih-na: Phwwh... I'm ready whenever you are. Shih-na: In my eyes, all you've proved is that the rotating fireplace wall was used... Shih-na: ...but you can't really call that proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace, now can you? Shih-na: So then, who was it that used the rotating wall? Show me your answer with real evidence. Shih-na: Remember, we've already finished our very thorough investigation... Shih-na: ...and we found not a single suspicious thing in Mr. Coachen's office. Kay: So... do you actually have any proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace passageway? Edgeworth: No, I haven't found any yet. Kay: Then what are we going to do!? Edgeworth: Hmph. There's no need to worry. Because there is a loophole in Ms. Interpol Agent's argument we can exploit first. (The one in charge of the Babahlese investigation was not Agent Lang. Which means that with Agent Shih-na in charge... ...it's possible she may have tampered with the evidence. That piece of evidence that we found... If there is one thing I DO know, it is that someone tried to hide it from us!) Edgeworth: And that this throws doubt on the purity of your investigation into the Yatagarasu! Shih-na: ...! You still suspect me, I see. Alright then, I ask that you point out what part of my investigation is incomplete. Edgeworth: (The other Interpol agents worked under the command of Agent Shih-na. And is it not possible that the reason the person Kay was chasing chose the third floor... ...was because that person knew there would be no other agents on that floor? Furthermore, we've come to see that Agent Shih-na... ...was only pretending to be investigating the Yatagarasu, to the point of arresting Kay. In that case, there is one location that no one has yet to inspect!) Your team's investigation was incomplete because they failed to inspect this location! Edgeworth: The location, Agent Shih-na, is of course, the room you claimed to have examined. I believe the room next to Mr. Coachen's office warrants a thorough inspection. Shih-na: Even if you do that, I doubt you'll find anything of use to you there. Edgeworth: Hmph. I will be the one to decide that! Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I'm on it! I'll be right back after I check out that room next to the office! Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth... Do you really think that Ms. Shih-na's the Yatagarasu? Edgeworth: ...Yes, if my logic is sound, I believe she is. Kay: Then, I'm not going to let her get away with ruining the name of the Yatagarasu! Franziska: But can you prove she's the Yatagarasu is the question. Edgeworth: If Detective Gumshoe can find what I'm hoping he will find, then I should be able to. Franziska: And just what are you hoping he'll find? Edgeworth: Let's just say this. I had Detective Gumshoe do a little experiment for me earlier. Franziska: An experiment? As if that detective has the brains for high science. Edgeworth: It wasn't that mentally taxing. I had him use the same escape route as the Yatagarasu. Franziska: And what did you find out by doing that? Edgeworth: First, that it's possible for a person to fit through the revolving wall \"door\". Second, that by going through there, his coat was covered in ash and Babahlese ink. Franziska: Who cares what his coat was covered in? It's not worth that much anyway! Edgeworth: Ah, but is it really worth so little? I believe that it's actually quite a meaningful result, the value of which I'm about to prove. Franziska: ...? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! I've found some things you really need to see, sir! Edgeworth: Oh? So what are these things that you found? Gumshoe: Ummm... Some make-up, a coat, and a pair of shoes, sir. Kay: You found a coat!? You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Maybe it's the one the person I was chasing was wearing! Edgeworth: Yes, the possibility does exist. Agent Shih-na. Were these pieces of evidence not in that room when you examined it? Shih-na: Phwwwh... Unfortunately for you, those aren't \"suspicious items\" of any sort. They all belong to me. They were getting in the way, so I stored them in that room. Gumshoe: Aww...! Shih-na: Thank you for bringing them to me. It saves me a trip. May I have them back now? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: These items that the detective brought back are incredibly significant. I request that we be allowed to examine them. Shih-na: Shih-na: They're my personal belongings, so you have no right to touch them without my permission. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I wish to examine them for the sake of the investigation. But if you wish to deny us access to them... Agent Lang, let's hear your opinion on this. Lang: I say, let them look at your stuff, Shih-na. Shih-na: Lang! Lang: Shih-na, let's put it all out in the open. If you're really innocent, then you have nothing to worry about, right? Shih-na: .........I guess so, Alright, go ahead and examine whatever you'd like. After all, I have nothing to hide. Edgeworth: Hmph... Good. Now let us begin. Gumshoe: So which of Agent Shih-na's belongings are you going to examine, sir? Edgeworth: Let's examine the coat. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: It appears you managed to stain your coat rather badly... ...Agent Shih-na. Shih-na: ............ Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu that Kay saw was wearing a coat. And I'm beginning to wonder if this stain wasn't created when you went through the fireplace. Shih-na: Ahah... No, you have it wrong. That soot probably got on my coat when I was helping the police put out the fire. Edgeworth: And what about this dark substance around the hem of your coat? Shih-na: Oh! I didn't realize that the hem was that dirty. I'm sure it's just some water mixed with soot from when I was helping with the fire. Kay: I don't think so! You think you can get away with such a transparent lie!? Gumshoe: Yeah! Don't lie to us, pal! This is the same pattern of dirt that got on my coat when I went through the fireplace! Shih-na: Shih-na: Your words ring hollow in the absence of evidence, you know. So unless you can prove that the dirt on my coat is from the fireplace... Edgeworth: Which I can. Shih-na: Wh...!? How...!? Edgeworth: You did a great job, Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Me, sir? What did I do? Edgeworth: This coat... This is exactly the piece of evidence I was searching for. I had been hoping to find the coat that the person Kay saw was wearing. And thanks to you, we proved that going through the fireplace would sully a coat. Gumshoe: I don't quite get what you're saying, but I'm happy for the praise, sir! Edgeworth: All that remains... ...is for us to show what the dark substance on the coat hem is. Shih-na: Oh? And you think you can do that? Edgeworth: Of course I can. This is the dark substance that sullied the hem of this coat! Shih-na: B-Babahlese ink? Edgeworth: Yes. This is what will prove that the coat went through that fireplace! According to Ambassador Palaeno, he burned some files in the fireplace this morning. Shih-na: You told us about that already, so I don't really see the point in mentioning it again. Edgeworth: My point is that he spilled some ink onto the back wall of the fireplace at that time. Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: If the dark substance on this coat turns out to be Babahlese ink... ...it would prove that you and this coat went through the revolving fireplace wall! Shih-na: ...Ack! Edgeworth: (Sorry to have clipped one of your wings, \"Yatagarasu\", but we're not finished yet.) Shih-na: But you have no way of proving whether or not this is Babahlese ink on the coat hem! Edgeworth: Oh, but I do. And I intend to show that it IS ink in a few seconds. Shih-na: How...!? Edgeworth: How, you ask? Well, since you don't seem to know, allow me to show you. This is how I will prove that the dark substance on the coat is Babahlese ink! Edgeworth: We can find out whether that is Babahlese ink or not by lighting it on fire. Lang: That's how you're going to prove that it's Babahlese ink? Edgeworth: Yes. If you could please cut a section of the dark, stained area for me, I'd appreciate it. Because I will show you, here and now, what the dark substance is! Lang: Shih-na... Sorry to do this, but I'm going to have to cut off a bit of your coat. Shih-na: Go ahead. I wasn't planning to wear it anymore anyway. Edgeworth: Now then, if someone could loan me a lighter or something... Kay: Oh! I've got some matches! I always carry them with me so I can light smoke bombs! Edgeworth: Then, if I could please have one, Kay, we can get this experiment underway. Franziska: The flame...! Lang: It's the same color as the flames whitcrystal oil produces... Which means...! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink is a product of whitcrystal oil. And when lit, the ink produces a green flame. Shih-na: ......... Edgeworth: (Hmph. I believe the time has come to clip the Yatagarasu's other wing.) Kay: Ms. Shih-na... You're the fake Yatagarasu...! The one who killed my father! Shih-na: ......... Edgeworth: It's about time you came clean, Agent Shih-na. Or should I say... ...Calisto Yew!? Lang: Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... You're not serious, are you? Edgeworth: Do I look like the joking type to you? Shih-na: ...Ahah. Phwwwh... \"Calisto Yew\"? I've never heard that name before in my life. Franziska: That manner of speaking, and that attitude...! You haven't changed a bit in seven years! Gumshoe: You're the defense attorney that killed Mr. Faraday, and then tried to frame me for it! Shih-na: Oh really, and you have proof? You insist that I am this \"Calisto Yew\" woman, but you can't prove it! If you have no proof, then I'm afraid you won't be able to lay a single finger on me. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The raven is a very unique bird, one that flies by the darkness of night. However! The light of dawn has arrived, and it will reveal your true, ugly form to the world! Shih-na: Shih-na: Enough poetry! I want to see some evidence! Franziska: Do you really have something that can prove that she is Calisto Yew? Edgeworth: I do. It's something that the 2nd Yatagarasu has preserved for us these last seven years! Kay: Do me the honor, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: I will, Kay. For we have finally come to the end. We'll prove her to be Calisto Yew with this, and clip this Yatagarasu's wings for good! Edgeworth: This perfume... This will prove you to be Calisto Yew. Shih-na: It will...!? Edgeworth: Kay has preserved it perfectly for us. Surely you remember this bottle? This belonged to Ms. Yew just before she disappeared seven years ago. Naturally, this means that a few of her fingerprints are on here as well. Kay: This is that bottle of perfume you spilled, which I have preserved ever since. Shih-na: ...! Kay: I heard from my father, Byrne Faraday... ...that if stored under the right conditions, a fingerprint can be preserved for decades. Which means that your fingerprints are still on here. Every last one. Shih-na: ......... Edgeworth: We can clear everything up if we were to compare the prints on this to your own! Now come, Agent Shih-na! Will you submit yourself to a fingerprint test!? Shih-na: ...Ahah. Edgeworth: ! Shih-na: Hee... hee hee hee... Ahah. Ahah! Ahah! Ahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! ???: It looks like... you've seen right through me yet again... Ahah... You're sending the biggest chill down my spine, Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Calisto... Yew...! Franziska: So you've shown your true face at last. Yew: This feeling of thrill... it's even greater than that time, seven years ago. Lang: Shih-na! You're...! Yew: Lang, I really enjoyed our days together. You're an insanely strong, nice, kind-hearted... idiot of a man. Lang: So, you were a spy all along? A mole sent by the smuggling ring I've been chasing after... Someone who has been feeding them intel on Interpol all this time!? Yew: Ahah! Very good! Maybe you're not as big of an idiot as I thought! Kay: Calisto Yew... The woman who killed my father seven years ago...! You're her, aren't you!? The fake Yatagarasu! Yew: That's right. Calisto Yew... That's just one of my many names. But even that is just a fa\u00e7ade. .........Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I am... the Great Thief Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: Calisto Yew, this time you won't escape, for this is the end of the road for you. Now come along quietly! Yew: You know, you're the one who left the strongest impression on me... Kay Faraday. And had you not used the Yatagarasu's gadgets, I might've never known who you were. But here you are, being a thorn in my side... just like your father always was. Kay: ...! Edgeworth: Kay! Don't! Kay: Yew! I'll never forgive you for what you did to my father! Yew: Phwwwh... You really are just like him. Mr. Faraday, too, possessed such laughable honesty! Edgeworth: Kay! Gumshoe: Aaaaaaah! You let Kay go right now, pal! Franziska: You despicable...! Kay: Let go of me! You filthy... Arngh! Yew: You think I'm a fake, don't you? Well, unfortunately for you, I'm the real Yatagarasu. Kay: But that's impossible! My father was the one who created Little Thief! Yew: Ahaha! Hey, Edgeworth. The Yatagarasu has three legs. Do you know why that is? Edgeworth: Why it has three legs...? Badd: There are three main reasons why the Yatagarasu will always be one step ahead! First! The Yatagarasu always knows the exact location of the target object. Second! The Yatagarasu always knows exactly how to disarm the security system. Edgeworth: No, it can't be! Yew: Did you finally figure it out? Do you finally know the real identity of the Yatagarasu!? Edgeworth: The real identity of the Yatagarasu is... Edgeworth: The real identity of the Yatagarasu is neither Byrne Faraday nor Calisto Yew. But by the same token, they are also both the real Yatagarasu. Yew: Ha ha! How very perceptive of you! Kay: N-No way! Edgeworth: The single person known as the Great Thief Yatagarasu never existed. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I... No! I refuse to believe this! Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu is known to have three special skills. Skill number one. The Yatagarasu always knows the exact location of the target object. And a lawyer would have the opportunity to learn the layout of client corporations. Skill number two. The Yatagarasu always knows exactly how to disarm the security system. And a good prosecutor would be well-versed in the ways of a criminal. ???: And skill number three... The Yatagarasu doesn't leave a single shred of evidence behind... ever... Edgeworth: D-Detective Badd! Badd: ...It was only natural for the Yatagarasu to never leave evidence behind. Because the lead detective on the case... hid it all away... Edgeworth: Y-You're the third member of the Yatagarasu!? Badd: ...Yew. ...I've been looking for you for a long time. Seven long years, but I've finally got you... Yew: Ahah! Why, Mr. Badd! Long time no see. What happened to us? We used to be such a great team. Kay: If you were such a great team, then why did you kill my father seven years ago!? Yew: Ha ha ha. Why indeed? It was nothing personal, really. He was just another person I had to kill. Kay: ...! How can you say that...!? Yew: I grow weary of this, and it's about time for everything to come to an end. And this time, I won't miss. Edgeworth: Stop! Badd: Yeeeeeeeeew! Edgeworth: Kay! Lang: It's over, Shih-na. Kay: Y...! Your leg...! Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Yew: Grrrnk! Badd: You idiot...! What were you thinking, jumping in front of my gun like that...!? What are you risking your life for!? Lang: I'm sorry, Detective Badd, but no matter what sort of past she may have had... ...or even if she is a spy, it doesn't change the fact that she is my subordinate. And as long as she is, I can't allow any harm to come to her, not even from you! Yew: You really are... an idiot, you know that...? Lang: Hah! That's fine with me. You should know by now that this is just how I am. Hey, sis... Franziska: Yes...? Lang: I want you to conduct a full body search. Shih-na might have another weapon on her. Franziska: Alright. Detective Gumshoe, your assistance, please. Gumshoe: Sir! Gumshoe: Hey, I found something! What is this, sir? It looks like the blade of a knife, but it doesn't have a handle. Edgeworth: This is a great find, Detective. Gumshoe: Huh? It is, sir? Edgeworth: Let's try pairing up this blade with this handle. Edgeworth: I believe this blade actually belongs with the handle that was on the murder weapon. Gumshoe: Hey, they fit together perfectly! Edgeworth: This blade must've been taken from the crime scene when the knife handles were switched. Gumshoe: I'm going to go return this Babahlese knife now! Edgeworth: Alright. I trust that you'll make sure that it is returned to Ambassador Palaeno. Babahlese Knife Handle given to Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: I believe this makes it perfectly clear who did it, Calisto Yew! For the only time the handles could've been switched is just after Mr. Coachen's murder. Yew: Ahah...! Edgeworth: Which means that you must be Mr. Coachen's killer! You killed Mr. Coachen with the Allebahstian knife... ...switched the handles, and then took the original blade of the Babahlese knife with you. Later, you allowed yourself to be spotted by Kay near the open-air stage. You used the fireplace to lose her, and then you went back to accuse her of the murder. Does that about sum it up? Yew: Yew: Ahah... You craft an engaging tale, Edgeworth, but there are two problems with it. Edgeworth: Problems? In what respect? Yew: What do you think my real reason was in allowing her to chase after me? Edgeworth: .........? Yew: Phwwh... It was all so I could capture Kay Faraday. Kay: What!? Yew: When I saw you using that device at Gatewater Land, I knew right away... ...that you were Byrne Faraday's daughter. Ahah! I became curious, so I researched a little into your background. That's how I found out that you were on the trail of the Yatagarasu. Kay: So that's why you tried to pin Mr. Coachen's murder on me? Yew: Yes... I knew you would show up at this embassy tonight. So I thought to use you. But pinning the murder on you wasn't my only goal. Kay: You had another? Yew: Heh heh, yes. Once I had you under arrest, I had planned to search you... ...and take back the device that rightfully belongs to me, the true Yatagarasu. Kay: You were going to take Little Thief away from me!? Yew: Seven years ago, it was thanks to that device that Faraday was able to infiltrate this place. But he stole more than he should've. I had a tough time recovering that precious key. Edgeworth: Then, the person who stole the Yatagarasu's Key was Mr. Faraday...!? Badd: Yew... That incident seven years ago... What was the catalyst behind it? Yew: In the eyes of the smuggling ring, the Yatagarasu was becoming a bit of a problem. ...It wasn't an especially pleasant assignment. Kay: ......... Edgeworth: Then why!? Why did you become a member of the Yatagarasu!? Yew: Why? There is no \"why\". I was destined to betray everyone from the very beginning. Edgeworth: From the beginning? What is that supposed to mean? Yew: The person I take orders from hasn't changed... Even now, to this day. Edgeworth: ! (Does this mean that the leader of the smuggling ring wasn't Mr. Coachen? Then... the real ringleader is still out there pulling the strings!) Lang: Are you done asking what you need to know? Because if so, we should probably get going. And you're going to tell me everything you did tonight. Do you understand, Shih-na? Yew: I guess I should tell you, then, that I was the one who set the Babahlese Embassy on fire. Edgeworth: And why did you do that? Yew: Ahah... I suppose it was to destroy all evidence of the counterfeit bills. Lang: That was what the smuggling ring was trying to do...? But then, why start two fires!? Yew: Sorry, but I can't tell you anything about the ring. It's your job to complete your investigation, after all. I've had my fun. Now, it's your turn to enjoy the ride. Kay: ...Wait! Ye... I mean, Ms. Shih-na. Yew: Yes? Kay: When I fell to the floor earlier, these fell at my feet. Yew: What about them...? Kay: They're such pretty hair sticks that I thought... well, that I should return them to you. Yew: Ha ha... You can have them. They're of no use to me anymore. If you don't want them, you can always just throw them away. Kay: .........No, I want to keep them. Yew: Ahah... Suit yourself. .........Oh, that's right. I almost forgot, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hm...? Yew: About the second problem I had with your story... I didn't kill anyone tonight. Edgeworth: What...? Yew: I'm not saying that as a sore loser. Think of it as a hint, if you will. Lang: Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: Yes, Agent Lang? Lang: Mark my words, I'm not done here, and I'll be back! And it's got nothing to do with duty or anything, because this has become my personal case. I may have been shot... ...but I'll show you just how dangerous a wounded wolf can be! Edgeworth: (His anger appears to have negated the sensation of pain in his injured leg...) It's finally over, Kay. Kay: I feel like I've peered into her heart a little, you know? And it's so cold, and dark... and incredibly lonely. The person who was giving her all these commands... ...the one who thought my father was a problem to be removed... Edgeworth: That person is the real ringleader behind the smuggling ring! Kay: Um, Mr. Edgeworth, I have a favor to ask. Can you... hold onto these hair sticks for me? They're really pretty, just like the ones they were selling for the Jammin' Ninja show... ...but until this case is over, I don't think I can look at them without being overcome. Edgeworth: ...I understand. I'll take good care of them for you. (Hm...? There is a bit of soil stuck on the ends of these sticks...) Hair Sticks data jotted down in my Organizer. Gumshoe: Oh! I guess it's that time already, huh!? Franziska: So it's midnight... the dawn of another day. Gumshoe: Hey, pops! Thanks a bunch! You've really done a lot for everyone all these years! Edgeworth: Detective Badd, don't tell me today is the day...? Badd: Yeah... it is. With this... I can retire in peace. ...It was down to the wire, and we almost didn't make it... ...but we did it... we solved everything. Edgeworth: But that's just it; we haven't solved everything yet. The ringleader of the smuggling ring you, the Yatagarasu, were chasing after... Badd: ...The legend of that Yatagarasu... is now over. Mr. Edgeworth... That bit of logic earlier... it was brilliant. Edgeworth: ... Badd: I feel like... I can leave it all in your hands. ...I'm counting on you. Kay: Is it really true, Uncle Badd? Were you also a part of the Yatagarasu...? Badd: As I said to you earlier... Kay... I'm truly sorry. I wanted... nothing but a peaceful life for you... Kay: Uncle Badd... Gumshoe: Hey, don't take it so seriously! It's all just one big joke, right!? Franziska: ...Unfortunately, it isn't. Gumshoe: O-Oh, come on, sir! She's just yanking on my chain, isn't she, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Detective Badd... Wait, no, you are no longer a detective... Mr. Badd, I'd like to ask you about the Yatagarasu. Gumshoe: ...Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth... Badd: Mr. Edgeworth... ...Here, I should give these back to you. Edgeworth: These are... ...the pages from my KG-8 case files that the Yatagarasu stole from my office! Gumshoe: Huh? Wait? WHAT!? Badd: Mr. Edgeworth, I must apologize for last night. Edgeworth: So the Yatagarasu who stole into my room was you, was it? Gumshoe: Wait... then that means... WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? T-Tell me it's not true...! Th-That's too insane for me to believe, sir! Badd: It's true... Even if it's not something you want to hear. The KG-8 Incident... It was a very emotionally trying case. We stood in that courtroom... Faraday as the prosecutor... and I as the lead detective. Faraday had... evidence in his possession... that would prove the defendant guilty. However... because it was stolen, the defendant... was found innocent. Yew was... the elder sister... of the victim in the case. When the defendant was pronounced \"not guilty\"... she... let out a great wail. That's when we realized... that there was a limit... to what the law could do. The only way to bring someone like that to justice was to do so outside of the courts... That's what we thought... at the time. ...That's how we... formed the Yatagarasu... ...and vowed to bring to light... any dirty dealings companies had with the ring... ...including companies that dealt with... the Amano Group... Edgeworth: Mr. Amano's conglomerate...? Badd: We called ourselves the Yatagarasu... and flexed our collective muscle... We exposed all sorts of shady dealings... as a warning to the business world as a whole... By doing that... we were able to stop... the higher ups from covering things up. And then... it was finally time... We had finally arrived at the moment when... we'd find out the ringleader's true identity. It was then that Yew literally stabbed us in the heart... and Faraday... he died for it... Edgeworth: .................. Kay: But why...? Wasn't she the sister of the victim in the KG-8 Incident? Badd: ...After Faraday's death, I looked into her past... And that's when I found out... that she was a phony. The victim of the KG-8 Incident, Cece Yew... ...she ...never had a sister. Edgeworth: What? Then that means... Badd: \"Shih-na\" wasn't the only fake name she used! \"Calisto Yew\" was also another pseudonym! From the very beginning... that woman was a spy sent by the smuggling ring! Franziska: She said it herself; \"I was destined to betray everyone from the very beginning.\" Badd: Anyway... Let's return to the real topic at hand... Mr. Edgeworth... this \"trump card\" that we stuck onto this page of the case file... ...please use it wisely. Edgeworth: \"Trump card\"...? Badd: That photo that we stuck on there... Try peeling it off. Behind it... slumbers a piece of evidence... that Faraday hid away all those years ago. Edgeworth: It's the mark of the Yatagarasu... But why? Badd: This is... a \"directives card\"... from the big boss. Take a look... at the back. This was something... Coachen had on him at the time of the KG-8 Incident... ten years ago. That blood... is from the victim of the incident, Ms. Cece Yew... Edgeworth: But why is the card adorned with the mark of the Yatagarasu? Badd: The reason why... we called ourselves... the Yatagarasu... ...was because... of the three-legged raven mark that the smuggling ring's boss used. Apparently, orders from the boss... would come on these cards, without fail. The person who received the order... was supposed to burn it immediately after reading it. And apparently... it burns a bright green flame when set ablaze... Edgeworth: So you mean, the cards were written in Babahlese ink...? Badd: The fact that the card that Coachen was sent made it into Faraday's hand at all... ...is nothing short of a miracle. We decided... that whenever we stole anything... ...we would send a \"card\" along with it... to the police. Edgeworth: So that's what those white cards are! Badd: The Great Thief that used the mark... that only those within the ring would know... It was our message... to the ringleader... ...that we were only a few steps behind. Trump Card data jotted down in my Organizer. Badd: And one more thing... Detective Gumshoe. I'm entrusting this to you. Gumshoe: What is this, sir? Badd: This is what I was talking about earlier. During the KG-8 Incident trial, Faraday had this in his possession... ...this important, definitive piece of evidence... Edgeworth: But I thought it was stolen, How do you have it...? Badd: The person who stole it from us... ten years ago... ...was a man by the name of Ernest Amano... And he had it locked and hidden away... for all this time. But we forced him to tell us where it was finally... after the other day's kidnapping case. Video Tape data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: This video...! Portsman: Wh--! Don't come any closer! I'm warning you! Edgeworth: This is the same video as the one Mr. Portsman was trying to conceal from me! Badd: Yeah, it would seem that even he was caught up in the ring's web. Amano was preparing to take on the boss someday... ...and the video was his insurance. That's where that prosecutor comes in... He was to retrieve the video. On top of that... he was apparently instructed to sneak into your office... ...and steal the trump card... You saw it for yourself, right? The card that told him to preserve the evidence. Edgeworth: Then, that card was not the calling card of the Yatagarasu... ...but rather, a directives card from the ringleader to Mr. Portsman? Badd: The two pieces together make for a strong weapon for whoever holds them. Edgeworth: The evidence Mr. Portsman thought to withhold from me... ...and the one that you stole from my office last night... Both pieces are illegal, and for me to use either one is... Badd: Whether you use them or not... is up to you. But they will be of help to you... when you take on someone who is above the law. Edgeworth: (Is the boss one of those who \"cannot be brought to court\" that Mr. Faraday spoke of?) Detective Badd... There is no limit to the law, for it is the people who determine the limits to them. Badd: You still insist that, even now? You really are something else. I leave the rest in your hands. Now then, Detective Gumshoe. The handcuffs. It's time to lock up... the last remaining member of the Yatagarasu. Gumshoe: Pops... Badd: ...Don't ever lose your detective's spirit. Gumshoe: Nnnnrrrgh... Pops! Why is this happening!? This isn't justice! Badd: Like I always told you... do not get emotionally involved. ...Now let's go. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Is this really the end of a legend...? To be continued \nLang: One of Allebahst's knives was used in Babahl to murder Mr. Coachen. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I concur that this knife crossed over country lines. Lang: Good, but that's not the only thing that did. We mustn't forget about the other weapon! The knife was only one. Lang: And the murder weapon in the killing of DeMasque II is Babahl's Primidux Statue. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you're saying that the Primidux Statue was also brought over by Franziska? Lang: Like I told you before, that's the only way it makes sense! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And how exactly did she bring it over? Lang: I... haven't figured that out yet. Edgeworth: Hmph... That's a rather weak statement, considering how sure you are. Lang: Maybe, but there is one thing I do know for sure. Lang: Somehow, these two objects were able to penetrate the two countries' impenetrable security. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Impenetrable\"...? I should hardly think so. Lang: Lang: You've seen the top of the wall between the two countries, right? Who in the world could cross over that? Kay: Yeah, not even I could climb over that thing with all that barbed wire... Lang: The only way into either embassy is through the doors in the Theatrum Neutralis. So the only way for the knife and the Primidux Statue to traverse the two countries... ...is through those security camera-equipped, well-guarded doors. Present Babahl's Primidux Statue or Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Agent Lang, those two items are not the only two to cross the border tonight.\" Lang: The only one who traversed the two countries just before and after the crimes was you. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was Franziska really the only person to have traveled between the two countries? Lang: According to the guards at both doors, she is the only one to go back and forth. The sis there was in Allebahst when the Yatagarasu showed. And then, just before you guys found Mr. Coachen's body, she entered Babahl. I think we can assume that's when she brought the knife into Babahl. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Then how do you explain the Primidux Statue? Lang: ...I haven't quite figured that out yet. However, the fact that the two weapons crossed the border... ...proves that the killer must have also traveled across the country lines! Edgeworth: (The only things to cross the border are the Primidux Statue and the knife? I should hardly think that those are the only two items, Agent Lang...!) Edgeworth: Agent Lang, those two items are not the only two to cross the border tonight. Lang: Oh? Edgeworth: DeMasque II was killed with Babahl's Primidux Statue, yes. But if that's the case, then tell me, where did Allebahst's Primidux Statue go? Lang: To Babahl...! Edgeworth: Precisely. And if the two statues really were switched... ...then this means that both statues were smuggled across the border at some point. Which means that a total of three items were smuggled across the embassies! Lang: Hmm... I guess so. But you know what? It doesn't matter the number of items, only that the sis is the only one who could've done it! Because the only person who went back and forth between Allebahst and Babahl is her! Edgeworth: (Is that really true? Was there no one else who traveled between the two countries? Actually, there was definitely another person; one who paid a visit to both sides of the wall!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Is that really so, Agent Lang? Lang: Ha ha ha ha! What a lousy time to try and bluff your way out of this! I checked out what the guards said, along with the security cameras' footage. You're not going to overturn my hypothesis that easily! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But suppose there was some other way other than through the theater doors? Lang: What other way...? Edgeworth: (The other entity that managed to cross the border unharmed... If I point it out, it would open up a whole new possibility! And though I hesitate to bring this out... ...as long as this entity exists, the impossible road becomes a possibility.) Lang: It looks like you've got some clever idea in mind. Edgeworth: I do, and I can show it to you through a single piece of evidence. Lang: Tch! Fine, then. Let's see this piece of evidence that will show me this \"other route\"! Edgeworth: This piece of evidence will show us another way to move between the two countries! Present Photo of Yatagarasu Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Agent Lang, I'm sure you are familiar with this unforgettable photo.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I believe this is the piece of evidence that will show you how! Lang: ......... What about it? You're going to have to explain because I don't see another road or anything here (changed from [else] in the original release)! Edgeworth: B-But how can you not see!? Wolves are known for their keen eyesight! Lang: Sorry, but the only thing I see is the crud that you're hoping will stick to the wall. Edgeworth: (I need to think calmly about this and find that other road the smuggled goods took...) Leads back to: \"This piece of evidence will show us another way to move between the two countries!\" Edgeworth: Agent Lang, I'm sure you are familiar with this unforgettable photo. Lang: Tch...! That supernatural photo!? Like I said before... Humans can't fly. Edgeworth: No, of course not. I understand that perfectly well. Lang: And don't start claiming that Shih-na somehow grew wings, either. Edgeworth: I wouldn't dream of claiming that. Lang: And I won't allow you to take back what you've said either! I'll say it again; it's not humanly possible to fly through the air without wings! So you'd better have a good explanation for this, Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: ...Arngh! (But how can I prove who it was that flew through the air in this photo!? Wait. \"Not humanly possible\"...? Eureka...!) Very well. You will have your explanation! Lang: It sounds like you have a good idea simmering inside that head of yours... Let's hear it! The face hidden within this photo's blurry, trailed shadow is...!? Present Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Naturally, the shadow is the third smuggled object, the Primidux Statue replica.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is the face behind the shadow! Lang: Lang: I thought I said that you'd better have a GOOD explanation. I can't make heads or tails of what you're trying to say with that! Edgeworth: Nnrgh! (W-Was I wrong...?) Lang: Come on... Hurry up and show me what that shadow that's flying through the air is! Edgeworth: Even had you not barked that at me, I would've gladly done so, Agent Lang. (I need to go over it one more time. The man-shaped shadow that flew through the air, wrapped in the darkness of the night... Its real shape can only be this one thing!) Leads back to: \"Let's hear it! The face hidden within this photo's blurry, trailed shadow is...!?\" Edgeworth: Naturally, the shadow is the third smuggled object, the Primidux Statue replica. Lang: You can't be serious! Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu... or rather, Calisto Yew dressed as Agent Shih-na, was inside Babahl. She dressed the replica statue up in clothes, and launched it through the air. Lang: Lang: Hah... Mr. Prosecutooooooor! You left out a very crucial bit in your explanation. Edgeworth: I know I did. Lang: She \"launched it through the air\"!? Hah... And how exactly did she do thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (He is literally baring his fangs at me...! But he has a point. How exactly did it move through the air like that? As long as this remains unsolved, we won't be able to move any closer to the truth! Which reminds me, didn't he say this earlier...?) Lang: Hey, sis... I remember that just before Ambassador Alba went to give his speech... ...he called you into his office, right? Edgeworth: (So, just before the murder, Franziska was called here, right into this very room. If that's the case... then that may be another avenue I can pursue.) Agent Lang. In order for me to answer that question... ...I will need to hear testimony from Ms. von Karma. Franziska: ! Lang: Oh...? What are you up to now, pretty boy? Edgeworth: Earlier, you mentioned something of interest to me. You said that just before the murder occurred... ...Ms. von Karma had been in this room because Ambassador Alba had called for her. And for that reason alone, you believe her to be the killer. Lang: Yeah, I guess I did say something like that. Edgeworth: In that case, I believe it is my duty to ask her what her side of the story is. Lang: Hah! Do you really think a criminal would tell us the honest truth? Franziska: How dare you!? As I've said numerous times, there is absolutely no proof that I am the killer! Miles Edgeworth! Don't tell me you suspect me, too!? Edgeworth: I don't. However, I can't ignore the fact that you were in this room at one point in time. Which is why I would like to hear about it from you (changed from [your movements in this room] in the original release). Franziska: Krngh! Edgeworth: Franziska... I feel that I still don't have enough information... ...which is why your testimony is incredibly important to the outcome of this case. Franziska: ............ Alright. So? What would you like me to talk about? Edgeworth: Hmm... I'd like you to please testify to your movements up until you came into this room (changed from [in this room until the murder occurred] in the original release). Lang: Hmph... Alright, let's try this your way for a change. But if what she has to say turns out to be a waste of time... ...I'll place her under arrest faster than you can howl \"Nooooooooooooo!\" Edgeworth: Hmph... As you wish. Testimony -- Movements in Allebahst -- Franziska: As I said earlier, I was assigned to guard duty in the Allebahstian Embassy. After I saw the Steel Samurai off on his way towards the ambassador's office... ...I returned to the rose garden for a bit, and checked up on the security situation. After all the preparations were in place, I was called back by Ambassador Alba to his office. Edgeworth: Franziska, I want us to make this clear from the very beginning... ...so what I wish to confirm is that the only time span in which you were in this office... ...was before the murder occurred. Is that correct? Franziska: Yes, of course. Edgeworth: I see. (For now, the only way that I can see for us to break out of this situation... ...is to ask Franziska about her testimony in more detail.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I thought your duty was to fact-find anything you could about the smuggling ring? Franziska: Yes, that was my job. But upon hearing that the Yatagarasu had sent a calling card to the Embassy... ...Ambassador Alba called upon us to protect the Embassy instead. That incident seven years ago... Or have you forgotten what happened here back then? Edgeworth: Nngh... (Anything related to that case we were involved in appears to be rather painful for her. It's not exactly one I can readily forget myself...) Franziska: Hmph... It looks like you remember the case after all. Edgeworth: Of course I do. Franziska: I inspected every location, every possible escape route... ...and every aspect of the police's security detail. I did all that, then after that... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were at the theater as well? Franziska: Yes, and I suppose you were also there as well, watching that stage show? Edgeworth: Well, yes. (So Franziska was there...) Franziska: Hmph... Well, after the show was over and I saw the Steel Samurai off... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Why did you need to confirm the degree of preparation for even the speech? Franziska: For security's sake, of course. What other reason could I have had? No one knew just how the Yatagarasu had planned on getting in, right? Edgeworth: Yes, I suppose you're right. Franziska: And in the end, the Yatagarasu did choose to appear in the rose garden... Even if it did turn out to be nothing more than a shadow... Arngh... Who would've thought that she would use a shadow!? Edgeworth: Ack! C-Calm down, Franziska! (She must still be nursing a grudge over the fact that she couldn't figure it out herself.) Franziska: Hmph... Anyway, there was no one in the rose garden. And we were aware that the speech was set to start soon thereafter. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: At that time, DeMasque II's body had yet to be found in this room, is that correct? Franziska: That's right. But Ambassador Alba was here. One could hardly miss his rather large presence. Edgeworth: Hmm... Lang: Hmph! A criminal will say anything to get out of getting arrested! How do we know you're not lying!? Franziska: Well, if you need proof, I'd be happy to oblige you. Lang: Seriously!? Franziska: Like I keep telling you... ...when I arrived at this office, Ambassador Alba was already here. He was standing by the flower box on the windowsill, watering his plants. Alba: Ah, I can attest to that. I remember speaking with the lovely lady around that time here in my office. Lang: Grr! Alright, then... Add that statement to your testimony, and let's hear some details. Edgeworth: (So Ambassador Alba was in this room at the time, was he...?) Adds statement \"When I arrived, Ambassador Alba was watering the flowers on the windowsill.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: For the sake of being thorough, I'd like to ask you something. How did you know that Ambassador Alba was watering his plants at the windowsill? Franziska: What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: The entrance to this room is on this side, however, the window is on the opposite side. If what you say is true, then when you entered the room, his body would've been like a wall. He would've been blocking your view of what he was doing. Isn't that not correct? Franziska: I suppose it was a bit hard to see around him. But fortunately for me Ambassador Alba is not an immovable wall. Edgeworth: ...? Franziska: I knocked before I entered, and as I did, he turned around to greet me... ...with a watering can in his hand. So it's only natural to believe that he was watering his plants, right? Edgeworth: I suppose. Franziska: After his greeting, we spent a little time talking about his flowers. He had obtained them himself, and is growing them with the utmost care, you know. Alba: Yes... The plants in this room... They are all like my children. Franziska: The passionflowers in the flower box on the windowsill are growing beautifully, too. All four of them are in full bloom. Edgeworth: ! Ms. von Karma, what did you say just now? Franziska: I said that the flowers are growing beautifully. What about that statement do you not understand? Edgeworth: (What do I not understand? I do not understand why a certain thing is the way it is...) I'd like for you to append that statement to your testimony. Franziska: Very well. Adds statement \"There were four large passionflowers in full bloom in the flower box.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: For the sake of being thorough, I'd like to ask you something.

I should hardly think I could have miscounted such eye-catching flowers. Edgeworth: (There must be a deeper meaning to this statement. And it appears that I must take a gamble on its meaning for me to make any progress!) Edgeworth: (The Primidux Statues were already switched by the time the murder happened. In light of that fact, what Franziska saw in this room before the crime... ...is of incredible importance!)Franziska: As I said earlier, I was assigned to guard duty in the Allebahstian Embassy.

Edgeworth: (There must be a deeper meaning to this statement. And it appears that I must take a gamble on its meaning for me to make any progress!) Present Passionflowers Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Franziska...\" Edgeworth: (The Primidux Statues were already switched by the time the murder happened. In light of that fact, what Franziska saw in this room before the crime... ...is of incredible importance!) Edgeworth: Franziska... For some odd reason... your testimony contradicts with this piece of evidence. Franziska: It does appear that way. Lang: Hah! I know it! I knew we couldn't trust your words, sis! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! What are you doing discrediting Ms. von Karma like this!? Gumshoe: Yeah, sir! If you keep this up, she's gonna get taken away, sir! Eeek! Franziska: All I've done is state what I saw! I have not made (changed from [made not] in the original release) a single mistake in my testimony! And for this... I am still under suspicion for murder. Is the number of flowers really all that important at this juncture, Miles? Edgeworth: At the very least, it is a contradiction in this enigmatic case. One that I find hard to dismiss as irrelevant. Lang: Hah! Then let's hear it, Mr. Prosecutor! What does the number of flowers have to do with anything? What does it prove? Edgeworth: I believe the answer to that will become clear if we were to examine that flower box. (How did this contradiction come about...? There must be something behind this discrepancy!) Alba: Th-They're my beloved flowers. I've grown them with the utmost care. So I ask that you please be gentle with them as you examine them, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hmph... I understand. (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Examine flowers Edgeworth: The name of these flowers... I believe they're called \"passionflowers\". Despite being called \"flowers\", they are actually a species of vine. They appear to be growing well, and are well-supported by these plant supports. Lang: Yeah, but no matter how I look at it, it looks like there are only two here to me! You realize, don't you, sis... Your little lie has failed you! Franziska: Arngh! Miles Edgeworth! Hurry up and shut this man up for me already! Edgeworth: Hmm... (I suppose I will need to use some evidence to \"shut him up\", won't I...?) Show evidence Edgeworth: Hmph... I believe I have just the piece of evidence you require. Lang: Oh? You do, do you!? You have such confidence in the face of your current plight... ...but I highly doubt it'll last until the end! Edgeworth: Hmph... You howl like a wolf, Agent Lang... ...but we'll see if you have any bite to back up that bark after you see the evidence! The truth the passionflowers reveal can be seen in this piece of evidence! Present Hair Sticks Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Shih-na, who was supposedly in Babahl the entire time, had these \"hair sticks\" on her...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well? What do you think now, Agent Lang? Lang: Lang: Hah! You may talk big... but as usual, it's nothing more than a big bluff! Edgeworth: Gnrk! (Was I wrong!? Perhaps I should gather a bit more information before I attempt this again...) Leads back to examination of windowsill Don't have evidence to show Edgeworth: (Not yet... I still have a thing or two left to examine.) Leads back to examination of windowsill Examine watering can Edgeworth: This watering can has a rather robust design. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Why are you telling us stuff we can clearly see for ourselves!? Plus, if you keep wasting time talking about that, Ms. von Karma's gonna get arrested! Edgeworth: Nngh... (I'd better examine something else.) Examine flower box Edgeworth: This flower box... It appears to be made of marble. Franziska: It looks that way. But, so what? Is it something that's so important that you absolutely had to mention it? Edgeworth: N-No, not exactly, but... Franziska: .........Miles Edgeworth. You DO understand our current situation, don't you? Edgeworth: Y-Yes, of course. I am fully aware of the situation. Franziska: Oh? Then in that case, allow me to ask you once again. Is what the flower box is made out of really all that important? Edgeworth: Nngh... (It would appear that the construction of the flower box is not that important.) Examine holes in soil Edgeworth: (Hm...? This patch of soil looks as though it has had something removed from it.) Lang: Heh! What are you doing, Mr. Prosecutor? Why'd you clam up all of a sudden? I'm still here, waiting for an explanation, you know! Edgeworth: Did you know, Agent Lang? Flowers are best appreciated in silence. Lang: ...Tch. Edgeworth: (It looks like two things were pulled out of this flower box...) Edgeworth: Shih-na, who was supposedly in Babahl the entire time, had these \"hair sticks\" on her... ...that look exactly like the plant supports in this flower box. In other words, I believe it can be said that these \"hair sticks\" are in actuality... ...support sticks for the passionflowers! Lang: Heh! And so what!? Is this really all that important to the case? Examine evidence Hair Sticks Top of hair stick Edgeworth: Aha... So this ring-like section... ...is there to support vines like passionflowers up, huh? But if that's all they were meant to do, then what is this notch on the top end? Kay: Maybe it's for string or something to run through? To help the stick stay upright? Edgeworth: A notch for string to run through, huh? Tip of hair stick Edgeworth: I suppose this dirt was from when this plant support was stuck in the flower box. Kay: I guess that's why only the tip is dirty, huh? Edgeworth: Yes. Edgeworth: Of course it is. It means that we've found yet another item that was smuggled between the countries tonight. Lang: Aiya! Edgeworth: Think about it logically, Agent Lang. These sticks were originally in Allebahst... ...but somehow, they wound up in Shih-na's hands, who was in Babahl the whole night. So make no mistake! These sticks were smuggled somehow, just like the knife and statue! Lang: Arngh! Hmph! Very well, then! I want to hear from you exactly how they wound up in Babahl! Edgeworth: (How did these support sticks find their way to Babahl and why? There must be some reason as to why they ended up there... Aha! So that's why!) Agent Lang, if you would please take a look at this and tell me its shape. Lang: Hmph! It's just another stick, isn't it!? Edgeworth: Hmph... And so it is. But the shape of the support sticks is what is important. For when they are used with something in this room, that's when it all comes into focus. And the object that completes the picture when used with the support sticks is...! Present crossbow Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Th-That's a crossbow... Wait! You're not really suggesting...!?\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is what was used with the support sticks! Lang: .........Come again? Edgeworth: Isn't it obvious? Someone used those with this... Franziska: \"Those with this\"...? Could you be any more vague!? Why don't you try again!? Edgeworth: Y-Yes, I suppose I should. (It would appear that this was insufficient in conveying what I had wanted to say. The answer should become obvious to me if I just think calmly about it once more. But the only thing that can really connect the two offices together has to be this!) Leads back to: \"And the object that completes the picture when used with the support sticks is...!\" Lang: Th-That's a crossbow... Wait! You're not really suggesting...!? Edgeworth: I am. These hair sticks... or rather, plant support sticks... They make for perfect  arrows! Lang: Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Edgeworth: (I've done it! I've found the common thread that connects the two offices! But this thread has yet to be completely untangled. Even using the arrows, how does this explain how the statues were transported? Furthermore, who could it have been who fired these sticks as arrows? There MUST be a common thread that ties all of these things together!) Examine evidence Crossbow Arrows Loop on arrow Edgeworth: I thought these loops were just an eccentric design quirk... ...but who knew that they were actually arrow fletchings? Lang: Lang: Mr. Prosecutor! Hold up a second! You do realize what happens when you tie a statue to an arrow, right? They don't fly at all! Argument -- Border-Crossing, Pt. 2 -- Lang: So Babahl's statue was draped in the Yatagarasu's clothes, and then shot over here? Even if you fired the arrows from this side, they wouldn't go far with a statue tied to them! I don't think I need to tell you that the Primidux Statues didn't sprout wings. You're a realist, after all, aren't you? Edgeworth: The Primidux Statues didn't sprout wings...? Hmph. Of course they didn't. Lang: Glad you understand. I feel much better already. I was afraid for a second that you were unaware of that crucial fact! Edgeworth: It's only crucial because you're under the belief that wings are necessary to this equation. Lang: What? Edgeworth: You need to free your mind a bit more, and let it fly like a bird on the wind. The Primidux Statues flew, but not on a wing. Allow me a bit of your time, and I'll explain this mysterious phenomenon to you! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But that incredible scene just happened to have been caught on film, resulting in this photo. Lang: Hah! And what an incredible scene it was! This photo was taken by a freelance photojournalist, right? Edgeworth: Yes, so I hear. Lang: And not every photojournalist is known to be honest, right? Especially not the ones that sell photos of spirits and giant creatures to tabloids. Edgeworth: Yes, I know what you mean. I've seen those sorts of photos many a time in court. But there have been times when those photos have turned out to be telling the truth. If you had ever stood in a court of law, you would know that it's entirely plausible. Lang: Hah! You really believe the stuff you're spewing right now? A courtroom certainly is a strange place, if what you say is true. But there really is something odd about that photo no matter how you look at it. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But we are in agreement that an arrow by itself would reach the other side, correct? Lang: But just the arrow by itself is pretty meaningless, don't you think, Mr. Prosecutor? Because the things they wanted to smuggle were a lot bigger than nothing! Edgeworth: No, that's not necessarily true. Lang: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (What I need right now... ...is not further discussion of my conclusions; it's the launching of my conclusions! What the shooter wanted to launch with the crossbow was not the statues themselves! But rather, something a crossbow can launch that can be used to move the statues!) Adds statement \"If it wasn't a statue that was tied to the arrows, then what did the crossbow launch...?\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The thing the crossbow launched...? Allow me to show you the answer! Lang: Well, come on, then! Show me what you've got! But I warn you! I'll know when you're just bluffing! Edgeworth: This is what was launched from this Allebahstian office with the crossbow! Present Wire Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Finally...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence is what was launched from here in Allebahst! Lang: Lang: And what purpose, exactly, did launching that serve? Because if you're joking, it's not gonna be a fit of laughter I'm about to launch into! Edgeworth: Ack! (That was not the kind of launch I was looking for.) Lang: Hah! I knew you couldn't explain this whole thing in a down-to-earth manner! Leads back to rebuttal Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Finally...\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence is what was launched from here in Allebahst! Lang: Lang: And what purpose, exactly, did launching that serve? Because if you're joking, it's not gonna be a fit of laughter I'm about to launch into! Edgeworth: Ack! (That was not the kind of launch I was looking for.) Lang: Hah! I knew you couldn't explain this whole thing in a down-to-earth manner! Leads back to rebuttal Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. The statues didn't need wings to fly. Lang: Then how would YOU explain things? I'm almost looking forward to whatever fantastical explanation you come up with! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Of course, and I assure you that my hypothesis is firmly grounded in reality. Lang: Hah! Well, all I'm hearing is the fantasy of a desperate man! Edgeworth: At times, even reality itself can be a mysterious thing. Even you must admit that. Lang: Heh, do I? If it's so true, then why don't you go ahead and show me!? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I think I understand what went sailing through the air! Edgeworth: Hmph... I suppose that's because you're an expert at things that fly through the air. Kay: What did you expect from the second Yatagarasu!? Edgeworth: Indeed.

A country torn in two. One to the west... ...and one to the east. When those which were split are made whole again... ...the truth will reveal itself. I-It's the Yatagarasu! The Yatagarasu's here! Edgeworth: You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! Edgeworth: (It's so nice, almost dreamlike, to finally have the chance to relax and sip some tea. Especially after what a whirlwind the past few days have been.) On my return flight, I was dragged into a case involving an Interpol agent's murder. The next day, I investigated a kidnapping and a murder at the Gatewater Land theme park. And later that night, a detective's dead body welcomed me back to my office... ...along with a thief who was out to pilfer files related to a case from 10 years ago. (How did I manage to find myself in the middle of so many cases back to back? Well, at least I have today. All I ask is that I be allowed to spend it quietly.) ???: Mr. Edgewooooorth! This is big! Big, I tell you! ...Hey, what's wrong with you? Where's your enthusiasm...? Edgeworth: And suddenly, the phrase \"the fragility of dreams\" comes to mind... Kay: What are you talking about, \"fragile dreams\"!? Come on, let's go! The fake Yatagarasu isn't going to just find herself, you know! Edgeworth: Well, if you must know... it's possible that I was paid a visit last night by your \"fake\". Kay: Say what? Edgeworth: ......... Edgeworth: Unfortunately for us, the thief managed to escape. But even now, we're still looking for this criminal. However, I must warn you that we've only had a few hours to search so far... ...so I must insist that you be patient on this one, Kay. Kay: Wh-What's with you today...? Are you sure you aren't sleep-talking to me right now? Anyway, I've got something much more important that I want you to see! Edgeworth: Oh, and that is? Kay: Take a look at this! Edgeworth: \"On March 14th, I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" That's quite a bold declaration to send to an embassy... (I suppose it was inevitable that a newspaper would catch wind of this.) Kay: The date the card mentions is today! Edgeworth: Today, huh... Kay: Come on, we've gotta hurry! The embassy awaits! Edgeworth: I suppose it IS quite an urgent matter... ...however, do you know which country's embassy we should be investigating? Kay: Well, it's some really special country, and I'm actually really fuzzy on the details... But never mind that! Where's all your energy!? Why are you so lackadaisical today!? Edgeworth: I'm not, Kay. You're just too wound up. Kay: Well, then you should get too wound up, too! Because this just might be our chance to catch that woman! Edgeworth: You mean Ms. Yew? (The woman who killed Kay's father, Byrne Faraday, seven years ago... Calisto Yew... She claimed to be the Great Thief Yatagarasu... ...and then disappeared from the courtroom.) Kay: Argh! She makes me so mad! The phony! Everyone knows that the real Yatagarasu would never send something like a calling card! Until a company's underhanded dealings are made public... ...the target is always totally unaware that the Yatagarasu has paid them a visit. That's what makes the real Yatagarasu so awesome! Edgeworth: Hmm... The Yatagarasu's card that's shown in this article... It looks to me as though it could be genuine. Kay: See, that's the thing. Whoever it is, that person isn't the real deal, but has knowledge of the Yatagarasu. If this isn't a clue that that woman's involved, then nothing is! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Out the door you go! Edgeworth: Wait, there are a few preparations I must make before we go... (There's something interesting about this card we found last night here in my office... It's of a different color than the one in the article, which makes me wonder why.) Kay: What's up? Any reason why you're boring a hole through the newspaper with your eyes? Edgeworth: No... No reason at all. Very well. Seeing as how Ms. Yew is also someone of a special nature to me... ...I agree there is some merit to be found in investigating this. Kay: I knew you'd come around! ???: By the light of this night's glorious moon... We are ready! Pink Princess: Ready to embark on our nightly outing. Steel Samurai: And this is where... ...our tale begins! Edgeworth: Heh... What a coincidence. Who would've thought that a Steel Samurai stage show... ...would ever be held at such an elegant theater inside a foreign embassy? Kay: Yeah! The climax was really awesome! \"Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!\" I got chills down my spine when he pulled that move out! Edgeworth: I suppose it really is more impactful to watch a show in person than on television. Kay: I have to say, though, this embassy is set up kinda funny. I mean, they have two countries sharing the same building! Edgeworth: Well, as you said yourself, this place and the countries it houses are very special. Even this theater is special in that it is a neutral zone shared by the two countries. Kay: Umm... So, let me get this straight... The Steel Samurai show just now is being sponsored by one of the two countries. The one that's called the Kingdom of Allebahst, right? Edgeworth: Yes, it would appear that the Steel Samurai is very popular in that country as well. Kay: Seems that way! But you know who I'M really into? The Jammin' Ninja! The Republic of Babahl is sponsoring a Jammin' Ninja stage show! That's something for fangirls like me! We've totally gotta see that too, Mr. Edgeworth! The Jammin' Ninja's show is gonna kick the Steel Samurai show's rear end! Edgeworth: (You know, ever since I first met this girl, I've always had this inkling... ...that what she really wants to be... ...is not a thief, but rather, a ninja...) Kay: So anyway, about today's event... umm... What's it called again? Edgeworth: \"The Kingdom of Allebahst versus The Republic of Babahl Goodwill Jubilee\". The small, European countries of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...and the Republic of Babahl. These two countries used to be a single entity that was abundant with nature. And it was called... the Principality of Cohdopia. .................. Kay: Hm? Is everything alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Yes, I'm alright. Moving on... After a period of civil unrest, the country split in two, though signs of their past remain. For example, their flags preserve the flower and butterfly motifs to this day. ......... (Cohdopia, huh... The KG-8 Incident... and what was referred to as the second KG-8 Incident... ...in which an Embassy staff member was murdered... Both of these cases were related to the Principality of Cohdopia. In the seven years that have passed, the country may have split into two... ...however, the Yatagarasu still sent a calling card here. What could it all mean?) ......... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I know you're thinking about something! Edgeworth: Oh, excuse me. What were we talking about again? Kay: Argh, if you could please stop spacing out on me! Anyway, we were talking about the Allebahst versus Babahl Goodwill Jubilee. The two countries have had a pretty bad relationship with each other... ...but supposedly, they've been trying really hard to make up recently. That's why they decided to hold this event. Edgeworth: (If that's the case, then why the \"versus\"...?) Kay: Also, both countries claim to own the real \"Primidux Statue\", a national treasure to both. They're planning to have them publicly evaluated today, to see which one's the real deal. Edgeworth: Kay, need I remind you to take care and not succumb to your thieving desires? Kay: Well, when it comes to treasure, I can't help myself. You know that! Edgeworth: (Nngh... She had better be saying that in jest...) Kay: Hey! I can read your body language, you know! And you've got it all wrong! Look! I'm here to do some investigating! INVESTIGATING, I tell you! Edgeworth: Heh, I know. And although we don't know if the Yatagarasu will really make an appearance... ...I suppose we should still spend some time examining this place. After examining pamphlets: Edgeworth: I suppose I'll just help myself to one of these... Embassy Guide stuck into the pages of my Organizer. Edgeworth: (Hm? What is all the hubbub?) Ack! Kay: Hey, look! It's the Steel Samurai! And he's got his son, the Iron Infant, with him!! Edgeworth: May I speak with you for a second? (...It's... the Steel Samurai...) Steel Samurai: ......... Edgeworth: ......... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! What are you glaring at him for!? Edgeworth: Ahem, please excuse me. It's just that I've never seen a super-hero up close before. Steel Samurai: ......... Kay: It looks like he's written something down for you! Edgeworth: \"To Edgeworth, From Steel Samurai Daddy: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo\" Kay: Wow, an autograph! Pretty cool that you got one, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Heh... Steel Samurai's Autograph received. Guard: Mr. Steel Samurai! Ambassador Alba is waiting for you! Reporter: And now the Steel Samurai... ...will proceed to enter the Kingdom of Allebahst to shake the hand of the ambassador. The Steel Samurai isn't only here for the two countries tonight... ...but rather, can be thought of as a goodwill ambassador from our own country as well! Kay: There he goes. Off to spread goodwill to the world. Edgeworth: He really does seem like a goodwill ambassador, doesn't he? Cameraman: OK! We're shooting the next segment now! Cue camera! Reporter: In just a few seconds, the Jammin' Ninja stage show is set to begin. After the show, the Jammin' Ninja will enter the Republic of Babahl. He is set to meet with the Ambassador of Babahl at that time. Kay: AHH! The Jammin' Ninja's show is about to start! We've gotta get back to our seats! Edgeworth: Regrettably... I don't have much of an interest in ninjas... Kay: Well, this show will change your mind! Come on, we have to hurry! If we miss even a second of the Jammin' Ninja's awesome playing, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I suppose you're not about to give me much of a choice here, are you, Kay?) Kay: Ahhh! I could listen to that \"A Ninja Marked for Death's Lullaby\" song all day! His superb playing and that sad melody really brought a tear to my eye! And his heart-wrenching voice! Now THAT'S the Jammin' Ninja's greatest weapon! Edgeworth: .................. Kay: Ahh! Those pieces of Jammin' Ninja merchandise over there! I've got to have them! I especially want the hair sticks they're selling exclusively at these shows. They're exactly like the ones the heroine, Princess Misola, wears in her hair! Edgeworth: ...Anyway. Kay: Anyway!? ANYWAY!? Hold it right there, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: You're thinking of going home, aren't you!? Edgeworth: Well, it doesn't seem likely that the Yatagarasu will be making an appearance tonight. Most likely, it was simply a prank. Kay: No way! I just know the Yatagarasu will show! Edgeworth: But I thought you said that the Yatagarasu doesn't send calling cards. Kay: Yeah, I did, but... Edgeworth: I figured from the very beginning that this would wind up being a wild goose chase. Kay: But that card she sent was a genuine fake calling card! Edgeworth: A genuine fake...? Kay: Well, how can I word this...? The Yatagarasu's mark that's on the calling card is exactly the same as my mark. Get it now? Officer: W-We've got a problem! Th-The Yatagarasu has been spotted in Allebahst! Edgeworth: What!? Kay: You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Hah! So you finally decided to show yourself, you phony! Hey, what gives!? Guard: I'm sorry but I will need to search you before you may enter. Kay: What the!? Hey! The Steel Samurai just waltzed straight on through without one! Now if you don't hurry up and let me through, my phony is going to escape! Edgeworth: Kay, a country's embassy is considered to be a part of the country itself. If you don't go through the proper procedures to enter the country... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I'm going to enter through Babahl and climb over the wall into Allebahst! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You would tell a prosecutor straight out that you intend to illegally enter another... Kay, are you listening to me!? Kay: Kay Faraday, and I'm coming through! Guard: Yes, and welcome! Edgeworth: Someone stop her! Anyone! Edgeworth: *huff, huff, huff*... Kay... Where are you? Don't tell me you really did find some way over this fence... Ack! Guard: Fire! This is too big for us to handle! Looks like the Yatagarasu came to Babahl, too! Edgeworth: You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! You had better be alright, wherever you are! Kay: I told you! It wasn't me! Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: *huff, huff, huff*... Kay! Are you alright!? Kay: Do I look alright to you!? Now, can you do something about this woman!? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe! What is the meaning of this!? Gumshoe: *sigh* Well, sir... it's um, this. Edgeworth: He's...! Kay: It wasn't me! He was already dead when I ran in here, hot on the heels of the fake Yatagarasu! Look, I only came in here because I saw a suspicious person at the open-air stage! Edgeworth: A suspicious person? Kay: A long, black coat and a hood over their head -- I dare you to tell me that's not suspicious! When I saw that person, I immediately thought that they must be the fake Yatagarasu. So I chased after them into the Embassy, then into here, and then lost sight of them... But I just KNOW that person is the one who did it! Shih-na: What are you so worked up over? There is no reason for you to be this loud. Edgeworth: Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're Agent Lang's secretary... ...Shih-na, I believe your name is, correct? Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: And if you are making an arrest... ...I assume you have evidence that it was Kay who committed the crime, is that also correct? Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: You refuse to answer!? Shih-na: I don't need to answer. Edgeworth: ! Shih-na: You are merely a prosecutor in this country, meaning you have no investigative authority. Gumshoe: H-Hey, pal! Just what the heck does what you just said mean!? If it happened here, it's under Mr. Edgeworth's jurisdiction. The end. And seeing as how this building is sitting on our soil, we can investigate wherever we'd like! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, Detective, embassies are a different matter. Gumshoe: Huh? Edgeworth: This office is considered to be a part of the Republic of Babahl. Which means that anything that happens in here... ...defaults to the control of the Babahlese government and Babahlese law... ...giving them exclusive extraterritorial rights. Gumshoe: Extraterrestrial (changed from [Extraterristrial] in the original release, correcting the typo) rights? Sir, do you really believe that the truth is out there!? Edgeworth: *sigh* Basically, our country's laws do not apply inside the embassy of another country. That's what was agreed to by our respective governments. Our authority to investigate was effectively nullified the second we entered this place. Which means we can do little here in this situation... Gumshoe: N-No way, sir! Shih-na: Please leave this matter in Interpol's hands and go home. Edgeworth: N...Nnnnngh... Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Kay: H-Hey, you're not...!? Mr. Edgeworth! ???: ???: In that case... allow me to join your investigation. Gumshoe: M-Ms. von Karma! Eeek! Franziska: Ambassador Palaeno, I truly appreciate you allowing me to join the investigation. Palaeno: It's really nothing. Manny was my secretariat, so of course I want to help you as much as I can. In fact, it's a blessing that Interpol agents were able to make it so quickly. Edgeworth: Franziska... Franziska: Well, well. I never imagined that I'd meet you here of all places. This is an embassy, meaning that you have no authority to conduct... Edgeworth: Franziska: A-Already!? What is it!? Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno. Palaeno: Hm? And you are? Edgeworth: I'm Miles Edgeworth, public prosecutor. I ask that you please allow me to investigate this case as Ms. von Karma's assistant. Gumshoe: A...Assistant? Franziska: Miles!? What the heck do you think you're...!? Edgeworth: Please, I implore you, Ambassador Palaeno. Palaeno: Very well. I'll be counting on the two of you, Ms. von Karma and Mr. Edgeworth. Gumshoe: Umm... What did you mean by you'll be Ms. von Karma's assistant...? Edgeworth: I don't exactly have a choice, do I, Detective? If I don't become Franziska's assistant, I can't participate in this investigation. Franziska: Hmph. There you go again, running at the mouth with that aloof expression on your face. Edgeworth: Franziska, please... Franziska: I don't know what you're planning quite yet... ...but at least I do know one thing -- that you are now my subordinate. Just remember that my whip is always ready to wake you, should you have a brain lapse. Edgeworth: Of course. I'll keep that in mind. Shih-na: ...If you are done playing games...! Edgeworth: Right. let's begin the investigation. Edgeworth: By the way, Detective... I suppose it's a bit late to be asking, but why are you here? Gumshoe: Well, better late than never, I guess, sir. I was placed on guard duty for the Babahlese Embassy today! Edgeworth: And why are our police guarding an embassy? Gumshoe: Well, on account of the card they got from the Yatagarasu... ...they called us up and asked for our help, sir. Oh, and because we've been searching for the Yatagarasu these past seven years! It was a more or less mutually beneficial arrangement, if you ask me! Edgeworth: Except for how mutually unbeneficial this has all turned out to be, I suppose. It looks like you failed to competently perform your guard duty yet again. Gumshoe: Ack...! Edgeworth: Look forward to your next salary negotiation... although, it's out of my hands. Gumshoe: But sir! If it gets cut any more, I won't be able to buy even instant (changed from [packet] in the original release) noodles anymore... After connecting \"Locked safe\" and \"Key used at Embassy\" Logic: Edgeworth: We know for a fact that the Yatagarasu's Key was used at this embassy. Furthermore, we found it in the victim, Mr. Coachen's pocket. Which leads me to think that perhaps it is the key to the personal safe in this office. Gumshoe: Good thinking, sir! Let's go try it out! Edgeworth: ...It appears I was correct. (The key that was left to us in the victim's pocket... It literally turned out to be the key to the next piece of the truth!) Hmm... What do we have here? Gumshoe: Hey! There's nothing inside! D-Do you think the Yatagarasu made off with everything, sir? Edgeworth: No, Detective, I believe all we need is a closer look. Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: What is this here? Gumshoe: It looks like the ripped corner of a piece of paper, sir. Edgeworth: No, I don't think it's ripped; it seems more, to me, like it's stuck in the safe. Gumshoe: Hey, you're right! It won't budge an inch, not even when I tug on it! But I don't think I've ever seen paper stuck on the inside of a safe before... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective, I think you have it backwards. It's not the paper that's strange... It's the safe. Gumshoe: What do you mean? Edgeworth: What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that... Edgeworth: Even just eye-balling it, you can see that the inside is a bit too shallow. Furthermore, with the unnatural way the paper is stuck at the back of the safe... ...I'd say that there is an extra bit of space behind the back wall of this safe! In other words, this safe has a second compartment. Gumshoe: Wh-Whaaaaaaat!? Franziska: I suppose that you are correct in asserting that the paper is stuck in an unnatural manner. However, if what you say is correct and there is a second compartment... ...how do we go about opening the door to it then? As you can see, there is no other lock or keyhole in sight. Edgeworth: Actually, there is one more spot of interest to me on this safe. Franziska: Oh? Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe that spot is the keyhole to our mystery second lock! Franziska: The safe and its locks... Alright then, since you are so sure of yourself, show me how you deduced your answer! Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: Doesn't the shape of this keyhole remind you of something, Franziska? Franziska: The shape? It does look very familiar... However, I believe it's simply a latch hole for the safe's lock mechanism. It's just for keeping the door shut, nothing more. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is that so? The person who used this safe... ...Mr. Coachen, made sure this safe had two compartments, in order to hide something. Do you honestly think someone like that would allow the keyhole to the hidden half... ...to look so obviously like a keyhole that even the average person could figure it out? Franziska: ! ...You can't be serious...! Are you saying that this hole is the keyhole to the hidden compartment of this safe? Edgeworth: That's precisely what I'm saying. Franziska: ...! Edgeworth: And I will prove to you right now... ...that the Yatagarasu's Key is the key that will open it! Franziska: Franziska: The Yatagarasu's Key!? Miles Edgeworth! This had better be a very bad joke! Edgeworth: Sorry, but this is no joke. The Yatagarasu's Key... ...is the very key that will open the second compartment of this safe. Franziska: We know that this key opens the first compartment of the safe. But the keyhole you're talking about... ...is of an entirely different shape than that of the key! Leads to examination of Yatagarasu's Key Edgeworth: Let's go over this again, shall we? The Yatagarasu's Key... ...was originally made to open Mr. Coachen's safe in the Cohdopian Embassy. We confirmed that as fact by opening the door to his safe with it. Now, let's take a look at the back end of the key. Looking at the knife portion head on, what do you see? Franziska: What are you talking... Aaah! Edgeworth: It appears that you've come to understand what I'm talking about. When viewed head-on, the knife's blade is the exact same shape as the keyhole! The real function of the knife portion is to act as the key to the hidden portion of the safe. Franziska: B-But that's... preposterous! Edgeworth: Because it looks like a knife and was used like one to kill Mr. Faraday seven years ago... ...we fell under the misconception that it was always meant to be a knife. But for both the safe and its key to conceal such clever tricks... ...whatever is hidden inside the secret section must be of incredible importance. Franziska: .........Then, it's even possible that what I've been searching for is inside! Scruffy! Hurry up and open that safe! Gumshoe: Eeeek! Y-Yes, sir! Opening it now, sir! Edgeworth: These items... They're...! Gumshoe: It's a bunch of funny-shaped things. I guess they're pieces of art, huh, siiiiir!? Franziska: You're in the way! Now, move, Scruffy! Gumshoe: I didn't think I was in the way... *sniffle* Franziska: These pieces of art...! They're identical to ones that have been stolen from various countries around the world! Edgeworth: I figured as much... These are the treasures this section of the safe was to hide from view! Hmm... I believe a more thorough examination is required. Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: Take a good look at these documents, Franziska. Franziska: It says that there are three pages in total, and yet, there are only two here. Edgeworth: Correct. Now take a look at the smuggling activity document in your possession. Tell me, is it not possible that your page was taken from this set of three? Franziska: Well, well... It certainly looks that way. Edgeworth: By putting our multi-part puzzle together, we seem to have arrived at an answer. And it seems that you have now found what you were looking for. Franziska: Yes, and with this, it has become crystal clear... ...that Mr. Coachen himself was responsible for the mass smuggling of Babahlese ink! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink? Franziska: Babahlese ink is a special product of the Republic of Babahl. However, due to a special reason, only a limited volume is ever exported. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And that reason is...? Franziska: That's classified. It's on a need to know basis, and you don't need to know. In any case, it seems that the head of the smuggling ring was our victim, Mr. Manny Coachen. Edgeworth: His base was in an embassy, thus, it was hard for both our country and his to interfere. Making it the ideal conditions under which to run a smuggling operation. Franziska: Argh... but it's so frustrating. I lost the person I was to rain judgment down upon with my Whip of Justice. Edgeworth: Well, even if he is dead, we still have a responsibility to look into his misdeeds. Franziska: You expect me to whip a dead man? ...Well, I'm not interested. Edgeworth: Franziska... You must know... ...that Manny Coachen was the suspect in the KG-8 Incident... Franziska: Of course I know! On top of being the head of the smuggling ring... ...there is the matter of what really happened in that case that needs to be resolved. After connecting \"Motif on knife handle\" and \"Butterfly of Babahl\" Logic, and examining golden statue and knife rack: Shih-na: ...Are you done investigating? Edgeworth: .................. Shih-na: You realize now, don't you? That this girl is the only one it could be. Now come along quietly, Yatagarasu... Kay Faraday. You are under arrest for the murder of Manny Coachen. Kay: M...Mr. Edgeworth! Please, you have to believe me! I didn't do it! I chased the fake Yatagarasu in here... and he... he was already... Shih-na: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'd like to help you reduce the number of mistaken arrests Interpol makes. Shih-na: ...What is that supposed to mean? Edgeworth: I believe I told you that Kay Faraday is not the culprit of this crime. Shih-na: ...Very well. I suppose I have no choice. I'll show you just how foolish your claims are! Shih-na: Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight. Utilizing the confusion caused by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy. Furthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu. And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body. Edgeworth: Your reason for suspecting Kay is because you think she is the Yatagarasu? Shih-na: ...Exactly. But it isn't just me. She calls herself the Yatagarasu. Kay: Argh! Look, how many times do I have to tell you!? I was only out to capture the fake Yatagarasu! Shih-na: Imposter or not... it matters not. A Yatagarasu is a Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: Very well. Then I shall prove that Kay is not the Yatagarasu who killed Mr. Manny Coachen! Shih-na: ...Go ahead and try. Show me what the prosecutors of this country are made of. Shih-na: Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight. Shih-na: Utilizing the confusion caused by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy. Shih-na: Furthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu. Shih-na: She wanted to steal documents regarding smuggling, so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Shih-na: And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body. Edgeworth: (So Agent Shih-na suspects Kay of murder simply because Kay is the Yatagarasu. But if I can prove that the Yatagarasu's goal is not related to murder... ...then I may be able to begin to reason with her!) Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na. I regret to inform you, but there is a flaw in your logic. Shih-na: Oh? Edgeworth: Even if you claim that she is the killer, and the Yatagarasu... ...I am certain that securing the smuggling documents is not the motive behind the murder! The key to the safe in this room was found on Mr. Coachen's body. Furthermore, the Yatagarasu would not be so stupid as to leave without the documents. Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: By the simple fact that the documents were still in the safe when we looked... ...it's obvious that the killer's target was not the safe at all! Shih-na: Shih-na: Then perhaps she didn't know that Mr. Coachen had the key on him. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If that's the case, then why would she have needed to kill him? Because I can think of no reason for her to kill him if she had not known that fact! Shih-na: Shih-na: Need, reason... All of this is simply our conjecturing after the fact. It's entirely possible that she accidentally killed him when she was sneaking him. Edgeworth: .........! Shih-na: Perhaps she didn't notice the safe's second compartment before returning the key. Edgeworth: Arngh! Shih-na: But the fact still remains... that Mr. Coachen was stabbed to death. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But you have no definitive proof that it was Kay who committed the act! Shih-na: Shih-na: ...Actually, I do. I saw her holding the knife she used on the victim with my own eyes. Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? Shih-na: ...Allow me to tell you a bit more about the evidence that will put her away behind bars. Shih-na: The knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife. The knife with the butterfly handle is the murder weapon, which the killer was holding. I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim. The knife is a part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other. The evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument. Edgeworth: Nnnnnrrrrrgh... Th-That is your definitive evidence...!? Shih-na: You see now that she is definitely the killer, right? Kay: No! Mr. Edgeworth, you've gotta believe me! I saw a suspicious person in a long black coat outside the Embassy, I swear! Edgeworth: And you came in here because you were chasing this suspicious person? Kay: That's right. I ran into this office only because I was chasing after that person... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the lights, but then... Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ???: ...Who's there!? Shih-na: This is... Shih-na: I came to this room upon hearing the girl's scream. And when I saw her holding the knife, I immediately restrained her. Edgeworth: So the object Kay felt by her feet on the floor was the murder weapon...!? Shih-na: I had the knife analyzed right away, but we failed to find anyone's (changed from [anyone] in the original release, correcting the typo) prints on it. Kay: But the suspicious person in the black coat who came into this room before me...! Shih-na: Shih-na: You continue to insist there was such a person, but if there was, where did they go? Kay: That... I don't know. But I know they came in here! Shih-na: Shih-na: That sounds like the desperate excuses of a suspected killer, not a trustworthy testimony. You understand, don't you? We can't trust this girl's words, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Gnnrk! (She has a point. Even if Kay's words are the truth... ...I must show that they are with some solid evidence!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I really didn't...! Edgeworth: ! Kay... Don't worry. If you didn't do it, then there must exist a way for me to prove that. Shih-na: Shih-na: Still not giving up, I see. In that case, try to counter my argument, if you can. Edgeworth: Don't worry, I can and I will! Shih-na: The knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife. Shih-na: The knife with the butterfly handle is the murder weapon, which the killer was holding. Shih-na: I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim. Shih-na: The knife is a part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other. Shih-na: The evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument. Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na's proof is the Babahlese knife that Kay was allegedly holding. Gumshoe: Yeah... So, um, how are you going to prove that Kay didn't do it, sir? Edgeworth: If Agent Shih-na wants to suspect Kay merely because Kay was the only one here... ...then I must show with evidence that Kay couldn't have committed the murder! Gumshoe: Um, but do you have such evidence, sir? Edgeworth: Yes. There is one piece of evidence that seems very unnatural to me. ...And I believe it is my duty to point that out to Agent Shih-na. Edgeworth: So the murder weapon was the knife with the butterfly design on it. But is that really the truth? Shih-na: What are you getting at? Edgeworth: I'd like for you to take a look at this. There is blood on the blade, and yet, there's not a speck of blood on the handle. This signifies that at the time of the crime, a different handle was attached to this blade. The knife that Kay was holding... ...had its handle switched, and was, in fact, not the real murder weapon! Shih-na: It wasn't... the real murder weapon!? Edgeworth: This knife can be taken apart. Shall we give it a go? Leads to examination of Babahlese knife Edgeworth: As you can see, the Babahlese knife has now been disassembled into two parts. The killer must have pulled the murder weapon out of the victim's body... ...and proceeded to swap the knife's original handle with this butterfly one. It was all to create the illusion that Mr. Coachen was killed with the butterfly-themed knife! Shih-na: Uurrnngh... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: (This should clear up any and all suspicion surrounding Kay.) Babahlese Knife Handle data jotted down in my Organizer. Shih-na: Your argument isn't airtight yet! Edgeworth: How so? Shih-na: It's possible... that the girl herself is the one who switched the handles. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! For what purpose would she do such a thing!? Shih-na: I don't care to know how a criminal thinks. The way they view the world is beyond the comprehension of a normal person like myself. Therefore, I wouldn't put anything past them, no matter how odd it may seem. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Heh. The truth is right there in front of you, and this knife will show you the way! You will come to see that Kay is not and could not have been Mr. Coachen's killer! Leads to examination of Babahlese knife Shih-na: What is this mark on here? Edgeworth: It's the mark of a flower. I assume you know what this means? Shih-na: No, not really. Butterflies rest on flowers all the time to drink their sweet nectar. Edgeworth: ...And so they do. (However, would this butterfly really drink the nectar of this flower? The answer is clearly... not a chance! Now to prove the relationship between the butterfly and the flower with this!) Shih-na: ! Y-You can't be serious...! Edgeworth: Hmph... It appears that you've made the connection. The flower on this blade is designed after a certain country's national symbol. That's right... The Kingdom of Allebahst. In other words... This blade is from one of Allebahst's ornamental knives! Shih-na: Aah! Edgeworth: This part of the knife handle... ...has Babahl's national symbol of the butterfly on it. Therefore, it is undeniably Babahlese in origin! But as we both know, you can't kill someone with just a knife handle. Incidentally, when exactly did the murder occur again, Agent Shih-na? Shih-na: Ack! After the fire had broken out... Edgeworth: That's right. Kay entered the Babahlese Embassy after the fire had taken place. Furthermore, she had not been to the Allebahstian side of the building before then. On top of that, not a single person passed between the two countries during the fire... ...which means that Kay could not have transported an Allebahstian object over here! This makes it impossible for her to be the true killer! Shih-na: ..................! Gumshoe: Whooooop! Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! What a great victory! Edgeworth: .................. Franziska: .................. Shih-na: .................. Gumshoe: Huh? Hey, why is everyone so quiet...? Edgeworth: (I'm happy we got this far and cleared Kay's name... ...but what worries me now is what will happen next.) Franziska: Franziska: What is the meaning of this!? An Allebahstian knife, here...!? Edgeworth: Do you mean... how did this find its way to the Republic of Babahl? It didn't just find its way over. Rather, we should focus on how it was smuggled over! Kay: You know what!? My brain hurts thinking about it while we're just standing around! Thinking while you're on the run? Now THAT'S the way a real Great Thief operates! Edgeworth: Kay...? Kay: Oh, thanks a bunch, Mr. Edgeworth! For proving me innocent, I mean! You believed in me the whole time, right? Tell me you did! Edgeworth: Umm, not really, but... Kay: Ha ha. Come on, you don't have to be shy about it! Shih-na: Shih-na: ...Your argument is still not airtight. Edgeworth: Would you care to elaborate? Shih-na: I understand now that the girl didn't commit the murder. However, there is still the possibility that she is the Yatagarasu. Kay: That again!? Look, how many times do I have to explain it to you!? I am the real Yatagarasu! I'm not like that fake one that goes around setting fires, OK!? Shih-na: Whether you're the real deal or a fake, it doesn't really matter. All I have to say is this: I have my suspicions that this girl is the one who started the fire. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Preposterous! On what grounds do you suspect her of such a thing!? Shih-na: The fact that she calls herself the Yatagarasu. That in itself is the (changed from [a] in the original release) most elegant proof. Kay: Ms. Shih-na. Shih-na: Yes? Kay: I... have no intention of taking back any of what I've said. Shih-na: ...? Kay: I am the Great Thief Yatagarasu. And I refuse to allow some imposter to claim that name as their own! The path of justice that my father pointed me towards... I will walk it the best I can! Shih-na: It's not good to be so stubborn. I hope you can understand that. Kay: Thanks a lot for the concern, Ms. Shih-na! Let me share something with you, too, as a token of my appreciation! Those sunglasses totally do nothing for you, so I'll steal them from you next time, OK!? Shih-na: Wh--!? Kay: Well, I guess we'd better get going! Franziska: Going...? To where? Kay: To the Kingdom of Allebahst! If we don't go, we won't know for sure, right? Franziska: I suppose not... We won't get anywhere simply by standing here thinking. To see where the Allebahstian knife came from... ...we'll have to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. Let's go, Miles Edgeworth. As you are my subordinate... I will not tolerate you bringing the investigation to a halt. Edgeworth: Hmph... Understood. To be continued MIB: Count off! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! ...1! 1! MIB: Shifu! 99 callouts! So all 99 members are most likely here and accounted for, sir! Lang: ...Hey, you. Yeah, you, the second #1 from my right. Officer: Sir! Yes, sir!? Lang: Here... A birthday present for you. Officer: Wha...?? MIB: Shifu! I didn't know that you knew all of our birthdays...! Officer: What a kind heart you have! Shifu, you are more of a man than we'll ever be, sir! Officer: Umm... I'm really sorry, but it's not my birthday... Lang: Lang Zi says: \"A cub who disrespects others soon feels the disciplinary bite of an elder.\" That present isn't for you. It's for your younger brother's wife's younger brother. ...Tell him I said \"hi\", and \"happy birthday\", won't you? Officer: Y...Yes, sir! MIB: Shifu! I can't believe you remember that much about each of us! Officer: Shifu! I... I'm so moved that I can't stop crying! Edgeworth: (...I should probably leave them to their \"alone time\".) Lang: Alright, meeting's over. Everyone... head for your posts! Dismissed! Sir! Lang: Yo, were you guys there the whole time? I got a call from Shih-na, and she's already filled me in. It sounds like you're out to get in my way again. Edgeworth: I have absolutely no intention of interrupting your investigation. I simply request that you grant me permission to investigate the Allebahstian Embassy. Lang: Hmph. And what if I say no? Franziska: Franziska: Agent Lang! This man is my subordinate. As I have received permission from the ambassador, he is to be extended the same rights. Lang: Sorry, sis, but it's not that simple. Allebahst has the strictest immigration regulations in the world, or didn't you know? Even among my elite men, about only half of them were admitted into the country. Besides, any more cooks in the kitchen, and we might spoil the soup, if you get what I mean. Franziska: How dare you make such assumptions!? Lang: Don't take this the wrong way, but I thought I was in charge of Allebahst, Ms. von Karma. Franziska: Grrr! Lang: Look, try to understand, OK? Things over in Allebahst are a bit of a mess right now. Edgeworth: What do you mean by \"a bit of a mess\"? Lang: No one told you? We had an \"incident\" in Allebahst as well. This is what we call a decision based on the investigation, Mr. Prosecutor. Kay: Look, Wolfy! Just let us in already! ???: ???: Is there a problem here, Agent Lang? Lang: Not really. Just having a \"discussion\" about whether or not to let these guys in. Franziska: Ambassador Alba, I ask that you please allow these people to join the investigation. Alba: Having a debate because of my country... I'm terribly sorry for placing you good people in that kind of situation... It is all because I lacked the strength to govern well. Edgeworth: Please, it is nothing of the sort, Ambassador... Alba: You weakling, Quercus! Curse your frailty and inability to affect change in your country! Edgeworth: Wh-What are you--!? Alba: The thing is, investigations conducted in my country have been under Agent Lang. And it is my judgment that in order to minimize disruption in the investigation... ...I should leave everything up to Agent Lang. Lang: ...There, you see? Kay: Oh, no way! ???: Palaeno: Ambassador Alba, I ask you to please reconsider letting them into Allebahst. Alba: What's that...? Palaeno: My very own secretary has been murdered in the Babahlese Embassy. And he was apparently caught up in some very shady dealings completely unbeknownst to me. So I ask for your cooperation in our investigation. These aren't much, but I hope they can cover your travel expenses to Babahl someday. Lang: Alright, alright. I get it. Even if you beg Ambassador Alba, I still have to give the final OK anyway. Kay: Alright! You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? We're in! Lang: Not so fast, my little crow-girl. You're still a witness in the Babahl murder. So I'd like you to please stay in the Republic of Babahl. Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Please take good care of Kay for me. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Lang: Sounds good to me. The fewer troublemakers, the better. Kay: ......... *rasp!* Gumshoe: *rasp!* Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: So I wanted to ask for a while now, but... ...that lady over there, is she who I think she is!? Edgeworth: Ah, that's right. I didn't introduce the two of you yet. Franziska: Franziska von Karma, the prosecutorial prodigy. ...It's nice to see you again. Kay: Ooh, I knew it! You're the whip lady! Franziska: .........You may address me as Ms. von Karma. Kay: Ms. von Karma, I leave the investigation of Allebahst in your hands! Franziska: Thanks. Rest assured, I will outsmart both the smuggling ring and the Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: (The smuggling ring, huh... Perhaps I should ask Franziska a bit more about them before I head into Allebahst. Ah, and I mustn't forget to thank Ambassador Palaeno for all that he has done for me.) After talking with Franziska von Karma and Colias Palaeno: Edgeworth: Well, shall we get going? ???: Edgeworth: What's wrong, Kay? Kay: I didn't get permission to enter Allebahst... ...so we're going to go gather whatever info we can over on the Babahlese side, OK!? Edgeworth: Alright, I'm counting on you two. Kay: Right, and I'm counting on you and Ms. von Karma to sniff out clues in Allebahst! Oh, and Mr. Edgeworth! If you happen to come across my phony, you let me know, OK!? If you tell me, I'll rush on over straight away no matter where you are! Edgeworth: .................. I'll let you know when the time comes. Edgeworth: (...Hm?) Gwoooooooh! Franziska: What do you think you're doing to my subordinate!? Edgeworth: Y...You're...! ???: Edgey...! Oh, thank the heavens you're here...! I'm in a really, really big pickle, Your Lordship! The Raven, it appeared, poof! And then disappeared, swoosh! And though I am the Steel Samurai, my sword, it... Waaaaaaaaah! I'm so confused, I don't know what anything means anymore! Franziska: Who is this fruitcake!? Larry: I am Larry of the House of Butz: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo, m'lady! Franziska: Now I remember. This... person is one of your friends, isn't he, Miles? Edgeworth: Yes, frighteningly enough... he is. Larry: Hey! What's up with that answer!? Your best bud is in a bind, and you act like it's no big deal! Edgeworth: What sort of \"bind\" are we talking about here...? Larry: The suspect kind! I accidentally became a suspect in a murdeeeeeer! Edgeworth: I see. That is quite the bind. Franziska: ...Not that we're in the least bit surprised. Edgeworth: Yes, I pretty much expected this news... ...from the instant I saw this unlucky face. (His name is Larry Butz. I've known him since grade school, and for as long as I've known him... ...he has been the world's largest source of Trouble with a capital T.) Larry: Hey! What kind of introduction is that!? You're so mean, Edgey! If you're not careful, you might find your tiny number of friends go down by one! Edgeworth: That was uncalled for. Besides, you're............ Wait, hold on. Laaaaaaryyyy! It was you!? YOU'RE the one who wrote my Steel Samurai autograph!? Larry: Hm? Oh, you didn't notice earlier? I even winked at you through my headpiece. Franziska: .........What's going on? And why are you beet-red? Edgeworth: Sorry... but could you not speak to me right now...? ???: Lang: Oh, sorry, am I interrupting your comical, yet melodramatic play? Edgeworth: ! .........Aha. So this is the incident you mentioned earlier. Lang: Mr. Prosecutor, this man... this childhood friend of yours... is our prime suspect. Of what, you ask? Of the murder of a man who had snuck into this embassy, Mask\u2606DeMasque II! Edgeworth: Mask\u2606DeMasque II...? .................. (Only Larry could get himself into yet another mess as fine as this. But no matter what the facts seem to say, Larry is not the type to commit murder. Still, it's a rather daunting stroke of misfortune I've struck. I have to prove... that Larry Butz is innocent of all wrongdoing!) MIB: Shifu! We've identified the victim! Lang: Good work. I'll take that report now. Edgeworth: Agent Lang, would you mind if I took a peek at it as well? Lang: What did I tell you earlier, Mr. Prosecutor? Don't get in my way! There's only enough flesh here to feed one wolf, and that one is me! So, no, you may not take a \"peek\". Edgeworth: But Agent Lang...! ???: Badd: ...Agent Lang. Will you... allow an investigator such as myself... to take a look? Lang: Ah, yes. Of course. ...You, let the detective see the file. Edgeworth: You're... Detective Badd! Badd: You're... the prosecutor, Mr. Edgeworth, right? Edgeworth: Fancy meeting you here, Detective. Badd: You weren't expecting me...? Ever since that day seven years ago... I've chased after the Yatagarasu... non-stop. I even pressured Interpol... into keeping me in the loop... in case a card was ever found. Edgeworth: (What incredible dedication to the case.) Lang: Detective Badd knows the Yatagarasu's M. O. very well. And his passion for the chase hasn't died down in these seven long years. It's something... I can respect. But, Detective Badd, I must ask: are you going to make an ally out of this prosecutor? Badd: My only goal is to arrest the Yatagarasu. If he can get to the bottom of this case, then I'm willing to share info with him. Edgeworth: I am in your debt, Detective Badd. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: In any case, I believe it's high time for me to start my investigation. After correctly deducing spear and golden statue, and examining knife rack, paper in hand, Mask\u2606DeMasque II's head, sword, and flowers on windowsill: Edgeworth: Hmm... I guess that about wraps up my investigation. Hm? That's... Larry: Yo! Pink Princess! How're you feeling? Still feeling ill? Pink Princess: .................. Franziska: ...And yet another strange character comes out of the woodwork. Edgeworth: And so the Pink Princess also comes to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. (I believe I may need to speak with her as well...) After clearing all Talk options with Wendy Oldbag: Officer: Prosecutor von Karma! I've brought the police dog, as you requested, sir! Franziska: Good work. You may leave now, Officer. Edgeworth: Hmm... This dog... Franziska: I requested the assistance of a dog in our search for the Yatagarasu. Lang: Looks like you guys have some pretty bright dogs in this country, too. ???: Woof! Woof! Lang: Hey... You're a real cutie, aren't you? Yeah! That's a good boy! Badd: ...That's the police dog Gumshoe's been taking care of... I think its name is... Missile. Franziska: What a fitting name for a police dog that dashes out in front and attacks. Edgeworth: (That action alone isn't exactly what's going to solve the case for us, you know.) Franziska: Now, Missile. I want you to find some clues! Go! Missile: Woof! Franziska: Good dog. You really are quite bright, aren't you? ...Unlike a certain someone I know. Now, what do we have here? What... is this? It looks like a small hot dog, but... Edgeworth: Hm? Wait, Franziska, isn't that... an official Samurai Dog? Missile: Grrraaaaaaarh! Franziska: Ah! No! Bad Missile! .........He ate it. I wonder if it's alright for him to eat that? Edgeworth: It's just a meat-substance snack featuring the Steel Samurai. I'm sure he'll be fine. Franziska: That's quite a bit of information you gathered there in a single, quick glance. Edgeworth: (We should really be focusing on why there was a Samurai Dog there in the first place.) Franziska: Hm? It looks like that snack wasn't all Missile found. Edgeworth: Oh? And what do we have... here...? Franziska: It appears to be a lady's undershirt. I wonder if Ambassador Alba might have an interest in cross-dressing? Edgeworth: I somehow doubt that. It doesn't look like the shirt would even fit him. (A Samurai Dog and a lady's undershirt... What are these two items doing in a room like this? Given the circumstances, the lady's undershirt could only belong to one person. I suppose I should get this over with and ask the owner of said undershirt about it...) Lady's Undershirt data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: If you could please take a look at this brown-colored undershirt... Oldbag: Oh, Edgey-poo... What is the meaning of this!? Edgeworth: ? Oldbag: Why did you steal that thing from my bags...? All you had to do was ask, and I would've gladly given you as many as you'd like! Edgeworth: Nnnrghk! Th-Thanks, but no thanks! This shirt was found here at this crime scene. Oldbag: What!? Edgeworth: Come now, why don't you just confess... and explain what it's doing here. Oldbag: I know nothing! NOTHING, I tell you! Edgeworth: What!? Oldbag: Oh, I admit that I used the fireplace to dry that shirt! But I can't really help the fact that I had to, you know! Wearing that Pink Princess costume was like being in a sauna! And on top of that, I get fingered as a suspect!? You're too cruel, Edgey-poo! Edgeworth: Are you claiming that you never once set foot inside this room? Oldbag: Of course I am! If I had been the one to find the body, do you think I'd be as calm and relaxed as I am!? I tell you, it's always like this! It's always my fault for some reason or another. That weekly tabloid article is missing? The camera is missing? That lawyer always makes sure it's my fault they're missing. Speaking of missing, there's the matter of my husband. Can you believe when we got married, he said, \"I guess I'm stuck marrying you.\" What kind of way to propose is that!? What he should've done is he should've whispered in my ear, \"I don't deserve you... but I can't help it. Will you marry me?\" Honestly, men these days! Edgeworth: Umm... Well... (I don't believe she is lying about her actions... So I can safely assume she really was drying her shirt by the fireplace on her break. And somehow, the undershirt managed to move from the next room into this one (Undershirt from next door - The undershirt was found in the office fireplace, but how did it get there?)...) I assume the Samurai Dog was also yours...? Oldbag: Ah, that brilliant mind of yours. You really can see through everything about me! Edgeworth: (And so the feeling of dread continues... But I suppose I should ask for more details...) After connecting all possible Logic and clearing \"Samurai Dogs\" Talk option with Wendy Oldbag: Edgeworth: (It would appear that the answer has made itself known.) Lang: You're making quite a confident face there, Mr. Prosecutor. Bring it on! I'm ready to counter any argument you may have! Edgeworth: Very well, then. If you are prepared... ...I'll show you exactly where my deductions have led me! Larry: Good! I'm counting on you, Edgey! Edgeworth: Leave it to me, Larry. My first attack will be... to expose your lie for what it really is. Larry: M-My liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!? Edgeworth: I know that there is still something you are keeping from the rest of us. Larry: Wh-What's wrong with you!? Why is it you won't believe me no matter what I say, Edgey!? Curse you! I should just hurry up and die already if that's how it's gonna be! I'll confess to every murder in the whole world, and then kill myself... ...and throw everything into mass confuuuuuuuuusion! Lang: Heh, you made some wonderful friends as a child, I see. Edgeworth: Larry, I only have one thing to say to you. Larry: Even if you make that face at me, it's no use! A man who is ready to die is strong-willed, you know! Edgeworth: Larry, it doesn't matter what sort of harebrained trouble you've caused... ...I only ask that you do not lie to me. If you cause an innocent person to be judged unfairly because of some insipid lie... ...I will never forgive you! Larry: E...Edgey... Edgeworth: Although, allow me to say... ...that I consider you to be among the innocent in this case. And that I will draw the real killer out. You can trust me on this. Larry: Alright. I... I... This time... This time, I'll tell you the whole truth, OK!? What happened, what didn't happen, the works! Edgeworth: Just what happened will do! Now then, if you would please testify as to what you did up on the roof tonight. Larry: After the show, I left the pushcart in the Rose Garden, and came into the embassy. Then, they took a picture of me shaking hands with the ambassador. After that, and until my next appearance, I had some free time, so I wandered around. That's when I spotted the chimney. A chimney like that is a rare thing, you know. So then, I wanted to play Santa and decided to give it a try. Edgeworth: Larry, I thought I just finished telling you to not lie anymore. Larry: Umm......... But it's... kinda, ultra-embarrassing. Edgeworth: And what exactly is so ultra-embarrassing that you can't tell me!? Larry: Edgey, man! I just said it was embarrassing, so of course I can't just blurt it out! So you're just gonna have to reason it ouuuuuuuuuuuuut of me! Franziska: As your superior, I command you to hurry up and expose this man's lie! Edgeworth: I have every intention to, for I'm not about to let us waste time on such a trifling matter. Larry: After the show, I left the pushcart in the Rose Garden, and came into the embassy. Larry: Then, they took a picture of me shaking hands with the ambassador. Larry: After that, and until my next appearance, I had some free time, so I wandered around. Larry: That's when I spotted the chimney. A chimney like that is a rare thing, you know. Larry: So then, I wanted to play Santa and decided to give it a try. Edgeworth: As I suspected, you do have something to hide, Larry. But what could be so embarrassing that you'd be willing to go to jail for it!? Franziska: This man's mind is a complete mystery to me. Edgeworth: I believe it's a secret to everyone of a normal mindset how Larry's mind works. However, taking into account his usual, women-obsessed way of thinking... ...I believe that his lie this time is also related to a woman, and this is what I intend to prove. Edgeworth: Actually, I believe in the case of this man, playing Santa is actually quite a big deal. Lang: Are you saying that your buddy isn't exactly made of Santa-quality stuff? Edgeworth: Precisely. You hit the nail on the head, Agent Lang. Larry: Hey, Edgey! That's so incredibly mean! Edgeworth: Tell me something, Larry. Did you know that Santa's job is to deliver presents to people all over the world? Larry: Of course I know that! I DID graduate from junior high, you know! Edgeworth: In that case, it's your turn to tell me something. I want you to tell me to whom you were delivering a present to. Larry: Umm... I was, ah... delivering a present to a child not basking in the warm glow (changed from [glow] in the original release) of love? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That must be the most elegant description of you I've ever heard, but a lie is still a lie. Larry: Y-You sure know how to kick a guy when he's down, you know that!? Edgeworth: In any case, the person you wished to deliver a present unto was most certainly this! Lang: Heh, interesting tastes you have there, Mr. Suspect. Larry: D-D-Don't spread lies about me! I totally didn't want to see Ms. Oldbag so much that I'd try to go down a chimney! Owww! Franziska: I advise you to stop right there in your bashing of a lady. Edgeworth: Well, I must admit that I, myself, hardly ever have the want to run into that lady. However... what if you were misinformed, and under the wrong impression? Then what? Lang: Define \"wrong impression\". Edgeworth: I simply mean that the man before you thought to enter the old lady's room... ...without knowing one very important fact. And that fact... is best summed up with this! Edgeworth: This is something the old lady received from her employer for the night. The girl who normally plays the Pink Princess... Mindy, was it again? It seems that this man is quite taken with that actress. Larry: Larry: But that's not true, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...? Larry: She's the one with the hots for me! I just know it! I can feel her sexy beam piercing my heart when she's watching me! Seeeeeexy beam, I tell you! Franziska: You filthy, despicable, inconsiderate, fickle, idiotic, cowardly... ...apparition of a man! You haven't matured at all since we last met! Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: Yes? Lang: This guy... He's got bigger problems than just getting involved in murders, I take it? Edgeworth: I suppose you could put it that way. Larry: Hey! What the heck, man!? I don't get you guys at all! Why do you all have to make me out to be some sort of bad guy!? Edgeworth: To return to the original topic, I propose that at least this much has been made clear. Without any knowledge that Ms. Mindy had fallen ill... ...Larry tried to make his way into the Pink Princess's room. That much we know for sure! Larry: Larry: Hey, Edgey... Looks like I've got the hang of this court thing now. Edgeworth: But we're not in court at the moment... Larry: Shut up! I see what's going on here, and it looks just like what you do in court! Lang: I guess old boy here still has something he'd like to say. Lang Zi says: \"Until the root of the tongue dries, one never knows the whole truth.\" You shouldn't form conclusions until everything is out in the open, which is why I'll listen. Larry: Alright! Then get ready to listen to me defeat Edgey in a battle of wits! Edgeworth: (Larry, have you forgotten that should I \"lose\", your victory prize will be your arrest?) Larry: So you think that all I wanted to do was to go visit Mindy? Well, I dressed up as Santa and climbed up to the chimney, but the smoke was really thick. It was a case of mistaken identity, and that mistake made me late for the speech. Then, to top it all off, I became a suspect in a murder. THAT'S what you really meant. But why would I ever put myself through so much humiliation on purpose!? Edgeworth: .................. Lang: .................. Larry: ..................Hey! Someone say something! Edgeworth: Larry, are you seriously trying to submit this, not as a confession, but as testimony? Larry: So what if I am!? Is there something wrong with that!? My claim is a claim claiming my claim. Do you have a problem with that!? Oldbag: So it was you! You're my stalker! But I should warn you, it doesn't matter what kind of flattery you throw at me. I'm the devoted type of woman who's wholly focused on one man, and one man only! And as long as Edgey-poo is alive, I can't just drop him and be unfaithful! No, I can't! Although, earlier, I was tempted just a tiny-winy bit by that wolf-man! But that was just a test of my love for my dear Edgey-poo, which I passed with flying colors! But from now on, I will stay completely true to my beloved Edgey-poo for the rest of eternity! I swear it! Larry: Aaaaah! I-I'm so inspired! Franziska: You're such an inconsiderate, cowardly, idiotic, and all-around completely worthless man! Edgeworth: (I thought I heard something ominous just now, but perhaps it was just my imagination.) I believe there is nothing further for me to prove at this point... Larry: What do you mean!? Of course you've still got something to prove! You still have to show some proof that I was trying to meet up with Mindy! Edgeworth: \"Proof\", you say? Larry: Remember, Edgey!? Everything is evidence in court, right!? Edgeworth: You mean, \"Evidence is everything in court,\" Larry, but I understand your point. Larry: Yeah, see! I'm totally a pro at this now! Edgeworth: Very well. If you wish to see the evidence... ...then let me show you the last piece of evidence you'll ever wish to see. Larry: So you think that all I wanted to do was to go visit Mindy? Larry: Well, I dressed up as Santa and climbed up to the chimney, but the smoke was really thick. Larry: It was a case of mistaken identity, and that mistake made me late for the speech. Larry: Then, to top it all off, I became a suspect in a murder. THAT'S what you really meant. Larry: But why would I ever put myself through so much humiliation on purpose!? Edgeworth: (This whole testimony is one giant confession of all that he's done tonight. He's practically begging me to show why he bothered to put himself through all of this.) Edgeworth: Larry, don't even think about denying that you have knowledge of this letter. Larry: H-H-H-H-H-Hey! Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Why are you showing that thing to me!? Franziska: \"W\u00e9ndy, I'll be descending on you from above tonight. Your loving knight\" Well, isn't that just romantic? Edgeworth: But you weren't able to \"descend on her from above\", were you... Mr. Loving Knight? Larry: Aaaaaaaaaaaarghn! I-I have no idea what you're talking about! I don't remember a thing! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You can pretend to be ignorant all you'd like, but it's written right here. This letter proves that you were not out to meet the old lady... ...but rather, that you were attempting to pay Ms. Mindy a visit! (What part of this letter shows that the person Larry had intended to meet was Mindy?) Edgeworth: Larry, I suggest you take up penmanship lessons. That is... ...if you never wish to experience this level of embarrassment ever again. Larry: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the heck!? What are you talking about!? Speak English! Edgeworth: You wrote \"Mindy\" so sloppily that it became \"W\u00e9ndy\" to the average eye. Larry: ...Hey, stop picking on me... It's so embarrassiiiiiiiiiing! Lang: There, there. Isn't that what childhood friends are for? They're the best, aren't they? ...For punching. But that will have to wait until we're off of this crime scene. Larry: Eek! Edgey! Save me from the scary man! Edgeworth: Sure, if you're willing to make amends. Starting with your incredibly embarrassing mistake! Larry: .........That... That... That wasn't me! Edgeworth: Come again? Larry: It's a fake! Someone's out to get me, so they made that fake letter... ...to set me uuuuuuuuup! Franziska: Accept your defeat graciously! Larry: But... you guys are being so mean... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Penmanship analysis. Larry: What's that? Edgeworth: No matter who, all people have certain unique features to their handwriting. Ergo, all we have to do is compare the handwriting in this letter to a sample of yours... ...and we'll know soon enough who it was that sent this letter. Larry: I...I...I... I'll never write another thing in my life! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Tsk, tsk, tsk... It's no use, Mr. Loving Knight. For you've already graciously provided me with a sample of your handwriting! Edgeworth: This autograph and our mysterious letter... If we compare the handwriting, we'll know the answer to our questions soon enough. Larry: Gnn...nnn... Nnnnnnnn...! Edgeworth: Confess now, Larry... to your miserable failure! Larry: I...I'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorry! I... I... I did it... It was me causing trouble again... I admit it. You hit the nail right on the head... Edgey... Edgeworth: (So, he finally confesses...) Larry: I saw the Pink Princess being carried around in a stretcher, and got worried, alright!? I wanted to go into Mindy's room, but the doctors wouldn't let me in. So what choice did I have!? It was the chimney or bust, Edgey! Franziska: Your mind jumped from the door to the chimney? What a criminally overactive imagination. Larry: Well, at least I was honest and wrote Mindy a letter, and stuck it under the door. That way, she wouldn't be so shocked when I came down through the chimney! Edgeworth: (Except for the fact that the letter was an utter failure at conveying said sentiment...) Larry: I'm really, really sorry... Edgeworth: Larry, you may be a shameful, good-for-nothing blight on the face of humanity... ...however, I always knew you weren't the killer. I told you to trust me... ...because, at the very least, I can attest to that about you. Larry: Edgey... You're... Aaaack! Franziska: We've lost a lot of valuable time because of you...! Larry: Owwwwwwwww! Franziska: In any case, I believe we can say that we now know exactly what happened. Mr. Larry Butz sought to climb down the chimney... ...not for access to the crime scene... ...but to enter the room of the elderly lady next door. Lang: Lang: Great job, Mr. Prosecutor. Although, I still find it a bit unbelievable that the two of you are friends. Edgeworth: .................. Lang: But the suspicion on that guy over there... ...isn't completely resolved yet, so don't get any funny ideas about running off, OK? Larry: Owwwww...w? H-Hey... What--? Edgey... What does the wolf-man mean when he says I'm not off the hook yet? Edgeworth: .........He means the murder weapon. Larry, did you forget? There are two layers of suspicion hanging over your head. Lang: That's exactly what I mean. We can't only rely on the words of the suspect, after all. We may have figured out where he was and what he was doing all night... ...but the blood-stained Samurai Sword that was left at the crime scene... As long as there is no satisfactory explanation for that... ...this wolf will refuse to ease up on his bite! Larry: Eeeeeek! Edgey! That guy... He looks like he's seriously about to take a bite out of me! Edgeworth: I'm well aware. And you should be as well, that this upcoming battle will be crucial. Lang: Thanks to the cooperation of our lovely bumbler... ...I've been dealt a very nice hand, and a sweet trump card. Looks like we're about to enter the final bout! Now, Mr. Prosecutor! Let's see what you've got! Edgeworth: (I can easily point out the contradiction in the supposed \"murder weapon\"... ...but the real problem for me is figuring out what the real murder weapon is. This will be a high-stakes gamble! But this is one game I can't afford to lose!) Lang: I was the one who found the body of the victim, DeMasque II. Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood. It was supposed to be in the Steel Samurai's dressing room, but I found it here instead. Plus, I found the murder weapon's owner, the suspect, Larry Butz in here, too. Edgeworth: Isn't it a bit far-fetched to accuse someone simply on the basis of ownership? Lang: But this owner wanted to sneak onto the crime scene. I think that's plenty to go on, don't you? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you're alluding to his reason for being by the chimney, we've already established that! Lang: Lang: Hold on there, Mr. Prosecutor. You two are long-time friends, right? Who's to say you didn't fabricate the evidence to give him an alibi? Edgeworth: .........You're accusing me of fabricating evidence? Lang: You think I can believe anything you produce? Forging evidence is all you prosecutors do! Edgeworth: .........! (This man has some serious issues with prosecutors...) Larry: But come on, I can't think up something as complicated as that! Right, Edgey!? Edgeworth: Larry, I can agree because I know you and your personality well. However, Agent Lang knows nothing about you... or me, for that matter. (I sense his hatred for my entire profession emanating from his entire being. Meaning that the only way I can prove Larry's innocence is to present irrefutable evidence.) Lang: I was the one who found the body of the victim, DeMasque II. Lang: Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood. Lang: Beside him was the Samurai Sword... covered in the victim's blood. Lang: I suspect he beat the victim to death with that thing. Lang: It was supposed to be in the Steel Samurai's dressing room, but I found it here instead. Lang: Plus, I found the murder weapon's owner, the suspect, Larry Butz in here, too. Edgeworth: (It's simply not possible that the Samurai Sword is the real murder weapon. So I should focus on proving that point to Agent Lang first.) Edgeworth: Do you know what this is, Agent Lang? Lang: Heh, it's a long spear, right? We used to use those a lot in my country a long time ago. Piercing, mowing people down... Spears are the weapon of heroes throughout history. Franziska: It's the next most effective weapon after the whip. Edgeworth: (I think the whip is in a slightly different category...) Lang: So, what's your point? Are you going to tell me that the spear is the real weapon? Edgeworth: No. I simply want you to take a look at this section here. Lang: The way it's bent...? Edgeworth: Precisely. Apparently, a certain troublemaker hit it against a wall in this embassy earlier. And as you can clearly see, the insides of the Steel Samurai's weapons are hollow. In other words, they're replicas that aren't strong enough to deliver a damaging blow... ...let alone the multiple strikes necessary to bludgeon someone to death. And yet, there is not even a dent in the Samurai Sword. How do you explain that!? Lang: A...Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Larry: Oh, yeah... The sword and the spear are made of the same stuff, so they bend easily! But I wish they'd make them out of better stuff! Because the spear got bent... ...I wasn't able to do my special \"Early Summer Rain Jab!\" move! Man, I got such an earful from the director of the play for not doing it in the show! Edgeworth: (The Steel Samurai's special move was changed tonight because of him...!?) Samurai Spear data updated in my Organizer. Larry: Yeoooooooooowch! Franziska: That's more than enough of your whiny whimpering! Now... back on the topic of the spear. Edgeworth: Yes, let's return to the real topic of discussion. (This is where the real gamble begins. I don't have a real strategy, per se... ...so all I can do for now is let the chips fall where they may.) Franziska: Using guesswork and taking risks in place of real logic is hardly the Von Karma way. It's neither smart nor very clever. Edgeworth: Ms. von Karma, as you know, unlike your father, I am not a genius prosecutor. Plus, I doubt his record of a 40-year win streak will ever be broken. Franziska: .................. Edgeworth: But perhaps, it is for the best if it remains unbroken. For no one should've conceived of the notion to \"convict all defendants\" in the first place! Franziska: Franziska: What a foolishly foolish statement from a foolish fool who hates to lose... It's the job of a prosecutor to make sure that all defendants are found guilty in court. There is nothing more important in this world than a perfect victory! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That may be your opinion, however, I don't believe that's all we are. Lang: .........! Edgeworth: As a prosecutor, what I pursue is not the perfect victory, but the perfect truth. And if that means that the bridge I must cross will crumble beneath my feet... ...then let it crumble as I walk on towards the truth! Lang: Lang: You're good at keeping me entertained, Mr. Prosecutor! But you know... humans are delicate creatures. The slightest bump and we expire. I'd like you to consider, if you will, the possibility that... ...the sword was used in such a way that the attack killed DeMasque II without bending it. Edgeworth: .................. Lang: So, what do you think of my hypothetical scenario? I think you know what to do here, right? And what you need! Edgeworth: Of course. (What I need is evidence even he (changed from [Agent Lang] in the original release) can't refute! This is it! It's time to bring this to a close!) Lang: It's possible to use the Samurai Sword to kill someone. And under these circumstances, it's the only logical conclusion. We searched the Embassy, top to bottom, but the victim's blood is only on that weapon. So isn't it only natural that suspicion would fall onto the owner of said weapon? Edgeworth: How long do you intend to cling onto that preposterous theory? Lang: As long as I want, because we examined every corner within the walls of this Embassy. There's no stone we've left unturned! And we have managed to come up with only one logical conclusion! That the only place inside this embassy with the victim's blood on it is this sword. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You left no stone unturned? Is that a fact? Lang: Lang: If you've got something to say, then say it in the only way I respect, Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: Yes, of course. In that case, allow me to make it all crystal clear for you! Lang: It's possible to use the Samurai Sword to kill someone. Lang: And under these circumstances, it's the only logical conclusion. Lang: We searched the Embassy, top to bottom, but the victim's blood is only on that weapon. Lang: So isn't it only natural that suspicion would fall onto the owner of said weapon? Edgeworth: ...I can prove to you... the possibility that the murder weapon is something else... ...but I cannot do so on my strength alone. Franziska: Franziska: Miles Edgeworth. What are you running straight into a quagmire for? I thought you said that you were busy in pursuit of the perfect truth. And if that's the case, then show me this perfect truth, if it exists at all! Edgeworth: Don't worry. Thanks to you, I've already prepared myself to do just that. Franziska: There's no need to thank me. I'm simply doing what any good superior would. Edgeworth: Heh... I suppose you are. Very well, then. I will show you the possibility of a different murder weapon. Edgeworth: If you believe that there is no other door of possibility left to open... ...then allow me to force one open for you! Lang: Lang: Hmph! And how do you plan to do that? Edgeworth: By showing you what may possibly be the real murder weapon. Lang: Lang: Ha! Ha ha ha ha! The \"real\" murder weapon? I hate to repeat myself... ...but my men have already searched every last inch of this embassy! And they've concluded that nothing else could've been used as the weapon! Knowing these facts, do you still want to press forward with your little hypothesis? Edgeworth: Of course. Because it's not possible that your men inspected everything in their investigation. Lang: Lang: What are you talking about!? I don't appreciate mind games, and I don't appreciate it when people like you slander my men! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not slandering them, I assure you! I'm merely pointing out that their investigative dragnet has a few holes in it! Namely, that there is something your men couldn't even lay a finger on. And that item is the real murder weapon! Lang: Aaaaaaaalright then! I'll play along for now! This \"real\" weapon that killed DeMasque II... What exactly is it!? Edgeworth: The real murder weapon, which not a single person has yet to touch, is this! Edgeworth: .........The national treasure of Allebahst. Lang: Lang: You mean the Primidux Statue? Edgeworth: Yes, and as you know, only the ambassador and his secretariat may touch it. Which, I believe, means that neither you nor your men were able to examine it, correct? Lang: Lang: Ha... ha ha ha ha... You know very well that if we did that, there'd be an international incident... ...between the Kingdom of Allebahst and the Republic of Babahl. The two countries' precarious relationship teeters in the balance... ...over a stupid fight related to a sovereignty statue! But I'll be damned if I let something go unexamined! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang, if you could take a look at this... The direction the statue is facing just before and after the crime are different...! And there is only one conclusion I can draw from that. Lang: .................. Go look for Ambassador Alba, and get him to give us the OK to examine the statue. MIB: Shifu! You can't listen to this infidel's words! He is most definitely trying to trick you! Shifu! Please, let's be rational about this! Lang: Grr! Lang Zi says: .........Just go already! MIB: Y-Yes, sir! MIB: Shifu... Lang: Yeah? MIB: I'm really sorry, sir, but I was unable to convince the ambassador. I was unable to obtain permission for us to examine the Primidux Statue. Lang: ...Hmph. I see. Franziska: Wait...! But then, the investigation is at a standstill! Agent Lang! I will go and speak with the ambassador personally! Lang: Save your breath. He may act all weak and frail, but that old man's one tough cookie. But I guess you've gotta be tough when you're representing a whole country, you know? Edgeworth: Agent Lang... Lang: What do you want? Let's just hurry up and examine the statue already. MIB: Wh--!? But Shifu! What about causing an international incident!? Lang: Quiet! I'll take the fall if I have to later! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang, the hypothesis is mine, so if someone is to take the responsibility, let it be me! Lang: Responsibility? If we're going to talk in such heavy terms, maybe I should let you. It'd be a real problem for my men if something were to happen to me. Alright then... Less talk and more investigating! Edgeworth: (If we want to know the truth, we can't stop here! Action must be taken!) Agent Lang, I'd like to run a Luminol chemiluminescence test on the statue. Lang: A Luminol test...? Ah, good thinking. If the statue is the murder weapon, then some of the victim's blood should be on it. Okaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! Let's get the forensics team in here! Lang: Heh! Looks like you hit the jackpot, Mr. Prosecutor. I guess this means that this is the real weapon that killed DeMasque II. Edgeworth: Indeed...! Lang: But I wouldn't celebrate yet if I were you. This doesn't let your friend off the hook. It doesn't prove that he didn't kill DeMasque II, so the charge remains! Edgeworth: ...We are hardly done examining this statue, Agent Lang! Knowing that it IS the real weapon, I believe further examination is required. Lang: Hah, you think so? OK then, knock yourself out! Leads to examination of Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: ...Nngh. Lang: And what do we have here? This dirty smudge... It looks like... a handprint? Heh heh heh heh... Haaa hahahahahahaha! What's a definitive bit of evidence like you doing under here!? Looks like we've got some fingerprints to analyze! Edgeworth: Gnrk! (Worst case scenario, these prints belong to Larry... But it looks like it's too late for me to do anything about that now...!) Lang: Hey! Forensics guy! I want results on these fingerprints ASAP, you hear me!? Forensics: Agent Lang! I have the analysis results, sir! Lang: Good! And!? Forensics: Sir! About the prints we lifted from the bottom of the statue... Well, um... You know the victim of the murder in the Babahlese Embassy...? The prints belong to him, to Mr. Manny Coachen, sir! Lang: But that's--! Wh-What's going on around here!? Edgeworth: No... That's... impossible! (Each Primidux Statue can only be handled by someone of that country. But by the very fact that Mr. Coachen's fingerprints are on this one... ...it leads me to only one conclusion...!) This statue... is actually Babahl's Primidux Statue! Franziska: Impossible! It can't be...! Lang: A...! Aaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiya! Edgeworth: (Larry never once set foot on Babahlese soil, so he was free to go... However... this new piece of information only served to confuse us even further. The ringleader of a smuggling operation was killed with an Allebahstian knife in Babahl... ...and DeMasque II was killed on Allebahstian soil with Babahl's national treasure... ...and the mystery of the Great Thief Yatagarasu, who visited both countries. The pieces were there, but I had yet to see the big picture they were to form.) To be continued Edgeworth: (I've left the DeMasque II investigation to Franziska and returned to Babahl. I suppose my first order of business should be to look into Babahl's statue...) Kay: Mr. Edgewoooorth! Edgeworth: So, Kay, what's the situation? Kay: Oh, it's great! Investigating is so much fun! Edgeworth: (...In other words, they've made absolutely no progress.) Gumshoe: W-We weren't goofing off! Honest, sir! We've been investigating our hearts out! Edgeworth: Very well, then. Would you care to give me an update on your investigation? Gumshoe: ...Ummmmm... Oh! We've had a really fun time, sir! Edgeworth: (I knew it. Zero progress...) In any case, Detective Gumshoe... Gumshoe: Yes, sir? Edgeworth: You have permission to enter the Allebahstian Embassy, is that correct? Gumshoe: Yup! As a local detective, I'm helping out with investigations on both sides, sir! Edgeworth: Good. In that case, I can leave these... pieces of evidence with you. They belong to the lady under the Pink Princess's mask. Gumshoe: The Pink Princess? What kind of lady was playing her, sir? Edgeworth: The kind that was also playing the role of the Pink Badger yesterday. Gumshoe: Ugh! Ooonnngh... Understood, sir... If I happen to run into her, I'll give them back to her. And if I don't... then I guess I'll unload them somewhere... Edgeworth: (He doesn't seem all that enthused to go find her, but I can't blame him.) Evidence that has lost their value given to Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: Now then, I don't believe I'll be needing this anymore either. Kay: Whaaaat!? Are you really going to throw that autograph away!? Edgeworth: Yes, because that Steel Samurai was a fake. Steel Samurai's Autograph scrunched up into a ball and disposed of. Kay: Wait, what? What do you mean by \"fake\"? Edgeworth: (Now then, I believe it's time for a little housekeeping.) Unnecessary evidence has been removed. Remaining evidence has been re-arranged. After clearing Talk option with Dick Gumshoe and presenting Babahl's Primidux Statue or Allebahst's Primidux Statue to Colias Palaeno: Kay: Hey, where are you going? Are you heading back to Allebahst? Edgeworth: Yes, but before I do, I suppose I should give you a summary of what's happened. Kay: ...Oh, I see. So there's been a murder in both countries using an object from the other country...? Edgeworth: That's the gist of it. Babahl is just as strict as Allebahst... ...in their inspection of the people and things that enter their country. Meaning that somehow, both murder weapons were smuggled into the two countries. That's the only logical conclusion that can be drawn. Perhaps the key to the weapon smuggling is the person who traversed both countries... Kay: You mean the fake Yatagarasu!? Edgeworth: In one way or another, the Yatagarasu is connected... Of this I am sure! Now then, where was the Yatagarasu first spotted? Palaeno: I believe it was the rose garden on the Allebahstian side of the embassy. The garden is just on the other side of this boundary. It's where Ambassador Alba was to give a speech tonight. At least, that's where I heard the Yatagarasu had appeared. Edgeworth: In that case, I believe it's vital that I investigate the rose garden posthaste. Kay: Wait, before you go... Take a look at this, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What... is it? Kay: My guess is that it's a guitar pick. I picked it up just now over there. Do you think it'll be of any use? Edgeworth: (There is a little water on it... but how did the water get on it? It doesn't look like there's anything it could get wet from around here...) Kay: I was thinking, they have concerts here at this open-air stage from time to time, right? Edgeworth: Alright, I'll find its owner later... Pick data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Oh, yeah! There's one more thing... Mr. Edgeworth, would you be willing to hold onto this? Edgeworth: What is this? Kay: It's Ms. Yew's perfume. It's the bottle that woman left behind and that I found seven years ago. I thought that one day, it'd be of some use in tracking her down... ...so I kept it safe all this time. Edgeworth: Thank you. I'd be honored to hold onto it for you. Ms. Yew's Perfume data jotted down in my Organizer. Theatrum Neutralis Open-air stage (before approaching door on left side in Theatrum Neutralis) ???: I see you're back, Miles Edgeworth. How are things in Babahl? Although, I can't really say I expect much from Scruffy and that girl. Edgeworth: The investigation into Manny Coachen's death hasn't really progressed any... ...however, the investigation into the Yatagarasu has. Franziska: Ah, yes, the Yatagarasu. Even now, I find it hard to believe. A person who can freely traverse between the two countries at will? Preposterous. Edgeworth: Well, that's what I came here to investigate. I heard that this is where witnesses claim to have seen the Yatagarasu. Franziska: That's correct. Ambassador Alba was to give a speech tonight here in Allebahst. And that's when the Yatagarasu appeared. The shadow of the mysterious thief appeared, and just as suddenly, it vanished... After that, there was the fire at the Babahlese Embassy that the Yatagarasu started. Edgeworth: (I vow that not a single feather from the Yatagarasu shall escape my diligence!) After clearing Talk option with Shi-Long Lang and examining statue of man, pool, and statue of woman: Edgeworth: The suddenly appearing and disappearing shadow of the Yatagarasu... I believe I've figured out its true origin. Franziska: I expected no less from my subordinate. Now, let's hear what you know on the subject. What really cast the shadow of the Yatagarasu? Edgeworth: The suddenly appearing and disappearing shadow of the Yatagarasu... Is it not possible that it was created by this statue? Franziska: Franziska: Are you playing me for a fool, Miles Edgeworth!? This statue bears absolutely no resemblance to the shadow of the Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: You are correct, however, this statue is but one part of the whole picture. Franziska: What do you mean by \"only one part\"...? Edgeworth: What is the other part to the real form of the Yatagarasu's shadow? Franziska: It's... another statue? Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu's shadow was made from the shadows of these two statues. Franziska: Made? What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: Right now, the spotlights are all over the place. This is because they were moved when the guests were in a panicked state. However, if we were to restore the lights to where they were when the thief appeared... Franziska: You believe that the two shadows will create the Yatagarasu's shadow? Edgeworth: Precisely. Now then, watch as I reveal the true form of the Yatagarasu! First, if we set up a spotlight to cast a shadow of \"King Primidux and the Battlefield\"... ...the shadow of the king's statue would appear on the backdrop of the stage. Likewise, if we set a light up on \"The Queen Who Spoke of Love To King Primidux\"... ...her silhouette would also appear on the backdrop to the stage. Franziska: Aha! So if we were to combine the two shadows...! Franziska: ............ It looks nothing like the Yatagarasu's shadow! Miles Edgeworth! How do you explain this grotesque shape!? Edgeworth: C-Calm down, Franziska! The way the light needs to be shone on the queen's statue is wrong... Franziska: What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: I believe that the whole of the king's shadow needs to be used for this to work. However, in the case of the queen, I don't believe her whole shadow is needed. Rather, the person who created the shadow only used one part of her shadow. Franziska: Only one part? Edgeworth: Yes, and that one part alone is enough to fill in the rest of the Yatagarasu's shadow. Franziska: Why didn't you say that in the first place!? Edgeworth: You're right. I-I apologize... Franziska: Now, what part of the queen's statue was used to complete the Yatagarasu's shadow? Edgeworth: Think back to what is missing in our shadow. Five long, thin areas, correct? Now, what does that remind you of? Franziska: Ah! Edgeworth: That's right. It can only be the shadow of the queen's left hand. Franziska, can we please adjust the spotlight's position... ...so that it only shines on the queen's left hand? Franziska: Alright. Let's give it a try and see what we get. Franziska: It's...! Lang: Hmph... Yeah, this is exactly like the shadow I saw. Edgeworth: The culprit must've changed the spotlights' positioning beforehand... ...and then pulled the plug after people saw what the culprit wanted them to see. In their panic, the guests must have moved the spotlights around... ...which we can assume was also a part of the culprit's plan. By the time the lights came back on, the Yatagarasu's shadow had vanished. Franziska: Which means that the shadow was a construct from the very beginning. Edgeworth: So you see, the Yatagarasu never did visit Allebahst tonight. The only country that thief visited was Babahl, although it can be assumed... ...that the Yatagarasu had an accomplice in Allebahst. Franziska: An accomplice? But who...? Edgeworth: I haven't figured that out yet, but I assume it was the person who set up the shadow show. (I sense that the biggest clue yet to solving this case is the existence of this accomplice!) ???: .........How's the investigation going? Edgeworth: Detective Badd, have you come to join us in investigating the Yatagarasu? Badd: I've left the murder... in Agent Lang's charge... And my only target... from the very beginning is the Yatagarasu... so yes... Edgeworth: So... what have you found out? Badd: ...I got a piece of evidence. Edgeworth: May I see it...? Badd: ...Sure, but you might regret it... Franziska: We're here because we are ready to face whatever may come. ...So if you please. Badd: ...When people heard the commotion, bystanders... started gathering. And one woman... claimed, \"I'm tellin' ya I'm a genuine international journalist!\"... She gave me... an interesting picture. Edgeworth: A journalist...? Badd: Well, actually... she's a freelance... cameraman. This... is the photo I got from her. Edgeworth: Wh-What in the world!? Franziska: The Yatagarasu... is flying through the air...! Badd: ...The times, they are a-changing... It's... not just man... ...but evidence... even they lie to us now... Edgeworth: Wh-When was this photo taken? Badd: ...Apparently, right after the fires... on the fourth and fifth floors were put out... It was taken... from a near-by building... that you can see the embassy from. Edgeworth: I see. So this was taken after the fire... Photo of Yatagarasu data jotted down in my Organizer. Badd: The blur in this picture... took off from the Babahlese Embassy... ...flew over the boundary... and headed for the Embassy of Allebahst... Franziska: Franziska: This is simply not possible! People are incapable of flight! Edgeworth: Is that a fact? I've had the \"pleasure\" of dealing with a case involving a \"flying person\" once. Franziska: .............................. Actually, come to think of it, I've come across a case like that as well. Two, actually. Badd: ...Maybe it happens more often than we think... Edgeworth: (Am I up to the task of solving the mystery behind this photograph? Well, the Yatagarasu took off from the Babahlese Embassy, so I should start from there.) Franziska, I need to return to the Babahl investigation for a bit. Franziska: ...Alright. Theatrum Neutralis Kay: Welcome back, Mr. Edgeworth! Now come on! Let's get back to our investigation! Edgeworth: Yes, let's. Rose Garden Franziska: I see you're back. Well, let's continue with the investigation, shall we? Edgeworth: Yes, let's. Kay: To think, after all that running around, we're right back where we started. Edgeworth: It would appear that way... Palaeno: Hi, Mr. Edgeworth. Have you found Manny's killer yet? Edgeworth: I'm terribly sorry, Ambassador Palaeno, but I have yet to find his killer. Palaeno: Then I guess his murder... really was the work of the Yatagarasu... Kay: Let's get one thing straight. It was the work of the FAKE Yatagarasu. The real Yatagarasu is a noble vigilante who is only out to steal the truth... Palaeno: Ms. Faraday... Please don't make such a sad face. If there's anything I can do for you, all you have to do is ask, alright? Kay: Mr. Palaeno... Edgeworth: Actually, there is one thing you can do. Will you allow us to take another look around? We didn't have enough time to conduct a thorough investigation earlier. Palaeno: Oh, sure! Please feel free to investigate to your heart's content. Edgeworth: Also, there are a few questions I'd like to ask you personally, Ambassador. Palaeno: If it will bring a smile back to Ms. Faraday's face, then I'll gladly answer anything. Kay: Thank you, Mr. Palaeno! You're a total gentleman! Palaeno: Ha ha ha. You don't have to waste such nice words on me, little miss! Kay: Hey, Sir Palaeno! Edgeworth: (...Those two sure got chummy awfully quickly.) Kay: You know, it's easy to say we're going to investigate, but where should we begin? Edgeworth: We should probably start by comparing the state of this room before and after the fire. And then, we should look into the matter of the suspicious person you spotted. Kay: Yeah. When I came into this room, that person was already gone. But I'm willing to bet that the person I was chasing is Mr. Coachen's killer. Edgeworth: We don't know that yet; however, it's hard to believe that person is unrelated. Furthermore, because the key the Yatagarasu stole seven years ago was found here... ...it signals that perhaps Ms. Yew is also somehow involved. Kay: I knew it! That woman is almost definitely Mr. Coachen's killer! Edgeworth: Yet again, we don't know that! (There are too many mysteries to be solved here (changed from [in this case] in the original release).) Speaking of the Yatagarasu and mysteries... ...I received a most mysterious photo from Detective Badd. Kay: Uncle Badd!? He's taking part in the investigation, too!? Edgeworth: Yes. He has been chasing after the Yatagarasu for all these years. Kay: Uncle Badd......... Edgeworth: Now then, I was told that this photo was taken just after the fire... Kay: Wh-What--!? This kinda looks like the person in the long coat I was chasing...! Does this mean... that I was chasing the fake Yatagarasu after all? Edgeworth: I don't know the answer to your question, but I don't think people can fly either... Kay: But this could be how that person escaped! Edgeworth: Well, we'll need to investigate a bit more before we can say anything about that. In any case, let's not dawdle any more and pick up our investigation where we left off. After clearing all Talk options with Colias Palaeno: Gumshoe: Oh! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe, have you collected the information that I requested? Gumshoe: Yup! Got it all right here, sir! Here you go, Kay. Feel free to take a look! It's for you, after all. Kay: What is all this, Gummy...? Gumshoe: It's all the information on this room that I got from the Embassy and Interpol people. Now we know exactly how this room was before and after the fire! Edgeworth: Good work, Detective. Gumshoe: Aww, it was nothing, sir! I'm an expert at getting people to talk! Kay: Wow... You two remind me so much of my father and Uncle Badd... Edgeworth: What do you mean? Kay: As prosecutor and detective, your dynamic is just like theirs back in the day. Edgeworth: ......... Kay: Well, don't you worry! I'm going to find my own wonderful partner someday! And when I do, I'm going to become a good Yatagarasu, just like my father, right? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Please don't ask me questions to which I have no answers to, Kay. However, I can say that is truly a wonderful thing to find a partner you can trust. Kay: Heh heh, you bet! So, what now, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Well... I'd like to ask you for a favor. Kay: Yes? Edgeworth: That gadget... Mr. Thief, is it? That thing you call your secret weapon. Kay: Oh, you mean \"Little Thief\"! Heh, you're coming to rely on it, aren't you? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I-I don't need a crutch like that! I'm only asking because I need it for the investigation! From the information Detective Gumshoe gathered, and the ambassador's testimony... ...I'd like you to please re-create this room as it was during the third floor fire. Kay: You got it! Alright, here we go! Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! Now, witness the true power of a real, modern-day Robin Hood! Edgeworth: It seems there are other things besides what the ambassador mentioned that have changed. It's possible that we might find the escape route the person Kay saw used as well. Palaeno: Oooh! Wh-What is this? Is it some sort of light show I was not told about? Kay: This is the power of a true vigilante! It's re-creating the room with the info I inputted! Palaeno: Really!? That is certainly one interesting device you have there, Ms. Faraday! Edgeworth: Ahem. I believe it's about time we returned to our investigation. After examining flames: Edgeworth: These must have been the large green flames Ambassador Palaeno saw. Kay: With flames like these, it's no wonder he couldn't get in! Edgeworth: Kay, by the time you came into this room, had the fire already been put out? Kay: Yeah, the fire had died out or something by that time. Edgeworth: Then this fire in here only burned from the time the fire started on the third floor... ...until the Yatagarasu appeared and caused a stir in Babahl, I suppose. Kay: I guess Mr. Palaeno was just lucky enough to run into this fire as it was burning, huh? Edgeworth: Yes, you could put it that way. And since you were the first to discover the body... ...we can assume that no one else entered the room until that time. No one other than the person you were chasing, of course. Kay: I knew it! That person I saw was definitely up to no good! I mean, that person could even be Mr. Coachen's killer! Edgeworth: That is very likely to be the case. After all, that person came into this room before you... ...and must have chosen this room precisely because they knew no one would be in here. Kay: OK, then maybe the green fire was where it was to prevent anyone from coming in? But then, what did the person set on fire to make the green flames? Edgeworth: Hmm... Well, whatever it is that person burned, it made a rather sizable fire. Kay: And since the fire's green... well, we've seen something that burns green, right!? It's a bit tinier than these flames, but you get what I mean. Edgeworth: Yes, and I do believe that what you are thinking is exactly why these flames are green. Which fire-related piece of evidence burns the same color as these green flames? Edgeworth: This silhouette lantern... Its green flame comes from the whitcrystal oil it's burning. Kay: Yeah! That's the fire I was thinking of, too! I love the green it gives off. Edgeworth: I think we've now established that the green flames were caused by whitcrystal oil. Furthermore, we know that there is only one other thing made from whitcrystal oil. Kay: Oh! You mean that thing Mr. Palaeno was mistaken about, right!? Edgeworth: Yes, precisely... as we found out earlier in our investigation. Gumshoe: Um, what? I don't get it. Can you fill me in, sir!? Edgeworth: Fine, I suppose. I'll explain it in a way that even you can understand. This is the thing made from whitcrystal oil that Ambassador Palaeno was mistaken about! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink is made from whitcrystal oil. Gumshoe: Ohhhh! So, it should burn the same color as the flames in the lantern, right!? Edgeworth: Yes, precisely. However, the green flames in this room were not from a bottle of Babahlese ink. Kay: Because we found the ink Mr. Coachen used on his desk, right!? Edgeworth: Yes. However... we know that Mr. Coachen was smuggling the ink in massive quantities. Now, what do you suppose he made using all that ink? I believe what he made with that ink is the answer to what gave birth to the green flames. Kay: Oh, yeah! I'm beginning to really feel the energy coming from you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Heh... It would appear that I've finally found it, the smuggling ring's real goal!) Made of Babahlese ink, this is the source of the green flames! Edgeworth: What would consume that great of a volume of ink to make...? That would be... ...the counterfeit bills that the smuggling ring made and are circulating in Zheng Fa. Kay: You're kidding!? You're saying that it was Mr. Coachen who made the counterfeit bills...? Edgeworth: I am. I believe you could even go so far as to say that he \"stole\" Babahl's printing press. Ambassador, Mr. Coachen had permission to freely use the printing press, correct? Palaeno: Why, yes. And I do remember seeing him use it in the middle of the night... ...but never did I think he was using it for such a foul deed...! Edgeworth: Ambassador! Because of your secretary's crimes, you will need to be investigated as well! Palaeno: Ah, yes, I suppose so. We've caused a bit of trouble for a few countries, haven't we? Edgeworth: It's my duty to search out all who shielded Mr. Coachen and concealed his crime. For they are the ones who started the fire in order to destroy the evidence! Counterfeit Bills data updated in my Organizer. After clearing \"What you saw\" Talk option with Dick Gumshoe and examining grandfather clock: Edgeworth: (We've examined everything in this office, but there is one thing that bothers me. Perhaps I should ask Ambassador Palaeno about it.) Ambassador Palaeno, there is something I'd like to ask you about. Palaeno: Yes? Edgeworth: About this office, it appears, to me, to be very similar to Ambassador Alba's office. For example, the location of the fireplace and the position of the grandfather clock. Palaeno: Ah, that's right. You've also paid a visit to the Allebahstian side of the embassy. Our two embassies actually used to be one. Edgeworth: (Yes, I know. Even the pamphlet mentioned that.) Palaeno: Which is why the building is bilaterally symmetrical (Bilateral symmetry - Because this used to be one embassy, offices on the two sides are symmetrical.). So no matter which room, the location of the fireplace and the like are exactly the same. Even where the art is located is the same. As my room is currently under renovation... ...we worked hard to make Manny's room look like the ambassador's office. Kay: You mean for your hand shake photo op with the Jammin' Ninja? Palaeno: Yes, that's right. I mean, what's a photo like that worth if it's not taken in the ambassador's office right? Edgeworth: (Yet another odd expression of Babahl's obsessively competitive spirit with Allebahst, I take it?) Thank you, Ambassador. That piece of information is all I needed to connect the dots. Palaeno: ? ...Connect what dots? Well, anyway, I'm glad I was able to be of some help. Edgeworth: The Allebahstian and Babahlese sides of the building are symmetrical to each other. As we know that to be a fact, then this room's fireplace may also hide a secret passageway. Kay: A secret passageway? Edgeworth: In Allebahst, the fireplace turned out to have a revolving back wall. Kay: A revolving wall!? It sounds like something out of a ninja house! Gumshoe: Wow, there was a trick like that built into the fireplace, sir!? Palaeno: What!? Th-This embassy holds THAT kind of secret!? Edgeworth: There seems to be a lot about this room that you don't know about, Ambassador... Palaeno: I guess it's time to pay the bill for letting Manny do so much work for me. Please, I really want to know about the real Manny and what you know about this room. Kay: What are you waiting for, Mr. Edgeworth!? Let's get to the bottom of this! Edgeworth: Agreed. And my first thought is that it's likely the killer used the revolving fireplace (Revolving fireplace used? - It's possible someone used the revolving fireplace wall. I need to examine it more.). Kay: It looks like just another fireplace, though, doesn't it? So, how do you turn it again? Edgeworth: In Allebahst, I had to push where the X was on the far wall of the fireplace. Gumshoe: Oh! I see an X back there, sir! Let's see what happens when I push it... Edgeworth: Gumshoe: Aaaaah! You scared me, sir! Edgeworth: There is something about this fireplace that lies in contradiction to the facts. Kay: Huh? But we found an X where you thought there'd be one, right? Edgeworth: We did, but that's not what I was referring to. Something is missing from this scene. (What does this contradiction mean for us...?) Leads to examination of fireplace Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, you said that you burned some old files in this fireplace today, correct? Palaeno: Yes, I burned quite a few files this morning, actually. Edgeworth: And after you did, you forgot to clean out the ashes from the fireplace, correct? Palaeno: Th-That's right. But why are you asking? And why are you making such a scary face...? Edgeworth: I'm sorry, I admit I am a bit intimidating when I'm serious. ...In any case! Take a good look at this fireplace, and tell me what you find odd about it. Palaeno: Let's see... Huh? Where did all the ashes go...? (Missing ashes - The ashes that should still be in the fireplace are missing. Where did they go...?) Kay: What is the meaning of this, Mr. Edgeworth!? Gumshoe: You don't really think... that Ambassador Palaeno is lying, do you? Edgeworth: No, there is no reason for him to lie. And I don't believe his testimony is wrong, either. It is the fireplace that is causing the contradiction. Kay, I wonder if you might update the fireplace data for me. Kay: You got it! I'll add in the ashes from the burnt files and... Kay: Sounds like we've pretty much figured everything out now, huh!? Edgeworth: Hmph... Well, it was nothing. All I did was follow where our leads led us. Kay: Oh, I sense it coming on! You're about to dazzle us again, right!? Gumshoe: Oh, you mean that!? Well, it's what Mr. Edgeworth is known for, you know! Edgeworth: ...There is really no need for you two to dance around the name of what I'm about to do. Edgeworth: The reason as to why the ashes are missing is simple. Kay: It's not because someone cleaned them up, right? Edgeworth: No, because even if someone did sweep them up, the fireplace is too clean for that. Ambassador Palaeno said that he spilled some Babahlese ink while he was burning the files. And yet, there is not a trace of the spilled ink on the back wall anywhere! Kay: Well then, I don't know what happened. Edgeworth: Well, I'll tell you what happened. The two sides were switched. By using the revolving fireplace wall, the ashes were moved into the neighboring room. Which means that this is a clear indication that the fireplace was used! Revolving Fireplace Wall data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Then, you mean... the person I was chasing... ...disappeared from this room through there...? Edgeworth: Yes, I believe the person you were in pursuit of is Mr. Coachen's killer. And after committing the murder, escaped through the fireplace (Escaped through revolving fireplace - The person Kay was chasing used the fireplace to escape into the room next door.)! Kay: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth! You figured out the killer's escape route! Edgeworth: (I have, but this is only the beginning. Now we have to chase the killer down!) Edgeworth: If the killer used the fireplace in this room to escape into the next... ...then it's only logical for us to \"talk\" with the person who was in the neighboring room. Gumshoe: Well, the person that was in the next room was... Oh! It was that person, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, Detective... Agent Shih-na. Kay: It's looking more and more like Ms. Shih-na is the killer, isn't it? Edgeworth: Let's not jump to conclusions yet. We need to go through what we know so far. She came running straight into this room from the next one, and instantly accused you. Furthermore, she claimed that it could only have been you that killed Mr. Coachen. I don't have any proof yet, however, I KNOW she is hiding something from us! Kay: OK, then! Why don't we go ask Ms. Shih-na herself!? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: No, not yet. There's something that needs to be done first. ...Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Sir! Is it my turn to do something, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Yes. I have a two-part special assignment for you. First, I need you to run a handwriting analysis on DeMasque II's note. Gumshoe: OK! I'll get the lab boys on that right away! Edgeworth: Second, I want you to see if you can fit through the revolving fireplace wall. Gumshoe: R-Right now, sir!? Edgeworth: No, next decade... Of course now! We need to test our hypothesis first, don't we? Kay: Go on, Gummy! You can do it! Gumshoe: Alright. I'm gonna do this like a real man! Here I go, through the fireplace and back! Edgeworth: (You shouldn't need to psych yourself up that much for such a simple task, Detective...) Gumshoe: Wow! The wall inside the fireplace really DID turn! Kay: That's so neat! Now, I wanna try going through there, too! Palaeno: Th-There really IS a secret passageway through there... I had no idea...! Edgeworth: Hmm... It would appear that the ash really was pushed into the other room. Furthermore, the Babahlese ink you spilled, Ambassador, is there on the back wall. Gumshoe: OK, here I go, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective, I'd like you to go through there under the same conditions as the killer. Gumshoe: Huh? But there's all that ash and stuff... Edgeworth: And your point is? Now, we're short on time, so if you could please hurry on through. Gumshoe: Nngh... Y-Yes, sir... Kay: OK! So NOW we pretty much have the whole picture, right!? Edgeworth: No, not yet. There remains a few more mysteries to solve... ...such as the Yatagarasu's whereabouts, the other smuggling ring members... ...the two weapons that made it across the border, the key Ms. Yew stole 7 years ago... In fact, we haven't figured out a thing regarding how Ms. Yew is related to these embassies! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: A number of pieces connect in a very complicated way in this case... It's almost enough to make one completely mentally exhausted. Kay: What are you saying, Mr. Edgeworth!? I thought you were the one who said that it's easy if you follow the leads? Edgeworth: Hmph... Was that supposed to be an impression of me, Kay? Kay: If it's info gathering you need, Gummy and I can help with that! Then, all you'd have to do is show off your fancy-schmancy logical deductions! Edgeworth: \"Show off\"...? (Does it seem like I'm being boastful when I do that...?) Kay: Let's not over-complicate matters, OK, Mr. Edgeworth!? We've been so focused, like a laser, on only what seems strange and out of place... ...it's no wonder nothing's clicked and we haven't unlocked anything yet. But, if we think things through calmly, the answer should come to us! Edgeworth: Kay... Kay: That's the sort of thing I say to myself... ...when I'm practicing how to unlock padlocks, you know! Edgeworth: ...That is something that I hope practice doesn't make perfect, for your sake. Kay: Ha ha ha! Yay! Looks like you're back to your straight-laced self again! Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm back, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, I can see that. Good work, Detective. Gumshoe: *cough* *cough* *cough* L-Looks like you can use that fireplace like a door, sir! Kay: Are you alright, Gummy...? Gumshoe: I-I'm OK! It's just a bit of ash and dust, that's all! Edgeworth: Your jacket has gotten quite filthy. I see the hem has practically turned black. Gumshoe: Yeah, well, quite a bit of the unburned ink got on it, sir. Edgeworth: Hmm... I see. Thank you, Detective. You did a fine job. I'll even pay the cleaning bill for the trench coat. Gumshoe: What!? Oh, no, sir! I could never! This is just my old coat, sir! If it was [sic] a coat I actually cared about, then I'd get it cleaned, but, you know... Edgeworth: ...? I see. Very well, then. As you wish. Kay: So because Gummy was able to climb through the fireplace, we know it can be used, right? Edgeworth: Yes, but that's not all we learned. We actually learned one other important fact. Kay: And that is...? Edgeworth: I will have to explain it to you later. Right now, we need to deal with the handwriting analysis. Detective Gumshoe... Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I'll be back before you know it! Edgeworth: The handwriting analysis on Mr. Coachen's handwriting will take a bit of time. Let us go and wait in the Theatrum Neutralis, along with Agent Lang and Agent Shih-na! To be continued Edgeworth: Agent Lang... Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Little cubs, never do they know the real fury of the Elder wolves.\" Edgeworth: (These quotes are definitely becoming increasingly difficult to decipher...) And what does that mean? Lang: It means that you'll never really know how angry I can get. Mr. Prosecutor... The counterfeit bills made with Babahlese ink... they were all of Zheng Fa denominations. Edgeworth: Yes, so I heard from Ms. von Karma. Franziska: But we don't know where the play money has gone. Edgeworth: (They must not have figured out that it was all burned yet...) Lang: Ever since those things showed up in circulation, my country's economy has taken a big hit. Zheng Fa is in financial chaos as we speak... ...because we can't tell the difference between our own bills and the fakes! But it's not just the money; the citizens are also worried. I've staked the honor of the house of Lang on this... ...and have come to this land to capture the mastermind behind this whole mess. I investigated how the bills were made and how the ink was smuggled into Zheng Fa... ...and I pursued the smuggling ring all the way here. But tonight... this is where the final chapter was written. Despite my frantic efforts to chase the smuggler down, someone got to him first... ...and now I'm called to return home without a single answer! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, I... Lang: Don't start. It's not your fault. It's not anyone's fault, Mr. Prosecutor. Ambassador Alba, I'm sorry for all the trouble tonight. Alba: Oh, no, no. It is I who should apologize. It was all because I was not strong enough. If only I was able to think of a better solution... Quercus, you fool! Curse your empty brain! Lang: Heh, you're being too hard on yourself, Ambassador. I take full responsibility for tonight, end of story. Shih-na, let's go. Time to return to our den. Shih-na: .........Yes. Franziska: I don't like to admit it, but there's not much else for us to do but to go home as well. Edgeworth: Agent Lang! A moment, if you ???: Gumshoe: You, Wolf-man and the secretary lady! Hold it! Objection! Pal! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe...! Have you got the results of the handwriting analysis already? Gumshoe: Yup, and that note... was definitely written by Mr. Coachen, sir! Edgeworth: Hmm, just as I thought... Good work, Detective. DeMasque II's Note data updated in my Organizer. Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... How long do you intend to hold us up for? Edgeworth: Hmph... Sorry to have made you wait, but I believe that now everyone is finally here. Agent Shih-na. I'd like to ask you something, if you don't mind. Shih-na: .........Yes? Edgeworth: How exactly did you fail to see the Yatagarasu... ...when you were in the neighboring room to where Mr. Coachen was killed!? I'd like you to explain THAT to us. Lang: What...? Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! What are you doing asking her about something she didn't see? Edgeworth: (Agent Lang hasn't touched the Babahl investigation at all. So I suppose I will need to explain a few things to him first.) Franziska: Miles Edgeworth... I can't even begin to imagine what's going on in that head of yours. Edgeworth: The only thing going on in my head... is the pursuit of the truth! Franziska: Oh? It sounds like you have some sort of plan. Very well, I'll supervise you until the end. Edgeworth: (*sigh* Is she seriously going to treat me as a subordinate for the rest of the day...?) Lang: You're not trying to pick a fight with my subordinate on some flimsy guess, are you? Edgeworth: I'm not trying to \"pick a fight\" and the evidence is hardly flimsy, as you will see. Lang: Hah! I should've known... ...that you and I are destined to fight it out to the very end! Edgeworth: It would appear that way. Lang: Well, I'll prove her innocence, so let's see what you've got, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hmph... With pleasure. (For my opening argument, I'll discuss the Yatagarasu that appeared in Babahl... ...and establish exactly who it was that Kay saw.) Agent Lang. I assume you've been briefed on Kay's testimony? Lang: You mean the \"suspicious person in a coat\" that she saw? Edgeworth: That's right. That person is one of the keys to solving this case. The person who pretended to be the Yatagarasu! Lang: \"Pretended\"? And what do you mean by that!? Edgeworth: I'll get to that in a second. But first, I want to review what Kay's mystery person did (changed from [second, but first, I want to review what this person Kay saw did] in the original release). Kay, if you could please explain for us what the person you were chasing did (changed from [what the person you were chasing did for us] in the original release)... Kay: OK! You got it! I first spotted the suspicious person near the open-air stage on the Babahlese side. I called out to the person, but as soon as I did, that person ran off. I thought it was rather suspicious, so I immediately gave chase. Edgeworth: For the sake of argument, let's call this suspicious person the Yatagarasu. Now, please tell us what happened when you chased the Yatagarasu up to the 3rd floor. Kay: Can do! I chased the Yatagarasu all the way up to the third floor of the Babahlese Embassy. It was a pretty straight chase down the hallway, until the sudden turn. The Yatagarasu disappeared around the corner, so I did my best to catch up. When I turned the corner, I saw the Yatagarasu run into Mr. Coachen's office. I gave chase and ran into the room... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the light, but then... Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Shih-na: ...Who's there!? Kay: By the time I had turned on the lights, the Yatagarasu had disappeared. Edgeworth: When Kay entered the room, the person she was chasing was already gone. Why do you suppose that was, Agent Lang? Lang: ...What do you mean, \"Why do you suppose?\" Isn't it obvious!? The person slipped out through the door behind the girl under the cover of darkness. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Sorry, but I know for a fact that the person didn't escape through that door! Lang: Oh? And how do you know that with such certainly!? Edgeworth: Hmph... That's easy. If the Yatagarasu had left through that door, they would have run right into this person! Lang: Y-Your answer is Shih-na...? Edgeworth: Yes, because let's consider what would've happened if the Yatagarasu had used the door. When Kay screamed upon discovering Mr. Coachen's body... ...the Yatagarasu would've run right into Agent Shih-na, who was in the next room over. Lang: ...Arngh! Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na. Would you mind telling us if you saw the suspicious person in question? Shih-na: .........No, I didn't see anyone. Edgeworth: You see? Therefore, the Yatagarasu could not have escaped through the door as Lang: Lang: It just means that the creep slipped out before Shih-na made it out into the hallway! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. I doubt that, as there was another person in that hallway. A certain detective. Detective Gumshoe, where were you exactly at that time? Gumshoe: M-Me, sir? Well, when I heard Kay's scream... ...I ran towards Mr. Coachen's office from the opposite direction of Agent Shih-na, sir! Edgeworth: So, Agent Lang, can YOU explain how someone could've eluded both of them!? Even you must concede that under these circumstances, the door was not a viable route! Lang: Grr...rrrnoooooooooh! Kay: Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! You nailed him with just an explanation of what happened! Edgeworth: Yes... I've eliminated one of the possible escape routes from that room. (But this is far from over. I need to make Agent Lang aware as well... ...of yet another possible escape route the Yatagarasu could've taken.) Lang: .........! Ha ha ha ha! I get it! So that's what you were trying to show me. Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... Let me guess. This is what you're trying to say, right? Because the door was not a viable escape route, then there must've been another way out! Edgeworth: Precisely. Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! It's time to bust out with our revolving fireplace wall explanation, right!? Edgeworth: No, not quite yet. Kay: Huh!? But why? I thought this would be the perfect time... Edgeworth: The revolving wall on the Babahlese side is known only to four people. And if we use this information unwisely, the truth may escape us in the end. Lang: What's with all the whispering over there? Scared I'll figure out your tactics? Edgeworth: Hmph, nothing of the sort, Agent Lang. Come, let's continue where we left off. Lang: That smug, haughty attitude of yours... You really rub me the wrong way, you know that!? ...Hmph. Well, no matter. I've figured you out already anyway. The only other possible escape route besides the door... is the room's lone window! And since an eerie picture of said escape route exists... Are you saying that this photo captures the moment of the Yatagarasu's escape!? Edgeworth: (I guess Detective Badd must have filled him in on this photo... I have to admit that at first, I thought the window to be a possible escape route as well. However, I now know that to be impossible!) Lang: Now, I realize you may not know this, but... ...humans can't fly. Edgeworth: Of course I know that! That's bloody common sense! Besides, I never said I thought that photo to be of the Yatagarasu's escape route. Lang: ...I suppose not. Alright then, explain yourself. Edgeworth: The shadow in this photo is not the Yatagarasu that Kay was chasing after. Lang: Lang: You can say whatever you'd like in whatever language you want... ...but there's only one language I really understand: the language of evidence! Edgeworth: Very well, then. I present to you, proof that the person Kay saw is not the same as the one in this photo! Edgeworth: Let me explain to you precisely why the shadow in this photo is not the Yatagarasu Kay saw. Kay spotted the Yatagarasu heading for the third floor during the second fire. However, the photo in question was taken just after the first fire! Lang: Grr...rrrnoooooooooooh! Kay: Yeah! Way to go! That's TWICE you've bit him in the butt now! Lang: Lang: We're not done yet! You still have to explain what that shadow is... ...and how the Yatagarasu escaped! I don't suppose you can answer both, can you!? Edgeworth: Regarding the photo, I admit that we don't understand what it means quite yet. Lang: Hah! As I thought. Edgeworth: However, the Yatagarasu's escape route? Now, THAT I can answer. Lang: You can? Well, then, Mr. Prosecutor, go on! Enlighten me! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Even if I explain it, you'll try to find some flaw with what I have to say. You were busy heading up the Allebahstian investigation, correct? In that case, I doubt you'd have much knowledge about the Babahlese side of the case... ...so wouldn't it be best if the lead on that side, Agent Shih-na, explained in my stead? Lang: .........Argh! Shih-na is my subordinate...! If I don't stick up for her, how can I look her in the eyes and call myself her boss...!? Shih-na: .........Lang, it's alright. I can take care of him. Lang: Shih-na. Shih-na: You've shielded me a lot as my boss... ...but it's time for me to prove my worth. Lang: ...Alright. If you're OK with it, then you have my support. Edgeworth: (Finally, it's down to just Agent Shih-na and myself. This is where the battle really begins!) Shih-na: Now then, what is it you'd like to ask? Edgeworth: Hmm, let's see... Why don't we start with your movements inside the Babahlese Embassy? Shih-na: During the first Babahlese fire, I assisted in putting out the fire. During the second fire, I was searching for the Yatagarasu that had appeared in Babahl. While I was searching, I heard a scream coming from the next room over. Although I was in the next room, I was unable to catch a glimpse of the Yatagarasu. To be honest, I'm actually very skeptical that the girl's \"Yatagarasu\" even exists. Shih-na: And that is all I have to say. Kay: But I'm not lying when I say I saw the suspicious person run into Mr. Coachen's office! Like I said earlier... ...I have no intention of retracting my testimony. Shih-na: .........Good. Edgeworth: Just to confirm, did you have a partner when you were on your investigation? Shih-na: No, I moved alone. Edgeworth: In that case, you have no one to corroborate your alibi. Is that correct? Lang: Lang: Are you calling her suspicious because she was in a room by herself!? How pathetic! Edgeworth: ...And it wasn't when Agent Shih-na tried to arrest Kay under the same rationale? Lang: ............! Edgeworth: And how about when you accused Larry because he was the weapon's owner? Lang: ............Grr! Franziska: Not that it's unexpected for that useless lump to get into such a situation. Although, I suppose it's never a good idea to let mistakes go uncorrected. Lang: I will make no excuse for what I did in that situation. Gumshoe: Then you should apologize right now for making Kay out to be the killer, pal! Lang: .........I'm sorry. Shih-na, apologize. Shih-na: ............... .........I'm sorry. Kay: I-It's really OK! I mean, I'm not under suspicion anymore! Right, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Hmph. Well, I never doubted you. Not for one second. Lang: .........And the same goes for me. I believe in Shih-na. Edgeworth: Then let's put that to the test, and see if she is really worthy of your trust. Shih-na: Heh heh... This promises to be interesting. Shih-na: During the first Babahlese fire, I assisted in putting out the fire. Shih-na: During the second fire, I was searching for the Yatagarasu that had appeared in Babahl. Shih-na: While I was searching, I heard a scream coming from the next room over. Shih-na: Although I was in the next room, I was unable to catch a glimpse of the Yatagarasu. Shih-na: To be honest, I'm actually very skeptical that the girl's \"Yatagarasu\" even exists. Edgeworth: Hmph... There seems to be a very large flaw in her testimony. Kay: Oh? Then why don't you show her using what we found out with Little Thief? Edgeworth: Heh... I will, in due time. (The escape route of the Yatagarasu that Kay was in pursuit of... If it turns out that it really does lead right to Agent Shih-na... ...then what is it that she is keeping from us right now?) Edgeworth: Being in the room next to Mr. Coachen's office is the problem with your testimony. Shih-na: .........! Lang: Lang: Mr. Prosecutor... I don't see what problem you're talking about at all! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, do you recall the secret we discovered about the Allebahstian office fireplace? Lang: Huh? Oh, you mean how it connects the office with the room next door? What about it? Edgeworth: Well... Allebahst isn't the only country with secret connecting fireplaces. Lang: Wha--!? Edgeworth: The fireplace in Mr. Coachen's office holds the exact same secret! Lang: Wh...Whaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu didn't escape through the door to the room or the window. The escape route was through the revolving fireplace wall and into the next room over! Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: Now do you see? If the Yatagarasu had escaped into the next room... ...then the thief would've run straight into Agent Shih-na! Meaning that it's impossible for her to have missed the Yatagarasu! Lang: A.........Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaa! Franziska: Wh-What is the meaning of this, Miles!? Edgeworth: Well? Would you care to explain, Agent Shih-na... ...how you managed to completely miss the fleeing Yatagarasu, or shall I? Shih-na: ............ Edgeworth: Your claim that you were in the next room was a lie all along, wasn't it? The truth is, you were the one Kay saw in the coat... ...pretending to be the Yatagarasu, and you were the one she chased after. As you tried to lose her, you ran into Mr. Coachen's office, and headed for the fireplace. Then, you shed your coat in the next room, leaving it there to emerge as \"Agent Shih-na\". After that, you came back around to place Kay under arrest. Does that sound about right? If not, then speak now or forever hold your peace. Shih-na: ............ Gumshoe: How dare you make Kay look like the bad guy when you're the suspicious one, pal!? Shih-na: .........Phwwh... Phwwwwh... Edgeworth: .........! Lang: ...Shih-na...? Shih-na: Hee... hee hee hee......... ...Hee hee hee hee hee... hee hee......... Aha! Ahaha! Ahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Edgeworth: ! (That... That laugh...!) Franziska: I remember this irritating laugh... Gumshoe: Brr... I'm getting chills down my spine...! Kay: .........It can't be... But it has to be...! Lang: Shih-na... What's wrong with you...? Shih-na: Phwwh... I'm sorry. It was so funny that I couldn't help but laugh. Edgeworth: ...\"Funny\", you say? Shih-na: Yes, that you would accuse me of being the Yatagarasu. ...The prosecutors of this country really are all so very strange. Franziska: Do you think you can get away with this by simply laughing it off!? Shih-na: Phwwh... You think I'M taking things too lightly? I think not. It's that prosecutor who is. Edgeworth: .........! Shih-na: Look, everything you said earlier is nothing more than mere speculation. The Yatagarasu fled through the fireplace? Do you have any proof to back up your claim? If you don't, then you haven't proven a thing regarding the Yatagarasu's escape route! Edgeworth: The tone of voice you're taking with me now has certainly changed. Shih-na: Heh heh... That's because it's been a while since I've had this much fun. I think I'll let loose, and then we can have a real battle of wits. Edgeworth: For an agent of Interpol to show me the true power of her mind, it is a great honor. Shih-na: Phwwwh... Don't underestimate me; I'm not some foolish broad, you know. Edgeworth: I know. And that is why I won't hold anything back either as I answer your question. Shih-na: My question...? Edgeworth: Here is your proof that the revolving fireplace wall in Babahl was used recently! Shih-na: I'm sorry, but is this really your honest answer to my question? Edgeworth: Yes. According to Ambassador Palaeno's testimony... ...he said that he was burning some documents in the fireplace with Mr. Coachen. Shih-na: ...Oh? Edgeworth: The ashes of what they burned were left in the fireplace, so they should've been there. However, when we went to investigate the room, the ashes weren't there. Shih-na: Shih-na: Why is that a problem? Maybe someone cleaned them up? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph......... Unfortunately for you, Ambassador Palaeno said that he forgot to. And so the question remains: Why were the ashes missing? ...The answer is simple. When the Yatagarasu went through the fireplace wall... ...the ashes were pushed into the next room by the wall as well! The movement of the ashes that were in Mr. Coachen's office is my proof! Shih-na: Ahah! Ahaha! Ahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Edgeworth: .........And just what is so funny!? Shih-na: Ash as proof...? Are you even allowed to submit such flakey evidence in court? Franziska: You... still wish to fight us? Shih-na: Of course. Why wouldn't I? Edgeworth: In that case, let's hear your counterargument. Shih-na: Phwwwh... My counterargument, huh? This really is just like being in court. Edgeworth: Well, to me, we're simply continuing from where we left off all those years ago. Shih-na: ...Phwwwh. I have no idea what you're talking about. Edgeworth: It doesn't matter if we're at a crime scene or in court, let's finish this here and now! Shih-na: I suppose. I've had a lot of fun today, but I grow weary of this game of cat and mouse. Edgeworth: ...! Shih-na: Let's make this the last testimony, and wrap up this absurd case once and for all! Shih-na: In my eyes, all you've proved is that the rotating fireplace wall was used... ...but you can't really call that proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace, now can you? So then, who was it that used the rotating wall? Show me your answer with real evidence. Remember, we've already finished our very thorough investigation... ...and we found not a single suspicious thing in Mr. Coachen's office. Shih-na: Phwwwh... And there you have it, my counterargument. Edgeworth: ...Arngh! (That's very... impressive. She has seen through to the fact that I have yet to gather that one piece of evidence...) Kay: ............ Gumshoe: What is it, Kay? I haven't heard a peep out of you in quite a while now. Franziska If you don't think you can handle it, feel free to leave the rest of it to us. Kay: But I...! Edgeworth: Kay... Pull yourself together. You are the true heir to the Yatagarasu name, are you not? Kay: ...! Edgeworth: If you want to steal the truth, then you must never take your eyes off of it. This chase you're running to catch the truth... you must see it through to the very end. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... You're right. I... I will see this through to the end. So...... You go get her for me, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hmph... With pleasure. Shih-na: Looks like a lack of evidence has left you wide open, doesn't it? Lang: ...Shih-na. Please... show me you're someone I can trust. Shih-na: ......... Don't worry. This will be the deciding match. You'll see. Edgeworth: (I'm truly sorry, Agent Lang, but I simply can't allow her to escape me again.) Very well then, Agent Shih-na. Shall we begin? Shih-na: Phwwh... I'm ready whenever you are. Shih-na: In my eyes, all you've proved is that the rotating fireplace wall was used... Shih-na: ...but you can't really call that proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace, now can you? Shih-na: So then, who was it that used the rotating wall? Show me your answer with real evidence. Shih-na: Remember, we've already finished our very thorough investigation... Shih-na: ...and we found not a single suspicious thing in Mr. Coachen's office. Kay: So... do you actually have any proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace passageway? Edgeworth: No, I haven't found any yet. Kay: Then what are we going to do!? Edgeworth: Hmph. There's no need to worry. Because there is a loophole in Ms. Interpol Agent's argument we can exploit first. (The one in charge of the Babahlese investigation was not Agent Lang. Which means that with Agent Shih-na in charge... ...it's possible she may have tampered with the evidence. That piece of evidence that we found... If there is one thing I DO know, it is that someone tried to hide it from us!) Edgeworth: And that this throws doubt on the purity of your investigation into the Yatagarasu! Shih-na: ...! You still suspect me, I see. Alright then, I ask that you point out what part of my investigation is incomplete. Edgeworth: (The other Interpol agents worked under the command of Agent Shih-na. And is it not possible that the reason the person Kay was chasing chose the third floor... ...was because that person knew there would be no other agents on that floor? Furthermore, we've come to see that Agent Shih-na... ...was only pretending to be investigating the Yatagarasu, to the point of arresting Kay. In that case, there is one location that no one has yet to inspect!) Your team's investigation was incomplete because they failed to inspect this location! Edgeworth: The location, Agent Shih-na, is of course, the room you claimed to have examined. I believe the room next to Mr. Coachen's office warrants a thorough inspection. Shih-na: Even if you do that, I doubt you'll find anything of use to you there. Edgeworth: Hmph. I will be the one to decide that! Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I'm on it! I'll be right back after I check out that room next to the office! Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth... Do you really think that Ms. Shih-na's the Yatagarasu? Edgeworth: ...Yes, if my logic is sound, I believe she is. Kay: Then, I'm not going to let her get away with ruining the name of the Yatagarasu! Franziska: But can you prove she's the Yatagarasu is the question. Edgeworth: If Detective Gumshoe can find what I'm hoping he will find, then I should be able to. Franziska: And just what are you hoping he'll find? Edgeworth: Let's just say this. I had Detective Gumshoe do a little experiment for me earlier. Franziska: An experiment? As if that detective has the brains for high science. Edgeworth: It wasn't that mentally taxing. I had him use the same escape route as the Yatagarasu. Franziska: And what did you find out by doing that? Edgeworth: First, that it's possible for a person to fit through the revolving wall \"door\". Second, that by going through there, his coat was covered in ash and Babahlese ink. Franziska: Who cares what his coat was covered in? It's not worth that much anyway! Edgeworth: Ah, but is it really worth so little? I believe that it's actually quite a meaningful result, the value of which I'm about to prove. Franziska: ...? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! I've found some things you really need to see, sir! Edgeworth: Oh? So what are these things that you found? Gumshoe: Ummm... Some make-up, a coat, and a pair of shoes, sir. Kay: You found a coat!? You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Maybe it's the one the person I was chasing was wearing! Edgeworth: Yes, the possibility does exist. Agent Shih-na. Were these pieces of evidence not in that room when you examined it? Shih-na: Phwwwh... Unfortunately for you, those aren't \"suspicious items\" of any sort. They all belong to me. They were getting in the way, so I stored them in that room. Gumshoe: Aww...! Shih-na: Thank you for bringing them to me. It saves me a trip. May I have them back now? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: These items that the detective brought back are incredibly significant. I request that we be allowed to examine them. Shih-na: Shih-na: They're my personal belongings, so you have no right to touch them without my permission. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I wish to examine them for the sake of the investigation. But if you wish to deny us access to them... Agent Lang, let's hear your opinion on this. Lang: I say, let them look at your stuff, Shih-na. Shih-na: Lang! Lang: Shih-na, let's put it all out in the open. If you're really innocent, then you have nothing to worry about, right? Shih-na: .........I guess so, Alright, go ahead and examine whatever you'd like. After all, I have nothing to hide. Edgeworth: Hmph... Good. Now let us begin. Gumshoe: So which of Agent Shih-na's belongings are you going to examine, sir? Edgeworth: Let's examine the coat. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: It appears you managed to stain your coat rather badly... ...Agent Shih-na. Shih-na: ............ Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu that Kay saw was wearing a coat. And I'm beginning to wonder if this stain wasn't created when you went through the fireplace. Shih-na: Ahah... No, you have it wrong. That soot probably got on my coat when I was helping the police put out the fire. Edgeworth: And what about this dark substance around the hem of your coat? Shih-na: Oh! I didn't realize that the hem was that dirty. I'm sure it's just some water mixed with soot from when I was helping with the fire. Kay: I don't think so! You think you can get away with such a transparent lie!? Gumshoe: Yeah! Don't lie to us, pal! This is the same pattern of dirt that got on my coat when I went through the fireplace! Shih-na: Shih-na: Your words ring hollow in the absence of evidence, you know. So unless you can prove that the dirt on my coat is from the fireplace... Edgeworth: Which I can. Shih-na: Wh...!? How...!? Edgeworth: You did a great job, Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Me, sir? What did I do? Edgeworth: This coat... This is exactly the piece of evidence I was searching for. I had been hoping to find the coat that the person Kay saw was wearing. And thanks to you, we proved that going through the fireplace would sully a coat. Gumshoe: I don't quite get what you're saying, but I'm happy for the praise, sir! Edgeworth: All that remains... ...is for us to show what the dark substance on the coat hem is. Shih-na: Oh? And you think you can do that? Edgeworth: Of course I can. This is the dark substance that sullied the hem of this coat! Shih-na: B-Babahlese ink? Edgeworth: Yes. This is what will prove that the coat went through that fireplace! According to Ambassador Palaeno, he burned some files in the fireplace this morning. Shih-na: You told us about that already, so I don't really see the point in mentioning it again. Edgeworth: My point is that he spilled some ink onto the back wall of the fireplace at that time. Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: If the dark substance on this coat turns out to be Babahlese ink... ...it would prove that you and this coat went through the revolving fireplace wall! Shih-na: ...Ack! Edgeworth: (Sorry to have clipped one of your wings, \"Yatagarasu\", but we're not finished yet.) Shih-na: But you have no way of proving whether or not this is Babahlese ink on the coat hem! Edgeworth: Oh, but I do. And I intend to show that it IS ink in a few seconds. Shih-na: How...!? Edgeworth: How, you ask? Well, since you don't seem to know, allow me to show you. This is how I will prove that the dark substance on the coat is Babahlese ink! Edgeworth: We can find out whether that is Babahlese ink or not by lighting it on fire. Lang: That's how you're going to prove that it's Babahlese ink? Edgeworth: Yes. If you could please cut a section of the dark, stained area for me, I'd appreciate it. Because I will show you, here and now, what the dark substance is! Lang: Shih-na... Sorry to do this, but I'm going to have to cut off a bit of your coat. Shih-na: Go ahead. I wasn't planning to wear it anymore anyway. Edgeworth: Now then, if someone could loan me a lighter or something... Kay: Oh! I've got some matches! I always carry them with me so I can light smoke bombs! Edgeworth: Then, if I could please have one, Kay, we can get this experiment underway. Franziska: The flame...! Lang: It's the same color as the flames whitcrystal oil produces... Which means...! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink is a product of whitcrystal oil. And when lit, the ink produces a green flame. Shih-na: ......... Edgeworth: (Hmph. I believe the time has come to clip the Yatagarasu's other wing.) Kay: Ms. Shih-na... You're the fake Yatagarasu...! The one who killed my father! Shih-na: ......... Edgeworth: It's about time you came clean, Agent Shih-na. Or should I say... ...Calisto Yew!? Lang: Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... You're not serious, are you? Edgeworth: Do I look like the joking type to you? Shih-na: ...Ahah. Phwwwh... \"Calisto Yew\"? I've never heard that name before in my life. Franziska: That manner of speaking, and that attitude...! You haven't changed a bit in seven years! Gumshoe: You're the defense attorney that killed Mr. Faraday, and then tried to frame me for it! Shih-na: Oh really, and you have proof? You insist that I am this \"Calisto Yew\" woman, but you can't prove it! If you have no proof, then I'm afraid you won't be able to lay a single finger on me. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The raven is a very unique bird, one that flies by the darkness of night. However! The light of dawn has arrived, and it will reveal your true, ugly form to the world! Shih-na: Shih-na: Enough poetry! I want to see some evidence! Franziska: Do you really have something that can prove that she is Calisto Yew? Edgeworth: I do. It's something that the 2nd Yatagarasu has preserved for us these last seven years! Kay: Do me the honor, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: I will, Kay. For we have finally come to the end. We'll prove her to be Calisto Yew with this, and clip this Yatagarasu's wings for good! Edgeworth: This perfume... This will prove you to be Calisto Yew. Shih-na: It will...!? Edgeworth: Kay has preserved it perfectly for us. Surely you remember this bottle? This belonged to Ms. Yew just before she disappeared seven years ago. Naturally, this means that a few of her fingerprints are on here as well. Kay: This is that bottle of perfume you spilled, which I have preserved ever since. Shih-na: ...! Kay: I heard from my father, Byrne Faraday... ...that if stored under the right conditions, a fingerprint can be preserved for decades. Which means that your fingerprints are still on here. Every last one. Shih-na: ......... Edgeworth: We can clear everything up if we were to compare the prints on this to your own! Now come, Agent Shih-na! Will you submit yourself to a fingerprint test!? Shih-na: ...Ahah. Edgeworth: ! Shih-na: Hee... hee hee hee... Ahah. Ahah! Ahah! Ahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! ???: It looks like... you've seen right through me yet again... Ahah... You're sending the biggest chill down my spine, Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Calisto... Yew...! Franziska: So you've shown your true face at last. Yew: This feeling of thrill... it's even greater than that time, seven years ago. Lang: Shih-na! You're...! Yew: Lang, I really enjoyed our days together. You're an insanely strong, nice, kind-hearted... idiot of a man. Lang: So, you were a spy all along? A mole sent by the smuggling ring I've been chasing after... Someone who has been feeding them intel on Interpol all this time!? Yew: Ahah! Very good! Maybe you're not as big of an idiot as I thought! Kay: Calisto Yew... The woman who killed my father seven years ago...! You're her, aren't you!? The fake Yatagarasu! Yew: That's right. Calisto Yew... That's just one of my many names. But even that is just a fa\u00e7ade. .........Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I am... the Great Thief Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: Calisto Yew, this time you won't escape, for this is the end of the road for you. Now come along quietly! Yew: You know, you're the one who left the strongest impression on me... Kay Faraday. And had you not used the Yatagarasu's gadgets, I might've never known who you were. But here you are, being a thorn in my side... just like your father always was. Kay: ...! Edgeworth: Kay! Don't! Kay: Yew! I'll never forgive you for what you did to my father! Yew: Phwwwh... You really are just like him. Mr. Faraday, too, possessed such laughable honesty! Edgeworth: Kay! Gumshoe: Aaaaaaah! You let Kay go right now, pal! Franziska: You despicable...! Kay: Let go of me! You filthy... Arngh! Yew: You think I'm a fake, don't you? Well, unfortunately for you, I'm the real Yatagarasu. Kay: But that's impossible! My father was the one who created Little Thief! Yew: Ahaha! Hey, Edgeworth. The Yatagarasu has three legs. Do you know why that is? Edgeworth: Why it has three legs...? Badd: There are three main reasons why the Yatagarasu will always be one step ahead! First! The Yatagarasu always knows the exact location of the target object. Second! The Yatagarasu always knows exactly how to disarm the security system. Edgeworth: No, it can't be! Yew: Did you finally figure it out? Do you finally know the real identity of the Yatagarasu!? Edgeworth: The real identity of the Yatagarasu is... Edgeworth: The real identity of the Yatagarasu is neither Byrne Faraday nor Calisto Yew. But by the same token, they are also both the real Yatagarasu. Yew: Ha ha! How very perceptive of you! Kay: N-No way! Edgeworth: The single person known as the Great Thief Yatagarasu never existed. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I... No! I refuse to believe this! Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu is known to have three special skills. Skill number one. The Yatagarasu always knows the exact location of the target object. And a lawyer would have the opportunity to learn the layout of client corporations. Skill number two. The Yatagarasu always knows exactly how to disarm the security system. And a good prosecutor would be well-versed in the ways of a criminal. ???: And skill number three... The Yatagarasu doesn't leave a single shred of evidence behind... ever... Edgeworth: D-Detective Badd! Badd: ...It was only natural for the Yatagarasu to never leave evidence behind. Because the lead detective on the case... hid it all away... Edgeworth: Y-You're the third member of the Yatagarasu!? Badd: ...Yew. ...I've been looking for you for a long time. Seven long years, but I've finally got you... Yew: Ahah! Why, Mr. Badd! Long time no see. What happened to us? We used to be such a great team. Kay: If you were such a great team, then why did you kill my father seven years ago!? Yew: Ha ha ha. Why indeed? It was nothing personal, really. He was just another person I had to kill. Kay: ...! How can you say that...!? Yew: I grow weary of this, and it's about time for everything to come to an end. And this time, I won't miss. Edgeworth: Stop! Badd: Yeeeeeeeeew! Edgeworth: Kay! Lang: It's over, Shih-na. Kay: Y...! Your leg...! Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Yew: Grrrnk! Badd: You idiot...! What were you thinking, jumping in front of my gun like that...!? What are you risking your life for!? Lang: I'm sorry, Detective Badd, but no matter what sort of past she may have had... ...or even if she is a spy, it doesn't change the fact that she is my subordinate. And as long as she is, I can't allow any harm to come to her, not even from you! Yew: You really are... an idiot, you know that...? Lang: Hah! That's fine with me. You should know by now that this is just how I am. Hey, sis... Franziska: Yes...? Lang: I want you to conduct a full body search. Shih-na might have another weapon on her. Franziska: Alright. Detective Gumshoe, your assistance, please. Gumshoe: Sir! Gumshoe: Hey, I found something! What is this, sir? It looks like the blade of a knife, but it doesn't have a handle. Edgeworth: This is a great find, Detective. Gumshoe: Huh? It is, sir? Edgeworth: Let's try pairing up this blade with this handle. Edgeworth: I believe this blade actually belongs with the handle that was on the murder weapon. Gumshoe: Hey, they fit together perfectly! Edgeworth: This blade must've been taken from the crime scene when the knife handles were switched. Gumshoe: I'm going to go return this Babahlese knife now! Edgeworth: Alright. I trust that you'll make sure that it is returned to Ambassador Palaeno. Babahlese Knife Handle given to Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: I believe this makes it perfectly clear who did it, Calisto Yew! For the only time the handles could've been switched is just after Mr. Coachen's murder. Yew: Ahah...! Edgeworth: Which means that you must be Mr. Coachen's killer! You killed Mr. Coachen with the Allebahstian knife... ...switched the handles, and then took the original blade of the Babahlese knife with you. Later, you allowed yourself to be spotted by Kay near the open-air stage. You used the fireplace to lose her, and then you went back to accuse her of the murder. Does that about sum it up? Yew: Yew: Ahah... You craft an engaging tale, Edgeworth, but there are two problems with it. Edgeworth: Problems? In what respect? Yew: What do you think my real reason was in allowing her to chase after me? Edgeworth: .........? Yew: Phwwh... It was all so I could capture Kay Faraday. Kay: What!? Yew: When I saw you using that device at Gatewater Land, I knew right away... ...that you were Byrne Faraday's daughter. Ahah! I became curious, so I researched a little into your background. That's how I found out that you were on the trail of the Yatagarasu. Kay: So that's why you tried to pin Mr. Coachen's murder on me? Yew: Yes... I knew you would show up at this embassy tonight. So I thought to use you. But pinning the murder on you wasn't my only goal. Kay: You had another? Yew: Heh heh, yes. Once I had you under arrest, I had planned to search you... ...and take back the device that rightfully belongs to me, the true Yatagarasu. Kay: You were going to take Little Thief away from me!? Yew: Seven years ago, it was thanks to that device that Faraday was able to infiltrate this place. But he stole more than he should've. I had a tough time recovering that precious key. Edgeworth: Then, the person who stole the Yatagarasu's Key was Mr. Faraday...!? Badd: Yew... That incident seven years ago... What was the catalyst behind it? Yew: In the eyes of the smuggling ring, the Yatagarasu was becoming a bit of a problem. ...It wasn't an especially pleasant assignment. Kay: ......... Edgeworth: Then why!? Why did you become a member of the Yatagarasu!? Yew: Why? There is no \"why\". I was destined to betray everyone from the very beginning. Edgeworth: From the beginning? What is that supposed to mean? Yew: The person I take orders from hasn't changed... Even now, to this day. Edgeworth: ! (Does this mean that the leader of the smuggling ring wasn't Mr. Coachen? Then... the real ringleader is still out there pulling the strings!) Lang: Are you done asking what you need to know? Because if so, we should probably get going. And you're going to tell me everything you did tonight. Do you understand, Shih-na? Yew: I guess I should tell you, then, that I was the one who set the Babahlese Embassy on fire. Edgeworth: And why did you do that? Yew: Ahah... I suppose it was to destroy all evidence of the counterfeit bills. Lang: That was what the smuggling ring was trying to do...? But then, why start two fires!? Yew: Sorry, but I can't tell you anything about the ring. It's your job to complete your investigation, after all. I've had my fun. Now, it's your turn to enjoy the ride. Kay: ...Wait! Ye... I mean, Ms. Shih-na. Yew: Yes? Kay: When I fell to the floor earlier, these fell at my feet. Yew: What about them...? Kay: They're such pretty hair sticks that I thought... well, that I should return them to you. Yew: Ha ha... You can have them. They're of no use to me anymore. If you don't want them, you can always just throw them away. Kay: .........No, I want to keep them. Yew: Ahah... Suit yourself. .........Oh, that's right. I almost forgot, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hm...? Yew: About the second problem I had with your story... I didn't kill anyone tonight. Edgeworth: What...? Yew: I'm not saying that as a sore loser. Think of it as a hint, if you will. Lang: Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: Yes, Agent Lang? Lang: Mark my words, I'm not done here, and I'll be back! And it's got nothing to do with duty or anything, because this has become my personal case. I may have been shot... ...but I'll show you just how dangerous a wounded wolf can be! Edgeworth: (His anger appears to have negated the sensation of pain in his injured leg...) It's finally over, Kay. Kay: I feel like I've peered into her heart a little, you know? And it's so cold, and dark... and incredibly lonely. The person who was giving her all these commands... ...the one who thought my father was a problem to be removed... Edgeworth: That person is the real ringleader behind the smuggling ring! Kay: Um, Mr. Edgeworth, I have a favor to ask. Can you... hold onto these hair sticks for me? They're really pretty, just like the ones they were selling for the Jammin' Ninja show... ...but until this case is over, I don't think I can look at them without being overcome. Edgeworth: ...I understand. I'll take good care of them for you. (Hm...? There is a bit of soil stuck on the ends of these sticks...) Hair Sticks data jotted down in my Organizer. Gumshoe: Oh! I guess it's that time already, huh!? Franziska: So it's midnight... the dawn of another day. Gumshoe: Hey, pops! Thanks a bunch! You've really done a lot for everyone all these years! Edgeworth: Detective Badd, don't tell me today is the day...? Badd: Yeah... it is. With this... I can retire in peace. ...It was down to the wire, and we almost didn't make it... ...but we did it... we solved everything. Edgeworth: But that's just it; we haven't solved everything yet. The ringleader of the smuggling ring you, the Yatagarasu, were chasing after... Badd: ...The legend of that Yatagarasu... is now over. Mr. Edgeworth... That bit of logic earlier... it was brilliant. Edgeworth: ... Badd: I feel like... I can leave it all in your hands. ...I'm counting on you. Kay: Is it really true, Uncle Badd? Were you also a part of the Yatagarasu...? Badd: As I said to you earlier... Kay... I'm truly sorry. I wanted... nothing but a peaceful life for you... Kay: Uncle Badd... Gumshoe: Hey, don't take it so seriously! It's all just one big joke, right!? Franziska: ...Unfortunately, it isn't. Gumshoe: O-Oh, come on, sir! She's just yanking on my chain, isn't she, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Detective Badd... Wait, no, you are no longer a detective... Mr. Badd, I'd like to ask you about the Yatagarasu. Gumshoe: ...Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth... Badd: Mr. Edgeworth... ...Here, I should give these back to you. Edgeworth: These are... ...the pages from my KG-8 case files that the Yatagarasu stole from my office! Gumshoe: Huh? Wait? WHAT!? Badd: Mr. Edgeworth, I must apologize for last night. Edgeworth: So the Yatagarasu who stole into my room was you, was it? Gumshoe: Wait... then that means... WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? T-Tell me it's not true...! Th-That's too insane for me to believe, sir! Badd: It's true... Even if it's not something you want to hear. The KG-8 Incident... It was a very emotionally trying case. We stood in that courtroom... Faraday as the prosecutor... and I as the lead detective. Faraday had... evidence in his possession... that would prove the defendant guilty. However... because it was stolen, the defendant... was found innocent. Yew was... the elder sister... of the victim in the case. When the defendant was pronounced \"not guilty\"... she... let out a great wail. That's when we realized... that there was a limit... to what the law could do. The only way to bring someone like that to justice was to do so outside of the courts... That's what we thought... at the time. ...That's how we... formed the Yatagarasu... ...and vowed to bring to light... any dirty dealings companies had with the ring... ...including companies that dealt with... the Amano Group... Edgeworth: Mr. Amano's conglomerate...? Badd: We called ourselves the Yatagarasu... and flexed our collective muscle... We exposed all sorts of shady dealings... as a warning to the business world as a whole... By doing that... we were able to stop... the higher ups from covering things up. And then... it was finally time... We had finally arrived at the moment when... we'd find out the ringleader's true identity. It was then that Yew literally stabbed us in the heart... and Faraday... he died for it... Edgeworth: .................. Kay: But why...? Wasn't she the sister of the victim in the KG-8 Incident? Badd: ...After Faraday's death, I looked into her past... And that's when I found out... that she was a phony. The victim of the KG-8 Incident, Cece Yew... ...she ...never had a sister. Edgeworth: What? Then that means... Badd: \"Shih-na\" wasn't the only fake name she used! \"Calisto Yew\" was also another pseudonym! From the very beginning... that woman was a spy sent by the smuggling ring! Franziska: She said it herself; \"I was destined to betray everyone from the very beginning.\" Badd: Anyway... Let's return to the real topic at hand... Mr. Edgeworth... this \"trump card\" that we stuck onto this page of the case file... ...please use it wisely. Edgeworth: \"Trump card\"...? Badd: That photo that we stuck on there... Try peeling it off. Behind it... slumbers a piece of evidence... that Faraday hid away all those years ago. Edgeworth: It's the mark of the Yatagarasu... But why? Badd: This is... a \"directives card\"... from the big boss. Take a look... at the back. This was something... Coachen had on him at the time of the KG-8 Incident... ten years ago. That blood... is from the victim of the incident, Ms. Cece Yew... Edgeworth: But why is the card adorned with the mark of the Yatagarasu? Badd: The reason why... we called ourselves... the Yatagarasu... ...was because... of the three-legged raven mark that the smuggling ring's boss used. Apparently, orders from the boss... would come on these cards, without fail. The person who received the order... was supposed to burn it immediately after reading it. And apparently... it burns a bright green flame when set ablaze... Edgeworth: So you mean, the cards were written in Babahlese ink...? Badd: The fact that the card that Coachen was sent made it into Faraday's hand at all... ...is nothing short of a miracle. We decided... that whenever we stole anything... ...we would send a \"card\" along with it... to the police. Edgeworth: So that's what those white cards are! Badd: The Great Thief that used the mark... that only those within the ring would know... It was our message... to the ringleader... ...that we were only a few steps behind. Trump Card data jotted down in my Organizer. Badd: And one more thing... Detective Gumshoe. I'm entrusting this to you. Gumshoe: What is this, sir? Badd: This is what I was talking about earlier. During the KG-8 Incident trial, Faraday had this in his possession... ...this important, definitive piece of evidence... Edgeworth: But I thought it was stolen, How do you have it...? Badd: The person who stole it from us... ten years ago... ...was a man by the name of Ernest Amano... And he had it locked and hidden away... for all this time. But we forced him to tell us where it was finally... after the other day's kidnapping case. Video Tape data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: This video...! Portsman: Wh--! Don't come any closer! I'm warning you! Edgeworth: This is the same video as the one Mr. Portsman was trying to conceal from me! Badd: Yeah, it would seem that even he was caught up in the ring's web. Amano was preparing to take on the boss someday... ...and the video was his insurance. That's where that prosecutor comes in... He was to retrieve the video. On top of that... he was apparently instructed to sneak into your office... ...and steal the trump card... You saw it for yourself, right? The card that told him to preserve the evidence. Edgeworth: Then, that card was not the calling card of the Yatagarasu... ...but rather, a directives card from the ringleader to Mr. Portsman? Badd: The two pieces together make for a strong weapon for whoever holds them. Edgeworth: The evidence Mr. Portsman thought to withhold from me... ...and the one that you stole from my office last night... Both pieces are illegal, and for me to use either one is... Badd: Whether you use them or not... is up to you. But they will be of help to you... when you take on someone who is above the law. Edgeworth: (Is the boss one of those who \"cannot be brought to court\" that Mr. Faraday spoke of?) Detective Badd... There is no limit to the law, for it is the people who determine the limits to them. Badd: You still insist that, even now? You really are something else. I leave the rest in your hands. Now then, Detective Gumshoe. The handcuffs. It's time to lock up... the last remaining member of the Yatagarasu. Gumshoe: Pops... Badd: ...Don't ever lose your detective's spirit. Gumshoe: Nnnnrrrgh... Pops! Why is this happening!? This isn't justice! Badd: Like I always told you... do not get emotionally involved. ...Now let's go. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Is this really the end of a legend...? To be continued \nLang: One of Allebahst's knives was used in Babahl to murder Mr. Coachen. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I concur that this knife crossed over country lines. Lang: Good, but that's not the only thing that did. We mustn't forget about the other weapon! The knife was only one. Lang: And the murder weapon in the killing of DeMasque II is Babahl's Primidux Statue. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you're saying that the Primidux Statue was also brought over by Franziska? Lang: Like I told you before, that's the only way it makes sense! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And how exactly did she bring it over? Lang: I... haven't figured that out yet. Edgeworth: Hmph... That's a rather weak statement, considering how sure you are. Lang: Maybe, but there is one thing I do know for sure. Lang: Somehow, these two objects were able to penetrate the two countries' impenetrable security. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Impenetrable\"...? I should hardly think so. Lang: Lang: You've seen the top of the wall between the two countries, right? Who in the world could cross over that? Kay: Yeah, not even I could climb over that thing with all that barbed wire... Lang: The only way into either embassy is through the doors in the Theatrum Neutralis. So the only way for the knife and the Primidux Statue to traverse the two countries... ...is through those security camera-equipped, well-guarded doors. Present Babahl's Primidux Statue or Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Agent Lang, those two items are not the only two to cross the border tonight.\" Lang: The only one who traversed the two countries just before and after the crimes was you. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was Franziska really the only person to have traveled between the two countries? Lang: According to the guards at both doors, she is the only one to go back and forth. The sis there was in Allebahst when the Yatagarasu showed. And then, just before you guys found Mr. Coachen's body, she entered Babahl. I think we can assume that's when she brought the knife into Babahl. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Then how do you explain the Primidux Statue? Lang: ...I haven't quite figured that out yet. However, the fact that the two weapons crossed the border... ...proves that the killer must have also traveled across the country lines! Edgeworth: (The only things to cross the border are the Primidux Statue and the knife? I should hardly think that those are the only two items, Agent Lang...!) Edgeworth: Agent Lang, those two items are not the only two to cross the border tonight. Lang: Oh? Edgeworth: DeMasque II was killed with Babahl's Primidux Statue, yes. But if that's the case, then tell me, where did Allebahst's Primidux Statue go? Lang: To Babahl...! Edgeworth: Precisely. And if the two statues really were switched... ...then this means that both statues were smuggled across the border at some point. Which means that a total of three items were smuggled across the embassies! Lang: Hmm... I guess so. But you know what? It doesn't matter the number of items, only that the sis is the only one who could've done it! Because the only person who went back and forth between Allebahst and Babahl is her! Edgeworth: (Is that really true? Was there no one else who traveled between the two countries? Actually, there was definitely another person; one who paid a visit to both sides of the wall!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Is that really so, Agent Lang? Lang: Ha ha ha ha! What a lousy time to try and bluff your way out of this! I checked out what the guards said, along with the security cameras' footage. You're not going to overturn my hypothesis that easily! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But suppose there was some other way other than through the theater doors? Lang: What other way...? Edgeworth: (The other entity that managed to cross the border unharmed... If I point it out, it would open up a whole new possibility! And though I hesitate to bring this out... ...as long as this entity exists, the impossible road becomes a possibility.) Lang: It looks like you've got some clever idea in mind. Edgeworth: I do, and I can show it to you through a single piece of evidence. Lang: Tch! Fine, then. Let's see this piece of evidence that will show me this \"other route\"! Edgeworth: This piece of evidence will show us another way to move between the two countries! Present Photo of Yatagarasu Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Agent Lang, I'm sure you are familiar with this unforgettable photo.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I believe this is the piece of evidence that will show you how! Lang: ......... What about it? You're going to have to explain because I don't see another road or anything here (changed from [else] in the original release)! Edgeworth: B-But how can you not see!? Wolves are known for their keen eyesight! Lang: Sorry, but the only thing I see is the crud that you're hoping will stick to the wall. Edgeworth: (I need to think calmly about this and find that other road the smuggled goods took...) Leads back to: \"This piece of evidence will show us another way to move between the two countries!\" Edgeworth: Agent Lang, I'm sure you are familiar with this unforgettable photo. Lang: Tch...! That supernatural photo!? Like I said before... Humans can't fly. Edgeworth: No, of course not. I understand that perfectly well. Lang: And don't start claiming that Shih-na somehow grew wings, either. Edgeworth: I wouldn't dream of claiming that. Lang: And I won't allow you to take back what you've said either! I'll say it again; it's not humanly possible to fly through the air without wings! So you'd better have a good explanation for this, Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: ...Arngh! (But how can I prove who it was that flew through the air in this photo!? Wait. \"Not humanly possible\"...? Eureka...!) Very well. You will have your explanation! Lang: It sounds like you have a good idea simmering inside that head of yours... Let's hear it! The face hidden within this photo's blurry, trailed shadow is...!? Present Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Naturally, the shadow is the third smuggled object, the Primidux Statue replica.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is the face behind the shadow! Lang: Lang: I thought I said that you'd better have a GOOD explanation. I can't make heads or tails of what you're trying to say with that! Edgeworth: Nnrgh! (W-Was I wrong...?) Lang: Come on... Hurry up and show me what that shadow that's flying through the air is! Edgeworth: Even had you not barked that at me, I would've gladly done so, Agent Lang. (I need to go over it one more time. The man-shaped shadow that flew through the air, wrapped in the darkness of the night... Its real shape can only be this one thing!) Leads back to: \"Let's hear it! The face hidden within this photo's blurry, trailed shadow is...!?\" Edgeworth: Naturally, the shadow is the third smuggled object, the Primidux Statue replica. Lang: You can't be serious! Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu... or rather, Calisto Yew dressed as Agent Shih-na, was inside Babahl. She dressed the replica statue up in clothes, and launched it through the air. Lang: Lang: Hah... Mr. Prosecutooooooor! You left out a very crucial bit in your explanation. Edgeworth: I know I did. Lang: She \"launched it through the air\"!? Hah... And how exactly did she do thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (He is literally baring his fangs at me...! But he has a point. How exactly did it move through the air like that? As long as this remains unsolved, we won't be able to move any closer to the truth! Which reminds me, didn't he say this earlier...?) Lang: Hey, sis... I remember that just before Ambassador Alba went to give his speech... ...he called you into his office, right? Edgeworth: (So, just before the murder, Franziska was called here, right into this very room. If that's the case... then that may be another avenue I can pursue.) Agent Lang. In order for me to answer that question... ...I will need to hear testimony from Ms. von Karma. Franziska: ! Lang: Oh...? What are you up to now, pretty boy? Edgeworth: Earlier, you mentioned something of interest to me. You said that just before the murder occurred... ...Ms. von Karma had been in this room because Ambassador Alba had called for her. And for that reason alone, you believe her to be the killer. Lang: Yeah, I guess I did say something like that. Edgeworth: In that case, I believe it is my duty to ask her what her side of the story is. Lang: Hah! Do you really think a criminal would tell us the honest truth? Franziska: How dare you!? As I've said numerous times, there is absolutely no proof that I am the killer! Miles Edgeworth! Don't tell me you suspect me, too!? Edgeworth: I don't. However, I can't ignore the fact that you were in this room at one point in time. Which is why I would like to hear about it from you (changed from [your movements in this room] in the original release). Franziska: Krngh! Edgeworth: Franziska... I feel that I still don't have enough information... ...which is why your testimony is incredibly important to the outcome of this case. Franziska: ............ Alright. So? What would you like me to talk about? Edgeworth: Hmm... I'd like you to please testify to your movements up until you came into this room (changed from [in this room until the murder occurred] in the original release). Lang: Hmph... Alright, let's try this your way for a change. But if what she has to say turns out to be a waste of time... ...I'll place her under arrest faster than you can howl \"Nooooooooooooo!\" Edgeworth: Hmph... As you wish. Testimony -- Movements in Allebahst -- Franziska: As I said earlier, I was assigned to guard duty in the Allebahstian Embassy. After I saw the Steel Samurai off on his way towards the ambassador's office... ...I returned to the rose garden for a bit, and checked up on the security situation. After all the preparations were in place, I was called back by Ambassador Alba to his office. Edgeworth: Franziska, I want us to make this clear from the very beginning... ...so what I wish to confirm is that the only time span in which you were in this office... ...was before the murder occurred. Is that correct? Franziska: Yes, of course. Edgeworth: I see. (For now, the only way that I can see for us to break out of this situation... ...is to ask Franziska about her testimony in more detail.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I thought your duty was to fact-find anything you could about the smuggling ring? Franziska: Yes, that was my job. But upon hearing that the Yatagarasu had sent a calling card to the Embassy... ...Ambassador Alba called upon us to protect the Embassy instead. That incident seven years ago... Or have you forgotten what happened here back then? Edgeworth: Nngh... (Anything related to that case we were involved in appears to be rather painful for her. It's not exactly one I can readily forget myself...) Franziska: Hmph... It looks like you remember the case after all. Edgeworth: Of course I do. Franziska: I inspected every location, every possible escape route... ...and every aspect of the police's security detail. I did all that, then after that... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were at the theater as well? Franziska: Yes, and I suppose you were also there as well, watching that stage show? Edgeworth: Well, yes. (So Franziska was there...) Franziska: Hmph... Well, after the show was over and I saw the Steel Samurai off... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Why did you need to confirm the degree of preparation for even the speech? Franziska: For security's sake, of course. What other reason could I have had? No one knew just how the Yatagarasu had planned on getting in, right? Edgeworth: Yes, I suppose you're right. Franziska: And in the end, the Yatagarasu did choose to appear in the rose garden... Even if it did turn out to be nothing more than a shadow... Arngh... Who would've thought that she would use a shadow!? Edgeworth: Ack! C-Calm down, Franziska! (She must still be nursing a grudge over the fact that she couldn't figure it out herself.) Franziska: Hmph... Anyway, there was no one in the rose garden. And we were aware that the speech was set to start soon thereafter. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: At that time, DeMasque II's body had yet to be found in this room, is that correct? Franziska: That's right. But Ambassador Alba was here. One could hardly miss his rather large presence. Edgeworth: Hmm... Lang: Hmph! A criminal will say anything to get out of getting arrested! How do we know you're not lying!? Franziska: Well, if you need proof, I'd be happy to oblige you. Lang: Seriously!? Franziska: Like I keep telling you... ...when I arrived at this office, Ambassador Alba was already here. He was standing by the flower box on the windowsill, watering his plants. Alba: Ah, I can attest to that. I remember speaking with the lovely lady around that time here in my office. Lang: Grr! Alright, then... Add that statement to your testimony, and let's hear some details. Edgeworth: (So Ambassador Alba was in this room at the time, was he...?) Adds statement \"When I arrived, Ambassador Alba was watering the flowers on the windowsill.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: For the sake of being thorough, I'd like to ask you something. How did you know that Ambassador Alba was watering his plants at the windowsill? Franziska: What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: The entrance to this room is on this side, however, the window is on the opposite side. If what you say is true, then when you entered the room, his body would've been like a wall. He would've been blocking your view of what he was doing. Isn't that not correct? Franziska: I suppose it was a bit hard to see around him. But fortunately for me Ambassador Alba is not an immovable wall. Edgeworth: ...? Franziska: I knocked before I entered, and as I did, he turned around to greet me... ...with a watering can in his hand. So it's only natural to believe that he was watering his plants, right? Edgeworth: I suppose. Franziska: After his greeting, we spent a little time talking about his flowers. He had obtained them himself, and is growing them with the utmost care, you know. Alba: Yes... The plants in this room... They are all like my children. Franziska: The passionflowers in the flower box on the windowsill are growing beautifully, too. All four of them are in full bloom. Edgeworth: ! Ms. von Karma, what did you say just now? Franziska: I said that the flowers are growing beautifully. What about that statement do you not understand? Edgeworth: (What do I not understand? I do not understand why a certain thing is the way it is...) I'd like for you to append that statement to your testimony. Franziska: Very well. Adds statement \"There were four large passionflowers in full bloom in the flower box.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: For the sake of being thorough, I'd like to ask you something. How did you know that Ambassador Alba was watering his plants at the windowsill? Franziska: What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: The entrance to this room is on this side, however, the window is on the opposite side. If what you say is true, then when you entered the room, his body would've been like a wall. He would've been blocking your view of what he was doing. Isn't that not correct? Franziska: I suppose it was a bit hard to see around him. But fortunately for me Ambassador Alba is not an immovable wall. Edgeworth: ...? Franziska: I knocked before I entered, and as I did, he turned around to greet me... ...with a watering can in his hand. So it's only natural to believe that he was watering his plants, right? Edgeworth: I suppose. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'd like to confirm this with you one more time. There were four passionflowers in bloom in that box, correct? Franziska: Yes. I should hardly think I could have miscounted such eye-catching flowers. Edgeworth: (There must be a deeper meaning to this statement. And it appears that I must take a gamble on its meaning for me to make any progress!) Edgeworth: (The Primidux Statues were already switched by the time the murder happened. In light of that fact, what Franziska saw in this room before the crime... ...is of incredible importance!)Franziska: As I said earlier, I was assigned to guard duty in the Allebahstian Embassy. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I thought your duty was to fact-find anything you could about the smuggling ring? Franziska: Yes, that was my job. But upon hearing that the Yatagarasu had sent a calling card to the Embassy... ...Ambassador Alba called upon us to protect the Embassy instead. That incident seven years ago... Or have you forgotten what happened here back then? Edgeworth: Nngh... (Anything related to that case we were involved in appears to be rather painful for her. It's not exactly one I can readily forget myself...) Franziska: Hmph... It looks like you remember the case after all. Edgeworth: Of course I do. Franziska: I inspected every location, every possible escape route... ...and every aspect of the police's security detail. I did all that, then after that... Franziska: After I saw the Steel Samurai off on his way towards the ambassador's office... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were at the theater as well? Franziska: Yes, and I suppose you were also there as well, watching that stage show? Edgeworth: Well, yes. (So Franziska was there...) Franziska: Hmph... Well, after the show was over and I saw the Steel Samurai off... Franziska: ...I returned to the rose garden for a bit, and checked up on the security situation. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Why did you need to confirm the degree of preparation for even the speech? Franziska: For security's sake, of course. What other reason could I have had? No one knew just how the Yatagarasu had planned on getting in, right? Edgeworth: Yes, I suppose you're right. Franziska: And in the end, the Yatagarasu did choose to appear in the rose garden... Even if it did turn out to be nothing more than a shadow... Arngh... Who would've thought that she would use a shadow!? Edgeworth: Ack! C-Calm down, Franziska! (She must still be nursing a grudge over the fact that she couldn't figure it out herself.) Franziska: Hmph... Anyway, there was no one in the rose garden. And we were aware that the speech was set to start soon thereafter. Franziska: After all the preparations were in place, I was called back by Ambassador Alba to his office. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: At that time, DeMasque II's body had yet to be found in this room, is that correct? Franziska: That's right. But Ambassador Alba was here. One could hardly miss his rather large presence. Edgeworth: Hmm... Lang: Hmph! A criminal will say anything to get out of getting arrested! How do we know you're not lying!? Franziska: Well, if you need proof, I'd be happy to oblige you. Lang: Seriously!? Franziska: Like I keep telling you... ...when I arrived at this office, Ambassador Alba was already here. He was standing by the flower box on the windowsill, watering his plants. Alba: Ah, I can attest to that. I remember speaking with the lovely lady around that time here in my office. Lang: Grr! Alright, then... Add that statement to your testimony, and let's hear some details. Edgeworth: (So Ambassador Alba was in this room at the time, was he...?) Adds statement \"When I arrived, Ambassador Alba was watering the flowers on the windowsill.\" Franziska: When I arrived, Ambassador Alba was watering the flowers on the windowsill. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: For the sake of being thorough, I'd like to ask you something. How did you know that Ambassador Alba was watering his plants at the windowsill?

Edgeworth: (There must be a deeper meaning to this statement. And it appears that I must take a gamble on its meaning for me to make any progress!) Present Passionflowers Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Franziska...\" Edgeworth: (The Primidux Statues were already switched by the time the murder happened. In light of that fact, what Franziska saw in this room before the crime... ...is of incredible importance!) Edgeworth: Franziska... For some odd reason... your testimony contradicts with this piece of evidence. Franziska: It does appear that way. Lang: Hah! I know it! I knew we couldn't trust your words, sis! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! What are you doing discrediting Ms. von Karma like this!? Gumshoe: Yeah, sir! If you keep this up, she's gonna get taken away, sir! Eeek! Franziska: All I've done is state what I saw! I have not made (changed from [made not] in the original release) a single mistake in my testimony! And for this... I am still under suspicion for murder. Is the number of flowers really all that important at this juncture, Miles? Edgeworth: At the very least, it is a contradiction in this enigmatic case. One that I find hard to dismiss as irrelevant. Lang: Hah! Then let's hear it, Mr. Prosecutor! What does the number of flowers have to do with anything? What does it prove? Edgeworth: I believe the answer to that will become clear if we were to examine that flower box. (How did this contradiction come about...? There must be something behind this discrepancy!) Alba: Th-They're my beloved flowers. I've grown them with the utmost care. So I ask that you please be gentle with them as you examine them, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hmph... I understand. (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Examine flowers Edgeworth: The name of these flowers... I believe they're called \"passionflowers\". Despite being called \"flowers\", they are actually a species of vine. They appear to be growing well, and are well-supported by these plant supports. Lang: Yeah, but no matter how I look at it, it looks like there are only two here to me! You realize, don't you, sis... Your little lie has failed you! Franziska: Arngh! Miles Edgeworth! Hurry up and shut this man up for me already! Edgeworth: Hmm... (I suppose I will need to use some evidence to \"shut him up\", won't I...?) Show evidence Edgeworth: Hmph... I believe I have just the piece of evidence you require. Lang: Oh? You do, do you!? You have such confidence in the face of your current plight... ...but I highly doubt it'll last until the end! Edgeworth: Hmph... You howl like a wolf, Agent Lang... ...but we'll see if you have any bite to back up that bark after you see the evidence! The truth the passionflowers reveal can be seen in this piece of evidence! Present Hair Sticks Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Shih-na, who was supposedly in Babahl the entire time, had these \"hair sticks\" on her...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well? What do you think now, Agent Lang? Lang: Lang: Hah! You may talk big... but as usual, it's nothing more than a big bluff! Edgeworth: Gnrk! (Was I wrong!? Perhaps I should gather a bit more information before I attempt this again...) Leads back to examination of windowsill Don't have evidence to show Edgeworth: (Not yet... I still have a thing or two left to examine.) Leads back to examination of windowsill Examine watering can Edgeworth: This watering can has a rather robust design. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Why are you telling us stuff we can clearly see for ourselves!? Plus, if you keep wasting time talking about that, Ms. von Karma's gonna get arrested! Edgeworth: Nngh... (I'd better examine something else.) Examine flower box Edgeworth: This flower box... It appears to be made of marble. Franziska: It looks that way. But, so what? Is it something that's so important that you absolutely had to mention it? Edgeworth: N-No, not exactly, but... Franziska: .........Miles Edgeworth. You DO understand our current situation, don't you? Edgeworth: Y-Yes, of course. I am fully aware of the situation. Franziska: Oh? Then in that case, allow me to ask you once again. Is what the flower box is made out of really all that important? Edgeworth: Nngh... (It would appear that the construction of the flower box is not that important.) Examine holes in soil Edgeworth: (Hm...? This patch of soil looks as though it has had something removed from it.) Lang: Heh! What are you doing, Mr. Prosecutor? Why'd you clam up all of a sudden? I'm still here, waiting for an explanation, you know! Edgeworth: Did you know, Agent Lang? Flowers are best appreciated in silence. Lang: ...Tch. Edgeworth: (It looks like two things were pulled out of this flower box...) Edgeworth: Shih-na, who was supposedly in Babahl the entire time, had these \"hair sticks\" on her... ...that look exactly like the plant supports in this flower box. In other words, I believe it can be said that these \"hair sticks\" are in actuality... ...support sticks for the passionflowers! Lang: Heh! And so what!? Is this really all that important to the case? Examine evidence Hair Sticks Top of hair stick Edgeworth: Aha... So this ring-like section... ...is there to support vines like passionflowers up, huh? But if that's all they were meant to do, then what is this notch on the top end? Kay: Maybe it's for string or something to run through? To help the stick stay upright? Edgeworth: A notch for string to run through, huh? Tip of hair stick Edgeworth: I suppose this dirt was from when this plant support was stuck in the flower box. Kay: I guess that's why only the tip is dirty, huh? Edgeworth: Yes. Edgeworth: Of course it is. It means that we've found yet another item that was smuggled between the countries tonight. Lang: Aiya! Edgeworth: Think about it logically, Agent Lang. These sticks were originally in Allebahst... ...but somehow, they wound up in Shih-na's hands, who was in Babahl the whole night. So make no mistake! These sticks were smuggled somehow, just like the knife and statue! Lang: Arngh! Hmph! Very well, then! I want to hear from you exactly how they wound up in Babahl! Edgeworth: (How did these support sticks find their way to Babahl and why? There must be some reason as to why they ended up there... Aha! So that's why!) Agent Lang, if you would please take a look at this and tell me its shape. Lang: Hmph! It's just another stick, isn't it!? Edgeworth: Hmph... And so it is. But the shape of the support sticks is what is important. For when they are used with something in this room, that's when it all comes into focus. And the object that completes the picture when used with the support sticks is...! Present crossbow Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Th-That's a crossbow... Wait! You're not really suggesting...!?\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is what was used with the support sticks! Lang: .........Come again? Edgeworth: Isn't it obvious? Someone used those with this... Franziska: \"Those with this\"...? Could you be any more vague!? Why don't you try again!? Edgeworth: Y-Yes, I suppose I should. (It would appear that this was insufficient in conveying what I had wanted to say. The answer should become obvious to me if I just think calmly about it once more. But the only thing that can really connect the two offices together has to be this!) Leads back to: \"And the object that completes the picture when used with the support sticks is...!\" Lang: Th-That's a crossbow... Wait! You're not really suggesting...!? Edgeworth: I am. These hair sticks... or rather, plant support sticks... They make for perfect  arrows! Lang: Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Edgeworth: (I've done it! I've found the common thread that connects the two offices! But this thread has yet to be completely untangled. Even using the arrows, how does this explain how the statues were transported? Furthermore, who could it have been who fired these sticks as arrows? There MUST be a common thread that ties all of these things together!) Examine evidence Crossbow Arrows Loop on arrow Edgeworth: I thought these loops were just an eccentric design quirk... ...but who knew that they were actually arrow fletchings? Lang: Lang: Mr. Prosecutor! Hold up a second! You do realize what happens when you tie a statue to an arrow, right? They don't fly at all! Argument -- Border-Crossing, Pt. 2 -- Lang: So Babahl's statue was draped in the Yatagarasu's clothes, and then shot over here? Even if you fired the arrows from this side, they wouldn't go far with a statue tied to them! I don't think I need to tell you that the Primidux Statues didn't sprout wings. You're a realist, after all, aren't you? Edgeworth: The Primidux Statues didn't sprout wings...? Hmph. Of course they didn't. Lang: Glad you understand. I feel much better already. I was afraid for a second that you were unaware of that crucial fact! Edgeworth: It's only crucial because you're under the belief that wings are necessary to this equation. Lang: What? Edgeworth: You need to free your mind a bit more, and let it fly like a bird on the wind. The Primidux Statues flew, but not on a wing. Allow me a bit of your time, and I'll explain this mysterious phenomenon to you! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But that incredible scene just happened to have been caught on film, resulting in this photo. Lang: Hah! And what an incredible scene it was! This photo was taken by a freelance photojournalist, right? Edgeworth: Yes, so I hear. Lang: And not every photojournalist is known to be honest, right? Especially not the ones that sell photos of spirits and giant creatures to tabloids. Edgeworth: Yes, I know what you mean. I've seen those sorts of photos many a time in court. But there have been times when those photos have turned out to be telling the truth. If you had ever stood in a court of law, you would know that it's entirely plausible. Lang: Hah! You really believe the stuff you're spewing right now? A courtroom certainly is a strange place, if what you say is true. But there really is something odd about that photo no matter how you look at it. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But we are in agreement that an arrow by itself would reach the other side, correct? Lang: But just the arrow by itself is pretty meaningless, don't you think, Mr. Prosecutor? Because the things they wanted to smuggle were a lot bigger than nothing! Edgeworth: No, that's not necessarily true. Lang: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (What I need right now... ...is not further discussion of my conclusions; it's the launching of my conclusions! What the shooter wanted to launch with the crossbow was not the statues themselves! But rather, something a crossbow can launch that can be used to move the statues!) Adds statement \"If it wasn't a statue that was tied to the arrows, then what did the crossbow launch...?\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The thing the crossbow launched...? Allow me to show you the answer! Lang: Well, come on, then! Show me what you've got! But I warn you! I'll know when you're just bluffing! Edgeworth: This is what was launched from this Allebahstian office with the crossbow! Present Wire Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Finally...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence is what was launched from here in Allebahst! Lang: Lang: And what purpose, exactly, did launching that serve? Because if you're joking, it's not gonna be a fit of laughter I'm about to launch into! Edgeworth: Ack!

I think I understand what went sailing through the air! Edgeworth: Hmph... I suppose that's because you're an expert at things that fly through the air. Kay: What did you expect from the second Yatagarasu!? Edgeworth: Indeed. Now, to show Agent Lang what really went soaring through the air tonight.Lang: So Babahl's statue was draped in the Yatagarasu's clothes, and then shot over here?

Now, to show Agent Lang what really went soaring through the air tonight. Edgeworth: Finally... Finally, we have reached this point in our discussion. For I present to you, that which was carried by the arrow from the crossbow! Lang: Heh. I get it now, Mr. Prosecutor... I can see exactly what you are trying to say! You're saying that the wire was tied to an arrow and then shot into Mr. Coachen's office! All the way from the fifth floor of the Allebahstian Embassy... ...down to the third floor of the Babahlese Embassy! If what you're claiming is really what happened... ...I can see how Allebahst's Primidux Statue could be moved. Gravity could be used to move the statue down the wire from the fifth to the third floor. But then, what about Babahl's Primidux Statue? The dark shadow in this photo is clearly flying away from Babahl! Going in the opposite way of gravity, from the third floor of the Babahlese Embassy... ...up to the fifth floor of the Allebahstian Embassy...! How do you explain that!? Edgeworth: (Aha! I think I finally see how the gears behind this whole trick work (changed from [works] in the original release, correcting the typo)!) Agent Lang, the \"motion\" used behind this trick... I wonder if perhaps you have yet to envision how it works in your head? Lang: \"Motion\"? What motion? Edgeworth: This is the motion that was employed to smuggle Babahl's Primidux Statue! Rotary motion Leads to: \"I believe it was done via rotary motion.\" Swinging motion Edgeworth: A swinging motion was employed. Lang: Heh! You sure thought that one through, Mr. Prosecutor! Because if they used that... ...the statue would swing right into the building's wall! Edgeworth: Arngh! (H-He does have me there...) Lang: For shame! You should sign yourself up for grade school physics for not realizing that! Edgeworth: Nnrrrrgh... (I'm at a loss for words to that... I need to calm down and think through this once more. There is only one feasible motion that could've been used to send the statue up!) Leads back to: \"This is the motion that was employed to smuggle Babahl's Primidux Statue!\" Bungee action Edgeworth: A bit of bungee action was employed! Lang: ...Bungee action? Are you saying that the wire acted as a bungee cord, and then the statue was hauled up? Edgeworth: That's a simple way of putting it, but yes. Lang: Lang: Hah! Did you think about the weight of the statue at all? That thing is solid gold! Before that thing ever reached the office window, the wire would've snapped! Edgeworth: Nngh... Lang: But OK, let's consider your idea and say that the wire has the elasticity required. If you fired that kind of wire from a crossbow... ...the arrow could come sailing back at the person who shot it! Talk about dangerous! Edgeworth: Nnrrrrgh! (H-He's absolutely right...) Lang: I thought this sort of thing was common knowledge. I'm having a bit of hard time right now dealing with a jurisdiction thief... ...who lacks understanding of the most basic things like physics, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: (...Unfortunately for me, it appears that Agent Lang is correct. I need to calm down and think through this once more. There is only one feasible motion that could've been used to send the statue up!) Leads back to: \"This is the motion that was employed to smuggle Babahl's Primidux Statue!\" Edgeworth: I believe it was done via rotary motion. If the two statues were transported simultaneously... Lang: Lang: \"Simultaneously\"!? Get real! The statues would collide somewhere along the way! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Did I ever say that there was only one line of wire between the two offices? If you shot an arrow with the two ends of a wire tied to it, a circular belt can be formed. Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Don't object and call a success what is beyond reasonability.\" Taking into account the tension difference between the two wires... ...the top one would sag too much to the point where the statues would collide anyway! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang... As you know, the Primidux Statue is a one-of-a-kind national treasure. And the fact that Babahl's statue is a hollow replica of the real statue... ...it would naturally be lighter than the real one, meaning that my idea is very possible! Lang: Lang Zi says: HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWL! Edgeworth: Here is what I believe happened. Ms. Yew and her mystery co-conspirator set themselves up in the two different rooms. The co-conspirator bridged the rooms by shooting the 2 ends of the wire down on 1 arrow. Then the two of them covered the statues and proceeded to transport the statues. After the switch was completed, another arrow was fired... ...carrying the other end of the wire down to Babahl, where it was to be disposed of. And to do that, Ms. Yew hid it inside the grandfather clock. Q.E.D. Lang: ...Hah! Ha ha ha ha... Grr! Franziska: This proves it, right, Agent Lang!? That I'm not the killer! Lang: Not yet, sis. I still haven't had my dessert yet. Right, Mr. Prosecutor? Edgeworth: The proof is in the pudding, as it were? Lang: Pudding IS a nice dessert. So? Do you think you can do it? Can you prove that what you said is what happened? Because remember, if you can't... ...I'll be taking a certain someone back home with me as a souvenir! Edgeworth: I agree that as long as there is no proof, my hypothesis remains just that. However... ...what I have laid out is no mere hypothesis, for there is one more piece of evidence. Lang: One more? This should be interesting. You think you have a piece of evidence that will turn your hypothesis into fact...? Well then, let's see it, Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: (The thing that made it possible to create a circular belt out of a length of wire... I believe that it is right here in this very room! Now then, I believe this is what made the circular belt transportation method possible!) Present ceiling fan Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Hah! Looks like you dropped another bomb on us again!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The circular belt method was made possible thanks to this part of the room! Lang: Hah! Don't you mean \"impossible\", Mr. Prosecutor? Franziska: ...I have to say, I agree. Lang: Haaa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Even the one in the most precarious situation here agrees with me! Franziska: I am a Von Karma... ...and as I have a name to uphold... ...I refuse to accept anything that is less than perfect! Edgeworth: Nngh... (I guess I was mistaken... I need to take another good look at this room. There is something here that made it possible to create a circular belt out of wire!) Leads back to: \"Now then, I believe this is what made the circular belt transportation method possible!\" Lang: Hah! Looks like you dropped another bomb on us again! Franziska: The last piece to the trick... are two pulleys! Edgeworth: Precisely! The ceiling fans double as pulleys in this case! And thanks to the fact that there is one installed in each of the offices... ...the ceiling fans made for the perfect pulley set for the wire to run on! Lang: A...Aaa......... Arruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh! Edgeworth: (This must be it! This is how the smugglers bypassed the impenetrable security!) Lang: Ha... Ha ha ha ha ha! Grr... You really are something else, Mr. Prosecutor! I bet you've figured it all out already, haven't you!? You know who the bug hotshot that set up this real-life stage show is, don't you!? Edgeworth: (The person who set up this rather large and complex stage show... ...needs to be someone who had foreknowledge of... ...the existence of a ceiling fan in both the Allebahstian and Babahlese offices. And that the passionflowers' support stakes could be used as arrows...) The real mastermind behind this case......... Lang: Well!? Don't you dare make this wolf wait for his food! Franziska: Why are you so hesitant, Miles Edgeworth? If you can't say who it is, why don't you present something like you always do!? Edgeworth: (A single point of the finger here, and this case will explode into an international incident. However! It's already too late for me to stop the forward momentum! It appears that I have no choice now... but to rush in!) There is a piece of evidence that will point us to who the mysterious mastermind is! Present Passionflowers or Crossbow Arrows Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This smuggling could not have been possible without the use of the crossbow.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And this is it! Lang: Lang: Where's my real dessert!? How long do you intend to keep it from me!? That piece of evidence isn't satisfying at all! Edgeworth: Ack! (Then stop being so picky with your food! The person who concocted the trick used to smuggle the statues... I should already have the piece of evidence that shows who that is. I just have to present it. No matter what the cost!) Leads back to: \"There is a piece of evidence that will point us to who the mysterious mastermind is!\" Edgeworth: This smuggling could not have been possible without the use of the crossbow. Furthermore, the arrows that were shot by the crossbow... ...were plucked, as it were, from the flower box in this very room. They were planted so long ago that the passionflowers had the time to grow so big... ...that Ms. von Karma didn't even notice the arrows when she visited this room today! Lang: ............ Edgeworth: On top of all this, the fact that the culprit knew that both offices had ceiling fans... ...tells us that the person has very detailed information on the embassy's layout. So as you may have already guessed, the person I am accusing of hatching this plan... ...is the person who grew the flowers in the flower box with the utmost care. Thus, it can only be you! Quercus Alba! Franziska: ! Lang: ! Alba: .................. Franziska: Are you out of your mind, Miles Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: I'm certain of what I am saying, and I am sure that he is the culprit. Lang: Heh... Heh heh heh heh......... Haaa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Tell me, Mr. Prosecutor. What was the ambassador trying to accomplish by doing all that stuff you just outlined? Why in the world would he need to use a trick like that? Edgeworth: I understand your need to doubt me. However, there is one thing that stands out to me as very odd. Lang: Just one thing, huh? Edgeworth: (The one, single end result Ambassador Alba sought to obtain... If we were to examine the focus of this complex trick... ...I believe we will finally find the answer to everything!) Everything will become clear once we examine this piece of evidence! Present Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I would fully understand the reasoning had the situation been the reserve.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Lang: You want us to examine this? Edgeworth: Yes, for I believe that by examining it, we will finally have all of our answers. Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Items that become evidence should never have any part overlooked.\" All evidence related to this case are fine and don't need to be examined again! Edgeworth: Ack! (I-It would appear that I was mistaken... Agent Lang is correct... Most of the evidence has already undergone intense scrutiny. However, there is one piece that has only been partially checked... And that piece, which lies at the heart of the smuggling, is what I should present!) Leads back to: \"Everything will become clear once we examine this piece of evidence!\" Edgeworth: I would fully understand the reasoning had the situation been the reserve. However, to go through the trouble of swapping the real Primidux Statue for the fake... I sense a very shady reason for such a bizarre action! And who better to ask for that reason than King Primidux himself! Lang: I see... Ambassador, we'll be examining that statue now, with or without your permission! Alba: .............................. Examine head Leads to: \"Hmm... This guy kind of looks like the Steel Samurai, don't you think?\" Examine sword Edgeworth: With his sword drawn like that, there is an aura of valor and bravery around King Primidux. Kay: He looks so cool standing like that with the sword stuck in the ground in front of him. Maybe I should try and come up with some cool pose with a shuriken or something! Edgeworth: (I am seriously beginning to think that her real goal in life is to become a ninja.) Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. There isn't anything particularly odd about the sword, right? Edgeworth: No, not really. I suppose we should examine a different area of the statue now. Examine shield Edgeworth: A shield, huh... There doesn't seem to be anything unusual about it. Kay: I bet it's supposed to mean that the guy is protecting something! Edgeworth: I don't think it's supposed to have that deep of a meaning behind it. Kay: In that case, what are we wasting time with this for? Let's look at some other area! Examine handprint on bottom Edgeworth: These are Mr. Coachen's fingerprints. The fact that they're on here suggests that this statue once belong to Babahl. Kay: So it was smuggled from Babahl to Allebahst, huh? Edgeworth: (Why was there a need for them to smuggle it in?) Kay: Hmm... This guy kind of looks like the Steel Samurai, don't you think? Maybe it's because they look alike that he was picked to be the goodwill ambassador? Edgeworth: I suppose that's possible. ............Hm? Take a look at this area around the base of his neck. It looks like a gap. Kay: Hey! You're right! Maybe it's meant to be some kind of secret? Edgeworth: Perhaps it's possible to open the statue from this gap in its construction! Lang: What...!? Franziska: Hurry up and open it, Miles! Edgeworth: ...Alright, here goes. Kay: Wow! It really did open up! Hey, what's this thing that fell out? Edgeworth: Hm...? I believe a more thorough examination of it is required. Examine plate Leads to: \"What in the...!? Is this...!?\" Edgeworth: What in the...!? Is this...!? Lang: Hey! Is this what I think it is...!? Franziska: It's a plate... for making counterfeit bills! Edgeworth: Somehow... it appears that we've at long last arrived... ...at the exit to this complex labyrinth! We finally hold within our hands, one of the counterfeit money plates... ...and the reason why the replica was smuggled into Allebahst to begin with! Counterfeit Plate data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: The Primidux Statue can only be handled by the ambassador or the secretariat. And the replica is nothing more than a hollow shell covered in gold. These two circumstances make the statue the ideal object in which to hide contraband. After receiving the statue containing the counterfeit plate from Shih-na... ...the ambassador had the misfortune of accidentally running into DeMasque II. Surprised by the thief, the ambassador raised the replica statue at DeMasque II, and... Then, in order to frame the Steel Samurai of the murder... ...he covered the Samurai Sword in blood. Well, Ambassador Alba? Examine evidence Counterfeit Plate Front side Edgeworth: It's a counterfeit plate used to make counterfeit Zheng Fa bills. It's incredibly detailed, and even includes a phoenix taking off into the sky. With plates as finely crafted as these, it's no wonder the fakes are so hard to spot. Alba: .................. Lang: You're... the leader of the smuggling ring? My country is a mess... ...and it's all because of you!? Franziska: YOU'RE... the one who killed DeMasque II? Edgeworth: Answer us! Alba: ..................I never thought... I never thought... that you would figure things out to this level. Edgeworth: ...! Alba: However, there is one point I disagree with you on. The head of the smuggling ring was......... Mr. Coachen. Lang: Lang: Quite screwin' around! I have no sympathy for someone who would try to pass the guilt onto a dead man! If there is one thing I'm sure of, it's that you're the real ringleader, Quercus Alba! Alba: It's not good to speak with such subjectivity, you know, Agent Lang. Lang: \"Subjectivity\"? My conclusion is anything but, and is the result of logic and investigation! Alba: \"Logic and investigation\"? Only seconds ago, you were ready to arrest Ms. von Karma. I don't think we can give such flip-floppy logic any real weight, do you? Lang: Heh......... .........Heh heh heh... Haa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Alba: ? Edgeworth: ? Lang: It looks like you still don't get why I came back. Alba: Excuse me? Lang: You see, the reason I came back... ...is so that I could sink my fangs into your wrinkly, old neck! From the very beginning, my real target has been you! Alba: What? Franziska: Agent Lang! I demand an explanation! Lang: Sorry, sis. I didn't mean to put you through all that. I knew you were innocent from the very beginning. Franziska: You did...? Lang: I knew that this whole incident had been meticulously planned and prepared for. So naturally, the occupant of this room, Ambassador Alba, seemed the most suspicious. But without the ambassador's permission, we couldn't get in to take another look around! Edgeworth: Ah, so that's why you put on this big show to accuse Franziska of the murder! Using Franziska as the bait, you were able to gain us entry and investigative rights! Lang: Yeah, if I hadn't done that, I doubt the ambassador would've given the OK to poke around. Franziska: So that's what all this was about... Very well, I will forgive you. But in exchange for using me as bait... ...you will take some responsibility and help us find the truth! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, for giving me such a great opening... I thank you. Lang: ............You know, I just knew, Mr. Prosecutor... ...that somehow, if we were able to find some proof by investigating this room... ...that you would be able to figure out the real culprit with your special brand of logic. Edgeworth: Heh, the evidence detectives collect combined with the logic of a prosecutor... That's just as it should be in a \"prosecutor - detective team\", right? Lang: Tch. I don't know about all that! But one thing I do know is that I'm itching to see that old man get what's coming to him! Alba: Ho ho. You're quite scary when you want to be, aren't you? Lang: Hey, you were the one who was planning to use me to push all the guilt onto the sis. But unfortunately for you, you misjudged me! Alba: ..................Agent Lang, I wish for you to stop trying to intimidate me. What we need right now is evidence and proof. I wonder if you have what is necessary to prove that I am the head of the smuggling ring? Franziska: Franziska: Don't be such a sore loser! If you really are the head of the smuggling ring... ...then you should acknowledge your crimes with dignity! Alba: Dignity...? That is nothing more than a fool's insincere display of strength. If you really wish for me to acknowledge my crimes... ...then I would like to first see some of this thing you call \"evidence\". Franziska: Grr...! Alba: I tell you... I knew nothing. Really. I didn't even know that a counterfeit plate was hidden inside that statue. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You swapped a real statue that vested in your country the authority to rule for a sake. It doesn't make any sense that you didn't know anything! Alba: It doesn't make sense? Where doesn't it make sense? Can you prove that it doesn't make sense? Edgeworth: Gnnrk! Franziska: ...He's really got us. He's... turned the entire situation around against us. Alba: .................. Edgeworth: (The proof that Interpol has been after which points to this man as the ringleader... If we can somehow find that proof now, then we can see to it that justice is finally served! Is there nothing I can use to break this case wide open!?) ...! The trump card and the video tape... (With those two items... ...we might be able to finally bring this man down. But...! The card is evidence from a case that Mr. Faraday hid away in secret... ...and the tape was stolen by Detective Badd from the police. They're both illegal evidence! No matter what, a protector of the law can't be allowed to use such pieces of evidence!) Manfred: Needless to say... ...we Von Karmas are commanded to achieve nothing but victory! And by any means necessary! Badd: The only way to bring someone like that to justice was to do so outside of the courts... That's what we thought... at the time. Edgeworth: (I no longer follow the path of Manfred von Karma... ...and I won't follow the path of the Yatagarasu! This leaves me with what? What creed will I believe in? If I want to pursue the truth, then I will sully my hands in illegality... ...and if I want to pursue justice, then I will lose the truth! What is the \"law\", and what is \"justice\"? And which path is a \"prosecutor\" supposed to follow!? That choice... is one I must make by my own hand here and now!) Use the trump card Leads to: \"There is no limit to the law. Any limit that exists was set there by man.\" Don't use the trump card Edgeworth: (I am a prosecutor, and I can't allow myself to use evidence such as these!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! If you don't do something, Ambassador Alba is going to get away with it! Edgeworth: Nngh... I know, but... Franziska: Franziska: What are you holding back for? The only thing a Von Karma should pursue is the perfect proof. If you really do have what it takes to complete our argument... ...then there is absolutely no reason not to use it! Edgeworth: Nngh... Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says: \"The reason people judge people is because people are people.\" People weren't born to be chained to the law; laws were born to protect the people. You're the only one here right now who can put this guy out to pasture... ...and that is the only way a second or a third generation of Zheng Fa's people will be born. Can you really still hesitate knowing the fate of a nation rests in your hands? Edgeworth: I... Leads to: \"There is no limit to the law. Any limit that exists was set there by man.\" Edgeworth: (There is no limit to the law. Any limit that exists was set there by man. When a person goes beyond that limit, then the law, too, crosses into new territory! For what reason were laws invented? The answer to that is what I must now show!) Ambassador Alba. I wonder if you might recognize this. Alba: ...! Oh, I wonder what that card is? I've never seen that before in my life. Edgeworth: It's a directives card used by the leader of the ring to relay instructions to his subordinates. Alba: Oh? Is that what it is? Edgeworth: This card was sent to the real culprit behind the KG-8 Incident, ten years ago... A man by the name of Mr. Manny Coachen. Alba: .........Oh. So why do you have such a card in your possession? Edgeworth: Because it was hand-delivered to me... ...by a certain Great Thief... The Yatagarasu! Alba: The Yatagarasu gave that to you...? Don't talk nonsense, and let's be serious, Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof that the card contains directions from the ringleader? Edgeworth: I'll have you know that the card is not the only thing I was given! Alba: What!? Edgeworth: This contains security footage that was shot just before the start of the KG-8 Incident. Alba: ...The KG-8 Incident...? Edgeworth: The card and the video... These two pieces of evidence are what will seal your fate! Alba: ............Hoho, very interesting. I must admit I am very curious now. Very curious indeed in these \"case-deciding\" pieces of evidence you've presented. Edgeworth: (The prey the Yatagarasu has been chasing all this time... now stands before me. I can't allow this man, who has had free reign for ten long years, to simply walk away. Now is the time for me to bring to fruition the valiant spirit that was given to me!) March 15, 1:34 AM Theatrum Neutralis - Lobby Alba: So, what is this interesting thing that you wanted to show me? Edgeworth: (The trump card and the video tape... These two pieces of evidence together make for the ultimate hand! And this is where the real meaning behind Detective Badd's words will be realized!) Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: What you see here is security footage shot just before the KG-8 murder occurred. From this footage, we know that the card is a directives card from the smuggling ring. This is the section that proves that the card was used to relay an order! Present black card Edgeworth: Leads to: \"As you can see, Mr. Coachen is holding the card in his right hand.\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Take a look at this area. Alba: What about that area...? My eyes aren't what they used to be, so I can't see what you're pointing at too well. But from what I can see, it doesn't look like it's related to our conversation... Edgeworth: Nngh...! (It's unrelated...!? I need to remain calm and take another look at this footage. What is the vital clue that shows us that the card was used to relay an order!?) Leads back to: \"This is the section that proves that the card was used to relay an order!\" Edgeworth: As you can see, Mr. Coachen is holding the card in his right hand. Alba: I see. The killer is indeed holding a card with the exact same design on it. But the card and the one you have... Just because they look the same, doesn't mean that they are, does it now? Edgeworth: Ah, but there is a very easy way for me to prove that they are, in fact, one and the same. All we have to do is simply take a look at this! Examine bloodstain Leads to: \"This dark red blood... Yes, this is your proof.\" Examine raven Edgeworth: According to Detective Badd... ...Ambassador Alba's directive cards bear the mark of a three-legged raven... ...or in other words, a yatagarasu. I suppose this mark was the inspiration for their group's name, the Yatagarasu. Examine text Edgeworth: A section of the text has been obscured by blood, but it's clear the writing is Cohdopian. According to Detective Badd... ...\"Silence Cece Yew\"... ...is what is written here... ...along with the method to be used and where she lived. The evil intent displayed in this writing will not go unpunished! Edgeworth: This dark red blood... Yes, this is your proof. Proof that the orders on this card were played out in that terrible tragedy! The blood belonged to the victim of the KG-8 Incident. With a bit of DNA testing, we can very easily verify that as fact. Alba: .................. Edgeworth: If you have no objections... ...then I'd like for you to take a look at this next piece of footage! This car that passed by in front of the victim's apartment building... It's an official Cohdopian government car. Alba: Wh-What!? Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe! If you could please magnify the footage! This area of the footage directly links the smuggling ring with Cohdopia! Present front pocket Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The shape of this pocket...\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This section will make it all clear to us! Alba: .........You must be very tired, Mr. Edgeworth. If you continue presenting completely irrelevant evidence like this... ...I'm afraid your investigation may fall apart. Perhaps it is time for you to retire. Edgeworth: W-Wait! (Arngh! But I was so sure it was this area...! Alright, focus, Miles. The area I should be pointing out is definitely here!) Leads back to: \"This area of the footage directly links the smuggling ring with Cohdopia!\" Edgeworth: The shape of this pocket... and the directives card in it... It tells us that without a doubt, this person in this car is Mr. Coachen! Alba: ...Gnrk! Edgeworth: The license plate on the car was also captured by the security camera. And with it, we can easily find out who was sitting in this car on that day, ten years ago. Alba: Gnnrgh! Edgeworth: Which is why I can say with confidence that you were riding in this car on that day! Alba: Arnnnnnnnnnnnnngh! ..................Hah. Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah! You've done well, boy, to make it this far. However...! About your claim that I was riding in the car at the time... That's going to be mighty difficult to prove. Edgeworth: How so? Alba: The Principality of Cohdopia no longer exists. So naturally, all records from that time period also no longer exist. Edgeworth: (Nngh! That arrogance... What he really means is he's already erased all traces of them!) Alba: Are we finished here, boy? Edgeworth: (The only weapon I have left to me now... is this piece of footage! There must be something here that I can use against him!) Present medal Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Wh-What the...!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Franziska, what do you think about this area? Franziska: If you have to confer with someone, then it's obviously a useless piece of logic! Edgeworth: Gnnoooh! (Arngh! She's right. The only logic that can trap Ambassador Alba is a perfectly iron-clad one. There must be something here in this footage! There must be something that shows that Ambassador Alba was riding in the car that day! No matter how insignificant it may seem, a clue must be hiding here, and I must find it.) Leads back to: \"There must be something here that I can use against him!\" Edgeworth: Wh-What the...! Ambassador Alba! Alba: Yes, what is it? Edgeworth: You were once an army man in the service of Cohdopia. And it was you who made the many missions you participated in successes, correct? Alba: Hmph. Why the sudden back-handed praises, boy? Although, to be sure... ...the brilliant medals on my breast were awarded to me during the era of Cohdopia. But now, I am the only one who owns this particular medal. Edgeworth: In that case... the only person it could be who is sitting in this car is you! Alba: How do you figure that!? Edgeworth: By the medal captured here in this footage! It is clearly the same exact medal as the one on your chest! Alba: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (This is how it will be... But I won't look back. For this is the path that I have chosen!) Alba: Gnnrrr... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. You've moved me with your devotion to this case, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Why is he taking such an arrogant stance with me?) Alba: It's almost looking possible, isn't it? For the lot of you to have come this far... It looks like I just might lose our little game this time. Lang: You might lose the game \"this time\"...? You don't get another round, Mr. Ambassador! Alba: Is that a fact? ...Very well. I've decided to confess and admit my guilt. Franziska: You're... going to confess? Alba: And I will accept whatever punishment that may come as a result. Lang: What the...? Alba: Regarding the DeMasque II murder, I admit it... I did it out of self-defense. Edgeworth: You're claiming it was justified self-defense!? Alba: DeMasque II attacked me, and I felt that my life was in danger. If I hadn't done what I did, I might be the one you found dead instead of him. Lang: Haa ha ha ha ha ha ha! What a pathetic performance! Alba: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! I'm not giving you one! Kay: Wow, you two really know how to laugh at inappropriate times! Edgeworth: If you wish to claim it was justified self-defense, then we will need some evidence. Alba: It's always the evidence with you, isn't it? But if that's what you require, I'll provide it. That man left a mark on me when he attacked! Edgeworth: What!? Alba: I don't particularly want to show it off, but this is proof that it was in self-defense. I'm an old man, and sometimes I don't pay enough attention when I should... Franziska: But DeMasque II didn't have a single weapon on his body! Alba: Hold on. It's nothing to get worked up over, because... I hid the weapon. Franziska: You hid it? Alba: I'm sorry, but as you know, a murder is a murder, even if it's in self-defense. And I couldn't let it become public, seeing as how I AM an ambassador... This is the weapon you seek, my special bonsai trimming shears. Kay: Oongh... It's covered in blood. Alba: He was trembling quite badly during our struggle... ...but that's when he grabbed the shears that were sitting in my office and attacked. So you see, it was an act of self-defense. Kay: Is he right, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Since he has both a wound and the weapon that caused it, it's enough to declare it so. Amb. Alba's Wound data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: N-No way...! Alba: Oh, which reminds me. I guess there is still one more accusation I need to resolve. Smuggling and counterfeiting. Unfortunately, all of that is my secretary's doing. I had no knowledge it was going on. Lang: Lang: Stop spewing nonsense! You're trying to throw my investigation under the bus in your desperation. If you want to get real honest... ...everything in this case can be connected to you! Franziska: The murder of DeMasque II was done in self-defense...!? In my trials, no man escapes his crime alive! Alba: Perhaps so, if you were my opponent in court. However, there is one very important fact that I think you may have forgotten. Edgeworth: And what is that...? .................. A.........Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Lang: Arngh! That's what you mean! Extraterritoriality...! Alba: That's right. This embassy sits on what is effectively Allebahstian soil. So any trial that is to be held will be held in Allebahst. Therefore, the crime I just admitted to will never be tried in your courts. Edgeworth: Agent Lang! What is Interpol's stance on this!? Lang: Agents investigate. That's our job. The judgment of people who have confessed to their crime... that's the court's job. Edgeworth: Gnnrk! Alba: And I've already confessed to all of my crimes, Agent Lang. Furthermore, by the very nature of my position, I have full extraterritorial rights. These rights are effective, even on your country's soil. Therefore... ...no matter where a crime may take place, I will never stand trial in one of your courts! Lang: That arrogance... and your expression... That's nothing like the face of someone who is ready to accept the consequences. Don't tell me you have your own country's judicial system eating right out of your hands! Alba: These \"crimes\" you all speak so seriously of... To me, this has all been nothing more than a game. You may chase me out of this embassy with your accusations... ...but it's no big deal. Allebahst has numerous other embassies in other countries around the world. All you would accomplish is you would change the backdrop of our little game! Edgeworth: (These two layers of protection that extraterritoriality provides him... This is why he is one of those who cannot be brought to court!) Alba: You see now, don't you? I live in a whole different world than you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go and fetch your eviction papers. Edgeworth: Arngh! Is there nothing we can do!? To be continued. March 15, 2:11 AM Theatrum Neutralis - Lobby Gumshoe: I can't believe it, sir! Extraterritoriality... Edgeworth: Yes... and there is nothing we can really do about that. In the end, we didn't have enough authority to bring him to justice. Kay: I can't believe that even though we know he's the boss, we can't lay a finger on him! Edgeworth: I know... Lang: .................. Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, sorry to skip out on you, but I've got some business to take care of. Kay: If we can't even give an evil guy like him a slap on the wrist... ...then what the heck were laws created for!? What good are they!? If the law can't help us... ...then I'll go as the Yatagarasu, and take care of this myself! Edgeworth: Don't you dare! Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ...Sorry, that was a bit too harsh. Gumshoe: I know how you feel, sir. We're trying to take on an ambassador, after all. And he did tell us earlier to get out of the theater. This is kinda their country, I guess... ...but I feel like I've been slapped across the face for just doing my job. Edgeworth: (What... am I going to do? Should I retreat for now, and formulate a better plan of attack...?) ???: Kay: Come on, everyone! We can't give up yet! Edgeworth: Kay...? Kay: I want you to think about something for a sec! We've never let up for even a second, and as long as we don't stop investigating... ...we might find the \"rotten\" treasure hidden here! Gumshoe: Sh-She's right! Kay: Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ...You're right, Kay. Very well. Let us re-open the investigation and see what we find. Come on, Kay! Kay: Right behind you! Gumshoe: OK! Then I'll go check out Babahl a bit more, sir! Franziska: And I have something that I need to investigate further in Allebahst. Edgeworth: (Now then... ...before I gather any more information, I should do a bit of housekeeping.) Passionflowers data erased from my Organizer. Begin Investigation Theatrum Neutralis - Lobby Edgeworth: Ambassador Alba seemed agitated (Agitated Alba - I sense that there is something he doesn't want us to investigate.) over something. Kay: I wonder why? Edgeworth: There are two special circumstances that surround the ambassador. First, the embassy itself has extraterritorial rights. If something happens on Allebahstian soil... ...we are unable to legally prosecute him. Kay: Cool! It sounds like embassies are the perfect place to steal whatever you want! Edgeworth: ...And murder DeMasque II, run a smuggling operation, and make counterfeit bills apparently. Kay: But I thought all the counterfeiting was done by Mr. Coachen in Babahl? Edgeworth: Yes, he apparently used the embassy's coupon printing press (Coachen's counterfeiting op. - Used Babahlese Embassy's printing press and Babahlese ink to make counterfeit bills.) to do it. But it's the same story over there anyway. Babahl also has extraterritorial rights. Which brings me to my next point: the ambassador's extraterritorial rights. Those rights are effective even in our own country. Kay: Really? Edgeworth: No matter what happens, he can never be tried in our courts. He retains some very special rights, indeed. Basically, no matter what wrongs he may commit, we can't bring him to trial here. Kay: So I guess we really don't stand a chance, do we? Edgeworth: Hmm... We might stand a chance if we can somehow nullify either one of his special rights. Talk Guard by left door Guard: On the orders of Ambassador Alba, no one is allowed into Allebahst. Edgeworth: Nngh! But I thought a lady with a whip passed through here not too long ago. Guard: She is from Interpol, and had the proper paperwork... ...so, while I was reluctant, I had to let her in. Edgeworth: (Heh... Sounds like Franziska alright.) Guard: Besides... if I didn't... that whip of hers... Edgeworth: (.........Yup, definitely Franziska...) Guard by right door Guard: Hello! And welcome to the Embassy of Babahl! Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but I don't really need to enter your country at this time. Guard: Right now, for a limited time here at the Babahlese Embassy... ...we're offering the very special \"Experience the Terrifying Fire's Ashes Tour!\" So, how about it? Shall I sign you up? Edgeworth: ...We're fine, thanks. (We have an investigation to run.) Examine Black backdrop Edgeworth: It's a backdrop they used in the Steel Samurai stage show today. Kay: I loved the climax of that show! \"Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!\" That was the first time I'd seen that special move! But, well, the Jammin' Ninja stage show's climax was much better, of course. Edgeworth: ...Oh, is that a fact? Kay: That scene where he sang for Princess Misola and gave her those hair sticks? I could totally feel the love there in my heart! Edgeworth: (Hmm... Perhaps the Jammin' Ninja is just more popular with female audiences...?) Flowers on left side Edgeworth: Flowers were sent by a variety of people and businesses to celebrate the goodwill event. Even the Steel Samurai received some flowers from the ambassadors. Kay: There are so many bouquets here, it's like a wedding ceremony! Edgeworth: I believe the flowers for those are for a slightly different reason... Kay: What do you mean!? This event was supposed to be like a wedding between Allebahst and Babahl, right? Edgeworth: ...Actually, I believe they're more in a state of divorce. Kay: OK, then! This event was supposed to be their remarriage ceremony! Edgeworth: Hmm... I suppose you could call it that. Photo Edgeworth: This was taken just before the two ambassadors gave their bouquets to the Steel Samurai. (Wait, is it just my imagination... ...or is there something in this picture that I've seen before...? I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Examine Quercus Alba's face Kay: I can't believe he was pretending to be a harmless old grandpa. Talk about deceptive! Edgeworth: I don't suppose anyone expected him to change that drastically... Kay: I bet he's thinking of something evil behind that cheery smile! Edgeworth: Kay, please try to remain calm and focused on the here and now. Kay: Yeah, you're right. Sorry I got all worked up there. Well, the only way we're going to be able to steal the truth is if we keep on investigating! Quercus Alba's bouquet Edgeworth: It appears to be a bouquet of Persian cyclamens and roses. Kay: Wow! You even know the exact species!? I never would've figured you for an expert on flowers! Edgeworth: Nnnnngh... (It's all because of those flowers that old lady sends me every month... Just look at me; I sound like some sort of botanist!) Kay: So, umm, what exactly is this yellow flower here? Edgeworth: Hmm... That one... I'm not sure. Kay: What!? You don't know!? Edgeworth: (As far as I can recall, I've never seen a flower like this before. But I feel as though I've seen this shape somewhere before...) Steel Samurai Edgeworth: There's that troublemaker, standing there smack in the center making two peace signs. Kay: Wow, the Steel Samurai stands out even more than the two ambassadors in this picture! Oh, hey! The person playing the Steel Samurai is one of your friends, right? Edgeworth: ..................No, I have no idea who he is. Kay: Wait! But you just said \"he\"! You knew which gender he was, so you MUST know him, right!? Edgeworth: I beg that you please refrain from talking about that person with me ever again. Colias Palaeno's face Kay: Mr. Palaeno has a really great smile, don't you think!? I bet he was really happy that they were going to become Cohdopia again! Edgeworth: Perhaps... But instead, he became the greatest victim in today's case. An ambassador like him who is always thinking of his country is really to be admired. Kay: Yeah. Although this happened, I hope they'll be able to reunite the country someday. Edgeworth: I hope so as well, but for that to happen, we need to solve this case first. We need to see to it that those who would harm the new Cohdopia are locked away. Kay: And we will! Colias Palaeno's bouquet Edgeworth: Hmm... It seems that lilies are at the center of this bouquet, with an accent of chamomile. Kay: Wow... I can totally smell the wonderful fragrance! Edgeworth: Kay... this is just a picture. Kay: Argh! Look, I know that! But it's nice to imagine things once in a while, ya know? Where's your sense of empathy!? Edgeworth: If you can smell the fragrance of flowers from a photo, that's more like a \"hallucination\". Kay: ! Y-You don't have to be mean about it... Edgeworth: Hmph... Let's just drop this before it's in full bloom. Deduce Quercus Alba's bouquet (after examining Quercus Alba's bouquet) Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Present Allebahstian Knife Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Babahl's national symbol is the butterfly, and Allebahst's is the flower...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Could this piece of evidence be related to this photo somehow? Kay: Huh? Well... Nope! I don't think it's related at all! Edgeworth: (Even though I know she's right, she could have at least tried to humor me a little.) Leads back to examination of photo Edgeworth: Babahl's national symbol is the butterfly, and Allebahst's is the flower... It would appear that someone is employing the old \"hide a tree in a forest\" trick. Kay: What are you mumbling to yourself about...? Wait, what? The handle on this knife... Aaaaaah! Edgeworth: Yes, it's the handle that was supposed to be on the blade that killed Mr. Coachen. The weapon that killed him was carried through the Theatrum Neutralis... ...in the very bouquet Ambassador Alba was carrying! Commemorative Photo data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Hm? The flower motif... It looks like one of the flower petals is missing. Kay: Ooh! And take a look at the weapon itself! It's missing the exact same petal! Edgeworth: Then the knife in this photo is most definitely the same as this murder weapon. Allebahstian Knife data updated in my Organizer. Photo (after correctly deducing Quercus Alba's bouquet) Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Quercus Alba's bouquet Edgeworth: It appears to be a bouquet of Persian cyclamens and roses. Kay: Wow! You even know the exact species!? I never would've figured you for an expert on flowers! Edgeworth: Nnnnngh... (It's all because of those flowers that old lady sends me every month... Just look at me; I sound like some sort of botanist!) Window by right door Edgeworth: You can see the Babahlese Embassy, which is undergoing major renovations. From room expansions to garden upkeep, it looks like a lot of construction is going on. Kay: Mr. Palaeno said that all this work is really hard on him. He said that since Mr. Coachen passed away, that maybe I could work part-time for him. Edgeworth: (She got really chummy with that ambassador...) Kay: What can I say? I just have a good nose for money! Logic Connect \"Renovations\" and \"Coachen's counterfeiting op.\" Edgeworth: We know that the counterfeit bills were printed using the embassy's press... ...but the necessary materials, such as the Babahlese ink and paper... ...must have been hidden in a secure location. But what do you think would've happened if the renovation had begun? Kay: Well, he probably had to find a better hiding place, or get rid of it all. Edgeworth: Right, so we can assume that the renovation was the cause of the plate and bills disposal. And the reason Mr. Coachen was killed as the \"ringleader\" of the smuggling operation. ...Based on what we know, who do you think was the one with the most to gain? Colias Palaeno Edgeworth: The answer is Ambassador Palaeno. Kay: Y-You really think so!? But he was the one who had his embassy's offices burned down... ...and he lost his secretary. Do you really think he profited from any of that? Edgeworth: Hmm... Now that you mention it, perhaps not... (She's right... Ambassador Palaeno has gained absolutely nothing from the events of tonight. With that being the case, there really is only one man who gained from everything!) Leads back to: \"...Based on what we know, who do you think was the one with the most to gain?\" Manny Coachen Edgeworth: The answer is Mr. Coachen himself. Kay: Umm... He was the smuggling ring's boss, right? So maybe he had a lot to gain because of all the money...? But in the end, he was killed... It's kind of sad, really. Edgeworth: Hmm... I suppose there is some truth in that. (No matter how much he may have profited in life, he really didn't gain much in his death. With that being the case, there really is only one man who gained from everything!) Leads back to: \"...Based on what we know, who do you think was the one with the most to gain?\" Quercus Alba Leads to: \"It's the one person who has been erasing all evidence of the smuggling operation...\" Edgeworth: It's the one person who has been erasing all evidence of the smuggling operation... ...from both embassies, the co-conspirator who is mopping up, Ambassador Alba. Ambassador Alba had a very strong motive to kill Manny Coachen (Motive to kill Coachen - Alba could conveniently place all of the guilt for the smuggling onto Coachen.)! Connect \"Agitated Alba\" and \"Motive to kill Coachen\" Edgeworth: The cause of Ambassador Alba's agitation, the \"rotten\" treasure we may find... ...and the motive for killing Mr. Coachen... Ms. Yew said it herself that she didn't kill anyone tonight. If we were to take her words at face value... ...then the reason for the ambassador's nervousness can only be one thing. He didn't want us to discover the real circumstances under which Mr. Coachen was killed. Kay: Then you mean, Ambassador Alba is the real killer? But I thought the two of them were friends? Edgeworth: Maybe they were, but what if Mr. Coachen was the one who first betrayed their friendship? Kay: Oh, I get it! Wasn't Mr. Coachen pushing really hard for Mr. Palaeno... ...to be ambassador after the reunification? Edgeworth: Yes, and that was the real reason why he wanted to steal Allebahst's Primidux Statue. Kay: So Mr. Coachen hired DeMasque II to go steal it for him... ...but when Ambassador Alba found out what he was up to, he killed Mr. Coachen? Edgeworth: It is definitely a possibility at this point. Kay: Those two really were thinking of no one but themselves. But the question now is \"how did he do it?\" Ambassador Alba was in Allebahst... ...but Mr. Coachen's body was discovered in Babahl, right? Edgeworth: Right. And that is what we must solve next. Partner Talk The investigation Kay: We've come too far to give up! We must expose Ambassador Alba's misdeeds, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes, of course. Kay: And we've gotta find a way to steal the truth and get it out there... for my father's sake! Edgeworth: ...Yes, and we will. (The reason for Ambassador Alba's nervousness must still be here somewhere. Furthermore, I need to pin down exactly what happened in here... I'll start by thoroughly examining this room for any information I can find.) Agitated Alba? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! If you don't pay attention, Ambassador Alba is gonna get away! Edgeworth: Y-Yes, I know. Kay: Now hurry up and do that *schwing!* thing you always do! Edgeworth: I have no idea what you are talking about... Kay: What!? You don't!? Oh, come on, you know what I'm talking about! That thing you do! Edgeworth: ...Are you talking about \"Logic\"...? Kay: Yes! That's it! So hurry up and let's *schwing!* already! Edgeworth: A-Alright, alright... (To be honest, it's been a bit hard to connect everything up until now by just looking. However, I should be able to piece things together if I take another look at my leads. Perhaps now is the time to use logic and reason my way to the truth!) Present Video Tape Kay: Uncle Badd entrusted you with this piece of evidence, Mr. Edgeworth. I think he believes that you're the one who will finally bring the truth to light. Edgeworth: ......... Kay: And I believe in you, too, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Kay... After connecting all possible Logic and correctly deducing Quercus Alba's bouquet in photo: Edgeworth: I believe we now understand... ...why Ambassador Alba was so nervous and agitated. It must have something to do with where Mr. Coachen was killed. A place where the Allebahstian ambassador was likely to meet the Babahlese Mr. Coachen. The place where Ambassador Alba happened to have committed the murder is...? Present Theatrum Neutralis Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The only place that makes sense is here, at the Theatrum Neutralis.\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This area is rather suspicious, don't you think? Kay: You really think so? Because I don't see anything odd about it at all! Edgeworth: Nngh... (I guess it's not related after all...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! If you keep doing that, Ambassador Alba is going to get away! Come on! Let's see if we can't get a hold of that treasure known as the truth! Edgeworth: Agreed. Let's see what we can find. Leads back to: \"The place where Ambassador Alba happened to have committed the murder is...?\" Edgeworth: The only place that makes sense is here, at the Theatrum Neutralis. Kay: What? Here? Edgeworth: The goodwill event was being held here today, correct? So the only place that the both of them would have been in is here. Kay: But if that's the case, then everything changes. The theater isn't actually Allebahstian land... ...so that wipes out one of those extraterritorial rights he has! Edgeworth: It makes logical sense, in which case, it is a reason for us to investigate further. Kay: So what should we check out? Edgeworth: Let's see... I believe we should check the immigration records for both Allebahst and Babahl posthaste! Babahl's records should be easy to obtain, however, the problem will be Allebahst. I wonder if they would allow us to see their records, despite the order to vacate... Franziska: Franziska: I'm already one step ahead of you, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Franziska. Franziska: I have here, the security footage from both Allebahst and Babahl. You would do well to take a look at its contents. Security Footage data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: You move fast. Franziska: A Von Karma strives to be perfect in every way! It's not in my nature to keep on retreating like this. I took the liberty of looking over the Babahl investigation reports as well. From now on, you will make no excuse to back down or say that we can't solve this case! Edgeworth: Nngh... I'm sorry about earlier. Franziska: We won't be beaten. Because my cute little subordinate is going to try his very best, isn't he? Edgeworth: (Hasn't she patronized me enough already for a lifetime?) So this video contains footage from Allebahst's immigration screening area? Kay: I really hope there's something in here that we can use! Edgeworth: Which minute's footage should I examine? 5:21 PM Examine timestamp Edgeworth: 5:21 PM... Kay: That's just after the end of the Steel Samurai stage show. Edgeworth: Correct. Kay: We were still inside the theater itself at around this time. All because Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't get out of his seat. Edgeworth: Hmph. I wanted to show the actors my appreciation for a bit and soak in the atmosphere. Kay: Yeah, with your eyes closed and a complete lack of motion except for some breathing. Examine officer Franziska: This man is the immigration officer who was on duty. Kay: He's making a really scary face... even though there's no one around to see it. Franziska: I wonder if he's just the grumpy sort? Although, that wouldn't do much for tourism. Kay: Hey! He smiled a little just now! Franziska: I wonder if he recalled something funny? Kay: Well, even if he did, he still has that hard glare in his eyes. Edgeworth: It would appear that he was born with stern-looking eyes. Franziska: Rather fitting for someone in the security business, I'd say. Examine posters Kay: Ooh, I don't remember all these posters! I wonder what they're of? Edgeworth: Hmm, I do remember a bunch of these hanging in that hallway. Franziska: I believe they were all related to tourism and sightseeing. Edgeworth: In Allebahst? Impossible! If it were Babahl, I could believe that, however... Franziska: No, no. They were posters promoting tourist traps in this country! And I believe they were mostly of Gatewater Land. Edgeworth: I see. So they were targeted at the embassy's staff... Examine door Edgeworth: It's the door leading into the Theatrum Neutralis. Kay: I tried so hard to get through this door, you know, but I just couldn't get in. But it felt soooo great when I finally was allowed to go through there! You know what I really wanted to do, though? I wanted to try sneaking my way in! Edgeworth: (*sigh* At least nothing seems out of the ordinary with the door.) 5:22 PM Examine timestamp Edgeworth: 5:22 PM. At around this time, the Steel Samurai stage show had come to an end... ...and Ambassador Alba was making his way back to his office. Kay: And then later, he shook hands with the Steel Samurai in his office... ...and then, he was going to give a speech in the rose garden. Being an ambassador sounds like a busy, busy job! It's like someone is always stealing your time away! Edgeworth: Yes, I'd imagine it's something like that. (But despite how busy he was, he still managed to find the time to kill Mr. Coachen... ...and move his body somehow from the Theatrum Neutralis.) Examine officer Franziska: This man is the immigration officer who was on duty. Kay: He's making the exact same scary face that he was making a minute ago! Wait. Is it just me, or is he blushing? Franziska: It appears that he gets flustered around the ambassador. Kay: I guess the ambassador's well-respected inside Allebahst, too. Edgeworth: You could say that. The guard doesn't appear to be capable of looking at the ambassador. Examine posters Franziska: Those are posters of this country's tourist spots, though most are of Gatewater Land. Kay: I wonder if Allebahstians in general like theme parks at all? Franziska: The guard who stopped you has been to Gatewater Land a number of times, apparently. Kay: I guess they don't have theme parks in Allebahst, huh? Examine Quercus Alba Edgeworth: I can't believe how completely fooled I was by the way he carried himself. Franziska: He had me fooled, too... According to the files I had sent for earlier, Ambassador Alba... ...was a Cohdopian hero. He saved the royal family from danger countless times. So what bothers me is why would a man like that create a smuggling ring...? Even with all the authority I have, I still haven't been able to figure out why. Edgeworth: (It sounds like the ambassador was a hero who was corrupted by evil. But no matter what happened in the past, we can't let the man he is now escape justice!) Examine door Edgeworth: It's the door leading into the Theatrum Neutralis. Kay: The more the guy tried to keep me out, the more I wanted to get in! It's human nature! But I guess I can't complain too much. I did get let inside in the end. Edgeworth: (*sigh* At least nothing seems out of the ordinary with the door.) 5:23 PM Examine cart Leads to: \"Doesn't something about this lump's shape strike you as odd?\" Examine timestamp Edgeworth: 5:23 PM... This is just after the end of the Steel Samurai stage show... ...and after I had been given that autograph. Kay: You totally had stars in your eyes at that time, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: I-I most certainly did not! Franziska: You had stars in your eyes because of an autograph you received from that man...? Miles Edgeworth... You've just lost any respect I had left for you. Edgeworth: (I believe it's time to change the subject.) Examine officer Edgeworth: It appears that he is inspecting the person coming into the country. Kay: Are you kidding!? It's more like he's NOT checking the Steel Samurai! Hmph! And then they gave me such a hard time! Edgeworth: Hmm... There ARE certain risks involved when you give some people preferential treatment. Examine posters Edgeworth: There certainly is a variety of posters on this wall. Kay: It's kinda hard to see what's written on them, so they just look festive, you know? Franziska: Those are all tourism posters for this country, although most are of Gatewater Land. Kay: I wonder if any Allebahstians actually go to Gatewater Land for fun? It's just really hard to imagine them hanging out there. Edgeworth: True, they do seem to be a nation of extremely serious people... Examine Steel Samurai Edgeworth: On the outside, he may look like the Steel Samurai, but on the inside, it's just Larry. Franziska: Other than the fact that it's that good-for-nothing, nothing else seems out of order. Edgeworth: Wait. You know as well as I that anything can happen if he's involved. Franziska: You're not suggesting that someone else could be under that mask, are you? Edgeworth: No, I don't think that. Just before he entered here, he gave me an autograph, so I'm certain it's Larry under there. Examine door Edgeworth: It's the door connecting that hallway and this theater. Nothing appears to be out of the ordinary. Franziska: Indeed. Edgeworth: Doesn't something about this lump's shape strike you as odd? Kay: Huh? Isn't it supposed to be this shape? Edgeworth: No, there is clearly something odd about the bulge. If only we had the pushcart itself, we could compare and confirm my hunch... Pushcart data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Next, let us check the footage from Babahl's security camera. Kay: I hope it shows us something good. ...Phooey. There wasn't a single sign of a suspicious person or anything. Edgeworth: That, right there, is the contradiction. Kay: Huh? Did I miss something? Edgeworth: You didn't miss anything... because there was nothing to miss. However, what IS missing is the image of Mr. Coachen entering his own country. Kay: But wasn't his body found in Babahl? Edgeworth: It would appear that the true face of our final puzzle has finally revealed itself. Investigation Complete Edgeworth: ! Ambassador Alba...! Alba: I thought I had asked for you and your group to vacate the premises, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Actually, I thought I should let you know that this theater sits on my country's soil. Alba: You've had your fun, and I've enjoyed our little game. I dare say that you've even achieved a new high score. However, once you've recorded a score, that same game can never be replayed again. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Your game is done, and it's game over. Edgeworth: No...! Franziska: Franziska: Where do you think you're going at this time of night? Alba: After admitting to my crime, I was overcome with regret. So I am heading to the airport now to return home. Edgeworth: I'm afraid I can't let you do that. There are still too many issues we need to discuss with you. Alba: You can't stop me, Mr. Edgeworth, and you know it. Edgeworth: Arngh...! ???: Palaeno: Please, may I have a little bit of your time, Ambassador Alba? Alba: Ambassador Palaeno...! Palaeno: Even just a teeny-tiny bit is fine with me. The already strained relationship between our countries is in a precarious situation, you know. Alba: .........Very well. If you insist. I will play just one more round with them, and see what they want. .........Not that they'll get any farther. Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno... Palaeno: Mr. Edgeworth... All I wish for is the normalization of relationships between our two countries. But there is one person standing in the way of that dream. I... I believe in you. You'll do what's right. Edgeworth: ...Thank you for your vote of confidence. Alba: Now then, what was it you wanted to ask me about? I do have a flight to catch, after all. So I'm afraid I'm going to have to limit you to just one question. Edgeworth: That's more than enough, because I only have one question anyway. I want to hear your alibi, about how you couldn't have killed Mr. Manny Coachen! Alba: Ho! I see... You seem to have a good hand this time around. This should be fun. Edgeworth: (This really is the very last chance we have to bring him down. I won't allow even an atom-sized contradiction to slip by!) Testimony -- Ambassador Alba's Alibi -- Alba: Frankly, I still don't understand why I am being placed under suspicion here. Under your hypothetical scenario, Mr. Coachen and I were fellow smugglers. But to get to the point, I was in Allebahst the whole time. So, it's simply not possible for me to have killed him in Babahl. That is my alibi. Edgeworth: ...So that is your alibi? Alba: That is correct. It's simply not possible for me to have committed a crime in Babahl. Now that we cleared that up, I'd appreciate it if you would move out of my way. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I said, \"Hold it!\" Alba: What is it this time? I thought I told you I'd only allow one question. Edgeworth: Hmph... You did, but you still have yet to really answer my one question. Alba: What...? Edgeworth: Until you tell us the truth... I will refuse to budge an inch from where I'm standing! Alba: Hmph... Very well. I'll play with you just a little longer. Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! As my subordinate, and representative of this country's prosecutors... ...you are forbidden to lose! Edgeworth: Of course. That is something I've understood from the start. Kay: ...That guy's the one who... ordered my father killed, isn't he? Edgeworth: ...Yes, I believe so. Kay: The goal of the first Yatagarasu was the capture of the smuggling ring's leader. My father and Uncle Badd... Their legacy will live on... through me! So that's why we've just got to catch him, OK!? Edgeworth: We will. I promise. Now, Ambassador Alba, let's have at the truth now, shall we!? Alba: Heh heh heh... No matter how many times you ask, my answer remains the same. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Being the leader of a smuggling ring while taking on the duties of ambassadorship... Don't you think that the combination is more than enough reason for suspicion? Then there is the matter of the crossbow arrows and the Primidux Statues... Alba: Alba: All of that is nothing more than your flights of fancy. Edgeworth: What do you mean by that!? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It's not a hypothesis! Earlier, we proved it to be what happened. Alba: Ha ha ha... Well, let's leave that to one side for now. Because it doesn't change the fact that I have no motive. Edgeworth: Oh? So you really had no reason to kill Mr. Coachen? Alba: If you want to suppose I had one, then why not. I'll indulge you. After all, this is nothing more than a silly game to me. Edgeworth: Even if that's how you see things, I'd appreciate it if you would take me seriously. Alba: Gwah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haaa! Ahem, I'm sorry. I suppose you are in a bit of a pickle. Very well. A game is no fun if the playing field isn't level. Therefore, I formally claim that I had no motive to kill. Now, let's see you disprove it. Edgeworth: (How can he stand there looking proud when he knows he killed another human being? Well, I'm not going to stand by and just watch him get away with his crimes!) Adds statement \"In that case, what motive would I have had to kill my co-conspirator?\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you serious that just because you were partners, that you had no motive to kill? Alba: I'm only following your hypothetical scenario to its logical conclusion. Haaa ha ha ha ha! Kay: Looks like he's not going to admit it himself that he was in league with Mr. Coachen. Edgeworth: I suppose not. But I do know his relation to the smuggling ring, and to Mr. Coachen. Kay: You mean, he's the ringleader, and that Mr. Coachen was his subordinate, right? Edgeworth: Correct, but I know more than just that. Ms. von Karma, I'm sure you remember the safe in Mr. Coachen's office, correct? Franziska: Yes... The safe had two compartments to it, didn't it? Edgeworth: Yes, and why do you think those stolen goods were being stored in Mr. Coachen's office? Could it be because he was trying to cheat Ambassador Alba behind his back? Franziska: So Mr. Coachen didn't turn the goods over, but decided instead to keep them for himself? I suppose that's possible. Edgeworth: Hmm, it seems to me that both men were only concerned with their own wealth and wellbeing. Kay: Then that means that maybe they didn't have a trusting relationship after all. Edgeworth: What Ambassador Alba had to gain... I believe that is his motive for killing Mr. Coachen! Alba: ...What are you people whispering about amongst yourselves over there? Edgeworth: Ah, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. Now then, let's continue with your testimony! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And what exactly did you do while you were in Allebahst? Alba: I had a meeting with the Steel Samurai, and then I arranged a few files. Around that time, that thief who was sneaking in took me by surprise. Franziska: Franziska: Are you saying that it was DeMasque II that made the first move!? Alba: Yes, and it was after I was attacked that I hit him on the head with the Primidux Statue. Unfortunately, he died from the blow, but it was an act of justified self-defense. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Calling it that doesn't cover up what you really did! Alba: Ha ha ha ha ha. Cover up? No, my boy, I'm not covering up anything; I'm telling the truth! Franziska: You weren't planning to admit to it, which is why you tried to frame the Steel Samurai. If you weren't an ambassador, I'd be letting my whip fly loose on you right now...! Alba: I am terribly sorry that I didn't clean up the body better, but I am a busy man. I had a speech to give in the rose garden after that, you know. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Yet despite that, you still had time to kill Mr. Coachen, didn't you? Alba: Alba: Heh heh heh... Man is evil, and I'm sure you are familiar with the facts, but... ...Mr. Coachen was killed in Babahl while I was all the way in Allebahst. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You insist that it's not possible for you to have killed Mr. Coachen in Babahl... ...and you are correct. Alba: Oh? I thought you would put up a bit more of a fight, but if you must concede to me... Edgeworth: The only thing I am conceding is that it's not possible for you to kill him in Babahl. I am NOT conceding that your alibi is the truth! Alba: Oh... I see. However, no matter how you try, know that you can't crush my alibi. Edgeworth: ...Hmph. You would be wise not to underestimate a prosecutor of this country. Alba: ...Heh, we'll see about that. Edgeworth: So Mr. Coachen was a \"friend\" of Ambassador Alba... Kay: If that's true, then why did the ambassador kill him? It's not like in the case of my father where he ordered someone to do it... Franziska: The problem we have here is we don't know what their exact relationship was. Edgeworth: Indeed. If they had complete trust in each other, then there is no motive for murder. (However, both men were very selfish, and I believe that is from where his motive arose.)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Kay Faraday\nDescription: Young girl purporting to be the 2nd Yatagarasu.

A country torn in two. One to the west... ...and one to the east. When those which were split are made whole again... ...the truth will reveal itself. I-It's the Yatagarasu! The Yatagarasu's here! Edgeworth: You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! Edgeworth: (It's so nice, almost dreamlike, to finally have the chance to relax and sip some tea. Especially after what a whirlwind the past few days have been.) On my return flight, I was dragged into a case involving an Interpol agent's murder. The next day, I investigated a kidnapping and a murder at the Gatewater Land theme park. And later that night, a detective's dead body welcomed me back to my office... ...along with a thief who was out to pilfer files related to a case from 10 years ago. (How did I manage to find myself in the middle of so many cases back to back? Well, at least I have today. All I ask is that I be allowed to spend it quietly.) ???: Mr. Edgewooooorth! This is big! Big, I tell you! ...Hey, what's wrong with you? Where's your enthusiasm...? Edgeworth: And suddenly, the phrase \"the fragility of dreams\" comes to mind... Kay: What are you talking about, \"fragile dreams\"!? Come on, let's go! The fake Yatagarasu isn't going to just find herself, you know! Edgeworth: Well, if you must know... it's possible that I was paid a visit last night by your \"fake\". Kay: Say what? Edgeworth: ......... Edgeworth: Unfortunately for us, the thief managed to escape. But even now, we're still looking for this criminal. However, I must warn you that we've only had a few hours to search so far... ...so I must insist that you be patient on this one, Kay. Kay: Wh-What's with you today...? Are you sure you aren't sleep-talking to me right now? Anyway, I've got something much more important that I want you to see! Edgeworth: Oh, and that is? Kay: Take a look at this! Edgeworth: \"On March 14th, I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" That's quite a bold declaration to send to an embassy... (I suppose it was inevitable that a newspaper would catch wind of this.) Kay: The date the card mentions is today! Edgeworth: Today, huh... Kay: Come on, we've gotta hurry! The embassy awaits! Edgeworth: I suppose it IS quite an urgent matter... ...however, do you know which country's embassy we should be investigating? Kay: Well, it's some really special country, and I'm actually really fuzzy on the details... But never mind that! Where's all your energy!? Why are you so lackadaisical today!? Edgeworth: I'm not, Kay. You're just too wound up. Kay: Well, then you should get too wound up, too! Because this just might be our chance to catch that woman! Edgeworth: You mean Ms. Yew? (The woman who killed Kay's father, Byrne Faraday, seven years ago... Calisto Yew... She claimed to be the Great Thief Yatagarasu... ...and then disappeared from the courtroom.) Kay: Argh! She makes me so mad! The phony! Everyone knows that the real Yatagarasu would never send something like a calling card! Until a company's underhanded dealings are made public... ...the target is always totally unaware that the Yatagarasu has paid them a visit. That's what makes the real Yatagarasu so awesome! Edgeworth: Hmm... The Yatagarasu's card that's shown in this article... It looks to me as though it could be genuine. Kay: See, that's the thing. Whoever it is, that person isn't the real deal, but has knowledge of the Yatagarasu. If this isn't a clue that that woman's involved, then nothing is! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Out the door you go! Edgeworth: Wait, there are a few preparations I must make before we go... (There's something interesting about this card we found last night here in my office... It's of a different color than the one in the article, which makes me wonder why.) Kay: What's up? Any reason why you're boring a hole through the newspaper with your eyes? Edgeworth: No... No reason at all. Very well. Seeing as how Ms. Yew is also someone of a special nature to me... ...I agree there is some merit to be found in investigating this. Kay: I knew you'd come around! ???: By the light of this night's glorious moon... We are ready! Pink Princess: Ready to embark on our nightly outing. Steel Samurai: And this is where... ...our tale begins! Edgeworth: Heh... What a coincidence. Who would've thought that a Steel Samurai stage show... ...would ever be held at such an elegant theater inside a foreign embassy? Kay: Yeah! The climax was really awesome! \"Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!\" I got chills down my spine when he pulled that move out! Edgeworth: I suppose it really is more impactful to watch a show in person than on television. Kay: I have to say, though, this embassy is set up kinda funny. I mean, they have two countries sharing the same building! Edgeworth: Well, as you said yourself, this place and the countries it houses are very special. Even this theater is special in that it is a neutral zone shared by the two countries. Kay: Umm... So, let me get this straight... The Steel Samurai show just now is being sponsored by one of the two countries. The one that's called the Kingdom of Allebahst, right? Edgeworth: Yes, it would appear that the Steel Samurai is very popular in that country as well. Kay: Seems that way! But you know who I'M really into? The Jammin' Ninja! The Republic of Babahl is sponsoring a Jammin' Ninja stage show! That's something for fangirls like me! We've totally gotta see that too, Mr. Edgeworth! The Jammin' Ninja's show is gonna kick the Steel Samurai show's rear end! Edgeworth: (You know, ever since I first met this girl, I've always had this inkling... ...that what she really wants to be... ...is not a thief, but rather, a ninja...) Kay: So anyway, about today's event... umm... What's it called again? Edgeworth: \"The Kingdom of Allebahst versus The Republic of Babahl Goodwill Jubilee\". The small, European countries of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...and the Republic of Babahl. These two countries used to be a single entity that was abundant with nature. And it was called... the Principality of Cohdopia. .................. Kay: Hm? Is everything alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Yes, I'm alright. Moving on... After a period of civil unrest, the country split in two, though signs of their past remain. For example, their flags preserve the flower and butterfly motifs to this day. ......... (Cohdopia, huh... The KG-8 Incident... and what was referred to as the second KG-8 Incident... ...in which an Embassy staff member was murdered... Both of these cases were related to the Principality of Cohdopia. In the seven years that have passed, the country may have split into two... ...however, the Yatagarasu still sent a calling card here. What could it all mean?) ......... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I know you're thinking about something! Edgeworth: Oh, excuse me. What were we talking about again? Kay: Argh, if you could please stop spacing out on me! Anyway, we were talking about the Allebahst versus Babahl Goodwill Jubilee. The two countries have had a pretty bad relationship with each other... ...but supposedly, they've been trying really hard to make up recently. That's why they decided to hold this event. Edgeworth: (If that's the case, then why the \"versus\"...?) Kay: Also, both countries claim to own the real \"Primidux Statue\", a national treasure to both. They're planning to have them publicly evaluated today, to see which one's the real deal. Edgeworth: Kay, need I remind you to take care and not succumb to your thieving desires? Kay: Well, when it comes to treasure, I can't help myself. You know that! Edgeworth: (Nngh... She had better be saying that in jest...) Kay: Hey! I can read your body language, you know! And you've got it all wrong! Look! I'm here to do some investigating! INVESTIGATING, I tell you! Edgeworth: Heh, I know. And although we don't know if the Yatagarasu will really make an appearance... ...I suppose we should still spend some time examining this place. After examining pamphlets: Edgeworth: I suppose I'll just help myself to one of these... Embassy Guide stuck into the pages of my Organizer. Edgeworth: (Hm? What is all the hubbub?) Ack! Kay: Hey, look! It's the Steel Samurai! And he's got his son, the Iron Infant, with him!! Edgeworth: May I speak with you for a second? (...It's... the Steel Samurai...) Steel Samurai: ......... Edgeworth: ......... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! What are you glaring at him for!? Edgeworth: Ahem, please excuse me. It's just that I've never seen a super-hero up close before. Steel Samurai: ......... Kay: It looks like he's written something down for you! Edgeworth: \"To Edgeworth, From Steel Samurai Daddy: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo\" Kay: Wow, an autograph! Pretty cool that you got one, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Heh... Steel Samurai's Autograph received. Guard: Mr. Steel Samurai! Ambassador Alba is waiting for you! Reporter: And now the Steel Samurai... ...will proceed to enter the Kingdom of Allebahst to shake the hand of the ambassador. The Steel Samurai isn't only here for the two countries tonight... ...but rather, can be thought of as a goodwill ambassador from our own country as well! Kay: There he goes. Off to spread goodwill to the world. Edgeworth: He really does seem like a goodwill ambassador, doesn't he? Cameraman: OK! We're shooting the next segment now! Cue camera! Reporter: In just a few seconds, the Jammin' Ninja stage show is set to begin. After the show, the Jammin' Ninja will enter the Republic of Babahl. He is set to meet with the Ambassador of Babahl at that time. Kay: AHH! The Jammin' Ninja's show is about to start! We've gotta get back to our seats! Edgeworth: Regrettably... I don't have much of an interest in ninjas... Kay: Well, this show will change your mind! Come on, we have to hurry! If we miss even a second of the Jammin' Ninja's awesome playing, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I suppose you're not about to give me much of a choice here, are you, Kay?) Kay: Ahhh! I could listen to that \"A Ninja Marked for Death's Lullaby\" song all day! His superb playing and that sad melody really brought a tear to my eye! And his heart-wrenching voice! Now THAT'S the Jammin' Ninja's greatest weapon! Edgeworth: .................. Kay: Ahh! Those pieces of Jammin' Ninja merchandise over there! I've got to have them! I especially want the hair sticks they're selling exclusively at these shows. They're exactly like the ones the heroine, Princess Misola, wears in her hair! Edgeworth: ...Anyway. Kay: Anyway!? ANYWAY!? Hold it right there, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: You're thinking of going home, aren't you!? Edgeworth: Well, it doesn't seem likely that the Yatagarasu will be making an appearance tonight. Most likely, it was simply a prank. Kay: No way! I just know the Yatagarasu will show! Edgeworth: But I thought you said that the Yatagarasu doesn't send calling cards. Kay: Yeah, I did, but... Edgeworth: I figured from the very beginning that this would wind up being a wild goose chase. Kay: But that card she sent was a genuine fake calling card! Edgeworth: A genuine fake...? Kay: Well, how can I word this...? The Yatagarasu's mark that's on the calling card is exactly the same as my mark. Get it now? Officer: W-We've got a problem! Th-The Yatagarasu has been spotted in Allebahst! Edgeworth: What!? Kay: You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Hah! So you finally decided to show yourself, you phony! Hey, what gives!? Guard: I'm sorry but I will need to search you before you may enter. Kay: What the!? Hey! The Steel Samurai just waltzed straight on through without one! Now if you don't hurry up and let me through, my phony is going to escape! Edgeworth: Kay, a country's embassy is considered to be a part of the country itself. If you don't go through the proper procedures to enter the country... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I'm going to enter through Babahl and climb over the wall into Allebahst! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You would tell a prosecutor straight out that you intend to illegally enter another... Kay, are you listening to me!? Kay: Kay Faraday, and I'm coming through! Guard: Yes, and welcome! Edgeworth: Someone stop her! Anyone! Edgeworth: *huff, huff, huff*... Kay... Where are you? Don't tell me you really did find some way over this fence... Ack! Guard: Fire! This is too big for us to handle! Looks like the Yatagarasu came to Babahl, too! Edgeworth: You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! You had better be alright, wherever you are! Kay: I told you! It wasn't me! Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: *huff, huff, huff*... Kay! Are you alright!? Kay: Do I look alright to you!? Now, can you do something about this woman!? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe! What is the meaning of this!? Gumshoe: *sigh* Well, sir... it's um, this. Edgeworth: He's...! Kay: It wasn't me! He was already dead when I ran in here, hot on the heels of the fake Yatagarasu! Look, I only came in here because I saw a suspicious person at the open-air stage! Edgeworth: A suspicious person? Kay: A long, black coat and a hood over their head -- I dare you to tell me that's not suspicious! When I saw that person, I immediately thought that they must be the fake Yatagarasu. So I chased after them into the Embassy, then into here, and then lost sight of them... But I just KNOW that person is the one who did it! Shih-na: What are you so worked up over? There is no reason for you to be this loud. Edgeworth: Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're Agent Lang's secretary... ...Shih-na, I believe your name is, correct? Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: And if you are making an arrest... ...I assume you have evidence that it was Kay who committed the crime, is that also correct? Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: You refuse to answer!? Shih-na: I don't need to answer. Edgeworth: ! Shih-na: You are merely a prosecutor in this country, meaning you have no investigative authority. Gumshoe: H-Hey, pal! Just what the heck does what you just said mean!? If it happened here, it's under Mr. Edgeworth's jurisdiction. The end. And seeing as how this building is sitting on our soil, we can investigate wherever we'd like! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, Detective, embassies are a different matter. Gumshoe: Huh? Edgeworth: This office is considered to be a part of the Republic of Babahl. Which means that anything that happens in here... ...defaults to the control of the Babahlese government and Babahlese law... ...giving them exclusive extraterritorial rights. Gumshoe: Extraterrestrial (changed from [Extraterristrial] in the original release, correcting the typo) rights? Sir, do you really believe that the truth is out there!? Edgeworth: *sigh* Basically, our country's laws do not apply inside the embassy of another country. That's what was agreed to by our respective governments. Our authority to investigate was effectively nullified the second we entered this place. Which means we can do little here in this situation... Gumshoe: N-No way, sir! Shih-na: Please leave this matter in Interpol's hands and go home. Edgeworth: N...Nnnnngh... Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Kay: H-Hey, you're not...!? Mr. Edgeworth! ???: ???: In that case... allow me to join your investigation. Gumshoe: M-Ms. von Karma! Eeek! Franziska: Ambassador Palaeno, I truly appreciate you allowing me to join the investigation. Palaeno: It's really nothing. Manny was my secretariat, so of course I want to help you as much as I can. In fact, it's a blessing that Interpol agents were able to make it so quickly. Edgeworth: Franziska... Franziska: Well, well. I never imagined that I'd meet you here of all places. This is an embassy, meaning that you have no authority to conduct... Edgeworth: Franziska: A-Already!? What is it!? Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno. Palaeno: Hm? And you are? Edgeworth: I'm Miles Edgeworth, public prosecutor. I ask that you please allow me to investigate this case as Ms. von Karma's assistant. Gumshoe: A...Assistant? Franziska: Miles!? What the heck do you think you're...!? Edgeworth: Please, I implore you, Ambassador Palaeno. Palaeno: Very well. I'll be counting on the two of you, Ms. von Karma and Mr. Edgeworth. Gumshoe: Umm... What did you mean by you'll be Ms. von Karma's assistant...? Edgeworth: I don't exactly have a choice, do I, Detective? If I don't become Franziska's assistant, I can't participate in this investigation. Franziska: Hmph. There you go again, running at the mouth with that aloof expression on your face. Edgeworth: Franziska, please... Franziska: I don't know what you're planning quite yet... ...but at least I do know one thing -- that you are now my subordinate. Just remember that my whip is always ready to wake you, should you have a brain lapse. Edgeworth: Of course. I'll keep that in mind. Shih-na: ...If you are done playing games...! Edgeworth: Right. let's begin the investigation. Edgeworth: By the way, Detective... I suppose it's a bit late to be asking, but why are you here? Gumshoe: Well, better late than never, I guess, sir. I was placed on guard duty for the Babahlese Embassy today! Edgeworth: And why are our police guarding an embassy? Gumshoe: Well, on account of the card they got from the Yatagarasu... ...they called us up and asked for our help, sir. Oh, and because we've been searching for the Yatagarasu these past seven years! It was a more or less mutually beneficial arrangement, if you ask me! Edgeworth: Except for how mutually unbeneficial this has all turned out to be, I suppose. It looks like you failed to competently perform your guard duty yet again. Gumshoe: Ack...! Edgeworth: Look forward to your next salary negotiation... although, it's out of my hands. Gumshoe: But sir! If it gets cut any more, I won't be able to buy even instant (changed from [packet] in the original release) noodles anymore... After connecting \"Locked safe\" and \"Key used at Embassy\" Logic: Edgeworth: We know for a fact that the Yatagarasu's Key was used at this embassy. Furthermore, we found it in the victim, Mr. Coachen's pocket. Which leads me to think that perhaps it is the key to the personal safe in this office. Gumshoe: Good thinking, sir! Let's go try it out! Edgeworth: ...It appears I was correct. (The key that was left to us in the victim's pocket... It literally turned out to be the key to the next piece of the truth!) Hmm... What do we have here? Gumshoe: Hey! There's nothing inside! D-Do you think the Yatagarasu made off with everything, sir? Edgeworth: No, Detective, I believe all we need is a closer look. Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: What is this here? Gumshoe: It looks like the ripped corner of a piece of paper, sir. Edgeworth: No, I don't think it's ripped; it seems more, to me, like it's stuck in the safe. Gumshoe: Hey, you're right! It won't budge an inch, not even when I tug on it! But I don't think I've ever seen paper stuck on the inside of a safe before... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective, I think you have it backwards. It's not the paper that's strange... It's the safe. Gumshoe: What do you mean? Edgeworth: What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that... Edgeworth: Even just eye-balling it, you can see that the inside is a bit too shallow. Furthermore, with the unnatural way the paper is stuck at the back of the safe... ...I'd say that there is an extra bit of space behind the back wall of this safe! In other words, this safe has a second compartment. Gumshoe: Wh-Whaaaaaaat!? Franziska: I suppose that you are correct in asserting that the paper is stuck in an unnatural manner. However, if what you say is correct and there is a second compartment... ...how do we go about opening the door to it then? As you can see, there is no other lock or keyhole in sight. Edgeworth: Actually, there is one more spot of interest to me on this safe. Franziska: Oh? Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe that spot is the keyhole to our mystery second lock! Franziska: The safe and its locks... Alright then, since you are so sure of yourself, show me how you deduced your answer! Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: Doesn't the shape of this keyhole remind you of something, Franziska? Franziska: The shape? It does look very familiar... However, I believe it's simply a latch hole for the safe's lock mechanism. It's just for keeping the door shut, nothing more. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is that so? The person who used this safe... ...Mr. Coachen, made sure this safe had two compartments, in order to hide something. Do you honestly think someone like that would allow the keyhole to the hidden half... ...to look so obviously like a keyhole that even the average person could figure it out? Franziska: ! ...You can't be serious...! Are you saying that this hole is the keyhole to the hidden compartment of this safe? Edgeworth: That's precisely what I'm saying. Franziska: ...! Edgeworth: And I will prove to you right now... ...that the Yatagarasu's Key is the key that will open it! Franziska: Franziska: The Yatagarasu's Key!? Miles Edgeworth! This had better be a very bad joke! Edgeworth: Sorry, but this is no joke. The Yatagarasu's Key... ...is the very key that will open the second compartment of this safe. Franziska: We know that this key opens the first compartment of the safe. But the keyhole you're talking about... ...is of an entirely different shape than that of the key! Leads to examination of Yatagarasu's Key Edgeworth: Let's go over this again, shall we? The Yatagarasu's Key... ...was originally made to open Mr. Coachen's safe in the Cohdopian Embassy. We confirmed that as fact by opening the door to his safe with it. Now, let's take a look at the back end of the key. Looking at the knife portion head on, what do you see? Franziska: What are you talking... Aaah! Edgeworth: It appears that you've come to understand what I'm talking about. When viewed head-on, the knife's blade is the exact same shape as the keyhole! The real function of the knife portion is to act as the key to the hidden portion of the safe. Franziska: B-But that's... preposterous! Edgeworth: Because it looks like a knife and was used like one to kill Mr. Faraday seven years ago... ...we fell under the misconception that it was always meant to be a knife. But for both the safe and its key to conceal such clever tricks... ...whatever is hidden inside the secret section must be of incredible importance. Franziska: .........Then, it's even possible that what I've been searching for is inside! Scruffy! Hurry up and open that safe! Gumshoe: Eeeek! Y-Yes, sir! Opening it now, sir! Edgeworth: These items... They're...! Gumshoe: It's a bunch of funny-shaped things. I guess they're pieces of art, huh, siiiiir!? Franziska: You're in the way! Now, move, Scruffy! Gumshoe: I didn't think I was in the way... *sniffle* Franziska: These pieces of art...! They're identical to ones that have been stolen from various countries around the world! Edgeworth: I figured as much... These are the treasures this section of the safe was to hide from view! Hmm... I believe a more thorough examination is required. Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: Take a good look at these documents, Franziska. Franziska: It says that there are three pages in total, and yet, there are only two here. Edgeworth: Correct. Now take a look at the smuggling activity document in your possession. Tell me, is it not possible that your page was taken from this set of three? Franziska: Well, well... It certainly looks that way. Edgeworth: By putting our multi-part puzzle together, we seem to have arrived at an answer. And it seems that you have now found what you were looking for. Franziska: Yes, and with this, it has become crystal clear... ...that Mr. Coachen himself was responsible for the mass smuggling of Babahlese ink! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink? Franziska: Babahlese ink is a special product of the Republic of Babahl. However, due to a special reason, only a limited volume is ever exported. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And that reason is...? Franziska: That's classified. It's on a need to know basis, and you don't need to know. In any case, it seems that the head of the smuggling ring was our victim, Mr. Manny Coachen. Edgeworth: His base was in an embassy, thus, it was hard for both our country and his to interfere. Making it the ideal conditions under which to run a smuggling operation. Franziska: Argh... but it's so frustrating. I lost the person I was to rain judgment down upon with my Whip of Justice. Edgeworth: Well, even if he is dead, we still have a responsibility to look into his misdeeds. Franziska: You expect me to whip a dead man? ...Well, I'm not interested. Edgeworth: Franziska... You must know... ...that Manny Coachen was the suspect in the KG-8 Incident... Franziska: Of course I know! On top of being the head of the smuggling ring... ...there is the matter of what really happened in that case that needs to be resolved. After connecting \"Motif on knife handle\" and \"Butterfly of Babahl\" Logic, and examining golden statue and knife rack: Shih-na: ...Are you done investigating? Edgeworth: .................. Shih-na: You realize now, don't you? That this girl is the only one it could be. Now come along quietly, Yatagarasu... Kay Faraday. You are under arrest for the murder of Manny Coachen. Kay: M...Mr. Edgeworth! Please, you have to believe me! I didn't do it! I chased the fake Yatagarasu in here... and he... he was already... Shih-na: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'd like to help you reduce the number of mistaken arrests Interpol makes. Shih-na: ...What is that supposed to mean? Edgeworth: I believe I told you that Kay Faraday is not the culprit of this crime. Shih-na: ...Very well. I suppose I have no choice. I'll show you just how foolish your claims are! Shih-na: Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight. Utilizing the confusion caused by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy. Furthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu. And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body. Edgeworth: Your reason for suspecting Kay is because you think she is the Yatagarasu? Shih-na: ...Exactly. But it isn't just me. She calls herself the Yatagarasu. Kay: Argh! Look, how many times do I have to tell you!? I was only out to capture the fake Yatagarasu! Shih-na: Imposter or not... it matters not. A Yatagarasu is a Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: Very well. Then I shall prove that Kay is not the Yatagarasu who killed Mr. Manny Coachen! Shih-na: ...Go ahead and try. Show me what the prosecutors of this country are made of. Shih-na: Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight. Shih-na: Utilizing the confusion caused by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy. Shih-na: Furthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu. Shih-na: She wanted to steal documents regarding smuggling, so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Shih-na: And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body. Edgeworth: (So Agent Shih-na suspects Kay of murder simply because Kay is the Yatagarasu. But if I can prove that the Yatagarasu's goal is not related to murder... ...then I may be able to begin to reason with her!) Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na. I regret to inform you, but there is a flaw in your logic. Shih-na: Oh? Edgeworth: Even if you claim that she is the killer, and the Yatagarasu... ...I am certain that securing the smuggling documents is not the motive behind the murder! The key to the safe in this room was found on Mr. Coachen's body. Furthermore, the Yatagarasu would not be so stupid as to leave without the documents. Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: By the simple fact that the documents were still in the safe when we looked... ...it's obvious that the killer's target was not the safe at all! Shih-na: Shih-na: Then perhaps she didn't know that Mr. Coachen had the key on him. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If that's the case, then why would she have needed to kill him? Because I can think of no reason for her to kill him if she had not known that fact! Shih-na: Shih-na: Need, reason... All of this is simply our conjecturing after the fact. It's entirely possible that she accidentally killed him when she was sneaking him. Edgeworth: .........! Shih-na: Perhaps she didn't notice the safe's second compartment before returning the key. Edgeworth: Arngh! Shih-na: But the fact still remains... that Mr. Coachen was stabbed to death. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But you have no definitive proof that it was Kay who committed the act! Shih-na: Shih-na: ...Actually, I do. I saw her holding the knife she used on the victim with my own eyes. Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? Shih-na: ...Allow me to tell you a bit more about the evidence that will put her away behind bars. Shih-na: The knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife. The knife with the butterfly handle is the murder weapon, which the killer was holding. I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim. The knife is a part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other. The evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument. Edgeworth: Nnnnnrrrrrgh... Th-That is your definitive evidence...!? Shih-na: You see now that she is definitely the killer, right? Kay: No! Mr. Edgeworth, you've gotta believe me! I saw a suspicious person in a long black coat outside the Embassy, I swear! Edgeworth: And you came in here because you were chasing this suspicious person? Kay: That's right. I ran into this office only because I was chasing after that person... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the lights, but then... Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ???: ...Who's there!? Shih-na: This is... Shih-na: I came to this room upon hearing the girl's scream. And when I saw her holding the knife, I immediately restrained her. Edgeworth: So the object Kay felt by her feet on the floor was the murder weapon...!? Shih-na: I had the knife analyzed right away, but we failed to find anyone's (changed from [anyone] in the original release, correcting the typo) prints on it. Kay: But the suspicious person in the black coat who came into this room before me...! Shih-na: Shih-na: You continue to insist there was such a person, but if there was, where did they go? Kay: That... I don't know. But I know they came in here! Shih-na: Shih-na: That sounds like the desperate excuses of a suspected killer, not a trustworthy testimony. You understand, don't you? We can't trust this girl's words, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Gnnrk! (She has a point. Even if Kay's words are the truth... ...I must show that they are with some solid evidence!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I really didn't...! Edgeworth: ! Kay... Don't worry. If you didn't do it, then there must exist a way for me to prove that. Shih-na: Shih-na: Still not giving up, I see. In that case, try to counter my argument, if you can. Edgeworth: Don't worry, I can and I will! Shih-na: The knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife. Shih-na: The knife with the butterfly handle is the murder weapon, which the killer was holding. Shih-na: I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim. Shih-na: The knife is a part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other. Shih-na: The evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument. Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na's proof is the Babahlese knife that Kay was allegedly holding. Gumshoe: Yeah... So, um, how are you going to prove that Kay didn't do it, sir? Edgeworth: If Agent Shih-na wants to suspect Kay merely because Kay was the only one here... ...then I must show with evidence that Kay couldn't have committed the murder! Gumshoe: Um, but do you have such evidence, sir? Edgeworth: Yes. There is one piece of evidence that seems very unnatural to me. ...And I believe it is my duty to point that out to Agent Shih-na. Edgeworth: So the murder weapon was the knife with the butterfly design on it. But is that really the truth? Shih-na: What are you getting at? Edgeworth: I'd like for you to take a look at this. There is blood on the blade, and yet, there's not a speck of blood on the handle. This signifies that at the time of the crime, a different handle was attached to this blade. The knife that Kay was holding... ...had its handle switched, and was, in fact, not the real murder weapon! Shih-na: It wasn't... the real murder weapon!? Edgeworth: This knife can be taken apart. Shall we give it a go? Leads to examination of Babahlese knife Edgeworth: As you can see, the Babahlese knife has now been disassembled into two parts. The killer must have pulled the murder weapon out of the victim's body... ...and proceeded to swap the knife's original handle with this butterfly one. It was all to create the illusion that Mr. Coachen was killed with the butterfly-themed knife! Shih-na: Uurrnngh... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: (This should clear up any and all suspicion surrounding Kay.) Babahlese Knife Handle data jotted down in my Organizer. Shih-na: Your argument isn't airtight yet! Edgeworth: How so? Shih-na: It's possible... that the girl herself is the one who switched the handles. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! For what purpose would she do such a thing!? Shih-na: I don't care to know how a criminal thinks. The way they view the world is beyond the comprehension of a normal person like myself. Therefore, I wouldn't put anything past them, no matter how odd it may seem. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Heh. The truth is right there in front of you, and this knife will show you the way! You will come to see that Kay is not and could not have been Mr. Coachen's killer! Leads to examination of Babahlese knife Shih-na: What is this mark on here? Edgeworth: It's the mark of a flower. I assume you know what this means? Shih-na: No, not really. Butterflies rest on flowers all the time to drink their sweet nectar. Edgeworth: ...And so they do. (However, would this butterfly really drink the nectar of this flower? The answer is clearly... not a chance! Now to prove the relationship between the butterfly and the flower with this!) Shih-na: ! Y-You can't be serious...! Edgeworth: Hmph... It appears that you've made the connection. The flower on this blade is designed after a certain country's national symbol. That's right... The Kingdom of Allebahst. In other words... This blade is from one of Allebahst's ornamental knives! Shih-na: Aah! Edgeworth: This part of the knife handle... ...has Babahl's national symbol of the butterfly on it. Therefore, it is undeniably Babahlese in origin! But as we both know, you can't kill someone with just a knife handle. Incidentally, when exactly did the murder occur again, Agent Shih-na? Shih-na: Ack! After the fire had broken out... Edgeworth: That's right. Kay entered the Babahlese Embassy after the fire had taken place. Furthermore, she had not been to the Allebahstian side of the building before then. On top of that, not a single person passed between the two countries during the fire... ...which means that Kay could not have transported an Allebahstian object over here! This makes it impossible for her to be the true killer! Shih-na: ..................! Gumshoe: Whooooop! Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! What a great victory! Edgeworth: .................. Franziska: .................. Shih-na: .................. Gumshoe: Huh? Hey, why is everyone so quiet...? Edgeworth: (I'm happy we got this far and cleared Kay's name... ...but what worries me now is what will happen next.) Franziska: Franziska: What is the meaning of this!? An Allebahstian knife, here...!? Edgeworth: Do you mean... how did this find its way to the Republic of Babahl? It didn't just find its way over. Rather, we should focus on how it was smuggled over! Kay: You know what!? My brain hurts thinking about it while we're just standing around! Thinking while you're on the run? Now THAT'S the way a real Great Thief operates! Edgeworth: Kay...? Kay: Oh, thanks a bunch, Mr. Edgeworth! For proving me innocent, I mean! You believed in me the whole time, right? Tell me you did! Edgeworth: Umm, not really, but... Kay: Ha ha. Come on, you don't have to be shy about it! Shih-na: Shih-na: ...Your argument is still not airtight. Edgeworth: Would you care to elaborate? Shih-na: I understand now that the girl didn't commit the murder. However, there is still the possibility that she is the Yatagarasu. Kay: That again!? Look, how many times do I have to explain it to you!? I am the real Yatagarasu! I'm not like that fake one that goes around setting fires, OK!? Shih-na: Whether you're the real deal or a fake, it doesn't really matter. All I have to say is this: I have my suspicions that this girl is the one who started the fire. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Preposterous! On what grounds do you suspect her of such a thing!? Shih-na: The fact that she calls herself the Yatagarasu. That in itself is the (changed from [a] in the original release) most elegant proof. Kay: Ms. Shih-na. Shih-na: Yes? Kay: I... have no intention of taking back any of what I've said. Shih-na: ...? Kay: I am the Great Thief Yatagarasu. And I refuse to allow some imposter to claim that name as their own! The path of justice that my father pointed me towards... I will walk it the best I can! Shih-na: It's not good to be so stubborn. I hope you can understand that. Kay: Thanks a lot for the concern, Ms. Shih-na! Let me share something with you, too, as a token of my appreciation! Those sunglasses totally do nothing for you, so I'll steal them from you next time, OK!? Shih-na: Wh--!? Kay: Well, I guess we'd better get going! Franziska: Going...? To where? Kay: To the Kingdom of Allebahst! If we don't go, we won't know for sure, right? Franziska: I suppose not... We won't get anywhere simply by standing here thinking. To see where the Allebahstian knife came from... ...we'll have to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. Let's go, Miles Edgeworth. As you are my subordinate... I will not tolerate you bringing the investigation to a halt. Edgeworth: Hmph... Understood. To be continued MIB: Count off! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! ...1! 1! MIB: Shifu! 99 callouts! So all 99 members are most likely here and accounted for, sir! Lang: ...Hey, you. Yeah, you, the second #1 from my right. Officer: Sir! Yes, sir!? Lang: Here... A birthday present for you. Officer: Wha...?? MIB: Shifu! I didn't know that you knew all of our birthdays...! Officer: What a kind heart you have! Shifu, you are more of a man than we'll ever be, sir! Officer: Umm... I'm really sorry, but it's not my birthday... Lang: Lang Zi says: \"A cub who disrespects others soon feels the disciplinary bite of an elder.\" That present isn't for you. It's for your younger brother's wife's younger brother. ...Tell him I said \"hi\", and \"happy birthday\", won't you? Officer: Y...Yes, sir! MIB: Shifu! I can't believe you remember that much about each of us! Officer: Shifu! I... I'm so moved that I can't stop crying! Edgeworth: (...I should probably leave them to their \"alone time\".) Lang: Alright, meeting's over. Everyone... head for your posts! Dismissed! Sir! Lang: Yo, were you guys there the whole time? I got a call from Shih-na, and she's already filled me in. It sounds like you're out to get in my way again. Edgeworth: I have absolutely no intention of interrupting your investigation. I simply request that you grant me permission to investigate the Allebahstian Embassy. Lang: Hmph. And what if I say no? Franziska: Franziska: Agent Lang! This man is my subordinate. As I have received permission from the ambassador, he is to be extended the same rights. Lang: Sorry, sis, but it's not that simple. Allebahst has the strictest immigration regulations in the world, or didn't you know? Even among my elite men, about only half of them were admitted into the country. Besides, any more cooks in the kitchen, and we might spoil the soup, if you get what I mean. Franziska: How dare you make such assumptions!? Lang: Don't take this the wrong way, but I thought I was in charge of Allebahst, Ms. von Karma. Franziska: Grrr! Lang: Look, try to understand, OK? Things over in Allebahst are a bit of a mess right now. Edgeworth: What do you mean by \"a bit of a mess\"? Lang: No one told you? We had an \"incident\" in Allebahst as well. This is what we call a decision based on the investigation, Mr. Prosecutor. Kay: Look, Wolfy! Just let us in already! ???: ???: Is there a problem here, Agent Lang? Lang: Not really. Just having a \"discussion\" about whether or not to let these guys in. Franziska: Ambassador Alba, I ask that you please allow these people to join the investigation. Alba: Having a debate because of my country... I'm terribly sorry for placing you good people in that kind of situation... It is all because I lacked the strength to govern well. Edgeworth: Please, it is nothing of the sort, Ambassador... Alba: You weakling, Quercus! Curse your frailty and inability to affect change in your country! Edgeworth: Wh-What are you--!? Alba: The thing is, investigations conducted in my country have been under Agent Lang. And it is my judgment that in order to minimize disruption in the investigation... ...I should leave everything up to Agent Lang. Lang: ...There, you see? Kay: Oh, no way! ???: Palaeno: Ambassador Alba, I ask you to please reconsider letting them into Allebahst. Alba: What's that...? Palaeno: My very own secretary has been murdered in the Babahlese Embassy. And he was apparently caught up in some very shady dealings completely unbeknownst to me. So I ask for your cooperation in our investigation. These aren't much, but I hope they can cover your travel expenses to Babahl someday. Lang: Alright, alright. I get it. Even if you beg Ambassador Alba, I still have to give the final OK anyway. Kay: Alright! You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? We're in! Lang: Not so fast, my little crow-girl. You're still a witness in the Babahl murder. So I'd like you to please stay in the Republic of Babahl. Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Please take good care of Kay for me. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Lang: Sounds good to me. The fewer troublemakers, the better. Kay: ......... *rasp!* Gumshoe: *rasp!* Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: So I wanted to ask for a while now, but... ...that lady over there, is she who I think she is!? Edgeworth: Ah, that's right. I didn't introduce the two of you yet. Franziska: Franziska von Karma, the prosecutorial prodigy. ...It's nice to see you again. Kay: Ooh, I knew it! You're the whip lady! Franziska: .........You may address me as Ms. von Karma. Kay: Ms. von Karma, I leave the investigation of Allebahst in your hands! Franziska: Thanks. Rest assured, I will outsmart both the smuggling ring and the Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: (The smuggling ring, huh... Perhaps I should ask Franziska a bit more about them before I head into Allebahst. Ah, and I mustn't forget to thank Ambassador Palaeno for all that he has done for me.) After talking with Franziska von Karma and Colias Palaeno: Edgeworth: Well, shall we get going? ???: Edgeworth: What's wrong, Kay? Kay: I didn't get permission to enter Allebahst... ...so we're going to go gather whatever info we can over on the Babahlese side, OK!? Edgeworth: Alright, I'm counting on you two. Kay: Right, and I'm counting on you and Ms. von Karma to sniff out clues in Allebahst! Oh, and Mr. Edgeworth! If you happen to come across my phony, you let me know, OK!? If you tell me, I'll rush on over straight away no matter where you are! Edgeworth: .................. I'll let you know when the time comes. Edgeworth: (...Hm?) Gwoooooooh! Franziska: What do you think you're doing to my subordinate!? Edgeworth: Y...You're...! ???: Edgey...! Oh, thank the heavens you're here...! I'm in a really, really big pickle, Your Lordship! The Raven, it appeared, poof! And then disappeared, swoosh! And though I am the Steel Samurai, my sword, it... Waaaaaaaaah! I'm so confused, I don't know what anything means anymore! Franziska: Who is this fruitcake!? Larry: I am Larry of the House of Butz: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo, m'lady! Franziska: Now I remember. This... person is one of your friends, isn't he, Miles? Edgeworth: Yes, frighteningly enough... he is. Larry: Hey! What's up with that answer!? Your best bud is in a bind, and you act like it's no big deal! Edgeworth: What sort of \"bind\" are we talking about here...? Larry: The suspect kind! I accidentally became a suspect in a murdeeeeeer! Edgeworth: I see. That is quite the bind. Franziska: ...Not that we're in the least bit surprised. Edgeworth: Yes, I pretty much expected this news... ...from the instant I saw this unlucky face. (His name is Larry Butz. I've known him since grade school, and for as long as I've known him... ...he has been the world's largest source of Trouble with a capital T.) Larry: Hey! What kind of introduction is that!? You're so mean, Edgey! If you're not careful, you might find your tiny number of friends go down by one! Edgeworth: That was uncalled for. Besides, you're............ Wait, hold on. Laaaaaaryyyy! It was you!? YOU'RE the one who wrote my Steel Samurai autograph!? Larry: Hm? Oh, you didn't notice earlier? I even winked at you through my headpiece. Franziska: .........What's going on? And why are you beet-red? Edgeworth: Sorry... but could you not speak to me right now...? ???: Lang: Oh, sorry, am I interrupting your comical, yet melodramatic play? Edgeworth: ! .........Aha. So this is the incident you mentioned earlier. Lang: Mr. Prosecutor, this man... this childhood friend of yours... is our prime suspect. Of what, you ask? Of the murder of a man who had snuck into this embassy, Mask\u2606DeMasque II! Edgeworth: Mask\u2606DeMasque II...? .................. (Only Larry could get himself into yet another mess as fine as this. But no matter what the facts seem to say, Larry is not the type to commit murder. Still, it's a rather daunting stroke of misfortune I've struck. I have to prove... that Larry Butz is innocent of all wrongdoing!) MIB: Shifu! We've identified the victim! Lang: Good work. I'll take that report now. Edgeworth: Agent Lang, would you mind if I took a peek at it as well? Lang: What did I tell you earlier, Mr. Prosecutor? Don't get in my way! There's only enough flesh here to feed one wolf, and that one is me! So, no, you may not take a \"peek\". Edgeworth: But Agent Lang...! ???: Badd: ...Agent Lang. Will you... allow an investigator such as myself... to take a look? Lang: Ah, yes. Of course. ...You, let the detective see the file. Edgeworth: You're... Detective Badd! Badd: You're... the prosecutor, Mr. Edgeworth, right? Edgeworth: Fancy meeting you here, Detective. Badd: You weren't expecting me...? Ever since that day seven years ago... I've chased after the Yatagarasu... non-stop. I even pressured Interpol... into keeping me in the loop... in case a card was ever found. Edgeworth: (What incredible dedication to the case.) Lang: Detective Badd knows the Yatagarasu's M. O. very well. And his passion for the chase hasn't died down in these seven long years. It's something... I can respect. But, Detective Badd, I must ask: are you going to make an ally out of this prosecutor? Badd: My only goal is to arrest the Yatagarasu. If he can get to the bottom of this case, then I'm willing to share info with him. Edgeworth: I am in your debt, Detective Badd. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: In any case, I believe it's high time for me to start my investigation. After correctly deducing spear and golden statue, and examining knife rack, paper in hand, Mask\u2606DeMasque II's head, sword, and flowers on windowsill: Edgeworth: Hmm... I guess that about wraps up my investigation. Hm? That's... Larry: Yo! Pink Princess! How're you feeling? Still feeling ill? Pink Princess: .................. Franziska: ...And yet another strange character comes out of the woodwork. Edgeworth: And so the Pink Princess also comes to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. (I believe I may need to speak with her as well...) After clearing all Talk options with Wendy Oldbag: Officer: Prosecutor von Karma! I've brought the police dog, as you requested, sir! Franziska: Good work. You may leave now, Officer. Edgeworth: Hmm... This dog... Franziska: I requested the assistance of a dog in our search for the Yatagarasu. Lang: Looks like you guys have some pretty bright dogs in this country, too. ???: Woof! Woof! Lang: Hey... You're a real cutie, aren't you? Yeah! That's a good boy! Badd: ...That's the police dog Gumshoe's been taking care of... I think its name is... Missile. Franziska: What a fitting name for a police dog that dashes out in front and attacks. Edgeworth: (That action alone isn't exactly what's going to solve the case for us, you know.) Franziska: Now, Missile. I want you to find some clues! Go! Missile: Woof! Franziska: Good dog. You really are quite bright, aren't you? ...Unlike a certain someone I know. Now, what do we have here? What... is this? It looks like a small hot dog, but... Edgeworth: Hm? Wait, Franziska, isn't that... an official Samurai Dog? Missile: Grrraaaaaaarh! Franziska: Ah! No! Bad Missile! .........He ate it. I wonder if it's alright for him to eat that? Edgeworth: It's just a meat-substance snack featuring the Steel Samurai. I'm sure he'll be fine. Franziska: That's quite a bit of information you gathered there in a single, quick glance. Edgeworth: (We should really be focusing on why there was a Samurai Dog there in the first place.) Franziska: Hm? It looks like that snack wasn't all Missile found. Edgeworth: Oh? And what do we have... here...? Franziska: It appears to be a lady's undershirt. I wonder if Ambassador Alba might have an interest in cross-dressing? Edgeworth: I somehow doubt that. It doesn't look like the shirt would even fit him. (A Samurai Dog and a lady's undershirt... What are these two items doing in a room like this? Given the circumstances, the lady's undershirt could only belong to one person. I suppose I should get this over with and ask the owner of said undershirt about it...) Lady's Undershirt data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: If you could please take a look at this brown-colored undershirt... Oldbag: Oh, Edgey-poo... What is the meaning of this!? Edgeworth: ? Oldbag: Why did you steal that thing from my bags...? All you had to do was ask, and I would've gladly given you as many as you'd like! Edgeworth: Nnnrghk! Th-Thanks, but no thanks! This shirt was found here at this crime scene. Oldbag: What!? Edgeworth: Come now, why don't you just confess... and explain what it's doing here. Oldbag: I know nothing! NOTHING, I tell you! Edgeworth: What!? Oldbag: Oh, I admit that I used the fireplace to dry that shirt! But I can't really help the fact that I had to, you know! Wearing that Pink Princess costume was like being in a sauna! And on top of that, I get fingered as a suspect!? You're too cruel, Edgey-poo! Edgeworth: Are you claiming that you never once set foot inside this room? Oldbag: Of course I am! If I had been the one to find the body, do you think I'd be as calm and relaxed as I am!? I tell you, it's always like this! It's always my fault for some reason or another. That weekly tabloid article is missing? The camera is missing? That lawyer always makes sure it's my fault they're missing. Speaking of missing, there's the matter of my husband. Can you believe when we got married, he said, \"I guess I'm stuck marrying you.\" What kind of way to propose is that!? What he should've done is he should've whispered in my ear, \"I don't deserve you... but I can't help it. Will you marry me?\" Honestly, men these days! Edgeworth: Umm... Well... (I don't believe she is lying about her actions... So I can safely assume she really was drying her shirt by the fireplace on her break. And somehow, the undershirt managed to move from the next room into this one (Undershirt from next door - The undershirt was found in the office fireplace, but how did it get there?)...) I assume the Samurai Dog was also yours...? Oldbag: Ah, that brilliant mind of yours. You really can see through everything about me! Edgeworth: (And so the feeling of dread continues... But I suppose I should ask for more details...) After connecting all possible Logic and clearing \"Samurai Dogs\" Talk option with Wendy Oldbag: Edgeworth: (It would appear that the answer has made itself known.) Lang: You're making quite a confident face there, Mr. Prosecutor. Bring it on! I'm ready to counter any argument you may have! Edgeworth: Very well, then. If you are prepared... ...I'll show you exactly where my deductions have led me! Larry: Good! I'm counting on you, Edgey! Edgeworth: Leave it to me, Larry. My first attack will be... to expose your lie for what it really is. Larry: M-My liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!? Edgeworth: I know that there is still something you are keeping from the rest of us. Larry: Wh-What's wrong with you!? Why is it you won't believe me no matter what I say, Edgey!? Curse you! I should just hurry up and die already if that's how it's gonna be! I'll confess to every murder in the whole world, and then kill myself... ...and throw everything into mass confuuuuuuuuusion! Lang: Heh, you made some wonderful friends as a child, I see. Edgeworth: Larry, I only have one thing to say to you. Larry: Even if you make that face at me, it's no use! A man who is ready to die is strong-willed, you know! Edgeworth: Larry, it doesn't matter what sort of harebrained trouble you've caused... ...I only ask that you do not lie to me. If you cause an innocent person to be judged unfairly because of some insipid lie... ...I will never forgive you! Larry: E...Edgey... Edgeworth: Although, allow me to say... ...that I consider you to be among the innocent in this case. And that I will draw the real killer out. You can trust me on this. Larry: Alright. I... I... This time... This time, I'll tell you the whole truth, OK!? What happened, what didn't happen, the works! Edgeworth: Just what happened will do! Now then, if you would please testify as to what you did up on the roof tonight. Larry: After the show, I left the pushcart in the Rose Garden, and came into the embassy. Then, they took a picture of me shaking hands with the ambassador. After that, and until my next appearance, I had some free time, so I wandered around. That's when I spotted the chimney. A chimney like that is a rare thing, you know. So then, I wanted to play Santa and decided to give it a try. Edgeworth: Larry, I thought I just finished telling you to not lie anymore. Larry: Umm......... But it's... kinda, ultra-embarrassing. Edgeworth: And what exactly is so ultra-embarrassing that you can't tell me!? Larry: Edgey, man! I just said it was embarrassing, so of course I can't just blurt it out! So you're just gonna have to reason it ouuuuuuuuuuuuut of me! Franziska: As your superior, I command you to hurry up and expose this man's lie! Edgeworth: I have every intention to, for I'm not about to let us waste time on such a trifling matter. Larry: After the show, I left the pushcart in the Rose Garden, and came into the embassy. Larry: Then, they took a picture of me shaking hands with the ambassador. Larry: After that, and until my next appearance, I had some free time, so I wandered around. Larry: That's when I spotted the chimney. A chimney like that is a rare thing, you know. Larry: So then, I wanted to play Santa and decided to give it a try. Edgeworth: As I suspected, you do have something to hide, Larry. But what could be so embarrassing that you'd be willing to go to jail for it!? Franziska: This man's mind is a complete mystery to me. Edgeworth: I believe it's a secret to everyone of a normal mindset how Larry's mind works. However, taking into account his usual, women-obsessed way of thinking... ...I believe that his lie this time is also related to a woman, and this is what I intend to prove. Edgeworth: Actually, I believe in the case of this man, playing Santa is actually quite a big deal. Lang: Are you saying that your buddy isn't exactly made of Santa-quality stuff? Edgeworth: Precisely. You hit the nail on the head, Agent Lang. Larry: Hey, Edgey! That's so incredibly mean! Edgeworth: Tell me something, Larry. Did you know that Santa's job is to deliver presents to people all over the world? Larry: Of course I know that! I DID graduate from junior high, you know! Edgeworth: In that case, it's your turn to tell me something. I want you to tell me to whom you were delivering a present to. Larry: Umm... I was, ah... delivering a present to a child not basking in the warm glow (changed from [glow] in the original release) of love? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That must be the most elegant description of you I've ever heard, but a lie is still a lie. Larry: Y-You sure know how to kick a guy when he's down, you know that!? Edgeworth: In any case, the person you wished to deliver a present unto was most certainly this! Lang: Heh, interesting tastes you have there, Mr. Suspect. Larry: D-D-Don't spread lies about me! I totally didn't want to see Ms. Oldbag so much that I'd try to go down a chimney! Owww! Franziska: I advise you to stop right there in your bashing of a lady. Edgeworth: Well, I must admit that I, myself, hardly ever have the want to run into that lady. However... what if you were misinformed, and under the wrong impression? Then what? Lang: Define \"wrong impression\". Edgeworth: I simply mean that the man before you thought to enter the old lady's room... ...without knowing one very important fact. And that fact... is best summed up with this! Edgeworth: This is something the old lady received from her employer for the night. The girl who normally plays the Pink Princess... Mindy, was it again? It seems that this man is quite taken with that actress. Larry: Larry: But that's not true, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...? Larry: She's the one with the hots for me! I just know it! I can feel her sexy beam piercing my heart when she's watching me! Seeeeeexy beam, I tell you! Franziska: You filthy, despicable, inconsiderate, fickle, idiotic, cowardly... ...apparition of a man! You haven't matured at all since we last met! Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: Yes? Lang: This guy... He's got bigger problems than just getting involved in murders, I take it? Edgeworth: I suppose you could put it that way. Larry: Hey! What the heck, man!? I don't get you guys at all! Why do you all have to make me out to be some sort of bad guy!? Edgeworth: To return to the original topic, I propose that at least this much has been made clear. Without any knowledge that Ms. Mindy had fallen ill... ...Larry tried to make his way into the Pink Princess's room. That much we know for sure! Larry: Larry: Hey, Edgey... Looks like I've got the hang of this court thing now. Edgeworth: But we're not in court at the moment... Larry: Shut up! I see what's going on here, and it looks just like what you do in court! Lang: I guess old boy here still has something he'd like to say. Lang Zi says: \"Until the root of the tongue dries, one never knows the whole truth.\" You shouldn't form conclusions until everything is out in the open, which is why I'll listen. Larry: Alright! Then get ready to listen to me defeat Edgey in a battle of wits! Edgeworth: (Larry, have you forgotten that should I \"lose\", your victory prize will be your arrest?) Larry: So you think that all I wanted to do was to go visit Mindy? Well, I dressed up as Santa and climbed up to the chimney, but the smoke was really thick. It was a case of mistaken identity, and that mistake made me late for the speech. Then, to top it all off, I became a suspect in a murder. THAT'S what you really meant. But why would I ever put myself through so much humiliation on purpose!? Edgeworth: .................. Lang: .................. Larry: ..................Hey! Someone say something! Edgeworth: Larry, are you seriously trying to submit this, not as a confession, but as testimony? Larry: So what if I am!? Is there something wrong with that!? My claim is a claim claiming my claim. Do you have a problem with that!? Oldbag: So it was you! You're my stalker! But I should warn you, it doesn't matter what kind of flattery you throw at me. I'm the devoted type of woman who's wholly focused on one man, and one man only! And as long as Edgey-poo is alive, I can't just drop him and be unfaithful! No, I can't! Although, earlier, I was tempted just a tiny-winy bit by that wolf-man! But that was just a test of my love for my dear Edgey-poo, which I passed with flying colors! But from now on, I will stay completely true to my beloved Edgey-poo for the rest of eternity! I swear it! Larry: Aaaaah! I-I'm so inspired! Franziska: You're such an inconsiderate, cowardly, idiotic, and all-around completely worthless man! Edgeworth: (I thought I heard something ominous just now, but perhaps it was just my imagination.) I believe there is nothing further for me to prove at this point... Larry: What do you mean!? Of course you've still got something to prove! You still have to show some proof that I was trying to meet up with Mindy! Edgeworth: \"Proof\", you say? Larry: Remember, Edgey!? Everything is evidence in court, right!? Edgeworth: You mean, \"Evidence is everything in court,\" Larry, but I understand your point. Larry: Yeah, see! I'm totally a pro at this now! Edgeworth: Very well. If you wish to see the evidence... ...then let me show you the last piece of evidence you'll ever wish to see. Larry: So you think that all I wanted to do was to go visit Mindy? Larry: Well, I dressed up as Santa and climbed up to the chimney, but the smoke was really thick. Larry: It was a case of mistaken identity, and that mistake made me late for the speech. Larry: Then, to top it all off, I became a suspect in a murder. THAT'S what you really meant. Larry: But why would I ever put myself through so much humiliation on purpose!? Edgeworth: (This whole testimony is one giant confession of all that he's done tonight. He's practically begging me to show why he bothered to put himself through all of this.) Edgeworth: Larry, don't even think about denying that you have knowledge of this letter. Larry: H-H-H-H-H-Hey! Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Why are you showing that thing to me!? Franziska: \"W\u00e9ndy, I'll be descending on you from above tonight. Your loving knight\" Well, isn't that just romantic? Edgeworth: But you weren't able to \"descend on her from above\", were you... Mr. Loving Knight? Larry: Aaaaaaaaaaaarghn! I-I have no idea what you're talking about! I don't remember a thing! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You can pretend to be ignorant all you'd like, but it's written right here. This letter proves that you were not out to meet the old lady... ...but rather, that you were attempting to pay Ms. Mindy a visit! (What part of this letter shows that the person Larry had intended to meet was Mindy?) Edgeworth: Larry, I suggest you take up penmanship lessons. That is... ...if you never wish to experience this level of embarrassment ever again. Larry: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the heck!? What are you talking about!? Speak English! Edgeworth: You wrote \"Mindy\" so sloppily that it became \"W\u00e9ndy\" to the average eye. Larry: ...Hey, stop picking on me... It's so embarrassiiiiiiiiiing! Lang: There, there. Isn't that what childhood friends are for? They're the best, aren't they? ...For punching. But that will have to wait until we're off of this crime scene. Larry: Eek! Edgey! Save me from the scary man! Edgeworth: Sure, if you're willing to make amends. Starting with your incredibly embarrassing mistake! Larry: .........That... That... That wasn't me! Edgeworth: Come again? Larry: It's a fake! Someone's out to get me, so they made that fake letter... ...to set me uuuuuuuuup! Franziska: Accept your defeat graciously! Larry: But... you guys are being so mean... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Penmanship analysis. Larry: What's that? Edgeworth: No matter who, all people have certain unique features to their handwriting. Ergo, all we have to do is compare the handwriting in this letter to a sample of yours... ...and we'll know soon enough who it was that sent this letter. Larry: I...I...I... I'll never write another thing in my life! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Tsk, tsk, tsk... It's no use, Mr. Loving Knight. For you've already graciously provided me with a sample of your handwriting! Edgeworth: This autograph and our mysterious letter... If we compare the handwriting, we'll know the answer to our questions soon enough. Larry: Gnn...nnn... Nnnnnnnn...! Edgeworth: Confess now, Larry... to your miserable failure! Larry: I...I'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorry! I... I... I did it... It was me causing trouble again... I admit it. You hit the nail right on the head... Edgey... Edgeworth: (So, he finally confesses...) Larry: I saw the Pink Princess being carried around in a stretcher, and got worried, alright!? I wanted to go into Mindy's room, but the doctors wouldn't let me in. So what choice did I have!? It was the chimney or bust, Edgey! Franziska: Your mind jumped from the door to the chimney? What a criminally overactive imagination. Larry: Well, at least I was honest and wrote Mindy a letter, and stuck it under the door. That way, she wouldn't be so shocked when I came down through the chimney! Edgeworth: (Except for the fact that the letter was an utter failure at conveying said sentiment...) Larry: I'm really, really sorry... Edgeworth: Larry, you may be a shameful, good-for-nothing blight on the face of humanity... ...however, I always knew you weren't the killer. I told you to trust me... ...because, at the very least, I can attest to that about you. Larry: Edgey... You're... Aaaack! Franziska: We've lost a lot of valuable time because of you...! Larry: Owwwwwwwww! Franziska: In any case, I believe we can say that we now know exactly what happened. Mr. Larry Butz sought to climb down the chimney... ...not for access to the crime scene... ...but to enter the room of the elderly lady next door. Lang: Lang: Great job, Mr. Prosecutor. Although, I still find it a bit unbelievable that the two of you are friends. Edgeworth: .................. Lang: But the suspicion on that guy over there... ...isn't completely resolved yet, so don't get any funny ideas about running off, OK? Larry: Owwwww...w? H-Hey... What--? Edgey... What does the wolf-man mean when he says I'm not off the hook yet? Edgeworth: .........He means the murder weapon. Larry, did you forget? There are two layers of suspicion hanging over your head. Lang: That's exactly what I mean. We can't only rely on the words of the suspect, after all. We may have figured out where he was and what he was doing all night... ...but the blood-stained Samurai Sword that was left at the crime scene... As long as there is no satisfactory explanation for that... ...this wolf will refuse to ease up on his bite! Larry: Eeeeeek! Edgey! That guy... He looks like he's seriously about to take a bite out of me! Edgeworth: I'm well aware. And you should be as well, that this upcoming battle will be crucial. Lang: Thanks to the cooperation of our lovely bumbler... ...I've been dealt a very nice hand, and a sweet trump card. Looks like we're about to enter the final bout! Now, Mr. Prosecutor! Let's see what you've got! Edgeworth: (I can easily point out the contradiction in the supposed \"murder weapon\"... ...but the real problem for me is figuring out what the real murder weapon is. This will be a high-stakes gamble! But this is one game I can't afford to lose!) Lang: I was the one who found the body of the victim, DeMasque II. Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood. It was supposed to be in the Steel Samurai's dressing room, but I found it here instead. Plus, I found the murder weapon's owner, the suspect, Larry Butz in here, too. Edgeworth: Isn't it a bit far-fetched to accuse someone simply on the basis of ownership? Lang: But this owner wanted to sneak onto the crime scene. I think that's plenty to go on, don't you? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you're alluding to his reason for being by the chimney, we've already established that! Lang: Lang: Hold on there, Mr. Prosecutor. You two are long-time friends, right? Who's to say you didn't fabricate the evidence to give him an alibi? Edgeworth: .........You're accusing me of fabricating evidence? Lang: You think I can believe anything you produce? Forging evidence is all you prosecutors do! Edgeworth: .........! (This man has some serious issues with prosecutors...) Larry: But come on, I can't think up something as complicated as that! Right, Edgey!? Edgeworth: Larry, I can agree because I know you and your personality well. However, Agent Lang knows nothing about you... or me, for that matter. (I sense his hatred for my entire profession emanating from his entire being. Meaning that the only way I can prove Larry's innocence is to present irrefutable evidence.) Lang: I was the one who found the body of the victim, DeMasque II. Lang: Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood. Lang: Beside him was the Samurai Sword... covered in the victim's blood. Lang: I suspect he beat the victim to death with that thing. Lang: It was supposed to be in the Steel Samurai's dressing room, but I found it here instead. Lang: Plus, I found the murder weapon's owner, the suspect, Larry Butz in here, too. Edgeworth: (It's simply not possible that the Samurai Sword is the real murder weapon. So I should focus on proving that point to Agent Lang first.) Edgeworth: Do you know what this is, Agent Lang? Lang: Heh, it's a long spear, right? We used to use those a lot in my country a long time ago. Piercing, mowing people down... Spears are the weapon of heroes throughout history. Franziska: It's the next most effective weapon after the whip. Edgeworth: (I think the whip is in a slightly different category...) Lang: So, what's your point? Are you going to tell me that the spear is the real weapon? Edgeworth: No. I simply want you to take a look at this section here. Lang: The way it's bent...? Edgeworth: Precisely. Apparently, a certain troublemaker hit it against a wall in this embassy earlier. And as you can clearly see, the insides of the Steel Samurai's weapons are hollow. In other words, they're replicas that aren't strong enough to deliver a damaging blow... ...let alone the multiple strikes necessary to bludgeon someone to death. And yet, there is not even a dent in the Samurai Sword. How do you explain that!? Lang: A...Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Larry: Oh, yeah... The sword and the spear are made of the same stuff, so they bend easily! But I wish they'd make them out of better stuff! Because the spear got bent... ...I wasn't able to do my special \"Early Summer Rain Jab!\" move! Man, I got such an earful from the director of the play for not doing it in the show! Edgeworth: (The Steel Samurai's special move was changed tonight because of him...!?) Samurai Spear data updated in my Organizer. Larry: Yeoooooooooowch! Franziska: That's more than enough of your whiny whimpering! Now... back on the topic of the spear. Edgeworth: Yes, let's return to the real topic of discussion. (This is where the real gamble begins. I don't have a real strategy, per se... ...so all I can do for now is let the chips fall where they may.) Franziska: Using guesswork and taking risks in place of real logic is hardly the Von Karma way. It's neither smart nor very clever. Edgeworth: Ms. von Karma, as you know, unlike your father, I am not a genius prosecutor. Plus, I doubt his record of a 40-year win streak will ever be broken. Franziska: .................. Edgeworth: But perhaps, it is for the best if it remains unbroken. For no one should've conceived of the notion to \"convict all defendants\" in the first place! Franziska: Franziska: What a foolishly foolish statement from a foolish fool who hates to lose... It's the job of a prosecutor to make sure that all defendants are found guilty in court. There is nothing more important in this world than a perfect victory! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That may be your opinion, however, I don't believe that's all we are. Lang: .........! Edgeworth: As a prosecutor, what I pursue is not the perfect victory, but the perfect truth. And if that means that the bridge I must cross will crumble beneath my feet... ...then let it crumble as I walk on towards the truth! Lang: Lang: You're good at keeping me entertained, Mr. Prosecutor! But you know... humans are delicate creatures. The slightest bump and we expire. I'd like you to consider, if you will, the possibility that... ...the sword was used in such a way that the attack killed DeMasque II without bending it. Edgeworth: .................. Lang: So, what do you think of my hypothetical scenario? I think you know what to do here, right? And what you need! Edgeworth: Of course. (What I need is evidence even he (changed from [Agent Lang] in the original release) can't refute! This is it! It's time to bring this to a close!) Lang: It's possible to use the Samurai Sword to kill someone. And under these circumstances, it's the only logical conclusion. We searched the Embassy, top to bottom, but the victim's blood is only on that weapon. So isn't it only natural that suspicion would fall onto the owner of said weapon? Edgeworth: How long do you intend to cling onto that preposterous theory? Lang: As long as I want, because we examined every corner within the walls of this Embassy. There's no stone we've left unturned! And we have managed to come up with only one logical conclusion! That the only place inside this embassy with the victim's blood on it is this sword. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You left no stone unturned? Is that a fact? Lang: Lang: If you've got something to say, then say it in the only way I respect, Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: Yes, of course. In that case, allow me to make it all crystal clear for you! Lang: It's possible to use the Samurai Sword to kill someone. Lang: And under these circumstances, it's the only logical conclusion. Lang: We searched the Embassy, top to bottom, but the victim's blood is only on that weapon. Lang: So isn't it only natural that suspicion would fall onto the owner of said weapon? Edgeworth: ...I can prove to you... the possibility that the murder weapon is something else... ...but I cannot do so on my strength alone. Franziska: Franziska: Miles Edgeworth. What are you running straight into a quagmire for? I thought you said that you were busy in pursuit of the perfect truth. And if that's the case, then show me this perfect truth, if it exists at all! Edgeworth: Don't worry. Thanks to you, I've already prepared myself to do just that. Franziska: There's no need to thank me. I'm simply doing what any good superior would. Edgeworth: Heh... I suppose you are. Very well, then. I will show you the possibility of a different murder weapon. Edgeworth: If you believe that there is no other door of possibility left to open... ...then allow me to force one open for you! Lang: Lang: Hmph! And how do you plan to do that? Edgeworth: By showing you what may possibly be the real murder weapon. Lang: Lang: Ha! Ha ha ha ha! The \"real\" murder weapon? I hate to repeat myself... ...but my men have already searched every last inch of this embassy! And they've concluded that nothing else could've been used as the weapon! Knowing these facts, do you still want to press forward with your little hypothesis? Edgeworth: Of course. Because it's not possible that your men inspected everything in their investigation. Lang: Lang: What are you talking about!? I don't appreciate mind games, and I don't appreciate it when people like you slander my men! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not slandering them, I assure you! I'm merely pointing out that their investigative dragnet has a few holes in it! Namely, that there is something your men couldn't even lay a finger on. And that item is the real murder weapon! Lang: Aaaaaaaalright then! I'll play along for now! This \"real\" weapon that killed DeMasque II... What exactly is it!? Edgeworth: The real murder weapon, which not a single person has yet to touch, is this! Edgeworth: .........The national treasure of Allebahst. Lang: Lang: You mean the Primidux Statue? Edgeworth: Yes, and as you know, only the ambassador and his secretariat may touch it. Which, I believe, means that neither you nor your men were able to examine it, correct? Lang: Lang: Ha... ha ha ha ha... You know very well that if we did that, there'd be an international incident... ...between the Kingdom of Allebahst and the Republic of Babahl. The two countries' precarious relationship teeters in the balance... ...over a stupid fight related to a sovereignty statue! But I'll be damned if I let something go unexamined! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang, if you could take a look at this... The direction the statue is facing just before and after the crime are different...! And there is only one conclusion I can draw from that. Lang: .................. Go look for Ambassador Alba, and get him to give us the OK to examine the statue. MIB: Shifu! You can't listen to this infidel's words! He is most definitely trying to trick you! Shifu! Please, let's be rational about this! Lang: Grr! Lang Zi says: .........Just go already! MIB: Y-Yes, sir! MIB: Shifu... Lang: Yeah? MIB: I'm really sorry, sir, but I was unable to convince the ambassador. I was unable to obtain permission for us to examine the Primidux Statue. Lang: ...Hmph. I see. Franziska: Wait...! But then, the investigation is at a standstill! Agent Lang! I will go and speak with the ambassador personally! Lang: Save your breath. He may act all weak and frail, but that old man's one tough cookie. But I guess you've gotta be tough when you're representing a whole country, you know? Edgeworth: Agent Lang... Lang: What do you want? Let's just hurry up and examine the statue already. MIB: Wh--!? But Shifu! What about causing an international incident!? Lang: Quiet! I'll take the fall if I have to later! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang, the hypothesis is mine, so if someone is to take the responsibility, let it be me! Lang: Responsibility? If we're going to talk in such heavy terms, maybe I should let you. It'd be a real problem for my men if something were to happen to me. Alright then... Less talk and more investigating! Edgeworth: (If we want to know the truth, we can't stop here! Action must be taken!) Agent Lang, I'd like to run a Luminol chemiluminescence test on the statue. Lang: A Luminol test...? Ah, good thinking. If the statue is the murder weapon, then some of the victim's blood should be on it. Okaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! Let's get the forensics team in here! Lang: Heh! Looks like you hit the jackpot, Mr. Prosecutor. I guess this means that this is the real weapon that killed DeMasque II. Edgeworth: Indeed...! Lang: But I wouldn't celebrate yet if I were you. This doesn't let your friend off the hook. It doesn't prove that he didn't kill DeMasque II, so the charge remains! Edgeworth: ...We are hardly done examining this statue, Agent Lang! Knowing that it IS the real weapon, I believe further examination is required. Lang: Hah, you think so? OK then, knock yourself out! Leads to examination of Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: ...Nngh. Lang: And what do we have here? This dirty smudge... It looks like... a handprint? Heh heh heh heh... Haaa hahahahahahaha! What's a definitive bit of evidence like you doing under here!? Looks like we've got some fingerprints to analyze! Edgeworth: Gnrk! (Worst case scenario, these prints belong to Larry... But it looks like it's too late for me to do anything about that now...!) Lang: Hey! Forensics guy! I want results on these fingerprints ASAP, you hear me!? Forensics: Agent Lang! I have the analysis results, sir! Lang: Good! And!? Forensics: Sir! About the prints we lifted from the bottom of the statue... Well, um... You know the victim of the murder in the Babahlese Embassy...? The prints belong to him, to Mr. Manny Coachen, sir! Lang: But that's--! Wh-What's going on around here!? Edgeworth: No... That's... impossible! (Each Primidux Statue can only be handled by someone of that country. But by the very fact that Mr. Coachen's fingerprints are on this one... ...it leads me to only one conclusion...!) This statue... is actually Babahl's Primidux Statue! Franziska: Impossible! It can't be...! Lang: A...! Aaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiya! Edgeworth: (Larry never once set foot on Babahlese soil, so he was free to go... However... this new piece of information only served to confuse us even further. The ringleader of a smuggling operation was killed with an Allebahstian knife in Babahl... ...and DeMasque II was killed on Allebahstian soil with Babahl's national treasure... ...and the mystery of the Great Thief Yatagarasu, who visited both countries. The pieces were there, but I had yet to see the big picture they were to form.) To be continued Edgeworth: (I've left the DeMasque II investigation to Franziska and returned to Babahl. I suppose my first order of business should be to look into Babahl's statue...) Kay: Mr. Edgewoooorth! Edgeworth: So, Kay, what's the situation? Kay: Oh, it's great! Investigating is so much fun! Edgeworth: (...In other words, they've made absolutely no progress.) Gumshoe: W-We weren't goofing off! Honest, sir! We've been investigating our hearts out! Edgeworth: Very well, then. Would you care to give me an update on your investigation? Gumshoe: ...Ummmmm... Oh! We've had a really fun time, sir! Edgeworth: (I knew it. Zero progress...) In any case, Detective Gumshoe... Gumshoe: Yes, sir? Edgeworth: You have permission to enter the Allebahstian Embassy, is that correct? Gumshoe: Yup! As a local detective, I'm helping out with investigations on both sides, sir! Edgeworth: Good. In that case, I can leave these... pieces of evidence with you. They belong to the lady under the Pink Princess's mask. Gumshoe: The Pink Princess? What kind of lady was playing her, sir? Edgeworth: The kind that was also playing the role of the Pink Badger yesterday. Gumshoe: Ugh! Ooonnngh... Understood, sir... If I happen to run into her, I'll give them back to her. And if I don't... then I guess I'll unload them somewhere... Edgeworth: (He doesn't seem all that enthused to go find her, but I can't blame him.) Evidence that has lost their value given to Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: Now then, I don't believe I'll be needing this anymore either. Kay: Whaaaat!? Are you really going to throw that autograph away!? Edgeworth: Yes, because that Steel Samurai was a fake. Steel Samurai's Autograph scrunched up into a ball and disposed of. Kay: Wait, what? What do you mean by \"fake\"? Edgeworth: (Now then, I believe it's time for a little housekeeping.) Unnecessary evidence has been removed. Remaining evidence has been re-arranged. After clearing Talk option with Dick Gumshoe and presenting Babahl's Primidux Statue or Allebahst's Primidux Statue to Colias Palaeno: Kay: Hey, where are you going? Are you heading back to Allebahst? Edgeworth: Yes, but before I do, I suppose I should give you a summary of what's happened. Kay: ...Oh, I see. So there's been a murder in both countries using an object from the other country...? Edgeworth: That's the gist of it. Babahl is just as strict as Allebahst... ...in their inspection of the people and things that enter their country. Meaning that somehow, both murder weapons were smuggled into the two countries. That's the only logical conclusion that can be drawn. Perhaps the key to the weapon smuggling is the person who traversed both countries... Kay: You mean the fake Yatagarasu!? Edgeworth: In one way or another, the Yatagarasu is connected... Of this I am sure! Now then, where was the Yatagarasu first spotted? Palaeno: I believe it was the rose garden on the Allebahstian side of the embassy. The garden is just on the other side of this boundary. It's where Ambassador Alba was to give a speech tonight. At least, that's where I heard the Yatagarasu had appeared. Edgeworth: In that case, I believe it's vital that I investigate the rose garden posthaste. Kay: Wait, before you go... Take a look at this, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What... is it? Kay: My guess is that it's a guitar pick. I picked it up just now over there. Do you think it'll be of any use? Edgeworth: (There is a little water on it... but how did the water get on it? It doesn't look like there's anything it could get wet from around here...) Kay: I was thinking, they have concerts here at this open-air stage from time to time, right? Edgeworth: Alright, I'll find its owner later... Pick data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Oh, yeah! There's one more thing... Mr. Edgeworth, would you be willing to hold onto this? Edgeworth: What is this? Kay: It's Ms. Yew's perfume. It's the bottle that woman left behind and that I found seven years ago. I thought that one day, it'd be of some use in tracking her down... ...so I kept it safe all this time. Edgeworth: Thank you. I'd be honored to hold onto it for you. Ms. Yew's Perfume data jotted down in my Organizer. Theatrum Neutralis Open-air stage (before approaching door on left side in Theatrum Neutralis) ???: I see you're back, Miles Edgeworth. How are things in Babahl? Although, I can't really say I expect much from Scruffy and that girl. Edgeworth: The investigation into Manny Coachen's death hasn't really progressed any... ...however, the investigation into the Yatagarasu has. Franziska: Ah, yes, the Yatagarasu. Even now, I find it hard to believe. A person who can freely traverse between the two countries at will? Preposterous. Edgeworth: Well, that's what I came here to investigate. I heard that this is where witnesses claim to have seen the Yatagarasu. Franziska: That's correct. Ambassador Alba was to give a speech tonight here in Allebahst. And that's when the Yatagarasu appeared. The shadow of the mysterious thief appeared, and just as suddenly, it vanished... After that, there was the fire at the Babahlese Embassy that the Yatagarasu started. Edgeworth: (I vow that not a single feather from the Yatagarasu shall escape my diligence!) After clearing Talk option with Shi-Long Lang and examining statue of man, pool, and statue of woman: Edgeworth: The suddenly appearing and disappearing shadow of the Yatagarasu... I believe I've figured out its true origin. Franziska: I expected no less from my subordinate. Now, let's hear what you know on the subject. What really cast the shadow of the Yatagarasu? Edgeworth: The suddenly appearing and disappearing shadow of the Yatagarasu... Is it not possible that it was created by this statue? Franziska: Franziska: Are you playing me for a fool, Miles Edgeworth!? This statue bears absolutely no resemblance to the shadow of the Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: You are correct, however, this statue is but one part of the whole picture. Franziska: What do you mean by \"only one part\"...? Edgeworth: What is the other part to the real form of the Yatagarasu's shadow? Franziska: It's... another statue? Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu's shadow was made from the shadows of these two statues. Franziska: Made? What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: Right now, the spotlights are all over the place. This is because they were moved when the guests were in a panicked state. However, if we were to restore the lights to where they were when the thief appeared... Franziska: You believe that the two shadows will create the Yatagarasu's shadow? Edgeworth: Precisely. Now then, watch as I reveal the true form of the Yatagarasu! First, if we set up a spotlight to cast a shadow of \"King Primidux and the Battlefield\"... ...the shadow of the king's statue would appear on the backdrop of the stage. Likewise, if we set a light up on \"The Queen Who Spoke of Love To King Primidux\"... ...her silhouette would also appear on the backdrop to the stage. Franziska: Aha! So if we were to combine the two shadows...! Franziska: ............ It looks nothing like the Yatagarasu's shadow! Miles Edgeworth! How do you explain this grotesque shape!? Edgeworth: C-Calm down, Franziska! The way the light needs to be shone on the queen's statue is wrong... Franziska: What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: I believe that the whole of the king's shadow needs to be used for this to work. However, in the case of the queen, I don't believe her whole shadow is needed. Rather, the person who created the shadow only used one part of her shadow. Franziska: Only one part? Edgeworth: Yes, and that one part alone is enough to fill in the rest of the Yatagarasu's shadow. Franziska: Why didn't you say that in the first place!? Edgeworth: You're right. I-I apologize... Franziska: Now, what part of the queen's statue was used to complete the Yatagarasu's shadow? Edgeworth: Think back to what is missing in our shadow. Five long, thin areas, correct? Now, what does that remind you of? Franziska: Ah! Edgeworth: That's right. It can only be the shadow of the queen's left hand. Franziska, can we please adjust the spotlight's position... ...so that it only shines on the queen's left hand? Franziska: Alright. Let's give it a try and see what we get. Franziska: It's...! Lang: Hmph... Yeah, this is exactly like the shadow I saw. Edgeworth: The culprit must've changed the spotlights' positioning beforehand... ...and then pulled the plug after people saw what the culprit wanted them to see. In their panic, the guests must have moved the spotlights around... ...which we can assume was also a part of the culprit's plan. By the time the lights came back on, the Yatagarasu's shadow had vanished. Franziska: Which means that the shadow was a construct from the very beginning. Edgeworth: So you see, the Yatagarasu never did visit Allebahst tonight. The only country that thief visited was Babahl, although it can be assumed... ...that the Yatagarasu had an accomplice in Allebahst. Franziska: An accomplice? But who...? Edgeworth: I haven't figured that out yet, but I assume it was the person who set up the shadow show. (I sense that the biggest clue yet to solving this case is the existence of this accomplice!) ???: .........How's the investigation going? Edgeworth: Detective Badd, have you come to join us in investigating the Yatagarasu? Badd: I've left the murder... in Agent Lang's charge... And my only target... from the very beginning is the Yatagarasu... so yes... Edgeworth: So... what have you found out? Badd: ...I got a piece of evidence. Edgeworth: May I see it...? Badd: ...Sure, but you might regret it... Franziska: We're here because we are ready to face whatever may come. ...So if you please. Badd: ...When people heard the commotion, bystanders... started gathering. And one woman... claimed, \"I'm tellin' ya I'm a genuine international journalist!\"... She gave me... an interesting picture. Edgeworth: A journalist...? Badd: Well, actually... she's a freelance... cameraman. This... is the photo I got from her. Edgeworth: Wh-What in the world!? Franziska: The Yatagarasu... is flying through the air...! Badd: ...The times, they are a-changing... It's... not just man... ...but evidence... even they lie to us now... Edgeworth: Wh-When was this photo taken? Badd: ...Apparently, right after the fires... on the fourth and fifth floors were put out... It was taken... from a near-by building... that you can see the embassy from. Edgeworth: I see. So this was taken after the fire... Photo of Yatagarasu data jotted down in my Organizer. Badd: The blur in this picture... took off from the Babahlese Embassy... ...flew over the boundary... and headed for the Embassy of Allebahst... Franziska: Franziska: This is simply not possible! People are incapable of flight! Edgeworth: Is that a fact? I've had the \"pleasure\" of dealing with a case involving a \"flying person\" once. Franziska: .............................. Actually, come to think of it, I've come across a case like that as well. Two, actually. Badd: ...Maybe it happens more often than we think... Edgeworth: (Am I up to the task of solving the mystery behind this photograph? Well, the Yatagarasu took off from the Babahlese Embassy, so I should start from there.) Franziska, I need to return to the Babahl investigation for a bit. Franziska: ...Alright. Theatrum Neutralis Kay: Welcome back, Mr. Edgeworth! Now come on! Let's get back to our investigation! Edgeworth: Yes, let's. Rose Garden Franziska: I see you're back. Well, let's continue with the investigation, shall we? Edgeworth: Yes, let's. Kay: To think, after all that running around, we're right back where we started. Edgeworth: It would appear that way... Palaeno: Hi, Mr. Edgeworth. Have you found Manny's killer yet? Edgeworth: I'm terribly sorry, Ambassador Palaeno, but I have yet to find his killer. Palaeno: Then I guess his murder... really was the work of the Yatagarasu... Kay: Let's get one thing straight. It was the work of the FAKE Yatagarasu. The real Yatagarasu is a noble vigilante who is only out to steal the truth... Palaeno: Ms. Faraday... Please don't make such a sad face. If there's anything I can do for you, all you have to do is ask, alright? Kay: Mr. Palaeno... Edgeworth: Actually, there is one thing you can do. Will you allow us to take another look around? We didn't have enough time to conduct a thorough investigation earlier. Palaeno: Oh, sure! Please feel free to investigate to your heart's content. Edgeworth: Also, there are a few questions I'd like to ask you personally, Ambassador. Palaeno: If it will bring a smile back to Ms. Faraday's face, then I'll gladly answer anything. Kay: Thank you, Mr. Palaeno! You're a total gentleman! Palaeno: Ha ha ha. You don't have to waste such nice words on me, little miss! Kay: Hey, Sir Palaeno! Edgeworth: (...Those two sure got chummy awfully quickly.) Kay: You know, it's easy to say we're going to investigate, but where should we begin? Edgeworth: We should probably start by comparing the state of this room before and after the fire. And then, we should look into the matter of the suspicious person you spotted. Kay: Yeah. When I came into this room, that person was already gone. But I'm willing to bet that the person I was chasing is Mr. Coachen's killer. Edgeworth: We don't know that yet; however, it's hard to believe that person is unrelated. Furthermore, because the key the Yatagarasu stole seven years ago was found here... ...it signals that perhaps Ms. Yew is also somehow involved. Kay: I knew it! That woman is almost definitely Mr. Coachen's killer! Edgeworth: Yet again, we don't know that! (There are too many mysteries to be solved here (changed from [in this case] in the original release).) Speaking of the Yatagarasu and mysteries... ...I received a most mysterious photo from Detective Badd. Kay: Uncle Badd!? He's taking part in the investigation, too!? Edgeworth: Yes. He has been chasing after the Yatagarasu for all these years. Kay: Uncle Badd......... Edgeworth: Now then, I was told that this photo was taken just after the fire... Kay: Wh-What--!? This kinda looks like the person in the long coat I was chasing...! Does this mean... that I was chasing the fake Yatagarasu after all? Edgeworth: I don't know the answer to your question, but I don't think people can fly either... Kay: But this could be how that person escaped! Edgeworth: Well, we'll need to investigate a bit more before we can say anything about that. In any case, let's not dawdle any more and pick up our investigation where we left off. After clearing all Talk options with Colias Palaeno: Gumshoe: Oh! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe, have you collected the information that I requested? Gumshoe: Yup! Got it all right here, sir! Here you go, Kay. Feel free to take a look! It's for you, after all. Kay: What is all this, Gummy...? Gumshoe: It's all the information on this room that I got from the Embassy and Interpol people. Now we know exactly how this room was before and after the fire! Edgeworth: Good work, Detective. Gumshoe: Aww, it was nothing, sir! I'm an expert at getting people to talk! Kay: Wow... You two remind me so much of my father and Uncle Badd... Edgeworth: What do you mean? Kay: As prosecutor and detective, your dynamic is just like theirs back in the day. Edgeworth: ......... Kay: Well, don't you worry! I'm going to find my own wonderful partner someday! And when I do, I'm going to become a good Yatagarasu, just like my father, right? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Please don't ask me questions to which I have no answers to, Kay. However, I can say that is truly a wonderful thing to find a partner you can trust. Kay: Heh heh, you bet! So, what now, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Well... I'd like to ask you for a favor. Kay: Yes? Edgeworth: That gadget... Mr. Thief, is it? That thing you call your secret weapon. Kay: Oh, you mean \"Little Thief\"! Heh, you're coming to rely on it, aren't you? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I-I don't need a crutch like that! I'm only asking because I need it for the investigation! From the information Detective Gumshoe gathered, and the ambassador's testimony... ...I'd like you to please re-create this room as it was during the third floor fire. Kay: You got it! Alright, here we go! Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! Now, witness the true power of a real, modern-day Robin Hood! Edgeworth: It seems there are other things besides what the ambassador mentioned that have changed. It's possible that we might find the escape route the person Kay saw used as well. Palaeno: Oooh! Wh-What is this? Is it some sort of light show I was not told about? Kay: This is the power of a true vigilante! It's re-creating the room with the info I inputted! Palaeno: Really!? That is certainly one interesting device you have there, Ms. Faraday! Edgeworth: Ahem. I believe it's about time we returned to our investigation. After examining flames: Edgeworth: These must have been the large green flames Ambassador Palaeno saw. Kay: With flames like these, it's no wonder he couldn't get in! Edgeworth: Kay, by the time you came into this room, had the fire already been put out? Kay: Yeah, the fire had died out or something by that time. Edgeworth: Then this fire in here only burned from the time the fire started on the third floor... ...until the Yatagarasu appeared and caused a stir in Babahl, I suppose. Kay: I guess Mr. Palaeno was just lucky enough to run into this fire as it was burning, huh? Edgeworth: Yes, you could put it that way. And since you were the first to discover the body... ...we can assume that no one else entered the room until that time. No one other than the person you were chasing, of course. Kay: I knew it! That person I saw was definitely up to no good! I mean, that person could even be Mr. Coachen's killer! Edgeworth: That is very likely to be the case. After all, that person came into this room before you... ...and must have chosen this room precisely because they knew no one would be in here. Kay: OK, then maybe the green fire was where it was to prevent anyone from coming in? But then, what did the person set on fire to make the green flames? Edgeworth: Hmm... Well, whatever it is that person burned, it made a rather sizable fire. Kay: And since the fire's green... well, we've seen something that burns green, right!? It's a bit tinier than these flames, but you get what I mean. Edgeworth: Yes, and I do believe that what you are thinking is exactly why these flames are green. Which fire-related piece of evidence burns the same color as these green flames? Edgeworth: This silhouette lantern... Its green flame comes from the whitcrystal oil it's burning. Kay: Yeah! That's the fire I was thinking of, too! I love the green it gives off. Edgeworth: I think we've now established that the green flames were caused by whitcrystal oil. Furthermore, we know that there is only one other thing made from whitcrystal oil. Kay: Oh! You mean that thing Mr. Palaeno was mistaken about, right!? Edgeworth: Yes, precisely... as we found out earlier in our investigation. Gumshoe: Um, what? I don't get it. Can you fill me in, sir!? Edgeworth: Fine, I suppose. I'll explain it in a way that even you can understand. This is the thing made from whitcrystal oil that Ambassador Palaeno was mistaken about! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink is made from whitcrystal oil. Gumshoe: Ohhhh! So, it should burn the same color as the flames in the lantern, right!? Edgeworth: Yes, precisely. However, the green flames in this room were not from a bottle of Babahlese ink. Kay: Because we found the ink Mr. Coachen used on his desk, right!? Edgeworth: Yes. However... we know that Mr. Coachen was smuggling the ink in massive quantities. Now, what do you suppose he made using all that ink? I believe what he made with that ink is the answer to what gave birth to the green flames. Kay: Oh, yeah! I'm beginning to really feel the energy coming from you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Heh... It would appear that I've finally found it, the smuggling ring's real goal!) Made of Babahlese ink, this is the source of the green flames! Edgeworth: What would consume that great of a volume of ink to make...? That would be... ...the counterfeit bills that the smuggling ring made and are circulating in Zheng Fa. Kay: You're kidding!? You're saying that it was Mr. Coachen who made the counterfeit bills...? Edgeworth: I am. I believe you could even go so far as to say that he \"stole\" Babahl's printing press. Ambassador, Mr. Coachen had permission to freely use the printing press, correct? Palaeno: Why, yes. And I do remember seeing him use it in the middle of the night... ...but never did I think he was using it for such a foul deed...! Edgeworth: Ambassador! Because of your secretary's crimes, you will need to be investigated as well! Palaeno: Ah, yes, I suppose so. We've caused a bit of trouble for a few countries, haven't we? Edgeworth: It's my duty to search out all who shielded Mr. Coachen and concealed his crime. For they are the ones who started the fire in order to destroy the evidence! Counterfeit Bills data updated in my Organizer. After clearing \"What you saw\" Talk option with Dick Gumshoe and examining grandfather clock: Edgeworth: (We've examined everything in this office, but there is one thing that bothers me. Perhaps I should ask Ambassador Palaeno about it.) Ambassador Palaeno, there is something I'd like to ask you about. Palaeno: Yes? Edgeworth: About this office, it appears, to me, to be very similar to Ambassador Alba's office. For example, the location of the fireplace and the position of the grandfather clock. Palaeno: Ah, that's right. You've also paid a visit to the Allebahstian side of the embassy. Our two embassies actually used to be one. Edgeworth: (Yes, I know. Even the pamphlet mentioned that.) Palaeno: Which is why the building is bilaterally symmetrical (Bilateral symmetry - Because this used to be one embassy, offices on the two sides are symmetrical.). So no matter which room, the location of the fireplace and the like are exactly the same. Even where the art is located is the same. As my room is currently under renovation... ...we worked hard to make Manny's room look like the ambassador's office. Kay: You mean for your hand shake photo op with the Jammin' Ninja? Palaeno: Yes, that's right. I mean, what's a photo like that worth if it's not taken in the ambassador's office right? Edgeworth: (Yet another odd expression of Babahl's obsessively competitive spirit with Allebahst, I take it?) Thank you, Ambassador. That piece of information is all I needed to connect the dots. Palaeno: ? ...Connect what dots? Well, anyway, I'm glad I was able to be of some help. Edgeworth: The Allebahstian and Babahlese sides of the building are symmetrical to each other. As we know that to be a fact, then this room's fireplace may also hide a secret passageway. Kay: A secret passageway? Edgeworth: In Allebahst, the fireplace turned out to have a revolving back wall. Kay: A revolving wall!? It sounds like something out of a ninja house! Gumshoe: Wow, there was a trick like that built into the fireplace, sir!? Palaeno: What!? Th-This embassy holds THAT kind of secret!? Edgeworth: There seems to be a lot about this room that you don't know about, Ambassador... Palaeno: I guess it's time to pay the bill for letting Manny do so much work for me. Please, I really want to know about the real Manny and what you know about this room. Kay: What are you waiting for, Mr. Edgeworth!? Let's get to the bottom of this! Edgeworth: Agreed. And my first thought is that it's likely the killer used the revolving fireplace (Revolving fireplace used? - It's possible someone used the revolving fireplace wall. I need to examine it more.). Kay: It looks like just another fireplace, though, doesn't it? So, how do you turn it again? Edgeworth: In Allebahst, I had to push where the X was on the far wall of the fireplace. Gumshoe: Oh! I see an X back there, sir! Let's see what happens when I push it... Edgeworth: Gumshoe: Aaaaah! You scared me, sir! Edgeworth: There is something about this fireplace that lies in contradiction to the facts. Kay: Huh? But we found an X where you thought there'd be one, right? Edgeworth: We did, but that's not what I was referring to. Something is missing from this scene. (What does this contradiction mean for us...?) Leads to examination of fireplace Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, you said that you burned some old files in this fireplace today, correct? Palaeno: Yes, I burned quite a few files this morning, actually. Edgeworth: And after you did, you forgot to clean out the ashes from the fireplace, correct? Palaeno: Th-That's right. But why are you asking? And why are you making such a scary face...? Edgeworth: I'm sorry, I admit I am a bit intimidating when I'm serious. ...In any case! Take a good look at this fireplace, and tell me what you find odd about it. Palaeno: Let's see... Huh? Where did all the ashes go...? (Missing ashes - The ashes that should still be in the fireplace are missing. Where did they go...?) Kay: What is the meaning of this, Mr. Edgeworth!? Gumshoe: You don't really think... that Ambassador Palaeno is lying, do you? Edgeworth: No, there is no reason for him to lie. And I don't believe his testimony is wrong, either. It is the fireplace that is causing the contradiction. Kay, I wonder if you might update the fireplace data for me. Kay: You got it! I'll add in the ashes from the burnt files and... Kay: Sounds like we've pretty much figured everything out now, huh!? Edgeworth: Hmph... Well, it was nothing. All I did was follow where our leads led us. Kay: Oh, I sense it coming on! You're about to dazzle us again, right!? Gumshoe: Oh, you mean that!? Well, it's what Mr. Edgeworth is known for, you know! Edgeworth: ...There is really no need for you two to dance around the name of what I'm about to do. Edgeworth: The reason as to why the ashes are missing is simple. Kay: It's not because someone cleaned them up, right? Edgeworth: No, because even if someone did sweep them up, the fireplace is too clean for that. Ambassador Palaeno said that he spilled some Babahlese ink while he was burning the files. And yet, there is not a trace of the spilled ink on the back wall anywhere! Kay: Well then, I don't know what happened. Edgeworth: Well, I'll tell you what happened. The two sides were switched. By using the revolving fireplace wall, the ashes were moved into the neighboring room. Which means that this is a clear indication that the fireplace was used! Revolving Fireplace Wall data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Then, you mean... the person I was chasing... ...disappeared from this room through there...? Edgeworth: Yes, I believe the person you were in pursuit of is Mr. Coachen's killer. And after committing the murder, escaped through the fireplace (Escaped through revolving fireplace - The person Kay was chasing used the fireplace to escape into the room next door.)! Kay: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth! You figured out the killer's escape route! Edgeworth: (I have, but this is only the beginning. Now we have to chase the killer down!) Edgeworth: If the killer used the fireplace in this room to escape into the next... ...then it's only logical for us to \"talk\" with the person who was in the neighboring room. Gumshoe: Well, the person that was in the next room was... Oh! It was that person, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, Detective... Agent Shih-na. Kay: It's looking more and more like Ms. Shih-na is the killer, isn't it? Edgeworth: Let's not jump to conclusions yet. We need to go through what we know so far. She came running straight into this room from the next one, and instantly accused you. Furthermore, she claimed that it could only have been you that killed Mr. Coachen. I don't have any proof yet, however, I KNOW she is hiding something from us! Kay: OK, then! Why don't we go ask Ms. Shih-na herself!? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: No, not yet. There's something that needs to be done first. ...Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Sir! Is it my turn to do something, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Yes. I have a two-part special assignment for you. First, I need you to run a handwriting analysis on DeMasque II's note. Gumshoe: OK! I'll get the lab boys on that right away! Edgeworth: Second, I want you to see if you can fit through the revolving fireplace wall. Gumshoe: R-Right now, sir!? Edgeworth: No, next decade... Of course now! We need to test our hypothesis first, don't we? Kay: Go on, Gummy! You can do it! Gumshoe: Alright. I'm gonna do this like a real man! Here I go, through the fireplace and back! Edgeworth: (You shouldn't need to psych yourself up that much for such a simple task, Detective...) Gumshoe: Wow! The wall inside the fireplace really DID turn! Kay: That's so neat! Now, I wanna try going through there, too! Palaeno: Th-There really IS a secret passageway through there... I had no idea...! Edgeworth: Hmm... It would appear that the ash really was pushed into the other room. Furthermore, the Babahlese ink you spilled, Ambassador, is there on the back wall. Gumshoe: OK, here I go, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective, I'd like you to go through there under the same conditions as the killer. Gumshoe: Huh? But there's all that ash and stuff... Edgeworth: And your point is? Now, we're short on time, so if you could please hurry on through. Gumshoe: Nngh... Y-Yes, sir... Kay: OK! So NOW we pretty much have the whole picture, right!? Edgeworth: No, not yet. There remains a few more mysteries to solve... ...such as the Yatagarasu's whereabouts, the other smuggling ring members... ...the two weapons that made it across the border, the key Ms. Yew stole 7 years ago... In fact, we haven't figured out a thing regarding how Ms. Yew is related to these embassies! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: A number of pieces connect in a very complicated way in this case... It's almost enough to make one completely mentally exhausted. Kay: What are you saying, Mr. Edgeworth!? I thought you were the one who said that it's easy if you follow the leads? Edgeworth: Hmph... Was that supposed to be an impression of me, Kay? Kay: If it's info gathering you need, Gummy and I can help with that! Then, all you'd have to do is show off your fancy-schmancy logical deductions! Edgeworth: \"Show off\"...? (Does it seem like I'm being boastful when I do that...?) Kay: Let's not over-complicate matters, OK, Mr. Edgeworth!? We've been so focused, like a laser, on only what seems strange and out of place... ...it's no wonder nothing's clicked and we haven't unlocked anything yet. But, if we think things through calmly, the answer should come to us! Edgeworth: Kay... Kay: That's the sort of thing I say to myself... ...when I'm practicing how to unlock padlocks, you know! Edgeworth: ...That is something that I hope practice doesn't make perfect, for your sake. Kay: Ha ha ha! Yay! Looks like you're back to your straight-laced self again! Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm back, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, I can see that. Good work, Detective. Gumshoe: *cough* *cough* *cough* L-Looks like you can use that fireplace like a door, sir! Kay: Are you alright, Gummy...? Gumshoe: I-I'm OK! It's just a bit of ash and dust, that's all! Edgeworth: Your jacket has gotten quite filthy. I see the hem has practically turned black. Gumshoe: Yeah, well, quite a bit of the unburned ink got on it, sir. Edgeworth: Hmm... I see. Thank you, Detective. You did a fine job. I'll even pay the cleaning bill for the trench coat. Gumshoe: What!? Oh, no, sir! I could never! This is just my old coat, sir! If it was [sic] a coat I actually cared about, then I'd get it cleaned, but, you know... Edgeworth: ...? I see. Very well, then. As you wish. Kay: So because Gummy was able to climb through the fireplace, we know it can be used, right? Edgeworth: Yes, but that's not all we learned. We actually learned one other important fact. Kay: And that is...? Edgeworth: I will have to explain it to you later. Right now, we need to deal with the handwriting analysis. Detective Gumshoe... Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I'll be back before you know it! Edgeworth: The handwriting analysis on Mr. Coachen's handwriting will take a bit of time. Let us go and wait in the Theatrum Neutralis, along with Agent Lang and Agent Shih-na! To be continued Edgeworth: Agent Lang... Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Little cubs, never do they know the real fury of the Elder wolves.\" Edgeworth: (These quotes are definitely becoming increasingly difficult to decipher...) And what does that mean? Lang: It means that you'll never really know how angry I can get. Mr. Prosecutor... The counterfeit bills made with Babahlese ink... they were all of Zheng Fa denominations. Edgeworth: Yes, so I heard from Ms. von Karma. Franziska: But we don't know where the play money has gone. Edgeworth: (They must not have figured out that it was all burned yet...) Lang: Ever since those things showed up in circulation, my country's economy has taken a big hit. Zheng Fa is in financial chaos as we speak... ...because we can't tell the difference between our own bills and the fakes! But it's not just the money; the citizens are also worried. I've staked the honor of the house of Lang on this... ...and have come to this land to capture the mastermind behind this whole mess. I investigated how the bills were made and how the ink was smuggled into Zheng Fa... ...and I pursued the smuggling ring all the way here. But tonight... this is where the final chapter was written. Despite my frantic efforts to chase the smuggler down, someone got to him first... ...and now I'm called to return home without a single answer! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, I... Lang: Don't start. It's not your fault. It's not anyone's fault, Mr. Prosecutor. Ambassador Alba, I'm sorry for all the trouble tonight. Alba: Oh, no, no. It is I who should apologize. It was all because I was not strong enough. If only I was able to think of a better solution... Quercus, you fool! Curse your empty brain! Lang: Heh, you're being too hard on yourself, Ambassador. I take full responsibility for tonight, end of story. Shih-na, let's go. Time to return to our den. Shih-na: .........Yes. Franziska: I don't like to admit it, but there's not much else for us to do but to go home as well. Edgeworth: Agent Lang! A moment, if you ???: Gumshoe: You, Wolf-man and the secretary lady! Hold it! Objection! Pal! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe...! Have you got the results of the handwriting analysis already? Gumshoe: Yup, and that note... was definitely written by Mr. Coachen, sir! Edgeworth: Hmm, just as I thought... Good work, Detective. DeMasque II's Note data updated in my Organizer. Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... How long do you intend to hold us up for? Edgeworth: Hmph... Sorry to have made you wait, but I believe that now everyone is finally here. Agent Shih-na. I'd like to ask you something, if you don't mind. Shih-na: .........Yes? Edgeworth: How exactly did you fail to see the Yatagarasu... ...when you were in the neighboring room to where Mr. Coachen was killed!? I'd like you to explain THAT to us. Lang: What...? Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! What are you doing asking her about something she didn't see? Edgeworth: (Agent Lang hasn't touched the Babahl investigation at all. So I suppose I will need to explain a few things to him first.) Franziska: Miles Edgeworth... I can't even begin to imagine what's going on in that head of yours. Edgeworth: The only thing going on in my head... is the pursuit of the truth! Franziska: Oh? It sounds like you have some sort of plan. Very well, I'll supervise you until the end. Edgeworth: (*sigh* Is she seriously going to treat me as a subordinate for the rest of the day...?) Lang: You're not trying to pick a fight with my subordinate on some flimsy guess, are you? Edgeworth: I'm not trying to \"pick a fight\" and the evidence is hardly flimsy, as you will see. Lang: Hah! I should've known... ...that you and I are destined to fight it out to the very end! Edgeworth: It would appear that way. Lang: Well, I'll prove her innocence, so let's see what you've got, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hmph... With pleasure. (For my opening argument, I'll discuss the Yatagarasu that appeared in Babahl... ...and establish exactly who it was that Kay saw.) Agent Lang. I assume you've been briefed on Kay's testimony? Lang: You mean the \"suspicious person in a coat\" that she saw? Edgeworth: That's right. That person is one of the keys to solving this case. The person who pretended to be the Yatagarasu! Lang: \"Pretended\"? And what do you mean by that!? Edgeworth: I'll get to that in a second. But first, I want to review what Kay's mystery person did (changed from [second, but first, I want to review what this person Kay saw did] in the original release). Kay, if you could please explain for us what the person you were chasing did (changed from [what the person you were chasing did for us] in the original release)... Kay: OK! You got it! I first spotted the suspicious person near the open-air stage on the Babahlese side. I called out to the person, but as soon as I did, that person ran off. I thought it was rather suspicious, so I immediately gave chase. Edgeworth: For the sake of argument, let's call this suspicious person the Yatagarasu. Now, please tell us what happened when you chased the Yatagarasu up to the 3rd floor. Kay: Can do! I chased the Yatagarasu all the way up to the third floor of the Babahlese Embassy. It was a pretty straight chase down the hallway, until the sudden turn. The Yatagarasu disappeared around the corner, so I did my best to catch up. When I turned the corner, I saw the Yatagarasu run into Mr. Coachen's office. I gave chase and ran into the room... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the light, but then... Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Shih-na: ...Who's there!? Kay: By the time I had turned on the lights, the Yatagarasu had disappeared. Edgeworth: When Kay entered the room, the person she was chasing was already gone. Why do you suppose that was, Agent Lang? Lang: ...What do you mean, \"Why do you suppose?\" Isn't it obvious!? The person slipped out through the door behind the girl under the cover of darkness. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Sorry, but I know for a fact that the person didn't escape through that door! Lang: Oh? And how do you know that with such certainly!? Edgeworth: Hmph... That's easy. If the Yatagarasu had left through that door, they would have run right into this person! Lang: Y-Your answer is Shih-na...? Edgeworth: Yes, because let's consider what would've happened if the Yatagarasu had used the door. When Kay screamed upon discovering Mr. Coachen's body... ...the Yatagarasu would've run right into Agent Shih-na, who was in the next room over. Lang: ...Arngh! Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na. Would you mind telling us if you saw the suspicious person in question? Shih-na: .........No, I didn't see anyone. Edgeworth: You see? Therefore, the Yatagarasu could not have escaped through the door as Lang: Lang: It just means that the creep slipped out before Shih-na made it out into the hallway! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. I doubt that, as there was another person in that hallway. A certain detective. Detective Gumshoe, where were you exactly at that time? Gumshoe: M-Me, sir? Well, when I heard Kay's scream... ...I ran towards Mr. Coachen's office from the opposite direction of Agent Shih-na, sir! Edgeworth: So, Agent Lang, can YOU explain how someone could've eluded both of them!? Even you must concede that under these circumstances, the door was not a viable route! Lang: Grr...rrrnoooooooooh! Kay: Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! You nailed him with just an explanation of what happened! Edgeworth: Yes... I've eliminated one of the possible escape routes from that room. (But this is far from over. I need to make Agent Lang aware as well... ...of yet another possible escape route the Yatagarasu could've taken.) Lang: .........! Ha ha ha ha! I get it! So that's what you were trying to show me. Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... Let me guess. This is what you're trying to say, right? Because the door was not a viable escape route, then there must've been another way out! Edgeworth: Precisely. Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! It's time to bust out with our revolving fireplace wall explanation, right!? Edgeworth: No, not quite yet. Kay: Huh!? But why? I thought this would be the perfect time... Edgeworth: The revolving wall on the Babahlese side is known only to four people. And if we use this information unwisely, the truth may escape us in the end. Lang: What's with all the whispering over there? Scared I'll figure out your tactics? Edgeworth: Hmph, nothing of the sort, Agent Lang. Come, let's continue where we left off. Lang: That smug, haughty attitude of yours... You really rub me the wrong way, you know that!? ...Hmph. Well, no matter. I've figured you out already anyway. The only other possible escape route besides the door... is the room's lone window! And since an eerie picture of said escape route exists... Are you saying that this photo captures the moment of the Yatagarasu's escape!? Edgeworth: (I guess Detective Badd must have filled him in on this photo... I have to admit that at first, I thought the window to be a possible escape route as well. However, I now know that to be impossible!) Lang: Now, I realize you may not know this, but... ...humans can't fly. Edgeworth: Of course I know that! That's bloody common sense! Besides, I never said I thought that photo to be of the Yatagarasu's escape route. Lang: ...I suppose not. Alright then, explain yourself. Edgeworth: The shadow in this photo is not the Yatagarasu that Kay was chasing after. Lang: Lang: You can say whatever you'd like in whatever language you want... ...but there's only one language I really understand: the language of evidence! Edgeworth: Very well, then. I present to you, proof that the person Kay saw is not the same as the one in this photo! Edgeworth: Let me explain to you precisely why the shadow in this photo is not the Yatagarasu Kay saw. Kay spotted the Yatagarasu heading for the third floor during the second fire. However, the photo in question was taken just after the first fire! Lang: Grr...rrrnoooooooooooh! Kay: Yeah! Way to go! That's TWICE you've bit him in the butt now! Lang: Lang: We're not done yet! You still have to explain what that shadow is... ...and how the Yatagarasu escaped! I don't suppose you can answer both, can you!? Edgeworth: Regarding the photo, I admit that we don't understand what it means quite yet. Lang: Hah! As I thought. Edgeworth: However, the Yatagarasu's escape route? Now, THAT I can answer. Lang: You can? Well, then, Mr. Prosecutor, go on! Enlighten me! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Even if I explain it, you'll try to find some flaw with what I have to say. You were busy heading up the Allebahstian investigation, correct? In that case, I doubt you'd have much knowledge about the Babahlese side of the case... ...so wouldn't it be best if the lead on that side, Agent Shih-na, explained in my stead? Lang: .........Argh! Shih-na is my subordinate...! If I don't stick up for her, how can I look her in the eyes and call myself her boss...!? Shih-na: .........Lang, it's alright. I can take care of him. Lang: Shih-na. Shih-na: You've shielded me a lot as my boss... ...but it's time for me to prove my worth. Lang: ...Alright. If you're OK with it, then you have my support. Edgeworth: (Finally, it's down to just Agent Shih-na and myself. This is where the battle really begins!) Shih-na: Now then, what is it you'd like to ask? Edgeworth: Hmm, let's see... Why don't we start with your movements inside the Babahlese Embassy? Shih-na: During the first Babahlese fire, I assisted in putting out the fire. During the second fire, I was searching for the Yatagarasu that had appeared in Babahl. While I was searching, I heard a scream coming from the next room over. Although I was in the next room, I was unable to catch a glimpse of the Yatagarasu. To be honest, I'm actually very skeptical that the girl's \"Yatagarasu\" even exists. Shih-na: And that is all I have to say. Kay: But I'm not lying when I say I saw the suspicious person run into Mr. Coachen's office! Like I said earlier... ...I have no intention of retracting my testimony. Shih-na: .........Good. Edgeworth: Just to confirm, did you have a partner when you were on your investigation? Shih-na: No, I moved alone. Edgeworth: In that case, you have no one to corroborate your alibi. Is that correct? Lang: Lang: Are you calling her suspicious because she was in a room by herself!? How pathetic! Edgeworth: ...And it wasn't when Agent Shih-na tried to arrest Kay under the same rationale? Lang: ............! Edgeworth: And how about when you accused Larry because he was the weapon's owner? Lang: ............Grr! Franziska: Not that it's unexpected for that useless lump to get into such a situation. Although, I suppose it's never a good idea to let mistakes go uncorrected. Lang: I will make no excuse for what I did in that situation. Gumshoe: Then you should apologize right now for making Kay out to be the killer, pal! Lang: .........I'm sorry. Shih-na, apologize. Shih-na: ............... .........I'm sorry. Kay: I-It's really OK! I mean, I'm not under suspicion anymore! Right, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Hmph. Well, I never doubted you. Not for one second. Lang: .........And the same goes for me. I believe in Shih-na. Edgeworth: Then let's put that to the test, and see if she is really worthy of your trust. Shih-na: Heh heh... This promises to be interesting. Shih-na: During the first Babahlese fire, I assisted in putting out the fire. Shih-na: During the second fire, I was searching for the Yatagarasu that had appeared in Babahl. Shih-na: While I was searching, I heard a scream coming from the next room over. Shih-na: Although I was in the next room, I was unable to catch a glimpse of the Yatagarasu. Shih-na: To be honest, I'm actually very skeptical that the girl's \"Yatagarasu\" even exists. Edgeworth: Hmph... There seems to be a very large flaw in her testimony. Kay: Oh? Then why don't you show her using what we found out with Little Thief? Edgeworth: Heh... I will, in due time. (The escape route of the Yatagarasu that Kay was in pursuit of... If it turns out that it really does lead right to Agent Shih-na... ...then what is it that she is keeping from us right now?) Edgeworth: Being in the room next to Mr. Coachen's office is the problem with your testimony. Shih-na: .........! Lang: Lang: Mr. Prosecutor... I don't see what problem you're talking about at all! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, do you recall the secret we discovered about the Allebahstian office fireplace? Lang: Huh? Oh, you mean how it connects the office with the room next door? What about it? Edgeworth: Well... Allebahst isn't the only country with secret connecting fireplaces. Lang: Wha--!? Edgeworth: The fireplace in Mr. Coachen's office holds the exact same secret! Lang: Wh...Whaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu didn't escape through the door to the room or the window. The escape route was through the revolving fireplace wall and into the next room over! Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: Now do you see? If the Yatagarasu had escaped into the next room... ...then the thief would've run straight into Agent Shih-na! Meaning that it's impossible for her to have missed the Yatagarasu! Lang: A.........Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaa! Franziska: Wh-What is the meaning of this, Miles!? Edgeworth: Well? Would you care to explain, Agent Shih-na... ...how you managed to completely miss the fleeing Yatagarasu, or shall I? Shih-na: ............ Edgeworth: Your claim that you were in the next room was a lie all along, wasn't it? The truth is, you were the one Kay saw in the coat... ...pretending to be the Yatagarasu, and you were the one she chased after. As you tried to lose her, you ran into Mr. Coachen's office, and headed for the fireplace. Then, you shed your coat in the next room, leaving it there to emerge as \"Agent Shih-na\". After that, you came back around to place Kay under arrest. Does that sound about right? If not, then speak now or forever hold your peace. Shih-na: ............ Gumshoe: How dare you make Kay look like the bad guy when you're the suspicious one, pal!? Shih-na: .........Phwwh... Phwwwwh... Edgeworth: .........! Lang: ...Shih-na...? Shih-na: Hee... hee hee hee......... ...Hee hee hee hee hee... hee hee......... Aha! Ahaha! Ahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Edgeworth: ! (That... That laugh...!) Franziska: I remember this irritating laugh... Gumshoe: Brr... I'm getting chills down my spine...! Kay: .........It can't be... But it has to be...! Lang: Shih-na... What's wrong with you...? Shih-na: Phwwh... I'm sorry. It was so funny that I couldn't help but laugh. Edgeworth: ...\"Funny\", you say? Shih-na: Yes, that you would accuse me of being the Yatagarasu. ...The prosecutors of this country really are all so very strange. Franziska: Do you think you can get away with this by simply laughing it off!? Shih-na: Phwwh... You think I'M taking things too lightly? I think not. It's that prosecutor who is. Edgeworth: .........! Shih-na: Look, everything you said earlier is nothing more than mere speculation. The Yatagarasu fled through the fireplace? Do you have any proof to back up your claim? If you don't, then you haven't proven a thing regarding the Yatagarasu's escape route! Edgeworth: The tone of voice you're taking with me now has certainly changed. Shih-na: Heh heh... That's because it's been a while since I've had this much fun. I think I'll let loose, and then we can have a real battle of wits. Edgeworth: For an agent of Interpol to show me the true power of her mind, it is a great honor. Shih-na: Phwwwh... Don't underestimate me; I'm not some foolish broad, you know. Edgeworth: I know. And that is why I won't hold anything back either as I answer your question. Shih-na: My question...? Edgeworth: Here is your proof that the revolving fireplace wall in Babahl was used recently! Shih-na: I'm sorry, but is this really your honest answer to my question? Edgeworth: Yes. According to Ambassador Palaeno's testimony... ...he said that he was burning some documents in the fireplace with Mr. Coachen. Shih-na: ...Oh? Edgeworth: The ashes of what they burned were left in the fireplace, so they should've been there. However, when we went to investigate the room, the ashes weren't there. Shih-na: Shih-na: Why is that a problem? Maybe someone cleaned them up? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph......... Unfortunately for you, Ambassador Palaeno said that he forgot to. And so the question remains: Why were the ashes missing? ...The answer is simple. When the Yatagarasu went through the fireplace wall... ...the ashes were pushed into the next room by the wall as well! The movement of the ashes that were in Mr. Coachen's office is my proof! Shih-na: Ahah! Ahaha! Ahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Edgeworth: .........And just what is so funny!? Shih-na: Ash as proof...? Are you even allowed to submit such flakey evidence in court? Franziska: You... still wish to fight us? Shih-na: Of course. Why wouldn't I? Edgeworth: In that case, let's hear your counterargument. Shih-na: Phwwwh... My counterargument, huh? This really is just like being in court. Edgeworth: Well, to me, we're simply continuing from where we left off all those years ago. Shih-na: ...Phwwwh. I have no idea what you're talking about. Edgeworth: It doesn't matter if we're at a crime scene or in court, let's finish this here and now! Shih-na: I suppose. I've had a lot of fun today, but I grow weary of this game of cat and mouse. Edgeworth: ...! Shih-na: Let's make this the last testimony, and wrap up this absurd case once and for all! Shih-na: In my eyes, all you've proved is that the rotating fireplace wall was used... ...but you can't really call that proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace, now can you? So then, who was it that used the rotating wall? Show me your answer with real evidence. Remember, we've already finished our very thorough investigation... ...and we found not a single suspicious thing in Mr. Coachen's office. Shih-na: Phwwwh... And there you have it, my counterargument. Edgeworth: ...Arngh! (That's very... impressive. She has seen through to the fact that I have yet to gather that one piece of evidence...) Kay: ............ Gumshoe: What is it, Kay? I haven't heard a peep out of you in quite a while now. Franziska If you don't think you can handle it, feel free to leave the rest of it to us. Kay: But I...! Edgeworth: Kay... Pull yourself together. You are the true heir to the Yatagarasu name, are you not? Kay: ...! Edgeworth: If you want to steal the truth, then you must never take your eyes off of it. This chase you're running to catch the truth... you must see it through to the very end. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... You're right. I... I will see this through to the end. So...... You go get her for me, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hmph... With pleasure. Shih-na: Looks like a lack of evidence has left you wide open, doesn't it? Lang: ...Shih-na. Please... show me you're someone I can trust. Shih-na: ......... Don't worry. This will be the deciding match. You'll see. Edgeworth: (I'm truly sorry, Agent Lang, but I simply can't allow her to escape me again.) Very well then, Agent Shih-na. Shall we begin? Shih-na: Phwwh... I'm ready whenever you are. Shih-na: In my eyes, all you've proved is that the rotating fireplace wall was used... Shih-na: ...but you can't really call that proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace, now can you? Shih-na: So then, who was it that used the rotating wall? Show me your answer with real evidence. Shih-na: Remember, we've already finished our very thorough investigation... Shih-na: ...and we found not a single suspicious thing in Mr. Coachen's office. Kay: So... do you actually have any proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace passageway? Edgeworth: No, I haven't found any yet. Kay: Then what are we going to do!? Edgeworth: Hmph. There's no need to worry. Because there is a loophole in Ms. Interpol Agent's argument we can exploit first. (The one in charge of the Babahlese investigation was not Agent Lang. Which means that with Agent Shih-na in charge... ...it's possible she may have tampered with the evidence. That piece of evidence that we found... If there is one thing I DO know, it is that someone tried to hide it from us!) Edgeworth: And that this throws doubt on the purity of your investigation into the Yatagarasu! Shih-na: ...! You still suspect me, I see. Alright then, I ask that you point out what part of my investigation is incomplete. Edgeworth: (The other Interpol agents worked under the command of Agent Shih-na. And is it not possible that the reason the person Kay was chasing chose the third floor... ...was because that person knew there would be no other agents on that floor? Furthermore, we've come to see that Agent Shih-na... ...was only pretending to be investigating the Yatagarasu, to the point of arresting Kay. In that case, there is one location that no one has yet to inspect!) Your team's investigation was incomplete because they failed to inspect this location! Edgeworth: The location, Agent Shih-na, is of course, the room you claimed to have examined. I believe the room next to Mr. Coachen's office warrants a thorough inspection. Shih-na: Even if you do that, I doubt you'll find anything of use to you there. Edgeworth: Hmph. I will be the one to decide that! Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I'm on it! I'll be right back after I check out that room next to the office! Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth... Do you really think that Ms. Shih-na's the Yatagarasu? Edgeworth: ...Yes, if my logic is sound, I believe she is. Kay: Then, I'm not going to let her get away with ruining the name of the Yatagarasu! Franziska: But can you prove she's the Yatagarasu is the question. Edgeworth: If Detective Gumshoe can find what I'm hoping he will find, then I should be able to. Franziska: And just what are you hoping he'll find? Edgeworth: Let's just say this. I had Detective Gumshoe do a little experiment for me earlier. Franziska: An experiment? As if that detective has the brains for high science. Edgeworth: It wasn't that mentally taxing. I had him use the same escape route as the Yatagarasu. Franziska: And what did you find out by doing that? Edgeworth: First, that it's possible for a person to fit through the revolving wall \"door\". Second, that by going through there, his coat was covered in ash and Babahlese ink. Franziska: Who cares what his coat was covered in? It's not worth that much anyway! Edgeworth: Ah, but is it really worth so little? I believe that it's actually quite a meaningful result, the value of which I'm about to prove. Franziska: ...? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! I've found some things you really need to see, sir! Edgeworth: Oh? So what are these things that you found? Gumshoe: Ummm... Some make-up, a coat, and a pair of shoes, sir. Kay: You found a coat!? You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Maybe it's the one the person I was chasing was wearing! Edgeworth: Yes, the possibility does exist. Agent Shih-na. Were these pieces of evidence not in that room when you examined it? Shih-na: Phwwwh... Unfortunately for you, those aren't \"suspicious items\" of any sort. They all belong to me. They were getting in the way, so I stored them in that room. Gumshoe: Aww...! Shih-na: Thank you for bringing them to me. It saves me a trip. May I have them back now? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: These items that the detective brought back are incredibly significant. I request that we be allowed to examine them. Shih-na: Shih-na: They're my personal belongings, so you have no right to touch them without my permission. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I wish to examine them for the sake of the investigation. But if you wish to deny us access to them... Agent Lang, let's hear your opinion on this. Lang: I say, let them look at your stuff, Shih-na. Shih-na: Lang! Lang: Shih-na, let's put it all out in the open. If you're really innocent, then you have nothing to worry about, right? Shih-na: .........I guess so, Alright, go ahead and examine whatever you'd like. After all, I have nothing to hide. Edgeworth: Hmph... Good. Now let us begin. Gumshoe: So which of Agent Shih-na's belongings are you going to examine, sir? Edgeworth: Let's examine the coat. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: It appears you managed to stain your coat rather badly... ...Agent Shih-na. Shih-na: ............ Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu that Kay saw was wearing a coat. And I'm beginning to wonder if this stain wasn't created when you went through the fireplace. Shih-na: Ahah... No, you have it wrong. That soot probably got on my coat when I was helping the police put out the fire. Edgeworth: And what about this dark substance around the hem of your coat? Shih-na: Oh! I didn't realize that the hem was that dirty. I'm sure it's just some water mixed with soot from when I was helping with the fire. Kay: I don't think so! You think you can get away with such a transparent lie!? Gumshoe: Yeah! Don't lie to us, pal! This is the same pattern of dirt that got on my coat when I went through the fireplace! Shih-na: Shih-na: Your words ring hollow in the absence of evidence, you know. So unless you can prove that the dirt on my coat is from the fireplace... Edgeworth: Which I can. Shih-na: Wh...!? How...!? Edgeworth: You did a great job, Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Me, sir? What did I do? Edgeworth: This coat... This is exactly the piece of evidence I was searching for. I had been hoping to find the coat that the person Kay saw was wearing. And thanks to you, we proved that going through the fireplace would sully a coat. Gumshoe: I don't quite get what you're saying, but I'm happy for the praise, sir! Edgeworth: All that remains... ...is for us to show what the dark substance on the coat hem is. Shih-na: Oh? And you think you can do that? Edgeworth: Of course I can. This is the dark substance that sullied the hem of this coat! Shih-na: B-Babahlese ink? Edgeworth: Yes. This is what will prove that the coat went through that fireplace! According to Ambassador Palaeno, he burned some files in the fireplace this morning. Shih-na: You told us about that already, so I don't really see the point in mentioning it again. Edgeworth: My point is that he spilled some ink onto the back wall of the fireplace at that time. Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: If the dark substance on this coat turns out to be Babahlese ink... ...it would prove that you and this coat went through the revolving fireplace wall! Shih-na: ...Ack! Edgeworth: (Sorry to have clipped one of your wings, \"Yatagarasu\", but we're not finished yet.) Shih-na: But you have no way of proving whether or not this is Babahlese ink on the coat hem! Edgeworth: Oh, but I do. And I intend to show that it IS ink in a few seconds. Shih-na: How...!? Edgeworth: How, you ask? Well, since you don't seem to know, allow me to show you. This is how I will prove that the dark substance on the coat is Babahlese ink! Edgeworth: We can find out whether that is Babahlese ink or not by lighting it on fire. Lang: That's how you're going to prove that it's Babahlese ink? Edgeworth: Yes. If you could please cut a section of the dark, stained area for me, I'd appreciate it. Because I will show you, here and now, what the dark substance is! Lang: Shih-na... Sorry to do this, but I'm going to have to cut off a bit of your coat. Shih-na: Go ahead. I wasn't planning to wear it anymore anyway. Edgeworth: Now then, if someone could loan me a lighter or something... Kay: Oh! I've got some matches! I always carry them with me so I can light smoke bombs! Edgeworth: Then, if I could please have one, Kay, we can get this experiment underway. Franziska: The flame...! Lang: It's the same color as the flames whitcrystal oil produces... Which means...! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink is a product of whitcrystal oil. And when lit, the ink produces a green flame. Shih-na: ......... Edgeworth: (Hmph. I believe the time has come to clip the Yatagarasu's other wing.) Kay: Ms. Shih-na... You're the fake Yatagarasu...! The one who killed my father! Shih-na: ......... Edgeworth: It's about time you came clean, Agent Shih-na. Or should I say... ...Calisto Yew!? Lang: Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... You're not serious, are you? Edgeworth: Do I look like the joking type to you? Shih-na: ...Ahah. Phwwwh... \"Calisto Yew\"? I've never heard that name before in my life. Franziska: That manner of speaking, and that attitude...! You haven't changed a bit in seven years! Gumshoe: You're the defense attorney that killed Mr. Faraday, and then tried to frame me for it! Shih-na: Oh really, and you have proof? You insist that I am this \"Calisto Yew\" woman, but you can't prove it! If you have no proof, then I'm afraid you won't be able to lay a single finger on me. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The raven is a very unique bird, one that flies by the darkness of night. However! The light of dawn has arrived, and it will reveal your true, ugly form to the world! Shih-na: Shih-na: Enough poetry! I want to see some evidence! Franziska: Do you really have something that can prove that she is Calisto Yew? Edgeworth: I do. It's something that the 2nd Yatagarasu has preserved for us these last seven years! Kay: Do me the honor, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: I will, Kay. For we have finally come to the end. We'll prove her to be Calisto Yew with this, and clip this Yatagarasu's wings for good! Edgeworth: This perfume... This will prove you to be Calisto Yew. Shih-na: It will...!? Edgeworth: Kay has preserved it perfectly for us. Surely you remember this bottle? This belonged to Ms. Yew just before she disappeared seven years ago. Naturally, this means that a few of her fingerprints are on here as well. Kay: This is that bottle of perfume you spilled, which I have preserved ever since. Shih-na: ...! Kay: I heard from my father, Byrne Faraday... ...that if stored under the right conditions, a fingerprint can be preserved for decades. Which means that your fingerprints are still on here. Every last one. Shih-na: ......... Edgeworth: We can clear everything up if we were to compare the prints on this to your own! Now come, Agent Shih-na! Will you submit yourself to a fingerprint test!? Shih-na: ...Ahah. Edgeworth: ! Shih-na: Hee... hee hee hee... Ahah. Ahah! Ahah! Ahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! ???: It looks like... you've seen right through me yet again... Ahah... You're sending the biggest chill down my spine, Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Calisto... Yew...! Franziska: So you've shown your true face at last. Yew: This feeling of thrill... it's even greater than that time, seven years ago. Lang: Shih-na! You're...! Yew: Lang, I really enjoyed our days together. You're an insanely strong, nice, kind-hearted... idiot of a man. Lang: So, you were a spy all along? A mole sent by the smuggling ring I've been chasing after... Someone who has been feeding them intel on Interpol all this time!? Yew: Ahah! Very good! Maybe you're not as big of an idiot as I thought! Kay: Calisto Yew... The woman who killed my father seven years ago...! You're her, aren't you!? The fake Yatagarasu! Yew: That's right. Calisto Yew... That's just one of my many names. But even that is just a fa\u00e7ade. .........Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I am... the Great Thief Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: Calisto Yew, this time you won't escape, for this is the end of the road for you. Now come along quietly! Yew: You know, you're the one who left the strongest impression on me... Kay Faraday. And had you not used the Yatagarasu's gadgets, I might've never known who you were. But here you are, being a thorn in my side... just like your father always was. Kay: ...! Edgeworth: Kay! Don't! Kay: Yew! I'll never forgive you for what you did to my father! Yew: Phwwwh... You really are just like him. Mr. Faraday, too, possessed such laughable honesty! Edgeworth: Kay! Gumshoe: Aaaaaaah! You let Kay go right now, pal! Franziska: You despicable...! Kay: Let go of me! You filthy... Arngh! Yew: You think I'm a fake, don't you? Well, unfortunately for you, I'm the real Yatagarasu. Kay: But that's impossible! My father was the one who created Little Thief! Yew: Ahaha! Hey, Edgeworth. The Yatagarasu has three legs. Do you know why that is? Edgeworth: Why it has three legs...? Badd: There are three main reasons why the Yatagarasu will always be one step ahead! First! The Yatagarasu always knows the exact location of the target object. Second! The Yatagarasu always knows exactly how to disarm the security system. Edgeworth: No, it can't be! Yew: Did you finally figure it out? Do you finally know the real identity of the Yatagarasu!? Edgeworth: The real identity of the Yatagarasu is... Edgeworth: The real identity of the Yatagarasu is neither Byrne Faraday nor Calisto Yew. But by the same token, they are also both the real Yatagarasu. Yew: Ha ha! How very perceptive of you! Kay: N-No way! Edgeworth: The single person known as the Great Thief Yatagarasu never existed. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I... No! I refuse to believe this! Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu is known to have three special skills. Skill number one. The Yatagarasu always knows the exact location of the target object. And a lawyer would have the opportunity to learn the layout of client corporations. Skill number two. The Yatagarasu always knows exactly how to disarm the security system. And a good prosecutor would be well-versed in the ways of a criminal. ???: And skill number three... The Yatagarasu doesn't leave a single shred of evidence behind... ever... Edgeworth: D-Detective Badd! Badd: ...It was only natural for the Yatagarasu to never leave evidence behind. Because the lead detective on the case... hid it all away... Edgeworth: Y-You're the third member of the Yatagarasu!? Badd: ...Yew. ...I've been looking for you for a long time. Seven long years, but I've finally got you... Yew: Ahah! Why, Mr. Badd! Long time no see. What happened to us? We used to be such a great team. Kay: If you were such a great team, then why did you kill my father seven years ago!? Yew: Ha ha ha. Why indeed? It was nothing personal, really. He was just another person I had to kill. Kay: ...! How can you say that...!? Yew: I grow weary of this, and it's about time for everything to come to an end. And this time, I won't miss. Edgeworth: Stop! Badd: Yeeeeeeeeew! Edgeworth: Kay! Lang: It's over, Shih-na. Kay: Y...! Your leg...! Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Yew: Grrrnk! Badd: You idiot...! What were you thinking, jumping in front of my gun like that...!? What are you risking your life for!? Lang: I'm sorry, Detective Badd, but no matter what sort of past she may have had... ...or even if she is a spy, it doesn't change the fact that she is my subordinate. And as long as she is, I can't allow any harm to come to her, not even from you! Yew: You really are... an idiot, you know that...? Lang: Hah! That's fine with me. You should know by now that this is just how I am. Hey, sis... Franziska: Yes...? Lang: I want you to conduct a full body search. Shih-na might have another weapon on her. Franziska: Alright. Detective Gumshoe, your assistance, please. Gumshoe: Sir! Gumshoe: Hey, I found something! What is this, sir? It looks like the blade of a knife, but it doesn't have a handle. Edgeworth: This is a great find, Detective. Gumshoe: Huh? It is, sir? Edgeworth: Let's try pairing up this blade with this handle. Edgeworth: I believe this blade actually belongs with the handle that was on the murder weapon. Gumshoe: Hey, they fit together perfectly! Edgeworth: This blade must've been taken from the crime scene when the knife handles were switched. Gumshoe: I'm going to go return this Babahlese knife now! Edgeworth: Alright. I trust that you'll make sure that it is returned to Ambassador Palaeno. Babahlese Knife Handle given to Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: I believe this makes it perfectly clear who did it, Calisto Yew! For the only time the handles could've been switched is just after Mr. Coachen's murder. Yew: Ahah...! Edgeworth: Which means that you must be Mr. Coachen's killer! You killed Mr. Coachen with the Allebahstian knife... ...switched the handles, and then took the original blade of the Babahlese knife with you. Later, you allowed yourself to be spotted by Kay near the open-air stage. You used the fireplace to lose her, and then you went back to accuse her of the murder. Does that about sum it up? Yew: Yew: Ahah... You craft an engaging tale, Edgeworth, but there are two problems with it. Edgeworth: Problems? In what respect? Yew: What do you think my real reason was in allowing her to chase after me? Edgeworth: .........? Yew: Phwwh... It was all so I could capture Kay Faraday. Kay: What!? Yew: When I saw you using that device at Gatewater Land, I knew right away... ...that you were Byrne Faraday's daughter. Ahah! I became curious, so I researched a little into your background. That's how I found out that you were on the trail of the Yatagarasu. Kay: So that's why you tried to pin Mr. Coachen's murder on me? Yew: Yes... I knew you would show up at this embassy tonight. So I thought to use you. But pinning the murder on you wasn't my only goal. Kay: You had another? Yew: Heh heh, yes. Once I had you under arrest, I had planned to search you... ...and take back the device that rightfully belongs to me, the true Yatagarasu. Kay: You were going to take Little Thief away from me!? Yew: Seven years ago, it was thanks to that device that Faraday was able to infiltrate this place. But he stole more than he should've. I had a tough time recovering that precious key. Edgeworth: Then, the person who stole the Yatagarasu's Key was Mr. Faraday...!? Badd: Yew... That incident seven years ago... What was the catalyst behind it? Yew: In the eyes of the smuggling ring, the Yatagarasu was becoming a bit of a problem. ...It wasn't an especially pleasant assignment. Kay: ......... Edgeworth: Then why!? Why did you become a member of the Yatagarasu!? Yew: Why? There is no \"why\". I was destined to betray everyone from the very beginning. Edgeworth: From the beginning? What is that supposed to mean? Yew: The person I take orders from hasn't changed... Even now, to this day. Edgeworth: ! (Does this mean that the leader of the smuggling ring wasn't Mr. Coachen? Then... the real ringleader is still out there pulling the strings!) Lang: Are you done asking what you need to know? Because if so, we should probably get going. And you're going to tell me everything you did tonight. Do you understand, Shih-na? Yew: I guess I should tell you, then, that I was the one who set the Babahlese Embassy on fire. Edgeworth: And why did you do that? Yew: Ahah... I suppose it was to destroy all evidence of the counterfeit bills. Lang: That was what the smuggling ring was trying to do...? But then, why start two fires!? Yew: Sorry, but I can't tell you anything about the ring. It's your job to complete your investigation, after all. I've had my fun. Now, it's your turn to enjoy the ride. Kay: ...Wait! Ye... I mean, Ms. Shih-na. Yew: Yes? Kay: When I fell to the floor earlier, these fell at my feet. Yew: What about them...? Kay: They're such pretty hair sticks that I thought... well, that I should return them to you. Yew: Ha ha... You can have them. They're of no use to me anymore. If you don't want them, you can always just throw them away. Kay: .........No, I want to keep them. Yew: Ahah... Suit yourself. .........Oh, that's right. I almost forgot, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hm...? Yew: About the second problem I had with your story... I didn't kill anyone tonight. Edgeworth: What...? Yew: I'm not saying that as a sore loser. Think of it as a hint, if you will. Lang: Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: Yes, Agent Lang? Lang: Mark my words, I'm not done here, and I'll be back! And it's got nothing to do with duty or anything, because this has become my personal case. I may have been shot... ...but I'll show you just how dangerous a wounded wolf can be! Edgeworth: (His anger appears to have negated the sensation of pain in his injured leg...) It's finally over, Kay. Kay: I feel like I've peered into her heart a little, you know? And it's so cold, and dark... and incredibly lonely. The person who was giving her all these commands... ...the one who thought my father was a problem to be removed... Edgeworth: That person is the real ringleader behind the smuggling ring! Kay: Um, Mr. Edgeworth, I have a favor to ask. Can you... hold onto these hair sticks for me? They're really pretty, just like the ones they were selling for the Jammin' Ninja show... ...but until this case is over, I don't think I can look at them without being overcome. Edgeworth: ...I understand. I'll take good care of them for you. (Hm...? There is a bit of soil stuck on the ends of these sticks...) Hair Sticks data jotted down in my Organizer. Gumshoe: Oh! I guess it's that time already, huh!? Franziska: So it's midnight... the dawn of another day. Gumshoe: Hey, pops! Thanks a bunch! You've really done a lot for everyone all these years! Edgeworth: Detective Badd, don't tell me today is the day...? Badd: Yeah... it is. With this... I can retire in peace. ...It was down to the wire, and we almost didn't make it... ...but we did it... we solved everything. Edgeworth: But that's just it; we haven't solved everything yet. The ringleader of the smuggling ring you, the Yatagarasu, were chasing after... Badd: ...The legend of that Yatagarasu... is now over. Mr. Edgeworth... That bit of logic earlier... it was brilliant. Edgeworth: ... Badd: I feel like... I can leave it all in your hands. ...I'm counting on you. Kay: Is it really true, Uncle Badd? Were you also a part of the Yatagarasu...? Badd: As I said to you earlier... Kay... I'm truly sorry. I wanted... nothing but a peaceful life for you... Kay: Uncle Badd... Gumshoe: Hey, don't take it so seriously! It's all just one big joke, right!? Franziska: ...Unfortunately, it isn't. Gumshoe: O-Oh, come on, sir! She's just yanking on my chain, isn't she, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Detective Badd... Wait, no, you are no longer a detective... Mr. Badd, I'd like to ask you about the Yatagarasu. Gumshoe: ...Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth... Badd: Mr. Edgeworth... ...Here, I should give these back to you. Edgeworth: These are... ...the pages from my KG-8 case files that the Yatagarasu stole from my office! Gumshoe: Huh? Wait? WHAT!? Badd: Mr. Edgeworth, I must apologize for last night. Edgeworth: So the Yatagarasu who stole into my room was you, was it? Gumshoe: Wait... then that means... WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? T-Tell me it's not true...! Th-That's too insane for me to believe, sir! Badd: It's true... Even if it's not something you want to hear. The KG-8 Incident... It was a very emotionally trying case. We stood in that courtroom... Faraday as the prosecutor... and I as the lead detective. Faraday had... evidence in his possession... that would prove the defendant guilty. However... because it was stolen, the defendant... was found innocent. Yew was... the elder sister... of the victim in the case. When the defendant was pronounced \"not guilty\"... she... let out a great wail. That's when we realized... that there was a limit... to what the law could do. The only way to bring someone like that to justice was to do so outside of the courts... That's what we thought... at the time. ...That's how we... formed the Yatagarasu... ...and vowed to bring to light... any dirty dealings companies had with the ring... ...including companies that dealt with... the Amano Group... Edgeworth: Mr. Amano's conglomerate...? Badd: We called ourselves the Yatagarasu... and flexed our collective muscle... We exposed all sorts of shady dealings... as a warning to the business world as a whole... By doing that... we were able to stop... the higher ups from covering things up. And then... it was finally time... We had finally arrived at the moment when... we'd find out the ringleader's true identity. It was then that Yew literally stabbed us in the heart... and Faraday... he died for it... Edgeworth: .................. Kay: But why...? Wasn't she the sister of the victim in the KG-8 Incident? Badd: ...After Faraday's death, I looked into her past... And that's when I found out... that she was a phony. The victim of the KG-8 Incident, Cece Yew... ...she ...never had a sister. Edgeworth: What? Then that means... Badd: \"Shih-na\" wasn't the only fake name she used! \"Calisto Yew\" was also another pseudonym! From the very beginning... that woman was a spy sent by the smuggling ring! Franziska: She said it herself; \"I was destined to betray everyone from the very beginning.\" Badd: Anyway... Let's return to the real topic at hand... Mr. Edgeworth... this \"trump card\" that we stuck onto this page of the case file... ...please use it wisely. Edgeworth: \"Trump card\"...? Badd: That photo that we stuck on there... Try peeling it off. Behind it... slumbers a piece of evidence... that Faraday hid away all those years ago. Edgeworth: It's the mark of the Yatagarasu... But why? Badd: This is... a \"directives card\"... from the big boss. Take a look... at the back. This was something... Coachen had on him at the time of the KG-8 Incident... ten years ago. That blood... is from the victim of the incident, Ms. Cece Yew... Edgeworth: But why is the card adorned with the mark of the Yatagarasu? Badd: The reason why... we called ourselves... the Yatagarasu... ...was because... of the three-legged raven mark that the smuggling ring's boss used. Apparently, orders from the boss... would come on these cards, without fail. The person who received the order... was supposed to burn it immediately after reading it. And apparently... it burns a bright green flame when set ablaze... Edgeworth: So you mean, the cards were written in Babahlese ink...? Badd: The fact that the card that Coachen was sent made it into Faraday's hand at all... ...is nothing short of a miracle. We decided... that whenever we stole anything... ...we would send a \"card\" along with it... to the police. Edgeworth: So that's what those white cards are! Badd: The Great Thief that used the mark... that only those within the ring would know... It was our message... to the ringleader... ...that we were only a few steps behind. Trump Card data jotted down in my Organizer. Badd: And one more thing... Detective Gumshoe. I'm entrusting this to you. Gumshoe: What is this, sir? Badd: This is what I was talking about earlier. During the KG-8 Incident trial, Faraday had this in his possession... ...this important, definitive piece of evidence... Edgeworth: But I thought it was stolen, How do you have it...? Badd: The person who stole it from us... ten years ago... ...was a man by the name of Ernest Amano... And he had it locked and hidden away... for all this time. But we forced him to tell us where it was finally... after the other day's kidnapping case. Video Tape data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: This video...! Portsman: Wh--! Don't come any closer! I'm warning you! Edgeworth: This is the same video as the one Mr. Portsman was trying to conceal from me! Badd: Yeah, it would seem that even he was caught up in the ring's web. Amano was preparing to take on the boss someday... ...and the video was his insurance. That's where that prosecutor comes in... He was to retrieve the video. On top of that... he was apparently instructed to sneak into your office... ...and steal the trump card... You saw it for yourself, right? The card that told him to preserve the evidence. Edgeworth: Then, that card was not the calling card of the Yatagarasu... ...but rather, a directives card from the ringleader to Mr. Portsman? Badd: The two pieces together make for a strong weapon for whoever holds them. Edgeworth: The evidence Mr. Portsman thought to withhold from me... ...and the one that you stole from my office last night... Both pieces are illegal, and for me to use either one is... Badd: Whether you use them or not... is up to you. But they will be of help to you... when you take on someone who is above the law. Edgeworth: (Is the boss one of those who \"cannot be brought to court\" that Mr. Faraday spoke of?) Detective Badd... There is no limit to the law, for it is the people who determine the limits to them. Badd: You still insist that, even now? You really are something else. I leave the rest in your hands. Now then, Detective Gumshoe. The handcuffs. It's time to lock up... the last remaining member of the Yatagarasu. Gumshoe: Pops... Badd: ...Don't ever lose your detective's spirit. Gumshoe: Nnnnrrrgh... Pops! Why is this happening!? This isn't justice! Badd: Like I always told you... do not get emotionally involved. ...Now let's go. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Is this really the end of a legend...? To be continued \nLang: One of Allebahst's knives was used in Babahl to murder Mr. Coachen. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I concur that this knife crossed over country lines. Lang: Good, but that's not the only thing that did. We mustn't forget about the other weapon! The knife was only one. Lang: And the murder weapon in the killing of DeMasque II is Babahl's Primidux Statue. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you're saying that the Primidux Statue was also brought over by Franziska? Lang: Like I told you before, that's the only way it makes sense! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And how exactly did she bring it over? Lang: I... haven't figured that out yet. Edgeworth: Hmph... That's a rather weak statement, considering how sure you are. Lang: Maybe, but there is one thing I do know for sure. Lang: Somehow, these two objects were able to penetrate the two countries' impenetrable security. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Impenetrable\"...? I should hardly think so. Lang: Lang: You've seen the top of the wall between the two countries, right? Who in the world could cross over that? Kay: Yeah, not even I could climb over that thing with all that barbed wire... Lang: The only way into either embassy is through the doors in the Theatrum Neutralis. So the only way for the knife and the Primidux Statue to traverse the two countries... ...is through those security camera-equipped, well-guarded doors. Present Babahl's Primidux Statue or Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Agent Lang, those two items are not the only two to cross the border tonight.\" Lang: The only one who traversed the two countries just before and after the crimes was you. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was Franziska really the only person to have traveled between the two countries? Lang: According to the guards at both doors, she is the only one to go back and forth. The sis there was in Allebahst when the Yatagarasu showed. And then, just before you guys found Mr. Coachen's body, she entered Babahl. I think we can assume that's when she brought the knife into Babahl. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Then how do you explain the Primidux Statue? Lang: ...I haven't quite figured that out yet. However, the fact that the two weapons crossed the border... ...proves that the killer must have also traveled across the country lines! Edgeworth: (The only things to cross the border are the Primidux Statue and the knife? I should hardly think that those are the only two items, Agent Lang...!) Edgeworth: Agent Lang, those two items are not the only two to cross the border tonight. Lang: Oh? Edgeworth: DeMasque II was killed with Babahl's Primidux Statue, yes. But if that's the case, then tell me, where did Allebahst's Primidux Statue go? Lang: To Babahl...! Edgeworth: Precisely. And if the two statues really were switched... ...then this means that both statues were smuggled across the border at some point. Which means that a total of three items were smuggled across the embassies! Lang: Hmm... I guess so. But you know what? It doesn't matter the number of items, only that the sis is the only one who could've done it! Because the only person who went back and forth between Allebahst and Babahl is her! Edgeworth: (Is that really true? Was there no one else who traveled between the two countries? Actually, there was definitely another person; one who paid a visit to both sides of the wall!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Is that really so, Agent Lang? Lang: Ha ha ha ha! What a lousy time to try and bluff your way out of this! I checked out what the guards said, along with the security cameras' footage. You're not going to overturn my hypothesis that easily! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But suppose there was some other way other than through the theater doors? Lang: What other way...? Edgeworth: (The other entity that managed to cross the border unharmed... If I point it out, it would open up a whole new possibility! And though I hesitate to bring this out... ...as long as this entity exists, the impossible road becomes a possibility.) Lang: It looks like you've got some clever idea in mind. Edgeworth: I do, and I can show it to you through a single piece of evidence. Lang: Tch! Fine, then. Let's see this piece of evidence that will show me this \"other route\"! Edgeworth: This piece of evidence will show us another way to move between the two countries! Present Photo of Yatagarasu Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Agent Lang, I'm sure you are familiar with this unforgettable photo.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I believe this is the piece of evidence that will show you how! Lang: ......... What about it? You're going to have to explain because I don't see another road or anything here (changed from [else] in the original release)! Edgeworth: B-But how can you not see!? Wolves are known for their keen eyesight! Lang: Sorry, but the only thing I see is the crud that you're hoping will stick to the wall. Edgeworth: (I need to think calmly about this and find that other road the smuggled goods took...) Leads back to: \"This piece of evidence will show us another way to move between the two countries!\" Edgeworth: Agent Lang, I'm sure you are familiar with this unforgettable photo. Lang: Tch...! That supernatural photo!? Like I said before... Humans can't fly. Edgeworth: No, of course not. I understand that perfectly well. Lang: And don't start claiming that Shih-na somehow grew wings, either. Edgeworth: I wouldn't dream of claiming that. Lang: And I won't allow you to take back what you've said either! I'll say it again; it's not humanly possible to fly through the air without wings! So you'd better have a good explanation for this, Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: ...Arngh! (But how can I prove who it was that flew through the air in this photo!? Wait. \"Not humanly possible\"...? Eureka...!) Very well. You will have your explanation! Lang: It sounds like you have a good idea simmering inside that head of yours... Let's hear it! The face hidden within this photo's blurry, trailed shadow is...!? Present Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Naturally, the shadow is the third smuggled object, the Primidux Statue replica.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is the face behind the shadow! Lang: Lang: I thought I said that you'd better have a GOOD explanation. I can't make heads or tails of what you're trying to say with that! Edgeworth: Nnrgh! (W-Was I wrong...?) Lang: Come on... Hurry up and show me what that shadow that's flying through the air is! Edgeworth: Even had you not barked that at me, I would've gladly done so, Agent Lang. (I need to go over it one more time. The man-shaped shadow that flew through the air, wrapped in the darkness of the night... Its real shape can only be this one thing!) Leads back to: \"Let's hear it! The face hidden within this photo's blurry, trailed shadow is...!?\" Edgeworth: Naturally, the shadow is the third smuggled object, the Primidux Statue replica. Lang: You can't be serious! Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu... or rather, Calisto Yew dressed as Agent Shih-na, was inside Babahl. She dressed the replica statue up in clothes, and launched it through the air. Lang: Lang: Hah... Mr. Prosecutooooooor! You left out a very crucial bit in your explanation. Edgeworth: I know I did. Lang: She \"launched it through the air\"!? Hah... And how exactly did she do thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (He is literally baring his fangs at me...! But he has a point. How exactly did it move through the air like that? As long as this remains unsolved, we won't be able to move any closer to the truth! Which reminds me, didn't he say this earlier...?) Lang: Hey, sis... I remember that just before Ambassador Alba went to give his speech... ...he called you into his office, right? Edgeworth: (So, just before the murder, Franziska was called here, right into this very room. If that's the case... then that may be another avenue I can pursue.) Agent Lang. In order for me to answer that question... ...I will need to hear testimony from Ms. von Karma. Franziska: ! Lang: Oh...? What are you up to now, pretty boy? Edgeworth: Earlier, you mentioned something of interest to me. You said that just before the murder occurred... ...Ms. von Karma had been in this room because Ambassador Alba had called for her. And for that reason alone, you believe her to be the killer. Lang: Yeah, I guess I did say something like that. Edgeworth: In that case, I believe it is my duty to ask her what her side of the story is. Lang: Hah! Do you really think a criminal would tell us the honest truth? Franziska: How dare you!? As I've said numerous times, there is absolutely no proof that I am the killer! Miles Edgeworth! Don't tell me you suspect me, too!? Edgeworth: I don't. However, I can't ignore the fact that you were in this room at one point in time. Which is why I would like to hear about it from you (changed from [your movements in this room] in the original release). Franziska: Krngh! Edgeworth: Franziska... I feel that I still don't have enough information... ...which is why your testimony is incredibly important to the outcome of this case. Franziska: ............ Alright. So? What would you like me to talk about? Edgeworth: Hmm... I'd like you to please testify to your movements up until you came into this room (changed from [in this room until the murder occurred] in the original release). Lang: Hmph... Alright, let's try this your way for a change. But if what she has to say turns out to be a waste of time... ...I'll place her under arrest faster than you can howl \"Nooooooooooooo!\" Edgeworth: Hmph... As you wish. Testimony -- Movements in Allebahst -- Franziska: As I said earlier, I was assigned to guard duty in the Allebahstian Embassy. After I saw the Steel Samurai off on his way towards the ambassador's office... ...I returned to the rose garden for a bit, and checked up on the security situation. After all the preparations were in place, I was called back by Ambassador Alba to his office. Edgeworth: Franziska, I want us to make this clear from the very beginning... ...so what I wish to confirm is that the only time span in which you were in this office... ...was before the murder occurred. Is that correct? Franziska: Yes, of course. Edgeworth: I see. (For now, the only way that I can see for us to break out of this situation... ...is to ask Franziska about her testimony in more detail.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I thought your duty was to fact-find anything you could about the smuggling ring? Franziska: Yes, that was my job. But upon hearing that the Yatagarasu had sent a calling card to the Embassy... ...Ambassador Alba called upon us to protect the Embassy instead. That incident seven years ago... Or have you forgotten what happened here back then? Edgeworth: Nngh... (Anything related to that case we were involved in appears to be rather painful for her. It's not exactly one I can readily forget myself...) Franziska: Hmph... It looks like you remember the case after all. Edgeworth: Of course I do. Franziska: I inspected every location, every possible escape route... ...and every aspect of the police's security detail. I did all that, then after that... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were at the theater as well? Franziska: Yes, and I suppose you were also there as well, watching that stage show? Edgeworth: Well, yes. (So Franziska was there...) Franziska: Hmph... Well, after the show was over and I saw the Steel Samurai off... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Why did you need to confirm the degree of preparation for even the speech? Franziska: For security's sake, of course. What other reason could I have had? No one knew just how the Yatagarasu had planned on getting in, right? Edgeworth: Yes, I suppose you're right. Franziska: And in the end, the Yatagarasu did choose to appear in the rose garden... Even if it did turn out to be nothing more than a shadow... Arngh... Who would've thought that she would use a shadow!? Edgeworth: Ack! C-Calm down, Franziska! (She must still be nursing a grudge over the fact that she couldn't figure it out herself.) Franziska: Hmph... Anyway, there was no one in the rose garden. And we were aware that the speech was set to start soon thereafter. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: At that time, DeMasque II's body had yet to be found in this room, is that correct? Franziska: That's right. But Ambassador Alba was here. One could hardly miss his rather large presence. Edgeworth: Hmm... Lang: Hmph! A criminal will say anything to get out of getting arrested! How do we know you're not lying!? Franziska: Well, if you need proof, I'd be happy to oblige you. Lang: Seriously!? Franziska: Like I keep telling you... ...when I arrived at this office, Ambassador Alba was already here. He was standing by the flower box on the windowsill, watering his plants. Alba: Ah, I can attest to that. I remember speaking with the lovely lady around that time here in my office. Lang: Grr! Alright, then... Add that statement to your testimony, and let's hear some details. Edgeworth: (So Ambassador Alba was in this room at the time, was he...?) Adds statement \"When I arrived, Ambassador Alba was watering the flowers on the windowsill.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: For the sake of being thorough, I'd like to ask you something. How did you know that Ambassador Alba was watering his plants at the windowsill? Franziska: What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: The entrance to this room is on this side, however, the window is on the opposite side. If what you say is true, then when you entered the room, his body would've been like a wall. He would've been blocking your view of what he was doing. Isn't that not correct? Franziska: I suppose it was a bit hard to see around him. But fortunately for me Ambassador Alba is not an immovable wall. Edgeworth: ...? Franziska: I knocked before I entered, and as I did, he turned around to greet me... ...with a watering can in his hand. So it's only natural to believe that he was watering his plants, right? Edgeworth: I suppose. Franziska: After his greeting, we spent a little time talking about his flowers. He had obtained them himself, and is growing them with the utmost care, you know. Alba: Yes... The plants in this room... They are all like my children. Franziska: The passionflowers in the flower box on the windowsill are growing beautifully, too. All four of them are in full bloom. Edgeworth: ! Ms. von Karma, what did you say just now? Franziska: I said that the flowers are growing beautifully. What about that statement do you not understand? Edgeworth: (What do I not understand? I do not understand why a certain thing is the way it is...) I'd like for you to append that statement to your testimony. Franziska: Very well. Adds statement \"There were four large passionflowers in full bloom in the flower box.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: For the sake of being thorough, I'd like to ask you something.

I should hardly think I could have miscounted such eye-catching flowers. Edgeworth: (There must be a deeper meaning to this statement. And it appears that I must take a gamble on its meaning for me to make any progress!) Edgeworth: (The Primidux Statues were already switched by the time the murder happened. In light of that fact, what Franziska saw in this room before the crime... ...is of incredible importance!)Franziska: As I said earlier, I was assigned to guard duty in the Allebahstian Embassy.

Edgeworth: (There must be a deeper meaning to this statement. And it appears that I must take a gamble on its meaning for me to make any progress!) Present Passionflowers Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Franziska...\" Edgeworth: (The Primidux Statues were already switched by the time the murder happened. In light of that fact, what Franziska saw in this room before the crime... ...is of incredible importance!) Edgeworth: Franziska... For some odd reason... your testimony contradicts with this piece of evidence. Franziska: It does appear that way. Lang: Hah! I know it! I knew we couldn't trust your words, sis! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! What are you doing discrediting Ms. von Karma like this!? Gumshoe: Yeah, sir! If you keep this up, she's gonna get taken away, sir! Eeek! Franziska: All I've done is state what I saw! I have not made (changed from [made not] in the original release) a single mistake in my testimony! And for this... I am still under suspicion for murder. Is the number of flowers really all that important at this juncture, Miles? Edgeworth: At the very least, it is a contradiction in this enigmatic case. One that I find hard to dismiss as irrelevant. Lang: Hah! Then let's hear it, Mr. Prosecutor! What does the number of flowers have to do with anything? What does it prove? Edgeworth: I believe the answer to that will become clear if we were to examine that flower box. (How did this contradiction come about...? There must be something behind this discrepancy!) Alba: Th-They're my beloved flowers. I've grown them with the utmost care. So I ask that you please be gentle with them as you examine them, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hmph... I understand. (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Examine flowers Edgeworth: The name of these flowers... I believe they're called \"passionflowers\". Despite being called \"flowers\", they are actually a species of vine. They appear to be growing well, and are well-supported by these plant supports. Lang: Yeah, but no matter how I look at it, it looks like there are only two here to me! You realize, don't you, sis... Your little lie has failed you! Franziska: Arngh! Miles Edgeworth! Hurry up and shut this man up for me already! Edgeworth: Hmm... (I suppose I will need to use some evidence to \"shut him up\", won't I...?) Show evidence Edgeworth: Hmph... I believe I have just the piece of evidence you require. Lang: Oh? You do, do you!? You have such confidence in the face of your current plight... ...but I highly doubt it'll last until the end! Edgeworth: Hmph... You howl like a wolf, Agent Lang... ...but we'll see if you have any bite to back up that bark after you see the evidence! The truth the passionflowers reveal can be seen in this piece of evidence! Present Hair Sticks Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Shih-na, who was supposedly in Babahl the entire time, had these \"hair sticks\" on her...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well? What do you think now, Agent Lang? Lang: Lang: Hah! You may talk big... but as usual, it's nothing more than a big bluff! Edgeworth: Gnrk! (Was I wrong!? Perhaps I should gather a bit more information before I attempt this again...) Leads back to examination of windowsill Don't have evidence to show Edgeworth: (Not yet... I still have a thing or two left to examine.) Leads back to examination of windowsill Examine watering can Edgeworth: This watering can has a rather robust design. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Why are you telling us stuff we can clearly see for ourselves!? Plus, if you keep wasting time talking about that, Ms. von Karma's gonna get arrested! Edgeworth: Nngh... (I'd better examine something else.) Examine flower box Edgeworth: This flower box... It appears to be made of marble. Franziska: It looks that way. But, so what? Is it something that's so important that you absolutely had to mention it? Edgeworth: N-No, not exactly, but... Franziska: .........Miles Edgeworth. You DO understand our current situation, don't you? Edgeworth: Y-Yes, of course. I am fully aware of the situation. Franziska: Oh? Then in that case, allow me to ask you once again. Is what the flower box is made out of really all that important? Edgeworth: Nngh... (It would appear that the construction of the flower box is not that important.) Examine holes in soil Edgeworth: (Hm...? This patch of soil looks as though it has had something removed from it.) Lang: Heh! What are you doing, Mr. Prosecutor? Why'd you clam up all of a sudden? I'm still here, waiting for an explanation, you know! Edgeworth: Did you know, Agent Lang? Flowers are best appreciated in silence. Lang: ...Tch. Edgeworth: (It looks like two things were pulled out of this flower box...) Edgeworth: Shih-na, who was supposedly in Babahl the entire time, had these \"hair sticks\" on her... ...that look exactly like the plant supports in this flower box. In other words, I believe it can be said that these \"hair sticks\" are in actuality... ...support sticks for the passionflowers! Lang: Heh! And so what!? Is this really all that important to the case? Examine evidence Hair Sticks Top of hair stick Edgeworth: Aha... So this ring-like section... ...is there to support vines like passionflowers up, huh? But if that's all they were meant to do, then what is this notch on the top end? Kay: Maybe it's for string or something to run through? To help the stick stay upright? Edgeworth: A notch for string to run through, huh? Tip of hair stick Edgeworth: I suppose this dirt was from when this plant support was stuck in the flower box. Kay: I guess that's why only the tip is dirty, huh? Edgeworth: Yes. Edgeworth: Of course it is. It means that we've found yet another item that was smuggled between the countries tonight. Lang: Aiya! Edgeworth: Think about it logically, Agent Lang. These sticks were originally in Allebahst... ...but somehow, they wound up in Shih-na's hands, who was in Babahl the whole night. So make no mistake! These sticks were smuggled somehow, just like the knife and statue! Lang: Arngh! Hmph! Very well, then! I want to hear from you exactly how they wound up in Babahl! Edgeworth: (How did these support sticks find their way to Babahl and why? There must be some reason as to why they ended up there... Aha! So that's why!) Agent Lang, if you would please take a look at this and tell me its shape. Lang: Hmph! It's just another stick, isn't it!? Edgeworth: Hmph... And so it is. But the shape of the support sticks is what is important. For when they are used with something in this room, that's when it all comes into focus. And the object that completes the picture when used with the support sticks is...! Present crossbow Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Th-That's a crossbow... Wait! You're not really suggesting...!?\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is what was used with the support sticks! Lang: .........Come again? Edgeworth: Isn't it obvious? Someone used those with this... Franziska: \"Those with this\"...? Could you be any more vague!? Why don't you try again!? Edgeworth: Y-Yes, I suppose I should. (It would appear that this was insufficient in conveying what I had wanted to say. The answer should become obvious to me if I just think calmly about it once more. But the only thing that can really connect the two offices together has to be this!) Leads back to: \"And the object that completes the picture when used with the support sticks is...!\" Lang: Th-That's a crossbow... Wait! You're not really suggesting...!? Edgeworth: I am. These hair sticks... or rather, plant support sticks... They make for perfect  arrows! Lang: Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Edgeworth: (I've done it! I've found the common thread that connects the two offices! But this thread has yet to be completely untangled. Even using the arrows, how does this explain how the statues were transported? Furthermore, who could it have been who fired these sticks as arrows? There MUST be a common thread that ties all of these things together!) Examine evidence Crossbow Arrows Loop on arrow Edgeworth: I thought these loops were just an eccentric design quirk... ...but who knew that they were actually arrow fletchings? Lang: Lang: Mr. Prosecutor! Hold up a second! You do realize what happens when you tie a statue to an arrow, right? They don't fly at all! Argument -- Border-Crossing, Pt. 2 -- Lang: So Babahl's statue was draped in the Yatagarasu's clothes, and then shot over here? Even if you fired the arrows from this side, they wouldn't go far with a statue tied to them! I don't think I need to tell you that the Primidux Statues didn't sprout wings. You're a realist, after all, aren't you? Edgeworth: The Primidux Statues didn't sprout wings...? Hmph. Of course they didn't. Lang: Glad you understand. I feel much better already. I was afraid for a second that you were unaware of that crucial fact! Edgeworth: It's only crucial because you're under the belief that wings are necessary to this equation. Lang: What? Edgeworth: You need to free your mind a bit more, and let it fly like a bird on the wind. The Primidux Statues flew, but not on a wing. Allow me a bit of your time, and I'll explain this mysterious phenomenon to you! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But that incredible scene just happened to have been caught on film, resulting in this photo. Lang: Hah! And what an incredible scene it was! This photo was taken by a freelance photojournalist, right? Edgeworth: Yes, so I hear. Lang: And not every photojournalist is known to be honest, right? Especially not the ones that sell photos of spirits and giant creatures to tabloids. Edgeworth: Yes, I know what you mean. I've seen those sorts of photos many a time in court. But there have been times when those photos have turned out to be telling the truth. If you had ever stood in a court of law, you would know that it's entirely plausible. Lang: Hah! You really believe the stuff you're spewing right now? A courtroom certainly is a strange place, if what you say is true. But there really is something odd about that photo no matter how you look at it. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But we are in agreement that an arrow by itself would reach the other side, correct? Lang: But just the arrow by itself is pretty meaningless, don't you think, Mr. Prosecutor? Because the things they wanted to smuggle were a lot bigger than nothing! Edgeworth: No, that's not necessarily true. Lang: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (What I need right now... ...is not further discussion of my conclusions; it's the launching of my conclusions! What the shooter wanted to launch with the crossbow was not the statues themselves! But rather, something a crossbow can launch that can be used to move the statues!) Adds statement \"If it wasn't a statue that was tied to the arrows, then what did the crossbow launch...?\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The thing the crossbow launched...? Allow me to show you the answer! Lang: Well, come on, then! Show me what you've got! But I warn you! I'll know when you're just bluffing! Edgeworth: This is what was launched from this Allebahstian office with the crossbow! Present Wire Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Finally...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence is what was launched from here in Allebahst! Lang: Lang: And what purpose, exactly, did launching that serve? Because if you're joking, it's not gonna be a fit of laughter I'm about to launch into! Edgeworth: Ack!

For I present to you, that which was carried by the arrow from the crossbow! Lang: Heh. I get it now, Mr. Prosecutor... I can see exactly what you are trying to say! You're saying that the wire was tied to an arrow and then shot into Mr. Coachen's office! All the way from the fifth floor of the Allebahstian Embassy... ...down to the third floor of the Babahlese Embassy! If what you're claiming is really what happened... ...I can see how Allebahst's Primidux Statue could be moved. Gravity could be used to move the statue down the wire from the fifth to the third floor. But then, what about Babahl's Primidux Statue? The dark shadow in this photo is clearly flying away from Babahl! Going in the opposite way of gravity, from the third floor of the Babahlese Embassy... ...up to the fifth floor of the Allebahstian Embassy...! How do you explain that!? Edgeworth: (Aha! I think I finally see how the gears behind this whole trick work (changed from [works] in the original release, correcting the typo)!) Agent Lang, the \"motion\" used behind this trick... I wonder if perhaps you have yet to envision how it works in your head? Lang: \"Motion\"? What motion? Edgeworth: This is the motion that was employed to smuggle Babahl's Primidux Statue! Rotary motion Leads to: \"I believe it was done via rotary motion.\" Swinging motion Edgeworth: A swinging motion was employed. Lang: Heh! You sure thought that one through, Mr. Prosecutor! Because if they used that... ...the statue would swing right into the building's wall! Edgeworth: Arngh! (H-He does have me there...) Lang: For shame! You should sign yourself up for grade school physics for not realizing that! Edgeworth: Nnrrrrgh... (I'm at a loss for words to that... I need to calm down and think through this once more. There is only one feasible motion that could've been used to send the statue up!) Leads back to: \"This is the motion that was employed to smuggle Babahl's Primidux Statue!\" Bungee action Edgeworth: A bit of bungee action was employed! Lang: ...Bungee action? Are you saying that the wire acted as a bungee cord, and then the statue was hauled up? Edgeworth: That's a simple way of putting it, but yes. Lang: Lang: Hah! Did you think about the weight of the statue at all? That thing is solid gold! Before that thing ever reached the office window, the wire would've snapped! Edgeworth: Nngh... Lang: But OK, let's consider your idea and say that the wire has the elasticity required. If you fired that kind of wire from a crossbow... ...the arrow could come sailing back at the person who shot it! Talk about dangerous! Edgeworth: Nnrrrrgh! (H-He's absolutely right...) Lang: I thought this sort of thing was common knowledge. I'm having a bit of hard time right now dealing with a jurisdiction thief... ...who lacks understanding of the most basic things like physics, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: (...Unfortunately for me, it appears that Agent Lang is correct. I need to calm down and think through this once more. There is only one feasible motion that could've been used to send the statue up!) Leads back to: \"This is the motion that was employed to smuggle Babahl's Primidux Statue!\" Edgeworth: I believe it was done via rotary motion. If the two statues were transported simultaneously... Lang: Lang: \"Simultaneously\"!? Get real! The statues would collide somewhere along the way! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Did I ever say that there was only one line of wire between the two offices? If you shot an arrow with the two ends of a wire tied to it, a circular belt can be formed. Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Don't object and call a success what is beyond reasonability.\" Taking into account the tension difference between the two wires... ...the top one would sag too much to the point where the statues would collide anyway! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang... As you know, the Primidux Statue is a one-of-a-kind national treasure. And the fact that Babahl's statue is a hollow replica of the real statue... ...it would naturally be lighter than the real one, meaning that my idea is very possible! Lang: Lang Zi says: HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWL! Edgeworth: Here is what I believe happened. Ms. Yew and her mystery co-conspirator set themselves up in the two different rooms. The co-conspirator bridged the rooms by shooting the 2 ends of the wire down on 1 arrow. Then the two of them covered the statues and proceeded to transport the statues. After the switch was completed, another arrow was fired... ...carrying the other end of the wire down to Babahl, where it was to be disposed of. And to do that, Ms. Yew hid it inside the grandfather clock. Q.E.D. Lang: ...Hah! Ha ha ha ha... Grr! Franziska: This proves it, right, Agent Lang!? That I'm not the killer! Lang: Not yet, sis. I still haven't had my dessert yet. Right, Mr. Prosecutor? Edgeworth: The proof is in the pudding, as it were? Lang: Pudding IS a nice dessert. So? Do you think you can do it? Can you prove that what you said is what happened? Because remember, if you can't... ...I'll be taking a certain someone back home with me as a souvenir! Edgeworth: I agree that as long as there is no proof, my hypothesis remains just that. However... ...what I have laid out is no mere hypothesis, for there is one more piece of evidence. Lang: One more? This should be interesting. You think you have a piece of evidence that will turn your hypothesis into fact...? Well then, let's see it, Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: (The thing that made it possible to create a circular belt out of a length of wire... I believe that it is right here in this very room! Now then, I believe this is what made the circular belt transportation method possible!) Present ceiling fan Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Hah! Looks like you dropped another bomb on us again!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The circular belt method was made possible thanks to this part of the room! Lang: Hah! Don't you mean \"impossible\", Mr. Prosecutor? Franziska: ...I have to say, I agree. Lang: Haaa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Even the one in the most precarious situation here agrees with me! Franziska: I am a Von Karma... ...and as I have a name to uphold... ...I refuse to accept anything that is less than perfect! Edgeworth: Nngh... (I guess I was mistaken... I need to take another good look at this room. There is something here that made it possible to create a circular belt out of wire!) Leads back to: \"Now then, I believe this is what made the circular belt transportation method possible!\" Lang: Hah! Looks like you dropped another bomb on us again! Franziska: The last piece to the trick... are two pulleys! Edgeworth: Precisely! The ceiling fans double as pulleys in this case! And thanks to the fact that there is one installed in each of the offices... ...the ceiling fans made for the perfect pulley set for the wire to run on! Lang: A...Aaa......... Arruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh! Edgeworth: (This must be it! This is how the smugglers bypassed the impenetrable security!) Lang: Ha... Ha ha ha ha ha! Grr... You really are something else, Mr. Prosecutor! I bet you've figured it all out already, haven't you!? You know who the bug hotshot that set up this real-life stage show is, don't you!? Edgeworth: (The person who set up this rather large and complex stage show... ...needs to be someone who had foreknowledge of... ...the existence of a ceiling fan in both the Allebahstian and Babahlese offices. And that the passionflowers' support stakes could be used as arrows...) The real mastermind behind this case......... Lang: Well!? Don't you dare make this wolf wait for his food! Franziska: Why are you so hesitant, Miles Edgeworth? If you can't say who it is, why don't you present something like you always do!? Edgeworth: (A single point of the finger here, and this case will explode into an international incident. However! It's already too late for me to stop the forward momentum! It appears that I have no choice now... but to rush in!) There is a piece of evidence that will point us to who the mysterious mastermind is! Present Passionflowers or Crossbow Arrows Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This smuggling could not have been possible without the use of the crossbow.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And this is it! Lang: Lang: Where's my real dessert!? How long do you intend to keep it from me!? That piece of evidence isn't satisfying at all! Edgeworth: Ack! (Then stop being so picky with your food! The person who concocted the trick used to smuggle the statues... I should already have the piece of evidence that shows who that is. I just have to present it. No matter what the cost!) Leads back to: \"There is a piece of evidence that will point us to who the mysterious mastermind is!\" Edgeworth: This smuggling could not have been possible without the use of the crossbow. Furthermore, the arrows that were shot by the crossbow... ...were plucked, as it were, from the flower box in this very room. They were planted so long ago that the passionflowers had the time to grow so big... ...that Ms. von Karma didn't even notice the arrows when she visited this room today! Lang: ............ Edgeworth: On top of all this, the fact that the culprit knew that both offices had ceiling fans... ...tells us that the person has very detailed information on the embassy's layout. So as you may have already guessed, the person I am accusing of hatching this plan... ...is the person who grew the flowers in the flower box with the utmost care. Thus, it can only be you! Quercus Alba! Franziska: ! Lang: ! Alba: .................. Franziska: Are you out of your mind, Miles Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: I'm certain of what I am saying, and I am sure that he is the culprit. Lang: Heh... Heh heh heh heh......... Haaa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Tell me, Mr. Prosecutor. What was the ambassador trying to accomplish by doing all that stuff you just outlined? Why in the world would he need to use a trick like that? Edgeworth: I understand your need to doubt me. However, there is one thing that stands out to me as very odd. Lang: Just one thing, huh? Edgeworth: (The one, single end result Ambassador Alba sought to obtain... If we were to examine the focus of this complex trick... ...I believe we will finally find the answer to everything!) Everything will become clear once we examine this piece of evidence! Present Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I would fully understand the reasoning had the situation been the reserve.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Lang: You want us to examine this? Edgeworth: Yes, for I believe that by examining it, we will finally have all of our answers. Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Items that become evidence should never have any part overlooked.\" All evidence related to this case are fine and don't need to be examined again! Edgeworth: Ack! (I-It would appear that I was mistaken... Agent Lang is correct... Most of the evidence has already undergone intense scrutiny. However, there is one piece that has only been partially checked... And that piece, which lies at the heart of the smuggling, is what I should present!) Leads back to: \"Everything will become clear once we examine this piece of evidence!\" Edgeworth: I would fully understand the reasoning had the situation been the reserve. However, to go through the trouble of swapping the real Primidux Statue for the fake... I sense a very shady reason for such a bizarre action! And who better to ask for that reason than King Primidux himself! Lang: I see... Ambassador, we'll be examining that statue now, with or without your permission! Alba: .............................. Examine head Leads to: \"Hmm... This guy kind of looks like the Steel Samurai, don't you think?\" Examine sword Edgeworth: With his sword drawn like that, there is an aura of valor and bravery around King Primidux. Kay: He looks so cool standing like that with the sword stuck in the ground in front of him. Maybe I should try and come up with some cool pose with a shuriken or something! Edgeworth: (I am seriously beginning to think that her real goal in life is to become a ninja.) Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. There isn't anything particularly odd about the sword, right? Edgeworth: No, not really. I suppose we should examine a different area of the statue now. Examine shield Edgeworth: A shield, huh... There doesn't seem to be anything unusual about it. Kay: I bet it's supposed to mean that the guy is protecting something! Edgeworth: I don't think it's supposed to have that deep of a meaning behind it. Kay: In that case, what are we wasting time with this for? Let's look at some other area! Examine handprint on bottom Edgeworth: These are Mr. Coachen's fingerprints. The fact that they're on here suggests that this statue once belong to Babahl. Kay: So it was smuggled from Babahl to Allebahst, huh? Edgeworth: (Why was there a need for them to smuggle it in?) Kay: Hmm... This guy kind of looks like the Steel Samurai, don't you think? Maybe it's because they look alike that he was picked to be the goodwill ambassador? Edgeworth: I suppose that's possible. ............Hm? Take a look at this area around the base of his neck. It looks like a gap. Kay: Hey! You're right! Maybe it's meant to be some kind of secret? Edgeworth: Perhaps it's possible to open the statue from this gap in its construction! Lang: What...!? Franziska: Hurry up and open it, Miles! Edgeworth: ...Alright, here goes. Kay: Wow! It really did open up! Hey, what's this thing that fell out? Edgeworth: Hm...? I believe a more thorough examination of it is required. Examine plate Leads to: \"What in the...!? Is this...!?\" Edgeworth: What in the...!? Is this...!? Lang: Hey! Is this what I think it is...!? Franziska: It's a plate... for making counterfeit bills! Edgeworth: Somehow... it appears that we've at long last arrived... ...at the exit to this complex labyrinth! We finally hold within our hands, one of the counterfeit money plates... ...and the reason why the replica was smuggled into Allebahst to begin with! Counterfeit Plate data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: The Primidux Statue can only be handled by the ambassador or the secretariat. And the replica is nothing more than a hollow shell covered in gold. These two circumstances make the statue the ideal object in which to hide contraband. After receiving the statue containing the counterfeit plate from Shih-na... ...the ambassador had the misfortune of accidentally running into DeMasque II. Surprised by the thief, the ambassador raised the replica statue at DeMasque II, and... Then, in order to frame the Steel Samurai of the murder... ...he covered the Samurai Sword in blood. Well, Ambassador Alba? Examine evidence Counterfeit Plate Front side Edgeworth: It's a counterfeit plate used to make counterfeit Zheng Fa bills. It's incredibly detailed, and even includes a phoenix taking off into the sky. With plates as finely crafted as these, it's no wonder the fakes are so hard to spot. Alba: .................. Lang: You're... the leader of the smuggling ring? My country is a mess... ...and it's all because of you!? Franziska: YOU'RE... the one who killed DeMasque II? Edgeworth: Answer us! Alba: ..................I never thought... I never thought... that you would figure things out to this level. Edgeworth: ...! Alba: However, there is one point I disagree with you on. The head of the smuggling ring was......... Mr. Coachen. Lang: Lang: Quite screwin' around! I have no sympathy for someone who would try to pass the guilt onto a dead man! If there is one thing I'm sure of, it's that you're the real ringleader, Quercus Alba! Alba: It's not good to speak with such subjectivity, you know, Agent Lang. Lang: \"Subjectivity\"? My conclusion is anything but, and is the result of logic and investigation! Alba: \"Logic and investigation\"? Only seconds ago, you were ready to arrest Ms. von Karma. I don't think we can give such flip-floppy logic any real weight, do you? Lang: Heh......... .........Heh heh heh... Haa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Alba: ? Edgeworth: ? Lang: It looks like you still don't get why I came back. Alba: Excuse me? Lang: You see, the reason I came back... ...is so that I could sink my fangs into your wrinkly, old neck! From the very beginning, my real target has been you! Alba: What? Franziska: Agent Lang! I demand an explanation! Lang: Sorry, sis. I didn't mean to put you through all that. I knew you were innocent from the very beginning. Franziska: You did...? Lang: I knew that this whole incident had been meticulously planned and prepared for. So naturally, the occupant of this room, Ambassador Alba, seemed the most suspicious. But without the ambassador's permission, we couldn't get in to take another look around! Edgeworth: Ah, so that's why you put on this big show to accuse Franziska of the murder! Using Franziska as the bait, you were able to gain us entry and investigative rights! Lang: Yeah, if I hadn't done that, I doubt the ambassador would've given the OK to poke around. Franziska: So that's what all this was about... Very well, I will forgive you. But in exchange for using me as bait... ...you will take some responsibility and help us find the truth! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, for giving me such a great opening... I thank you. Lang: ............You know, I just knew, Mr. Prosecutor... ...that somehow, if we were able to find some proof by investigating this room... ...that you would be able to figure out the real culprit with your special brand of logic. Edgeworth: Heh, the evidence detectives collect combined with the logic of a prosecutor... That's just as it should be in a \"prosecutor - detective team\", right? Lang: Tch. I don't know about all that! But one thing I do know is that I'm itching to see that old man get what's coming to him! Alba: Ho ho. You're quite scary when you want to be, aren't you? Lang: Hey, you were the one who was planning to use me to push all the guilt onto the sis. But unfortunately for you, you misjudged me! Alba: ..................Agent Lang, I wish for you to stop trying to intimidate me. What we need right now is evidence and proof. I wonder if you have what is necessary to prove that I am the head of the smuggling ring? Franziska: Franziska: Don't be such a sore loser! If you really are the head of the smuggling ring... ...then you should acknowledge your crimes with dignity! Alba: Dignity...? That is nothing more than a fool's insincere display of strength. If you really wish for me to acknowledge my crimes... ...then I would like to first see some of this thing you call \"evidence\". Franziska: Grr...! Alba: I tell you... I knew nothing. Really. I didn't even know that a counterfeit plate was hidden inside that statue. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You swapped a real statue that vested in your country the authority to rule for a sake. It doesn't make any sense that you didn't know anything! Alba: It doesn't make sense? Where doesn't it make sense? Can you prove that it doesn't make sense? Edgeworth: Gnnrk! Franziska: ...He's really got us. He's... turned the entire situation around against us. Alba: .................. Edgeworth: (The proof that Interpol has been after which points to this man as the ringleader... If we can somehow find that proof now, then we can see to it that justice is finally served! Is there nothing I can use to break this case wide open!?) ...! The trump card and the video tape... (With those two items... ...we might be able to finally bring this man down. But...! The card is evidence from a case that Mr. Faraday hid away in secret... ...and the tape was stolen by Detective Badd from the police. They're both illegal evidence! No matter what, a protector of the law can't be allowed to use such pieces of evidence!) Manfred: Needless to say... ...we Von Karmas are commanded to achieve nothing but victory! And by any means necessary! Badd: The only way to bring someone like that to justice was to do so outside of the courts... That's what we thought... at the time. Edgeworth: (I no longer follow the path of Manfred von Karma... ...and I won't follow the path of the Yatagarasu! This leaves me with what? What creed will I believe in? If I want to pursue the truth, then I will sully my hands in illegality... ...and if I want to pursue justice, then I will lose the truth! What is the \"law\", and what is \"justice\"? And which path is a \"prosecutor\" supposed to follow!? That choice... is one I must make by my own hand here and now!) Use the trump card Leads to: \"There is no limit to the law. Any limit that exists was set there by man.\" Don't use the trump card Edgeworth: (I am a prosecutor, and I can't allow myself to use evidence such as these!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! If you don't do something, Ambassador Alba is going to get away with it! Edgeworth: Nngh... I know, but... Franziska: Franziska: What are you holding back for? The only thing a Von Karma should pursue is the perfect proof. If you really do have what it takes to complete our argument... ...then there is absolutely no reason not to use it! Edgeworth: Nngh... Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says: \"The reason people judge people is because people are people.\" People weren't born to be chained to the law; laws were born to protect the people. You're the only one here right now who can put this guy out to pasture... ...and that is the only way a second or a third generation of Zheng Fa's people will be born. Can you really still hesitate knowing the fate of a nation rests in your hands? Edgeworth: I... Leads to: \"There is no limit to the law. Any limit that exists was set there by man.\" Edgeworth: (There is no limit to the law. Any limit that exists was set there by man. When a person goes beyond that limit, then the law, too, crosses into new territory! For what reason were laws invented? The answer to that is what I must now show!) Ambassador Alba. I wonder if you might recognize this. Alba: ...! Oh, I wonder what that card is? I've never seen that before in my life. Edgeworth: It's a directives card used by the leader of the ring to relay instructions to his subordinates. Alba: Oh? Is that what it is? Edgeworth: This card was sent to the real culprit behind the KG-8 Incident, ten years ago... A man by the name of Mr. Manny Coachen. Alba: .........Oh. So why do you have such a card in your possession? Edgeworth: Because it was hand-delivered to me... ...by a certain Great Thief... The Yatagarasu! Alba: The Yatagarasu gave that to you...? Don't talk nonsense, and let's be serious, Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof that the card contains directions from the ringleader? Edgeworth: I'll have you know that the card is not the only thing I was given! Alba: What!? Edgeworth: This contains security footage that was shot just before the start of the KG-8 Incident. Alba: ...The KG-8 Incident...? Edgeworth: The card and the video... These two pieces of evidence are what will seal your fate! Alba: ............Hoho, very interesting. I must admit I am very curious now. Very curious indeed in these \"case-deciding\" pieces of evidence you've presented. Edgeworth: (The prey the Yatagarasu has been chasing all this time... now stands before me. I can't allow this man, who has had free reign for ten long years, to simply walk away. Now is the time for me to bring to fruition the valiant spirit that was given to me!) March 15, 1:34 AM Theatrum Neutralis - Lobby Alba: So, what is this interesting thing that you wanted to show me? Edgeworth: (The trump card and the video tape... These two pieces of evidence together make for the ultimate hand! And this is where the real meaning behind Detective Badd's words will be realized!) Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: What you see here is security footage shot just before the KG-8 murder occurred. From this footage, we know that the card is a directives card from the smuggling ring. This is the section that proves that the card was used to relay an order! Present black card Edgeworth: Leads to: \"As you can see, Mr. Coachen is holding the card in his right hand.\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Take a look at this area. Alba: What about that area...? My eyes aren't what they used to be, so I can't see what you're pointing at too well. But from what I can see, it doesn't look like it's related to our conversation... Edgeworth: Nngh...! (It's unrelated...!? I need to remain calm and take another look at this footage. What is the vital clue that shows us that the card was used to relay an order!?) Leads back to: \"This is the section that proves that the card was used to relay an order!\" Edgeworth: As you can see, Mr. Coachen is holding the card in his right hand. Alba: I see. The killer is indeed holding a card with the exact same design on it. But the card and the one you have... Just because they look the same, doesn't mean that they are, does it now? Edgeworth: Ah, but there is a very easy way for me to prove that they are, in fact, one and the same. All we have to do is simply take a look at this! Examine bloodstain Leads to: \"This dark red blood... Yes, this is your proof.\" Examine raven Edgeworth: According to Detective Badd... ...Ambassador Alba's directive cards bear the mark of a three-legged raven... ...or in other words, a yatagarasu. I suppose this mark was the inspiration for their group's name, the Yatagarasu. Examine text Edgeworth: A section of the text has been obscured by blood, but it's clear the writing is Cohdopian. According to Detective Badd... ...\"Silence Cece Yew\"... ...is what is written here... ...along with the method to be used and where she lived. The evil intent displayed in this writing will not go unpunished! Edgeworth: This dark red blood... Yes, this is your proof. Proof that the orders on this card were played out in that terrible tragedy! The blood belonged to the victim of the KG-8 Incident. With a bit of DNA testing, we can very easily verify that as fact. Alba: .................. Edgeworth: If you have no objections... ...then I'd like for you to take a look at this next piece of footage! This car that passed by in front of the victim's apartment building... It's an official Cohdopian government car. Alba: Wh-What!? Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe! If you could please magnify the footage! This area of the footage directly links the smuggling ring with Cohdopia! Present front pocket Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The shape of this pocket...\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This section will make it all clear to us! Alba: .........You must be very tired, Mr. Edgeworth. If you continue presenting completely irrelevant evidence like this... ...I'm afraid your investigation may fall apart. Perhaps it is time for you to retire. Edgeworth: W-Wait! (Arngh! But I was so sure it was this area...! Alright, focus, Miles. The area I should be pointing out is definitely here!) Leads back to: \"This area of the footage directly links the smuggling ring with Cohdopia!\" Edgeworth: The shape of this pocket... and the directives card in it... It tells us that without a doubt, this person in this car is Mr. Coachen! Alba: ...Gnrk! Edgeworth: The license plate on the car was also captured by the security camera. And with it, we can easily find out who was sitting in this car on that day, ten years ago. Alba: Gnnrgh! Edgeworth: Which is why I can say with confidence that you were riding in this car on that day! Alba: Arnnnnnnnnnnnnngh! ..................Hah. Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah! You've done well, boy, to make it this far. However...! About your claim that I was riding in the car at the time... That's going to be mighty difficult to prove. Edgeworth: How so? Alba: The Principality of Cohdopia no longer exists. So naturally, all records from that time period also no longer exist. Edgeworth: (Nngh! That arrogance... What he really means is he's already erased all traces of them!) Alba: Are we finished here, boy? Edgeworth: (The only weapon I have left to me now... is this piece of footage! There must be something here that I can use against him!) Present medal Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Wh-What the...!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Franziska, what do you think about this area? Franziska: If you have to confer with someone, then it's obviously a useless piece of logic! Edgeworth: Gnnoooh! (Arngh! She's right. The only logic that can trap Ambassador Alba is a perfectly iron-clad one. There must be something here in this footage! There must be something that shows that Ambassador Alba was riding in the car that day! No matter how insignificant it may seem, a clue must be hiding here, and I must find it.) Leads back to: \"There must be something here that I can use against him!\" Edgeworth: Wh-What the...! Ambassador Alba! Alba: Yes, what is it? Edgeworth: You were once an army man in the service of Cohdopia. And it was you who made the many missions you participated in successes, correct? Alba: Hmph. Why the sudden back-handed praises, boy? Although, to be sure... ...the brilliant medals on my breast were awarded to me during the era of Cohdopia. But now, I am the only one who owns this particular medal. Edgeworth: In that case... the only person it could be who is sitting in this car is you! Alba: How do you figure that!? Edgeworth: By the medal captured here in this footage! It is clearly the same exact medal as the one on your chest! Alba: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (This is how it will be... But I won't look back. For this is the path that I have chosen!) Alba: Gnnrrr... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. You've moved me with your devotion to this case, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Why is he taking such an arrogant stance with me?) Alba: It's almost looking possible, isn't it? For the lot of you to have come this far... It looks like I just might lose our little game this time. Lang: You might lose the game \"this time\"...? You don't get another round, Mr. Ambassador! Alba: Is that a fact? ...Very well. I've decided to confess and admit my guilt. Franziska: You're... going to confess? Alba: And I will accept whatever punishment that may come as a result. Lang: What the...? Alba: Regarding the DeMasque II murder, I admit it... I did it out of self-defense. Edgeworth: You're claiming it was justified self-defense!? Alba: DeMasque II attacked me, and I felt that my life was in danger. If I hadn't done what I did, I might be the one you found dead instead of him. Lang: Haa ha ha ha ha ha ha! What a pathetic performance! Alba: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! I'm not giving you one! Kay: Wow, you two really know how to laugh at inappropriate times! Edgeworth: If you wish to claim it was justified self-defense, then we will need some evidence. Alba: It's always the evidence with you, isn't it? But if that's what you require, I'll provide it. That man left a mark on me when he attacked! Edgeworth: What!? Alba: I don't particularly want to show it off, but this is proof that it was in self-defense. I'm an old man, and sometimes I don't pay enough attention when I should... Franziska: But DeMasque II didn't have a single weapon on his body! Alba: Hold on. It's nothing to get worked up over, because... I hid the weapon. Franziska: You hid it? Alba: I'm sorry, but as you know, a murder is a murder, even if it's in self-defense. And I couldn't let it become public, seeing as how I AM an ambassador... This is the weapon you seek, my special bonsai trimming shears. Kay: Oongh... It's covered in blood. Alba: He was trembling quite badly during our struggle... ...but that's when he grabbed the shears that were sitting in my office and attacked. So you see, it was an act of self-defense. Kay: Is he right, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Since he has both a wound and the weapon that caused it, it's enough to declare it so. Amb. Alba's Wound data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: N-No way...! Alba: Oh, which reminds me. I guess there is still one more accusation I need to resolve. Smuggling and counterfeiting. Unfortunately, all of that is my secretary's doing. I had no knowledge it was going on. Lang: Lang: Stop spewing nonsense! You're trying to throw my investigation under the bus in your desperation. If you want to get real honest... ...everything in this case can be connected to you! Franziska: The murder of DeMasque II was done in self-defense...!? In my trials, no man escapes his crime alive! Alba: Perhaps so, if you were my opponent in court. However, there is one very important fact that I think you may have forgotten. Edgeworth: And what is that...? .................. A.........Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Lang: Arngh! That's what you mean! Extraterritoriality...! Alba: That's right. This embassy sits on what is effectively Allebahstian soil. So any trial that is to be held will be held in Allebahst. Therefore, the crime I just admitted to will never be tried in your courts. Edgeworth: Agent Lang! What is Interpol's stance on this!? Lang: Agents investigate. That's our job. The judgment of people who have confessed to their crime... that's the court's job. Edgeworth: Gnnrk! Alba: And I've already confessed to all of my crimes, Agent Lang. Furthermore, by the very nature of my position, I have full extraterritorial rights. These rights are effective, even on your country's soil. Therefore... ...no matter where a crime may take place, I will never stand trial in one of your courts! Lang: That arrogance... and your expression... That's nothing like the face of someone who is ready to accept the consequences. Don't tell me you have your own country's judicial system eating right out of your hands! Alba: These \"crimes\" you all speak so seriously of... To me, this has all been nothing more than a game. You may chase me out of this embassy with your accusations... ...but it's no big deal. Allebahst has numerous other embassies in other countries around the world. All you would accomplish is you would change the backdrop of our little game! Edgeworth: (These two layers of protection that extraterritoriality provides him... This is why he is one of those who cannot be brought to court!) Alba: You see now, don't you? I live in a whole different world than you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go and fetch your eviction papers. Edgeworth: Arngh! Is there nothing we can do!? To be continued. March 15, 2:11 AM Theatrum Neutralis - Lobby Gumshoe: I can't believe it, sir! Extraterritoriality... Edgeworth: Yes... and there is nothing we can really do about that. In the end, we didn't have enough authority to bring him to justice. Kay: I can't believe that even though we know he's the boss, we can't lay a finger on him! Edgeworth: I know... Lang: .................. Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, sorry to skip out on you, but I've got some business to take care of. Kay: If we can't even give an evil guy like him a slap on the wrist... ...then what the heck were laws created for!? What good are they!? If the law can't help us... ...then I'll go as the Yatagarasu, and take care of this myself! Edgeworth: Don't you dare! Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ...Sorry, that was a bit too harsh. Gumshoe: I know how you feel, sir. We're trying to take on an ambassador, after all. And he did tell us earlier to get out of the theater. This is kinda their country, I guess... ...but I feel like I've been slapped across the face for just doing my job. Edgeworth: (What... am I going to do? Should I retreat for now, and formulate a better plan of attack...?) ???: Kay: Come on, everyone! We can't give up yet! Edgeworth: Kay...? Kay: I want you to think about something for a sec! We've never let up for even a second, and as long as we don't stop investigating... ...we might find the \"rotten\" treasure hidden here! Gumshoe: Sh-She's right! Kay: Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ...You're right, Kay. Very well. Let us re-open the investigation and see what we find. Come on, Kay! Kay: Right behind you! Gumshoe: OK! Then I'll go check out Babahl a bit more, sir! Franziska: And I have something that I need to investigate further in Allebahst. Edgeworth: (Now then... ...before I gather any more information, I should do a bit of housekeeping.) Passionflowers data erased from my Organizer. Begin Investigation Theatrum Neutralis - Lobby Edgeworth: Ambassador Alba seemed agitated (Agitated Alba - I sense that there is something he doesn't want us to investigate.) over something. Kay: I wonder why? Edgeworth: There are two special circumstances that surround the ambassador. First, the embassy itself has extraterritorial rights. If something happens on Allebahstian soil... ...we are unable to legally prosecute him. Kay: Cool! It sounds like embassies are the perfect place to steal whatever you want! Edgeworth: ...And murder DeMasque II, run a smuggling operation, and make counterfeit bills apparently. Kay: But I thought all the counterfeiting was done by Mr. Coachen in Babahl? Edgeworth: Yes, he apparently used the embassy's coupon printing press (Coachen's counterfeiting op. - Used Babahlese Embassy's printing press and Babahlese ink to make counterfeit bills.) to do it. But it's the same story over there anyway. Babahl also has extraterritorial rights. Which brings me to my next point: the ambassador's extraterritorial rights. Those rights are effective even in our own country. Kay: Really? Edgeworth: No matter what happens, he can never be tried in our courts. He retains some very special rights, indeed. Basically, no matter what wrongs he may commit, we can't bring him to trial here. Kay: So I guess we really don't stand a chance, do we? Edgeworth: Hmm... We might stand a chance if we can somehow nullify either one of his special rights. Talk Guard by left door Guard: On the orders of Ambassador Alba, no one is allowed into Allebahst. Edgeworth: Nngh! But I thought a lady with a whip passed through here not too long ago. Guard: She is from Interpol, and had the proper paperwork... ...so, while I was reluctant, I had to let her in. Edgeworth: (Heh... Sounds like Franziska alright.) Guard: Besides... if I didn't... that whip of hers... Edgeworth: (.........Yup, definitely Franziska...) Guard by right door Guard: Hello! And welcome to the Embassy of Babahl! Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but I don't really need to enter your country at this time. Guard: Right now, for a limited time here at the Babahlese Embassy... ...we're offering the very special \"Experience the Terrifying Fire's Ashes Tour!\" So, how about it? Shall I sign you up? Edgeworth: ...We're fine, thanks. (We have an investigation to run.) Examine Black backdrop Edgeworth: It's a backdrop they used in the Steel Samurai stage show today. Kay: I loved the climax of that show! \"Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!\" That was the first time I'd seen that special move! But, well, the Jammin' Ninja stage show's climax was much better, of course. Edgeworth: ...Oh, is that a fact? Kay: That scene where he sang for Princess Misola and gave her those hair sticks? I could totally feel the love there in my heart! Edgeworth: (Hmm... Perhaps the Jammin' Ninja is just more popular with female audiences...?) Flowers on left side Edgeworth: Flowers were sent by a variety of people and businesses to celebrate the goodwill event. Even the Steel Samurai received some flowers from the ambassadors. Kay: There are so many bouquets here, it's like a wedding ceremony! Edgeworth: I believe the flowers for those are for a slightly different reason... Kay: What do you mean!? This event was supposed to be like a wedding between Allebahst and Babahl, right? Edgeworth: ...Actually, I believe they're more in a state of divorce. Kay: OK, then! This event was supposed to be their remarriage ceremony! Edgeworth: Hmm... I suppose you could call it that. Photo Edgeworth: This was taken just before the two ambassadors gave their bouquets to the Steel Samurai. (Wait, is it just my imagination... ...or is there something in this picture that I've seen before...? I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Examine Quercus Alba's face Kay: I can't believe he was pretending to be a harmless old grandpa. Talk about deceptive! Edgeworth: I don't suppose anyone expected him to change that drastically... Kay: I bet he's thinking of something evil behind that cheery smile! Edgeworth: Kay, please try to remain calm and focused on the here and now. Kay: Yeah, you're right. Sorry I got all worked up there. Well, the only way we're going to be able to steal the truth is if we keep on investigating! Quercus Alba's bouquet Edgeworth: It appears to be a bouquet of Persian cyclamens and roses. Kay: Wow! You even know the exact species!? I never would've figured you for an expert on flowers! Edgeworth: Nnnnngh... (It's all because of those flowers that old lady sends me every month... Just look at me; I sound like some sort of botanist!) Kay: So, umm, what exactly is this yellow flower here? Edgeworth: Hmm... That one... I'm not sure. Kay: What!? You don't know!? Edgeworth: (As far as I can recall, I've never seen a flower like this before. But I feel as though I've seen this shape somewhere before...) Steel Samurai Edgeworth: There's that troublemaker, standing there smack in the center making two peace signs. Kay: Wow, the Steel Samurai stands out even more than the two ambassadors in this picture! Oh, hey! The person playing the Steel Samurai is one of your friends, right? Edgeworth: ..................No, I have no idea who he is. Kay: Wait! But you just said \"he\"! You knew which gender he was, so you MUST know him, right!? Edgeworth: I beg that you please refrain from talking about that person with me ever again. Colias Palaeno's face Kay: Mr. Palaeno has a really great smile, don't you think!? I bet he was really happy that they were going to become Cohdopia again! Edgeworth: Perhaps... But instead, he became the greatest victim in today's case. An ambassador like him who is always thinking of his country is really to be admired. Kay: Yeah. Although this happened, I hope they'll be able to reunite the country someday. Edgeworth: I hope so as well, but for that to happen, we need to solve this case first. We need to see to it that those who would harm the new Cohdopia are locked away. Kay: And we will! Colias Palaeno's bouquet Edgeworth: Hmm... It seems that lilies are at the center of this bouquet, with an accent of chamomile. Kay: Wow... I can totally smell the wonderful fragrance! Edgeworth: Kay... this is just a picture. Kay: Argh! Look, I know that! But it's nice to imagine things once in a while, ya know? Where's your sense of empathy!? Edgeworth: If you can smell the fragrance of flowers from a photo, that's more like a \"hallucination\". Kay: ! Y-You don't have to be mean about it... Edgeworth: Hmph... Let's just drop this before it's in full bloom. Deduce Quercus Alba's bouquet (after examining Quercus Alba's bouquet) Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Present Allebahstian Knife Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Babahl's national symbol is the butterfly, and Allebahst's is the flower...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Could this piece of evidence be related to this photo somehow? Kay: Huh? Well... Nope! I don't think it's related at all! Edgeworth: (Even though I know she's right, she could have at least tried to humor me a little.) Leads back to examination of photo Edgeworth: Babahl's national symbol is the butterfly, and Allebahst's is the flower... It would appear that someone is employing the old \"hide a tree in a forest\" trick. Kay: What are you mumbling to yourself about...? Wait, what? The handle on this knife... Aaaaaah! Edgeworth: Yes, it's the handle that was supposed to be on the blade that killed Mr. Coachen. The weapon that killed him was carried through the Theatrum Neutralis... ...in the very bouquet Ambassador Alba was carrying! Commemorative Photo data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Hm? The flower motif... It looks like one of the flower petals is missing. Kay: Ooh! And take a look at the weapon itself! It's missing the exact same petal! Edgeworth: Then the knife in this photo is most definitely the same as this murder weapon. Allebahstian Knife data updated in my Organizer. Photo (after correctly deducing Quercus Alba's bouquet) Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Quercus Alba's bouquet Edgeworth: It appears to be a bouquet of Persian cyclamens and roses. Kay: Wow! You even know the exact species!? I never would've figured you for an expert on flowers! Edgeworth: Nnnnngh... (It's all because of those flowers that old lady sends me every month... Just look at me; I sound like some sort of botanist!) Window by right door Edgeworth: You can see the Babahlese Embassy, which is undergoing major renovations. From room expansions to garden upkeep, it looks like a lot of construction is going on. Kay: Mr. Palaeno said that all this work is really hard on him. He said that since Mr. Coachen passed away, that maybe I could work part-time for him. Edgeworth: (She got really chummy with that ambassador...) Kay: What can I say? I just have a good nose for money! Logic Connect \"Renovations\" and \"Coachen's counterfeiting op.\" Edgeworth: We know that the counterfeit bills were printed using the embassy's press... ...but the necessary materials, such as the Babahlese ink and paper... ...must have been hidden in a secure location. But what do you think would've happened if the renovation had begun? Kay: Well, he probably had to find a better hiding place, or get rid of it all. Edgeworth: Right, so we can assume that the renovation was the cause of the plate and bills disposal. And the reason Mr. Coachen was killed as the \"ringleader\" of the smuggling operation. ...Based on what we know, who do you think was the one with the most to gain? Colias Palaeno Edgeworth: The answer is Ambassador Palaeno. Kay: Y-You really think so!? But he was the one who had his embassy's offices burned down... ...and he lost his secretary. Do you really think he profited from any of that? Edgeworth: Hmm... Now that you mention it, perhaps not... (She's right... Ambassador Palaeno has gained absolutely nothing from the events of tonight. With that being the case, there really is only one man who gained from everything!) Leads back to: \"...Based on what we know, who do you think was the one with the most to gain?\" Manny Coachen Edgeworth: The answer is Mr. Coachen himself. Kay: Umm... He was the smuggling ring's boss, right? So maybe he had a lot to gain because of all the money...? But in the end, he was killed... It's kind of sad, really. Edgeworth: Hmm... I suppose there is some truth in that. (No matter how much he may have profited in life, he really didn't gain much in his death. With that being the case, there really is only one man who gained from everything!) Leads back to: \"...Based on what we know, who do you think was the one with the most to gain?\" Quercus Alba Leads to: \"It's the one person who has been erasing all evidence of the smuggling operation...\" Edgeworth: It's the one person who has been erasing all evidence of the smuggling operation... ...from both embassies, the co-conspirator who is mopping up, Ambassador Alba. Ambassador Alba had a very strong motive to kill Manny Coachen (Motive to kill Coachen - Alba could conveniently place all of the guilt for the smuggling onto Coachen.)! Connect \"Agitated Alba\" and \"Motive to kill Coachen\" Edgeworth: The cause of Ambassador Alba's agitation, the \"rotten\" treasure we may find... ...and the motive for killing Mr. Coachen... Ms. Yew said it herself that she didn't kill anyone tonight. If we were to take her words at face value... ...then the reason for the ambassador's nervousness can only be one thing. He didn't want us to discover the real circumstances under which Mr. Coachen was killed. Kay: Then you mean, Ambassador Alba is the real killer? But I thought the two of them were friends? Edgeworth: Maybe they were, but what if Mr. Coachen was the one who first betrayed their friendship? Kay: Oh, I get it! Wasn't Mr. Coachen pushing really hard for Mr. Palaeno... ...to be ambassador after the reunification? Edgeworth: Yes, and that was the real reason why he wanted to steal Allebahst's Primidux Statue. Kay: So Mr. Coachen hired DeMasque II to go steal it for him... ...but when Ambassador Alba found out what he was up to, he killed Mr. Coachen? Edgeworth: It is definitely a possibility at this point. Kay: Those two really were thinking of no one but themselves. But the question now is \"how did he do it?\" Ambassador Alba was in Allebahst... ...but Mr. Coachen's body was discovered in Babahl, right? Edgeworth: Right. And that is what we must solve next. Partner Talk The investigation Kay: We've come too far to give up! We must expose Ambassador Alba's misdeeds, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes, of course. Kay: And we've gotta find a way to steal the truth and get it out there... for my father's sake! Edgeworth: ...Yes, and we will. (The reason for Ambassador Alba's nervousness must still be here somewhere. Furthermore, I need to pin down exactly what happened in here... I'll start by thoroughly examining this room for any information I can find.) Agitated Alba? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! If you don't pay attention, Ambassador Alba is gonna get away! Edgeworth: Y-Yes, I know. Kay: Now hurry up and do that *schwing!* thing you always do! Edgeworth: I have no idea what you are talking about... Kay: What!? You don't!? Oh, come on, you know what I'm talking about! That thing you do! Edgeworth: ...Are you talking about \"Logic\"...? Kay: Yes! That's it! So hurry up and let's *schwing!* already! Edgeworth: A-Alright, alright... (To be honest, it's been a bit hard to connect everything up until now by just looking. However, I should be able to piece things together if I take another look at my leads. Perhaps now is the time to use logic and reason my way to the truth!) Present Video Tape Kay: Uncle Badd entrusted you with this piece of evidence, Mr. Edgeworth. I think he believes that you're the one who will finally bring the truth to light. Edgeworth: ......... Kay: And I believe in you, too, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Kay... After connecting all possible Logic and correctly deducing Quercus Alba's bouquet in photo: Edgeworth: I believe we now understand... ...why Ambassador Alba was so nervous and agitated. It must have something to do with where Mr. Coachen was killed. A place where the Allebahstian ambassador was likely to meet the Babahlese Mr. Coachen. The place where Ambassador Alba happened to have committed the murder is...? Present Theatrum Neutralis Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The only place that makes sense is here, at the Theatrum Neutralis.\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This area is rather suspicious, don't you think? Kay: You really think so? Because I don't see anything odd about it at all! Edgeworth: Nngh... (I guess it's not related after all...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! If you keep doing that, Ambassador Alba is going to get away! Come on! Let's see if we can't get a hold of that treasure known as the truth! Edgeworth: Agreed. Let's see what we can find. Leads back to: \"The place where Ambassador Alba happened to have committed the murder is...?\" Edgeworth: The only place that makes sense is here, at the Theatrum Neutralis. Kay: What? Here? Edgeworth: The goodwill event was being held here today, correct? So the only place that the both of them would have been in is here. Kay: But if that's the case, then everything changes. The theater isn't actually Allebahstian land... ...so that wipes out one of those extraterritorial rights he has! Edgeworth: It makes logical sense, in which case, it is a reason for us to investigate further. Kay: So what should we check out? Edgeworth: Let's see... I believe we should check the immigration records for both Allebahst and Babahl posthaste! Babahl's records should be easy to obtain, however, the problem will be Allebahst. I wonder if they would allow us to see their records, despite the order to vacate... Franziska: Franziska: I'm already one step ahead of you, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Franziska. Franziska: I have here, the security footage from both Allebahst and Babahl. You would do well to take a look at its contents. Security Footage data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: You move fast. Franziska: A Von Karma strives to be perfect in every way! It's not in my nature to keep on retreating like this. I took the liberty of looking over the Babahl investigation reports as well. From now on, you will make no excuse to back down or say that we can't solve this case! Edgeworth: Nngh... I'm sorry about earlier. Franziska: We won't be beaten. Because my cute little subordinate is going to try his very best, isn't he? Edgeworth: (Hasn't she patronized me enough already for a lifetime?) So this video contains footage from Allebahst's immigration screening area? Kay: I really hope there's something in here that we can use! Edgeworth: Which minute's footage should I examine? 5:21 PM Examine timestamp Edgeworth: 5:21 PM... Kay: That's just after the end of the Steel Samurai stage show. Edgeworth: Correct. Kay: We were still inside the theater itself at around this time. All because Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't get out of his seat. Edgeworth: Hmph. I wanted to show the actors my appreciation for a bit and soak in the atmosphere. Kay: Yeah, with your eyes closed and a complete lack of motion except for some breathing. Examine officer Franziska: This man is the immigration officer who was on duty. Kay: He's making a really scary face... even though there's no one around to see it. Franziska: I wonder if he's just the grumpy sort? Although, that wouldn't do much for tourism. Kay: Hey! He smiled a little just now! Franziska: I wonder if he recalled something funny? Kay: Well, even if he did, he still has that hard glare in his eyes. Edgeworth: It would appear that he was born with stern-looking eyes. Franziska: Rather fitting for someone in the security business, I'd say. Examine posters Kay: Ooh, I don't remember all these posters! I wonder what they're of? Edgeworth: Hmm, I do remember a bunch of these hanging in that hallway. Franziska: I believe they were all related to tourism and sightseeing. Edgeworth: In Allebahst? Impossible! If it were Babahl, I could believe that, however... Franziska: No, no. They were posters promoting tourist traps in this country! And I believe they were mostly of Gatewater Land. Edgeworth: I see. So they were targeted at the embassy's staff... Examine door Edgeworth: It's the door leading into the Theatrum Neutralis. Kay: I tried so hard to get through this door, you know, but I just couldn't get in. But it felt soooo great when I finally was allowed to go through there! You know what I really wanted to do, though? I wanted to try sneaking my way in! Edgeworth: (*sigh* At least nothing seems out of the ordinary with the door.) 5:22 PM Examine timestamp Edgeworth: 5:22 PM. At around this time, the Steel Samurai stage show had come to an end... ...and Ambassador Alba was making his way back to his office. Kay: And then later, he shook hands with the Steel Samurai in his office... ...and then, he was going to give a speech in the rose garden. Being an ambassador sounds like a busy, busy job! It's like someone is always stealing your time away! Edgeworth: Yes, I'd imagine it's something like that. (But despite how busy he was, he still managed to find the time to kill Mr. Coachen... ...and move his body somehow from the Theatrum Neutralis.) Examine officer Franziska: This man is the immigration officer who was on duty. Kay: He's making the exact same scary face that he was making a minute ago! Wait. Is it just me, or is he blushing? Franziska: It appears that he gets flustered around the ambassador. Kay: I guess the ambassador's well-respected inside Allebahst, too. Edgeworth: You could say that. The guard doesn't appear to be capable of looking at the ambassador. Examine posters Franziska: Those are posters of this country's tourist spots, though most are of Gatewater Land. Kay: I wonder if Allebahstians in general like theme parks at all? Franziska: The guard who stopped you has been to Gatewater Land a number of times, apparently. Kay: I guess they don't have theme parks in Allebahst, huh? Examine Quercus Alba Edgeworth: I can't believe how completely fooled I was by the way he carried himself. Franziska: He had me fooled, too... According to the files I had sent for earlier, Ambassador Alba... ...was a Cohdopian hero. He saved the royal family from danger countless times. So what bothers me is why would a man like that create a smuggling ring...? Even with all the authority I have, I still haven't been able to figure out why. Edgeworth: (It sounds like the ambassador was a hero who was corrupted by evil. But no matter what happened in the past, we can't let the man he is now escape justice!) Examine door Edgeworth: It's the door leading into the Theatrum Neutralis. Kay: The more the guy tried to keep me out, the more I wanted to get in! It's human nature! But I guess I can't complain too much. I did get let inside in the end. Edgeworth: (*sigh* At least nothing seems out of the ordinary with the door.) 5:23 PM Examine cart Leads to: \"Doesn't something about this lump's shape strike you as odd?\" Examine timestamp Edgeworth: 5:23 PM... This is just after the end of the Steel Samurai stage show... ...and after I had been given that autograph. Kay: You totally had stars in your eyes at that time, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: I-I most certainly did not! Franziska: You had stars in your eyes because of an autograph you received from that man...? Miles Edgeworth... You've just lost any respect I had left for you. Edgeworth: (I believe it's time to change the subject.) Examine officer Edgeworth: It appears that he is inspecting the person coming into the country. Kay: Are you kidding!? It's more like he's NOT checking the Steel Samurai! Hmph! And then they gave me such a hard time! Edgeworth: Hmm... There ARE certain risks involved when you give some people preferential treatment. Examine posters Edgeworth: There certainly is a variety of posters on this wall. Kay: It's kinda hard to see what's written on them, so they just look festive, you know? Franziska: Those are all tourism posters for this country, although most are of Gatewater Land. Kay: I wonder if any Allebahstians actually go to Gatewater Land for fun? It's just really hard to imagine them hanging out there. Edgeworth: True, they do seem to be a nation of extremely serious people... Examine Steel Samurai Edgeworth: On the outside, he may look like the Steel Samurai, but on the inside, it's just Larry. Franziska: Other than the fact that it's that good-for-nothing, nothing else seems out of order. Edgeworth: Wait. You know as well as I that anything can happen if he's involved. Franziska: You're not suggesting that someone else could be under that mask, are you? Edgeworth: No, I don't think that. Just before he entered here, he gave me an autograph, so I'm certain it's Larry under there. Examine door Edgeworth: It's the door connecting that hallway and this theater. Nothing appears to be out of the ordinary. Franziska: Indeed. Edgeworth: Doesn't something about this lump's shape strike you as odd? Kay: Huh? Isn't it supposed to be this shape? Edgeworth: No, there is clearly something odd about the bulge. If only we had the pushcart itself, we could compare and confirm my hunch... Pushcart data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Next, let us check the footage from Babahl's security camera. Kay: I hope it shows us something good. ...Phooey. There wasn't a single sign of a suspicious person or anything. Edgeworth: That, right there, is the contradiction. Kay: Huh? Did I miss something? Edgeworth: You didn't miss anything... because there was nothing to miss. However, what IS missing is the image of Mr. Coachen entering his own country. Kay: But wasn't his body found in Babahl? Edgeworth: It would appear that the true face of our final puzzle has finally revealed itself. Investigation Complete Edgeworth: ! Ambassador Alba...! Alba: I thought I had asked for you and your group to vacate the premises, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Actually, I thought I should let you know that this theater sits on my country's soil. Alba: You've had your fun, and I've enjoyed our little game. I dare say that you've even achieved a new high score. However, once you've recorded a score, that same game can never be replayed again. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Your game is done, and it's game over. Edgeworth: No...! Franziska: Franziska: Where do you think you're going at this time of night? Alba: After admitting to my crime, I was overcome with regret. So I am heading to the airport now to return home. Edgeworth: I'm afraid I can't let you do that. There are still too many issues we need to discuss with you. Alba: You can't stop me, Mr. Edgeworth, and you know it. Edgeworth: Arngh...! ???: Palaeno: Please, may I have a little bit of your time, Ambassador Alba? Alba: Ambassador Palaeno...! Palaeno: Even just a teeny-tiny bit is fine with me. The already strained relationship between our countries is in a precarious situation, you know. Alba: .........Very well. If you insist. I will play just one more round with them, and see what they want. .........Not that they'll get any farther. Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno... Palaeno: Mr. Edgeworth... All I wish for is the normalization of relationships between our two countries. But there is one person standing in the way of that dream. I... I believe in you. You'll do what's right. Edgeworth: ...Thank you for your vote of confidence. Alba: Now then, what was it you wanted to ask me about? I do have a flight to catch, after all. So I'm afraid I'm going to have to limit you to just one question. Edgeworth: That's more than enough, because I only have one question anyway. I want to hear your alibi, about how you couldn't have killed Mr. Manny Coachen! Alba: Ho! I see... You seem to have a good hand this time around. This should be fun. Edgeworth: (This really is the very last chance we have to bring him down. I won't allow even an atom-sized contradiction to slip by!) Testimony -- Ambassador Alba's Alibi -- Alba: Frankly, I still don't understand why I am being placed under suspicion here. Under your hypothetical scenario, Mr. Coachen and I were fellow smugglers. But to get to the point, I was in Allebahst the whole time. So, it's simply not possible for me to have killed him in Babahl. That is my alibi. Edgeworth: ...So that is your alibi? Alba: That is correct. It's simply not possible for me to have committed a crime in Babahl. Now that we cleared that up, I'd appreciate it if you would move out of my way. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I said, \"Hold it!\" Alba: What is it this time? I thought I told you I'd only allow one question. Edgeworth: Hmph... You did, but you still have yet to really answer my one question. Alba: What...? Edgeworth: Until you tell us the truth... I will refuse to budge an inch from where I'm standing! Alba: Hmph... Very well. I'll play with you just a little longer. Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! As my subordinate, and representative of this country's prosecutors... ...you are forbidden to lose! Edgeworth: Of course. That is something I've understood from the start. Kay: ...That guy's the one who... ordered my father killed, isn't he? Edgeworth: ...Yes, I believe so. Kay: The goal of the first Yatagarasu was the capture of the smuggling ring's leader. My father and Uncle Badd... Their legacy will live on... through me! So that's why we've just got to catch him, OK!? Edgeworth: We will. I promise. Now, Ambassador Alba, let's have at the truth now, shall we!? Alba: Heh heh heh... No matter how many times you ask, my answer remains the same. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Being the leader of a smuggling ring while taking on the duties of ambassadorship... Don't you think that the combination is more than enough reason for suspicion? Then there is the matter of the crossbow arrows and the Primidux Statues... Alba: Alba: All of that is nothing more than your flights of fancy. Edgeworth: What do you mean by that!? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It's not a hypothesis! Earlier, we proved it to be what happened. Alba: Ha ha ha... Well, let's leave that to one side for now. Because it doesn't change the fact that I have no motive. Edgeworth: Oh? So you really had no reason to kill Mr. Coachen? Alba: If you want to suppose I had one, then why not. I'll indulge you. After all, this is nothing more than a silly game to me. Edgeworth: Even if that's how you see things, I'd appreciate it if you would take me seriously. Alba: Gwah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haaa! Ahem, I'm sorry. I suppose you are in a bit of a pickle. Very well. A game is no fun if the playing field isn't level. Therefore, I formally claim that I had no motive to kill. Now, let's see you disprove it. Edgeworth: (How can he stand there looking proud when he knows he killed another human being? Well, I'm not going to stand by and just watch him get away with his crimes!) Adds statement \"In that case, what motive would I have had to kill my co-conspirator?\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you serious that just because you were partners, that you had no motive to kill? Alba: I'm only following your hypothetical scenario to its logical conclusion. Haaa ha ha ha ha! Kay: Looks like he's not going to admit it himself that he was in league with Mr. Coachen. Edgeworth: I suppose not. But I do know his relation to the smuggling ring, and to Mr. Coachen. Kay: You mean, he's the ringleader, and that Mr. Coachen was his subordinate, right? Edgeworth: Correct, but I know more than just that. Ms. von Karma, I'm sure you remember the safe in Mr. Coachen's office, correct? Franziska: Yes... The safe had two compartments to it, didn't it? Edgeworth: Yes, and why do you think those stolen goods were being stored in Mr. Coachen's office? Could it be because he was trying to cheat Ambassador Alba behind his back? Franziska: So Mr. Coachen didn't turn the goods over, but decided instead to keep them for himself? I suppose that's possible. Edgeworth: Hmm, it seems to me that both men were only concerned with their own wealth and wellbeing. Kay: Then that means that maybe they didn't have a trusting relationship after all. Edgeworth: What Ambassador Alba had to gain... I believe that is his motive for killing Mr. Coachen! Alba: ...What are you people whispering about amongst yourselves over there? Edgeworth: Ah, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. Now then, let's continue with your testimony! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And what exactly did you do while you were in Allebahst? Alba: I had a meeting with the Steel Samurai, and then I arranged a few files. Around that time, that thief who was sneaking in took me by surprise. Franziska: Franziska: Are you saying that it was DeMasque II that made the first move!? Alba: Yes, and it was after I was attacked that I hit him on the head with the Primidux Statue. Unfortunately, he died from the blow, but it was an act of justified self-defense. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Calling it that doesn't cover up what you really did! Alba: Ha ha ha ha ha. Cover up? No, my boy, I'm not covering up anything; I'm telling the truth! Franziska: You weren't planning to admit to it, which is why you tried to frame the Steel Samurai. If you weren't an ambassador, I'd be letting my whip fly loose on you right now...! Alba: I am terribly sorry that I didn't clean up the body better, but I am a busy man. I had a speech to give in the rose garden after that, you know. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Yet despite that, you still had time to kill Mr. Coachen, didn't you? Alba: Alba: Heh heh heh... Man is evil, and I'm sure you are familiar with the facts, but... ...Mr. Coachen was killed in Babahl while I was all the way in Allebahst. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You insist that it's not possible for you to have killed Mr. Coachen in Babahl... ...and you are correct. Alba: Oh? I thought you would put up a bit more of a fight, but if you must concede to me... Edgeworth: The only thing I am conceding is that it's not possible for you to kill him in Babahl. I am NOT conceding that your alibi is the truth! Alba: Oh... I see. However, no matter how you try, know that you can't crush my alibi. Edgeworth: ...Hmph. You would be wise not to underestimate a prosecutor of this country. Alba: ...Heh, we'll see about that. Edgeworth: So Mr. Coachen was a \"friend\" of Ambassador Alba... Kay: If that's true, then why did the ambassador kill him? It's not like in the case of my father where he ordered someone to do it... Franziska: The problem we have here is we don't know what their exact relationship was. Edgeworth: Indeed. If they had complete trust in each other, then there is no motive for murder. (However, both men were very selfish, and I believe that is from where his motive arose.)Alba: The last time I met with Mr. Coachen was here at the Theatrum Neutralis. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You met with the victim here? Alba: I was watching the Steel Samurai, as was Mr. Coachen, who was sitting nearby. Franziska: I've been meaning to ask, why invite the Steel Samurai as a guest for an embassy event? Alba: I like Steel Samurai Daddy, so I asked for him to be at the event. Edgeworth: .........I see. (So it was by Ambassador Alba's request...) Alba: Now then, will that be all? Edgeworth: N-No, wait...! I'm not finished yet...! Alba: Alba: You're not very good at listening, are you? I told you I don't have the time to listen to a bunch of useless questions. Edgeworth: Ack...! (The time remaining for me to find the truth has just been blown away...!) Present Commemorative Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I'd like you to take a look at this picture.\" Alba: After that, I was in Allebahst the rest of the time, as I stated earlier. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you have anyone who can testify that you never left Allebahst after that? Alba: Of course I do. I was in front of a large crowd to give my speech, wasn't I? Kay: I guess he's not lying about being in Allebahst the whole time. Edgeworth: Yes, as long as he is willing to admit to DeMasque II's murder, then I suppose so. Kay: But he keeps saying that it was justified self-defense... Oh! I get it! OK, so what if I were to pretend to be a real klutz (changed from [being all hollow and sunken] in the original release)... ...and then \"tripped\" into Mr. Medals really hard? That'd count as self-defense, right? (changed from [I run into a klutzy person? Could I call that self-defense?] in the original release) Edgeworth: That's not self-defense; that's just being careless. Kay: Well, you never know until you try! Edgeworth: ...I suggest that you don't. Especially since you've given me a statement of intent. Alba: Now then, will that be all? Edgeworth: N-No, wait...! I'm not finished yet...! Alba: Alba: You're not very good at listening, are you? I told you I don't have the time to listen to a bunch of useless questions. Edgeworth: Ack...! (The time remaining for me to find the truth has just been blown away...!) Alba: In any case, I did not see Mr. Coachen again after that. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you never saw Mr. Coachen again after you left this theater? Alba: That's correct. I'm an incredibly busy man, you know. So it's more likely that Mr. Coachen ran into Ambassador Palaeno. Edgeworth: Even now, you would push his murder on to someone else...!? Palaeno: How dare you!? Saying that I would kill Manny! Franziska: Ambassador Alba! I demand that you refrain from making baseless conjectures! Alba: I was merely offering a possibility. No, this won't do... I can already see this is turning into an international incident. Edgeworth: (Who exactly is pressing who here...? In any case, what I need to do I stay positive and forge on!) Alba: Now then, will that be all? Edgeworth: N-No, wait...! I'm not finished yet...! Alba: Alba: You're not very good at listening, are you? I told you I don't have the time to listen to a bunch of useless questions. Edgeworth: Ack...! (The time remaining for me to find the truth has just been blown away...!) Alba: So you see, there is no time span in which I could've killed him. Wouldn't you agree? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your alibi is that there was no time span in which you could've killed Mr. Coachen? Alba: Yes, because I was in the theater watching the stage show. Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth? Do you remember seeing him sitting in the audience? Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but I don't remember anything outside of what was going on on-stage. Franziska: You shouldn't have been so focused on the show, and paid attention to your surroundings! Palaeno: Mr. Edgeworth... It is a fact that Ambassador Alba came to the theater. But I guess you didn't know that because you didn't see him at the Steel Samurai show. Edgeworth: Well, I do recall that he and you had a photo shoot with the Steel Samurai... Alba: *sigh* It looks like you are finally beginning to understand. Now then, will that be all? Edgeworth: N-No, wait...! I'm not finished yet...! Alba: Alba: You're not very good at listening, are you? I told you I don't have the time to listen to a bunch of useless questions. Edgeworth: Ack...! (The time remaining for me to find the truth has just been blown away...!) Present Commemorative Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I'd like you to take a look at this picture.\" Edgeworth: Amazing. Diplomats really do know how to craft answers that don't answer anything. Kay: So if the only place he met the victim was at this theater... ...then when was he killed? Edgeworth: We know that Mr. Coachen didn't return to Babahl alive. Which means that the only time he could've been killed is when they were both here. Kay: And that means that he was planning to kill Mr. Coachen from the start. Edgeworth: I'd like you to take a look at this picture. Alba: It's a rather nice picture, isn't it? It was to commemorate the restoration of relations between our nations. Edgeworth: Oh, it's commemorative, alright. One that captures the proof I need to show that it was you who committed the murder. Alba: Come again? Edgeworth: This is the knife that killed Mr. Coachen. Alba: ! Edgeworth: I see you recognize it, as well you should, for it was you who brought it to this theater. You hid it in among the flowers you were to give to the Steel Samurai! Meaning that you killed Manny Coachen here, at the theater! Alba: Grr...rrr...rrrrrnnngh... Gwah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! .........It's time for me to catch my flight. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: We're not through yet! Alba: Alba: It's game over for you, Mr. Edgeworth. But I thank you for the entertainment. Edgeworth: Nnrgh...! Alba: No matter how passionately you orate, the end result will still be the same. I won't be returning to this country ever again. Edgeworth: (That's right... This man is an ambassador... and he has extraterritorial rights! No matter how hard we chase after him, we won't be able to have him tried in court!) Alba: Yes, that's exactly the face you should be making. The face of a worthless cur. Edgeworth: Nnn... Nnngghhoooooooh! Alba: Now then, ladies and gentlemen, I must bid you farewell. Edgeworth: Nnrgh.........! Edgeworth: (I... The courts... Is there no one who can lay a finger on this man!? Is this really the end...?) Lang: Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Lang: Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Prosecutor! Alba: Get out of my way. My plane is scheduled to take off soon. Lang: Sorry, but you're not going anywhere... Mr. Alba. Alba: I'm through playing games with you people. You can't touch me. If you do, it would spark an international incident, Agent Lang. Lang: .........Sorry, but no, it wouldn't. Alba: What? Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Good job holding the fort down here until I got back. Edgeworth: Hm...? Lang: So, Mr. Alba. Your diplomatic immunity... has just been revoked. Alba: What do you mean \"revoked\"? Spare me this nonsense and let me through. Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Before aiming for the throat, chew the neck shield off first.\" Interpol headquarters and the imperial household of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...took a while to get things rolling, but they finally moved on it. Alba: The imperial household...? You...! What have you done!? Lang: You have been relieved of your duties as ambassador, Mr. Alba. Alba: Wh... Edgeworth: Wh... Franziska: Wh... Alba: Whhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Lang: Effective today, effective right now! And you have Mr. Prosecutor's video tape to thank for this! Kay: The video the Yatagarasu protected...!? Lang: You can't be arrested simply because you're an ambassador? In that case, I thought I'd strip you of that title. You underestimated me, a descendant of the founder of detainment philosophy, Lang Zi. Four thousand years of deeply entrenched connections and networks around the world... ...have really paid off. Alba: It can't be... I don't believe this... My ambassadorship... has been revoked.........!? Lang: Haa ha ha ha! Looks like you're finally coming to grips with your new standing. Kay: Whoo-hoo! Looks like he's turned docile again! Edgeworth: He's probably in shock from the loss of his \"shield\". Franziska: Hmph... What a shame. I had so wanted to use my whip on him! Alba: Why is this happening to me? I'm just a hard-working, honest ambassador... Lang: Lang: Do you really think you can still pull that on us now? We've already ripped away the mask and seen you for who you really are, Mr. Alba! Alba: ...Gnnn... Gwooo.........ooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Alba: Alba: No... I won't be stopped now! Edgeworth: ! (He still intends to fight us!?) Alba: So what if I am no longer an ambassador? You still don't have any evidence on me! The fact remains that you cannot arrest me! Lang: Heh, I'd expected no less from you, the boss of the smuggling ring. Well, the rest is up to you, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: Understood! Alba: Heh heh heh heh... You say that I killed Mr. Coachen in the theater. But even if it's true that there was a knife in my bouquet... ...I left that bouquet in the theater. So anyone could've taken it out from there and used it, right? Besides, the claim that he was killed here itself is odd. After all, wasn't his body discovered in Babahl? Are you claiming that I carried his body all the way over there? Hmph, preposterous! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'll be the one to prove whether it's preposterous or not. Alba: Gnrk...! Edgeworth: Ex-Ambassador Alba, are you ready? Because this is no game. This is war! Testimony -- Alba's Alibi, Pt. 3 -- Alba: I killed Mr. Coachen in this theater using a knife that was stuck in my bouquet? I left that bouquet in the theater! Anyone could've taken the knife from there! Besides, Mr. Coachen's body was discovered in Babahl, right? There is no way for me to have transported his body from the theater to Babahl! Alba: Look, don't you think you've had enough fun with me? You've already stolen my ambassadorship from me. Would you have me surrender, too? Lang: Lang: You have no plans to ever return to this country, isn't that right? Alba: .........! Lang: Did you know that a bunch of your subordinates are seeking asylum because of you!? Alba: ...Ha ha ha. As if I care, Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! Boot this guy out of the embassy, and we can finally end everything. Edgeworth: I know, and I will give it my all to see that he leaves in handcuffs. Without the title of \"ambassador\", he is just another witness! Franziska: Yes... Just another witness. Kay: Alright! What are we waiting for! Let's get this guy! Lang: And get him good! Edgeworth: (I wonder if they understand that all I can do is present evidence to the testimony...?) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That's right. As I explained earlier... ...the commemorative photo shows that you had the knife on your personage. Alba: Alba: You have no proof that the bouquet was prepared by me, isn't that right? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Alba: The fact that there was a knife in the bouquet... was something I wasn't aware of. Lang: Lang: What a pathetic excuse! The weapon that was used is one of your national treasures! It isn't exactly something anyone other than you could touch, let alone take! Alba: I allowed some of my trusted subordinates to handle them. It could've been my secretary. Lang: You... You're an even bigger slime ball than I'd thought...! Edgeworth: You would push the guilt of Mr. Coachen's murder onto one of your subordinates!? Alba: Hmph. In any case, the fact that the knife was in the bouquet means nothing! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You still wish to deny your actions!? Alba: And you still wish to deny reality and accuse me of murder? Edgeworth: What!? I am not in denial! Kay: Arngh! Even though he's not an ambassador anymore, he's still got a real bad attitude! Franziska: I believe it's BECAUSE he's no longer ambassador that he can let himself speak freely. Kay: Well, if he's not holding anything back, then neither should I! Edgeworth: Wait! For the sake of the case, please refrain from what I think you're about to do! Alba: Ah, quite the pair of frightening women you are, but I digress. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Even if he was found in Babahl, he was killed somewhere else! Alba: Alba: Stop bluffing, because you can't prove what you're claiming. If this were a court-martial in my country, you'd have already been removed from the room. Lang: Are you taunting us on purpose, because I'd be happy to show you my claws! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hold on, Agent Lang! Allow me to fight him my way... with evidence! Lang: Ha ha ha! I was just joking. I'm not so easily ruffled by the likes of him! Alba: Too bad. Though I'm no longer an ambassador, it still could've been an international incident. Edgeworth: If you have the will to threaten us with that mouth of yours... ...then perhaps you can use it to return to the testimony. Alba: Very well... But to be fair, you should watch what you say as well. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is that really so? You could've easily blackmailed your subordinates to be quiet and then moved the body. Alba: Alba: That's quite an insult to me and my subordinates, and I'm afraid we can't have that! It's very difficult to enter my embassy, as the guards always conduct a thorough check. If someone so much as makes an unnatural movement, it would arouse their suspicions. Franziska: Come to think of it, there wasn't anything unnatural about him in the footage. Edgeworth: Nngh......... (Wait... Let me think about that for a second. Mr. Alba said that the guard would become suspicious if someone acted unnaturally. But then, by the same token... ...the guard would not become suspicious if someone were to act naturally!) Edgeworth: If we re-trace Mr. Alba's movements, we should find some hint to solving this case. Kay: Well, right after the Steel Samurai stage show, he went back to Allebahst, right? Lang: From there, he started preparing for his speech in the Allebahstian Embassy. Franziska: It DOES sound like it wasn't possible for him to have gone to the Babahlese Embassy. Edgeworth: (He couldn't have gone to Babahl, but the body didn't remain at the theater either. Is it possible that the body was temporarily taken to a different location first?)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Kay Faraday\nDescription: Young girl purporting to be the 2nd Yatagarasu.

A country torn in two. One to the west... ...and one to the east. When those which were split are made whole again... ...the truth will reveal itself. I-It's the Yatagarasu! The Yatagarasu's here! Edgeworth: You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! Edgeworth: (It's so nice, almost dreamlike, to finally have the chance to relax and sip some tea. Especially after what a whirlwind the past few days have been.) On my return flight, I was dragged into a case involving an Interpol agent's murder. The next day, I investigated a kidnapping and a murder at the Gatewater Land theme park. And later that night, a detective's dead body welcomed me back to my office... ...along with a thief who was out to pilfer files related to a case from 10 years ago. (How did I manage to find myself in the middle of so many cases back to back? Well, at least I have today. All I ask is that I be allowed to spend it quietly.) ???: Mr. Edgewooooorth! This is big! Big, I tell you! ...Hey, what's wrong with you? Where's your enthusiasm...? Edgeworth: And suddenly, the phrase \"the fragility of dreams\" comes to mind... Kay: What are you talking about, \"fragile dreams\"!? Come on, let's go! The fake Yatagarasu isn't going to just find herself, you know! Edgeworth: Well, if you must know... it's possible that I was paid a visit last night by your \"fake\". Kay: Say what? Edgeworth: ......... Edgeworth: Unfortunately for us, the thief managed to escape. But even now, we're still looking for this criminal. However, I must warn you that we've only had a few hours to search so far... ...so I must insist that you be patient on this one, Kay. Kay: Wh-What's with you today...? Are you sure you aren't sleep-talking to me right now? Anyway, I've got something much more important that I want you to see! Edgeworth: Oh, and that is? Kay: Take a look at this! Edgeworth: \"On March 14th, I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" That's quite a bold declaration to send to an embassy... (I suppose it was inevitable that a newspaper would catch wind of this.) Kay: The date the card mentions is today! Edgeworth: Today, huh... Kay: Come on, we've gotta hurry! The embassy awaits! Edgeworth: I suppose it IS quite an urgent matter... ...however, do you know which country's embassy we should be investigating? Kay: Well, it's some really special country, and I'm actually really fuzzy on the details... But never mind that! Where's all your energy!? Why are you so lackadaisical today!? Edgeworth: I'm not, Kay. You're just too wound up. Kay: Well, then you should get too wound up, too! Because this just might be our chance to catch that woman! Edgeworth: You mean Ms. Yew? (The woman who killed Kay's father, Byrne Faraday, seven years ago... Calisto Yew... She claimed to be the Great Thief Yatagarasu... ...and then disappeared from the courtroom.) Kay: Argh! She makes me so mad! The phony! Everyone knows that the real Yatagarasu would never send something like a calling card! Until a company's underhanded dealings are made public... ...the target is always totally unaware that the Yatagarasu has paid them a visit. That's what makes the real Yatagarasu so awesome! Edgeworth: Hmm... The Yatagarasu's card that's shown in this article... It looks to me as though it could be genuine. Kay: See, that's the thing. Whoever it is, that person isn't the real deal, but has knowledge of the Yatagarasu. If this isn't a clue that that woman's involved, then nothing is! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Out the door you go! Edgeworth: Wait, there are a few preparations I must make before we go... (There's something interesting about this card we found last night here in my office... It's of a different color than the one in the article, which makes me wonder why.) Kay: What's up? Any reason why you're boring a hole through the newspaper with your eyes? Edgeworth: No... No reason at all. Very well. Seeing as how Ms. Yew is also someone of a special nature to me... ...I agree there is some merit to be found in investigating this. Kay: I knew you'd come around! ???: By the light of this night's glorious moon... We are ready! Pink Princess: Ready to embark on our nightly outing. Steel Samurai: And this is where... ...our tale begins! Edgeworth: Heh... What a coincidence. Who would've thought that a Steel Samurai stage show... ...would ever be held at such an elegant theater inside a foreign embassy? Kay: Yeah! The climax was really awesome! \"Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!\" I got chills down my spine when he pulled that move out! Edgeworth: I suppose it really is more impactful to watch a show in person than on television. Kay: I have to say, though, this embassy is set up kinda funny. I mean, they have two countries sharing the same building! Edgeworth: Well, as you said yourself, this place and the countries it houses are very special. Even this theater is special in that it is a neutral zone shared by the two countries. Kay: Umm... So, let me get this straight... The Steel Samurai show just now is being sponsored by one of the two countries. The one that's called the Kingdom of Allebahst, right? Edgeworth: Yes, it would appear that the Steel Samurai is very popular in that country as well. Kay: Seems that way! But you know who I'M really into? The Jammin' Ninja! The Republic of Babahl is sponsoring a Jammin' Ninja stage show! That's something for fangirls like me! We've totally gotta see that too, Mr. Edgeworth! The Jammin' Ninja's show is gonna kick the Steel Samurai show's rear end! Edgeworth: (You know, ever since I first met this girl, I've always had this inkling... ...that what she really wants to be... ...is not a thief, but rather, a ninja...) Kay: So anyway, about today's event... umm... What's it called again? Edgeworth: \"The Kingdom of Allebahst versus The Republic of Babahl Goodwill Jubilee\". The small, European countries of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...and the Republic of Babahl. These two countries used to be a single entity that was abundant with nature. And it was called... the Principality of Cohdopia. .................. Kay: Hm? Is everything alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Yes, I'm alright. Moving on... After a period of civil unrest, the country split in two, though signs of their past remain. For example, their flags preserve the flower and butterfly motifs to this day. ......... (Cohdopia, huh... The KG-8 Incident... and what was referred to as the second KG-8 Incident... ...in which an Embassy staff member was murdered... Both of these cases were related to the Principality of Cohdopia. In the seven years that have passed, the country may have split into two... ...however, the Yatagarasu still sent a calling card here. What could it all mean?) ......... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I know you're thinking about something! Edgeworth: Oh, excuse me. What were we talking about again? Kay: Argh, if you could please stop spacing out on me! Anyway, we were talking about the Allebahst versus Babahl Goodwill Jubilee. The two countries have had a pretty bad relationship with each other... ...but supposedly, they've been trying really hard to make up recently. That's why they decided to hold this event. Edgeworth: (If that's the case, then why the \"versus\"...?) Kay: Also, both countries claim to own the real \"Primidux Statue\", a national treasure to both. They're planning to have them publicly evaluated today, to see which one's the real deal. Edgeworth: Kay, need I remind you to take care and not succumb to your thieving desires? Kay: Well, when it comes to treasure, I can't help myself. You know that! Edgeworth: (Nngh... She had better be saying that in jest...) Kay: Hey! I can read your body language, you know! And you've got it all wrong! Look! I'm here to do some investigating! INVESTIGATING, I tell you! Edgeworth: Heh, I know. And although we don't know if the Yatagarasu will really make an appearance... ...I suppose we should still spend some time examining this place. After examining pamphlets: Edgeworth: I suppose I'll just help myself to one of these... Embassy Guide stuck into the pages of my Organizer. Edgeworth: (Hm? What is all the hubbub?) Ack! Kay: Hey, look! It's the Steel Samurai! And he's got his son, the Iron Infant, with him!! Edgeworth: May I speak with you for a second? (...It's... the Steel Samurai...) Steel Samurai: ......... Edgeworth: ......... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! What are you glaring at him for!? Edgeworth: Ahem, please excuse me. It's just that I've never seen a super-hero up close before. Steel Samurai: ......... Kay: It looks like he's written something down for you! Edgeworth: \"To Edgeworth, From Steel Samurai Daddy: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo\" Kay: Wow, an autograph! Pretty cool that you got one, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Heh... Steel Samurai's Autograph received. Guard: Mr. Steel Samurai! Ambassador Alba is waiting for you! Reporter: And now the Steel Samurai... ...will proceed to enter the Kingdom of Allebahst to shake the hand of the ambassador. The Steel Samurai isn't only here for the two countries tonight... ...but rather, can be thought of as a goodwill ambassador from our own country as well! Kay: There he goes. Off to spread goodwill to the world. Edgeworth: He really does seem like a goodwill ambassador, doesn't he? Cameraman: OK! We're shooting the next segment now! Cue camera! Reporter: In just a few seconds, the Jammin' Ninja stage show is set to begin. After the show, the Jammin' Ninja will enter the Republic of Babahl. He is set to meet with the Ambassador of Babahl at that time. Kay: AHH! The Jammin' Ninja's show is about to start! We've gotta get back to our seats! Edgeworth: Regrettably... I don't have much of an interest in ninjas... Kay: Well, this show will change your mind! Come on, we have to hurry! If we miss even a second of the Jammin' Ninja's awesome playing, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I suppose you're not about to give me much of a choice here, are you, Kay?) Kay: Ahhh! I could listen to that \"A Ninja Marked for Death's Lullaby\" song all day! His superb playing and that sad melody really brought a tear to my eye! And his heart-wrenching voice! Now THAT'S the Jammin' Ninja's greatest weapon! Edgeworth: .................. Kay: Ahh! Those pieces of Jammin' Ninja merchandise over there! I've got to have them! I especially want the hair sticks they're selling exclusively at these shows. They're exactly like the ones the heroine, Princess Misola, wears in her hair! Edgeworth: ...Anyway. Kay: Anyway!? ANYWAY!? Hold it right there, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: You're thinking of going home, aren't you!? Edgeworth: Well, it doesn't seem likely that the Yatagarasu will be making an appearance tonight. Most likely, it was simply a prank. Kay: No way! I just know the Yatagarasu will show! Edgeworth: But I thought you said that the Yatagarasu doesn't send calling cards. Kay: Yeah, I did, but... Edgeworth: I figured from the very beginning that this would wind up being a wild goose chase. Kay: But that card she sent was a genuine fake calling card! Edgeworth: A genuine fake...? Kay: Well, how can I word this...? The Yatagarasu's mark that's on the calling card is exactly the same as my mark. Get it now? Officer: W-We've got a problem! Th-The Yatagarasu has been spotted in Allebahst! Edgeworth: What!? Kay: You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Hah! So you finally decided to show yourself, you phony! Hey, what gives!? Guard: I'm sorry but I will need to search you before you may enter. Kay: What the!? Hey! The Steel Samurai just waltzed straight on through without one! Now if you don't hurry up and let me through, my phony is going to escape! Edgeworth: Kay, a country's embassy is considered to be a part of the country itself. If you don't go through the proper procedures to enter the country... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I'm going to enter through Babahl and climb over the wall into Allebahst! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You would tell a prosecutor straight out that you intend to illegally enter another... Kay, are you listening to me!? Kay: Kay Faraday, and I'm coming through! Guard: Yes, and welcome! Edgeworth: Someone stop her! Anyone! Edgeworth: *huff, huff, huff*... Kay... Where are you? Don't tell me you really did find some way over this fence... Ack! Guard: Fire! This is too big for us to handle! Looks like the Yatagarasu came to Babahl, too! Edgeworth: You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! You had better be alright, wherever you are! Kay: I told you! It wasn't me! Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: *huff, huff, huff*... Kay! Are you alright!? Kay: Do I look alright to you!? Now, can you do something about this woman!? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe! What is the meaning of this!? Gumshoe: *sigh* Well, sir... it's um, this. Edgeworth: He's...! Kay: It wasn't me! He was already dead when I ran in here, hot on the heels of the fake Yatagarasu! Look, I only came in here because I saw a suspicious person at the open-air stage! Edgeworth: A suspicious person? Kay: A long, black coat and a hood over their head -- I dare you to tell me that's not suspicious! When I saw that person, I immediately thought that they must be the fake Yatagarasu. So I chased after them into the Embassy, then into here, and then lost sight of them... But I just KNOW that person is the one who did it! Shih-na: What are you so worked up over? There is no reason for you to be this loud. Edgeworth: Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're Agent Lang's secretary... ...Shih-na, I believe your name is, correct? Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: And if you are making an arrest... ...I assume you have evidence that it was Kay who committed the crime, is that also correct? Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: You refuse to answer!? Shih-na: I don't need to answer. Edgeworth: ! Shih-na: You are merely a prosecutor in this country, meaning you have no investigative authority. Gumshoe: H-Hey, pal! Just what the heck does what you just said mean!? If it happened here, it's under Mr. Edgeworth's jurisdiction. The end. And seeing as how this building is sitting on our soil, we can investigate wherever we'd like! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, Detective, embassies are a different matter. Gumshoe: Huh? Edgeworth: This office is considered to be a part of the Republic of Babahl. Which means that anything that happens in here... ...defaults to the control of the Babahlese government and Babahlese law... ...giving them exclusive extraterritorial rights. Gumshoe: Extraterrestrial (changed from [Extraterristrial] in the original release, correcting the typo) rights? Sir, do you really believe that the truth is out there!? Edgeworth: *sigh* Basically, our country's laws do not apply inside the embassy of another country. That's what was agreed to by our respective governments. Our authority to investigate was effectively nullified the second we entered this place. Which means we can do little here in this situation... Gumshoe: N-No way, sir! Shih-na: Please leave this matter in Interpol's hands and go home. Edgeworth: N...Nnnnngh... Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Kay: H-Hey, you're not...!? Mr. Edgeworth! ???: ???: In that case... allow me to join your investigation. Gumshoe: M-Ms. von Karma! Eeek! Franziska: Ambassador Palaeno, I truly appreciate you allowing me to join the investigation. Palaeno: It's really nothing. Manny was my secretariat, so of course I want to help you as much as I can. In fact, it's a blessing that Interpol agents were able to make it so quickly. Edgeworth: Franziska... Franziska: Well, well. I never imagined that I'd meet you here of all places. This is an embassy, meaning that you have no authority to conduct... Edgeworth: Franziska: A-Already!? What is it!? Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno. Palaeno: Hm? And you are? Edgeworth: I'm Miles Edgeworth, public prosecutor. I ask that you please allow me to investigate this case as Ms. von Karma's assistant. Gumshoe: A...Assistant? Franziska: Miles!? What the heck do you think you're...!? Edgeworth: Please, I implore you, Ambassador Palaeno. Palaeno: Very well. I'll be counting on the two of you, Ms. von Karma and Mr. Edgeworth. Gumshoe: Umm... What did you mean by you'll be Ms. von Karma's assistant...? Edgeworth: I don't exactly have a choice, do I, Detective? If I don't become Franziska's assistant, I can't participate in this investigation. Franziska: Hmph. There you go again, running at the mouth with that aloof expression on your face. Edgeworth: Franziska, please... Franziska: I don't know what you're planning quite yet... ...but at least I do know one thing -- that you are now my subordinate. Just remember that my whip is always ready to wake you, should you have a brain lapse. Edgeworth: Of course. I'll keep that in mind. Shih-na: ...If you are done playing games...! Edgeworth: Right. let's begin the investigation. Edgeworth: By the way, Detective... I suppose it's a bit late to be asking, but why are you here? Gumshoe: Well, better late than never, I guess, sir. I was placed on guard duty for the Babahlese Embassy today! Edgeworth: And why are our police guarding an embassy? Gumshoe: Well, on account of the card they got from the Yatagarasu... ...they called us up and asked for our help, sir. Oh, and because we've been searching for the Yatagarasu these past seven years! It was a more or less mutually beneficial arrangement, if you ask me! Edgeworth: Except for how mutually unbeneficial this has all turned out to be, I suppose. It looks like you failed to competently perform your guard duty yet again. Gumshoe: Ack...! Edgeworth: Look forward to your next salary negotiation... although, it's out of my hands. Gumshoe: But sir! If it gets cut any more, I won't be able to buy even instant (changed from [packet] in the original release) noodles anymore... After connecting \"Locked safe\" and \"Key used at Embassy\" Logic: Edgeworth: We know for a fact that the Yatagarasu's Key was used at this embassy. Furthermore, we found it in the victim, Mr. Coachen's pocket. Which leads me to think that perhaps it is the key to the personal safe in this office. Gumshoe: Good thinking, sir! Let's go try it out! Edgeworth: ...It appears I was correct. (The key that was left to us in the victim's pocket... It literally turned out to be the key to the next piece of the truth!) Hmm... What do we have here? Gumshoe: Hey! There's nothing inside! D-Do you think the Yatagarasu made off with everything, sir? Edgeworth: No, Detective, I believe all we need is a closer look. Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: What is this here? Gumshoe: It looks like the ripped corner of a piece of paper, sir. Edgeworth: No, I don't think it's ripped; it seems more, to me, like it's stuck in the safe. Gumshoe: Hey, you're right! It won't budge an inch, not even when I tug on it! But I don't think I've ever seen paper stuck on the inside of a safe before... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective, I think you have it backwards. It's not the paper that's strange... It's the safe. Gumshoe: What do you mean? Edgeworth: What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that... Edgeworth: Even just eye-balling it, you can see that the inside is a bit too shallow. Furthermore, with the unnatural way the paper is stuck at the back of the safe... ...I'd say that there is an extra bit of space behind the back wall of this safe! In other words, this safe has a second compartment. Gumshoe: Wh-Whaaaaaaat!? Franziska: I suppose that you are correct in asserting that the paper is stuck in an unnatural manner. However, if what you say is correct and there is a second compartment... ...how do we go about opening the door to it then? As you can see, there is no other lock or keyhole in sight. Edgeworth: Actually, there is one more spot of interest to me on this safe. Franziska: Oh? Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe that spot is the keyhole to our mystery second lock! Franziska: The safe and its locks... Alright then, since you are so sure of yourself, show me how you deduced your answer! Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: Doesn't the shape of this keyhole remind you of something, Franziska? Franziska: The shape? It does look very familiar... However, I believe it's simply a latch hole for the safe's lock mechanism. It's just for keeping the door shut, nothing more. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is that so? The person who used this safe... ...Mr. Coachen, made sure this safe had two compartments, in order to hide something. Do you honestly think someone like that would allow the keyhole to the hidden half... ...to look so obviously like a keyhole that even the average person could figure it out? Franziska: ! ...You can't be serious...! Are you saying that this hole is the keyhole to the hidden compartment of this safe? Edgeworth: That's precisely what I'm saying. Franziska: ...! Edgeworth: And I will prove to you right now... ...that the Yatagarasu's Key is the key that will open it! Franziska: Franziska: The Yatagarasu's Key!? Miles Edgeworth! This had better be a very bad joke! Edgeworth: Sorry, but this is no joke. The Yatagarasu's Key... ...is the very key that will open the second compartment of this safe. Franziska: We know that this key opens the first compartment of the safe. But the keyhole you're talking about... ...is of an entirely different shape than that of the key! Leads to examination of Yatagarasu's Key Edgeworth: Let's go over this again, shall we? The Yatagarasu's Key... ...was originally made to open Mr. Coachen's safe in the Cohdopian Embassy. We confirmed that as fact by opening the door to his safe with it. Now, let's take a look at the back end of the key. Looking at the knife portion head on, what do you see? Franziska: What are you talking... Aaah! Edgeworth: It appears that you've come to understand what I'm talking about. When viewed head-on, the knife's blade is the exact same shape as the keyhole! The real function of the knife portion is to act as the key to the hidden portion of the safe. Franziska: B-But that's... preposterous! Edgeworth: Because it looks like a knife and was used like one to kill Mr. Faraday seven years ago... ...we fell under the misconception that it was always meant to be a knife. But for both the safe and its key to conceal such clever tricks... ...whatever is hidden inside the secret section must be of incredible importance. Franziska: .........Then, it's even possible that what I've been searching for is inside! Scruffy! Hurry up and open that safe! Gumshoe: Eeeek! Y-Yes, sir! Opening it now, sir! Edgeworth: These items... They're...! Gumshoe: It's a bunch of funny-shaped things. I guess they're pieces of art, huh, siiiiir!? Franziska: You're in the way! Now, move, Scruffy! Gumshoe: I didn't think I was in the way... *sniffle* Franziska: These pieces of art...! They're identical to ones that have been stolen from various countries around the world! Edgeworth: I figured as much... These are the treasures this section of the safe was to hide from view! Hmm... I believe a more thorough examination is required. Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: Take a good look at these documents, Franziska. Franziska: It says that there are three pages in total, and yet, there are only two here. Edgeworth: Correct. Now take a look at the smuggling activity document in your possession. Tell me, is it not possible that your page was taken from this set of three? Franziska: Well, well... It certainly looks that way. Edgeworth: By putting our multi-part puzzle together, we seem to have arrived at an answer. And it seems that you have now found what you were looking for. Franziska: Yes, and with this, it has become crystal clear... ...that Mr. Coachen himself was responsible for the mass smuggling of Babahlese ink! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink? Franziska: Babahlese ink is a special product of the Republic of Babahl. However, due to a special reason, only a limited volume is ever exported. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And that reason is...? Franziska: That's classified. It's on a need to know basis, and you don't need to know. In any case, it seems that the head of the smuggling ring was our victim, Mr. Manny Coachen. Edgeworth: His base was in an embassy, thus, it was hard for both our country and his to interfere. Making it the ideal conditions under which to run a smuggling operation. Franziska: Argh... but it's so frustrating. I lost the person I was to rain judgment down upon with my Whip of Justice. Edgeworth: Well, even if he is dead, we still have a responsibility to look into his misdeeds. Franziska: You expect me to whip a dead man? ...Well, I'm not interested. Edgeworth: Franziska... You must know... ...that Manny Coachen was the suspect in the KG-8 Incident... Franziska: Of course I know! On top of being the head of the smuggling ring... ...there is the matter of what really happened in that case that needs to be resolved. After connecting \"Motif on knife handle\" and \"Butterfly of Babahl\" Logic, and examining golden statue and knife rack: Shih-na: ...Are you done investigating? Edgeworth: .................. Shih-na: You realize now, don't you? That this girl is the only one it could be. Now come along quietly, Yatagarasu... Kay Faraday. You are under arrest for the murder of Manny Coachen. Kay: M...Mr. Edgeworth! Please, you have to believe me! I didn't do it! I chased the fake Yatagarasu in here... and he... he was already... Shih-na: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'd like to help you reduce the number of mistaken arrests Interpol makes. Shih-na: ...What is that supposed to mean? Edgeworth: I believe I told you that Kay Faraday is not the culprit of this crime. Shih-na: ...Very well. I suppose I have no choice. I'll show you just how foolish your claims are! Shih-na: Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight. Utilizing the confusion caused by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy. Furthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu. And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body. Edgeworth: Your reason for suspecting Kay is because you think she is the Yatagarasu? Shih-na: ...Exactly. But it isn't just me. She calls herself the Yatagarasu. Kay: Argh! Look, how many times do I have to tell you!? I was only out to capture the fake Yatagarasu! Shih-na: Imposter or not... it matters not. A Yatagarasu is a Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: Very well. Then I shall prove that Kay is not the Yatagarasu who killed Mr. Manny Coachen! Shih-na: ...Go ahead and try. Show me what the prosecutors of this country are made of. Shih-na: Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight. Shih-na: Utilizing the confusion caused by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy. Shih-na: Furthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu. Shih-na: She wanted to steal documents regarding smuggling, so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Shih-na: And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body. Edgeworth: (So Agent Shih-na suspects Kay of murder simply because Kay is the Yatagarasu. But if I can prove that the Yatagarasu's goal is not related to murder... ...then I may be able to begin to reason with her!) Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na. I regret to inform you, but there is a flaw in your logic. Shih-na: Oh? Edgeworth: Even if you claim that she is the killer, and the Yatagarasu... ...I am certain that securing the smuggling documents is not the motive behind the murder! The key to the safe in this room was found on Mr. Coachen's body. Furthermore, the Yatagarasu would not be so stupid as to leave without the documents. Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: By the simple fact that the documents were still in the safe when we looked... ...it's obvious that the killer's target was not the safe at all! Shih-na: Shih-na: Then perhaps she didn't know that Mr. Coachen had the key on him. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If that's the case, then why would she have needed to kill him? Because I can think of no reason for her to kill him if she had not known that fact! Shih-na: Shih-na: Need, reason... All of this is simply our conjecturing after the fact. It's entirely possible that she accidentally killed him when she was sneaking him. Edgeworth: .........! Shih-na: Perhaps she didn't notice the safe's second compartment before returning the key. Edgeworth: Arngh! Shih-na: But the fact still remains... that Mr. Coachen was stabbed to death. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But you have no definitive proof that it was Kay who committed the act! Shih-na: Shih-na: ...Actually, I do. I saw her holding the knife she used on the victim with my own eyes. Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? Shih-na: ...Allow me to tell you a bit more about the evidence that will put her away behind bars. Shih-na: The knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife. The knife with the butterfly handle is the murder weapon, which the killer was holding. I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim. The knife is a part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other. The evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument. Edgeworth: Nnnnnrrrrrgh... Th-That is your definitive evidence...!? Shih-na: You see now that she is definitely the killer, right? Kay: No! Mr. Edgeworth, you've gotta believe me! I saw a suspicious person in a long black coat outside the Embassy, I swear! Edgeworth: And you came in here because you were chasing this suspicious person? Kay: That's right. I ran into this office only because I was chasing after that person... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the lights, but then... Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ???: ...Who's there!? Shih-na: This is... Shih-na: I came to this room upon hearing the girl's scream. And when I saw her holding the knife, I immediately restrained her. Edgeworth: So the object Kay felt by her feet on the floor was the murder weapon...!? Shih-na: I had the knife analyzed right away, but we failed to find anyone's (changed from [anyone] in the original release, correcting the typo) prints on it. Kay: But the suspicious person in the black coat who came into this room before me...! Shih-na: Shih-na: You continue to insist there was such a person, but if there was, where did they go? Kay: That... I don't know. But I know they came in here! Shih-na: Shih-na: That sounds like the desperate excuses of a suspected killer, not a trustworthy testimony. You understand, don't you? We can't trust this girl's words, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Gnnrk! (She has a point. Even if Kay's words are the truth... ...I must show that they are with some solid evidence!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I really didn't...! Edgeworth: ! Kay... Don't worry. If you didn't do it, then there must exist a way for me to prove that. Shih-na: Shih-na: Still not giving up, I see. In that case, try to counter my argument, if you can. Edgeworth: Don't worry, I can and I will! Shih-na: The knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife. Shih-na: The knife with the butterfly handle is the murder weapon, which the killer was holding. Shih-na: I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim. Shih-na: The knife is a part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other. Shih-na: The evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument. Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na's proof is the Babahlese knife that Kay was allegedly holding. Gumshoe: Yeah... So, um, how are you going to prove that Kay didn't do it, sir? Edgeworth: If Agent Shih-na wants to suspect Kay merely because Kay was the only one here... ...then I must show with evidence that Kay couldn't have committed the murder! Gumshoe: Um, but do you have such evidence, sir? Edgeworth: Yes. There is one piece of evidence that seems very unnatural to me. ...And I believe it is my duty to point that out to Agent Shih-na. Edgeworth: So the murder weapon was the knife with the butterfly design on it. But is that really the truth? Shih-na: What are you getting at? Edgeworth: I'd like for you to take a look at this. There is blood on the blade, and yet, there's not a speck of blood on the handle. This signifies that at the time of the crime, a different handle was attached to this blade. The knife that Kay was holding... ...had its handle switched, and was, in fact, not the real murder weapon! Shih-na: It wasn't... the real murder weapon!? Edgeworth: This knife can be taken apart. Shall we give it a go? Leads to examination of Babahlese knife Edgeworth: As you can see, the Babahlese knife has now been disassembled into two parts. The killer must have pulled the murder weapon out of the victim's body... ...and proceeded to swap the knife's original handle with this butterfly one. It was all to create the illusion that Mr. Coachen was killed with the butterfly-themed knife! Shih-na: Uurrnngh... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: (This should clear up any and all suspicion surrounding Kay.) Babahlese Knife Handle data jotted down in my Organizer. Shih-na: Your argument isn't airtight yet! Edgeworth: How so? Shih-na: It's possible... that the girl herself is the one who switched the handles. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Don't be ridiculous! For what purpose would she do such a thing!? Shih-na: I don't care to know how a criminal thinks. The way they view the world is beyond the comprehension of a normal person like myself. Therefore, I wouldn't put anything past them, no matter how odd it may seem. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Heh. The truth is right there in front of you, and this knife will show you the way! You will come to see that Kay is not and could not have been Mr. Coachen's killer! Leads to examination of Babahlese knife Shih-na: What is this mark on here? Edgeworth: It's the mark of a flower. I assume you know what this means? Shih-na: No, not really. Butterflies rest on flowers all the time to drink their sweet nectar. Edgeworth: ...And so they do. (However, would this butterfly really drink the nectar of this flower? The answer is clearly... not a chance! Now to prove the relationship between the butterfly and the flower with this!) Shih-na: ! Y-You can't be serious...! Edgeworth: Hmph... It appears that you've made the connection. The flower on this blade is designed after a certain country's national symbol. That's right... The Kingdom of Allebahst. In other words... This blade is from one of Allebahst's ornamental knives! Shih-na: Aah! Edgeworth: This part of the knife handle... ...has Babahl's national symbol of the butterfly on it. Therefore, it is undeniably Babahlese in origin! But as we both know, you can't kill someone with just a knife handle. Incidentally, when exactly did the murder occur again, Agent Shih-na? Shih-na: Ack! After the fire had broken out... Edgeworth: That's right. Kay entered the Babahlese Embassy after the fire had taken place. Furthermore, she had not been to the Allebahstian side of the building before then. On top of that, not a single person passed between the two countries during the fire... ...which means that Kay could not have transported an Allebahstian object over here! This makes it impossible for her to be the true killer! Shih-na: ..................! Gumshoe: Whooooop! Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! What a great victory! Edgeworth: .................. Franziska: .................. Shih-na: .................. Gumshoe: Huh? Hey, why is everyone so quiet...? Edgeworth: (I'm happy we got this far and cleared Kay's name... ...but what worries me now is what will happen next.) Franziska: Franziska: What is the meaning of this!? An Allebahstian knife, here...!? Edgeworth: Do you mean... how did this find its way to the Republic of Babahl? It didn't just find its way over. Rather, we should focus on how it was smuggled over! Kay: You know what!? My brain hurts thinking about it while we're just standing around! Thinking while you're on the run? Now THAT'S the way a real Great Thief operates! Edgeworth: Kay...? Kay: Oh, thanks a bunch, Mr. Edgeworth! For proving me innocent, I mean! You believed in me the whole time, right? Tell me you did! Edgeworth: Umm, not really, but... Kay: Ha ha. Come on, you don't have to be shy about it! Shih-na: Shih-na: ...Your argument is still not airtight. Edgeworth: Would you care to elaborate? Shih-na: I understand now that the girl didn't commit the murder. However, there is still the possibility that she is the Yatagarasu. Kay: That again!? Look, how many times do I have to explain it to you!? I am the real Yatagarasu! I'm not like that fake one that goes around setting fires, OK!? Shih-na: Whether you're the real deal or a fake, it doesn't really matter. All I have to say is this: I have my suspicions that this girl is the one who started the fire. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Preposterous! On what grounds do you suspect her of such a thing!? Shih-na: The fact that she calls herself the Yatagarasu. That in itself is the (changed from [a] in the original release) most elegant proof. Kay: Ms. Shih-na. Shih-na: Yes? Kay: I... have no intention of taking back any of what I've said. Shih-na: ...? Kay: I am the Great Thief Yatagarasu. And I refuse to allow some imposter to claim that name as their own! The path of justice that my father pointed me towards... I will walk it the best I can! Shih-na: It's not good to be so stubborn. I hope you can understand that. Kay: Thanks a lot for the concern, Ms. Shih-na! Let me share something with you, too, as a token of my appreciation! Those sunglasses totally do nothing for you, so I'll steal them from you next time, OK!? Shih-na: Wh--!? Kay: Well, I guess we'd better get going! Franziska: Going...? To where? Kay: To the Kingdom of Allebahst! If we don't go, we won't know for sure, right? Franziska: I suppose not... We won't get anywhere simply by standing here thinking. To see where the Allebahstian knife came from... ...we'll have to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. Let's go, Miles Edgeworth. As you are my subordinate... I will not tolerate you bringing the investigation to a halt. Edgeworth: Hmph... Understood. To be continued MIB: Count off! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! ...1! 1! MIB: Shifu! 99 callouts! So all 99 members are most likely here and accounted for, sir! Lang: ...Hey, you. Yeah, you, the second #1 from my right. Officer: Sir! Yes, sir!? Lang: Here... A birthday present for you. Officer: Wha...?? MIB: Shifu! I didn't know that you knew all of our birthdays...! Officer: What a kind heart you have! Shifu, you are more of a man than we'll ever be, sir! Officer: Umm... I'm really sorry, but it's not my birthday... Lang: Lang Zi says: \"A cub who disrespects others soon feels the disciplinary bite of an elder.\" That present isn't for you. It's for your younger brother's wife's younger brother. ...Tell him I said \"hi\", and \"happy birthday\", won't you? Officer: Y...Yes, sir! MIB: Shifu! I can't believe you remember that much about each of us! Officer: Shifu! I... I'm so moved that I can't stop crying! Edgeworth: (...I should probably leave them to their \"alone time\".) Lang: Alright, meeting's over. Everyone... head for your posts! Dismissed! Sir! Lang: Yo, were you guys there the whole time? I got a call from Shih-na, and she's already filled me in. It sounds like you're out to get in my way again. Edgeworth: I have absolutely no intention of interrupting your investigation. I simply request that you grant me permission to investigate the Allebahstian Embassy. Lang: Hmph. And what if I say no? Franziska: Franziska: Agent Lang! This man is my subordinate. As I have received permission from the ambassador, he is to be extended the same rights. Lang: Sorry, sis, but it's not that simple. Allebahst has the strictest immigration regulations in the world, or didn't you know? Even among my elite men, about only half of them were admitted into the country. Besides, any more cooks in the kitchen, and we might spoil the soup, if you get what I mean. Franziska: How dare you make such assumptions!? Lang: Don't take this the wrong way, but I thought I was in charge of Allebahst, Ms. von Karma. Franziska: Grrr! Lang: Look, try to understand, OK? Things over in Allebahst are a bit of a mess right now. Edgeworth: What do you mean by \"a bit of a mess\"? Lang: No one told you? We had an \"incident\" in Allebahst as well. This is what we call a decision based on the investigation, Mr. Prosecutor. Kay: Look, Wolfy! Just let us in already! ???: ???: Is there a problem here, Agent Lang? Lang: Not really. Just having a \"discussion\" about whether or not to let these guys in. Franziska: Ambassador Alba, I ask that you please allow these people to join the investigation. Alba: Having a debate because of my country... I'm terribly sorry for placing you good people in that kind of situation... It is all because I lacked the strength to govern well. Edgeworth: Please, it is nothing of the sort, Ambassador... Alba: You weakling, Quercus! Curse your frailty and inability to affect change in your country! Edgeworth: Wh-What are you--!? Alba: The thing is, investigations conducted in my country have been under Agent Lang. And it is my judgment that in order to minimize disruption in the investigation... ...I should leave everything up to Agent Lang. Lang: ...There, you see? Kay: Oh, no way! ???: Palaeno: Ambassador Alba, I ask you to please reconsider letting them into Allebahst. Alba: What's that...? Palaeno: My very own secretary has been murdered in the Babahlese Embassy. And he was apparently caught up in some very shady dealings completely unbeknownst to me. So I ask for your cooperation in our investigation. These aren't much, but I hope they can cover your travel expenses to Babahl someday. Lang: Alright, alright. I get it. Even if you beg Ambassador Alba, I still have to give the final OK anyway. Kay: Alright! You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? We're in! Lang: Not so fast, my little crow-girl. You're still a witness in the Babahl murder. So I'd like you to please stay in the Republic of Babahl. Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Please take good care of Kay for me. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Lang: Sounds good to me. The fewer troublemakers, the better. Kay: ......... *rasp!* Gumshoe: *rasp!* Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: So I wanted to ask for a while now, but... ...that lady over there, is she who I think she is!? Edgeworth: Ah, that's right. I didn't introduce the two of you yet. Franziska: Franziska von Karma, the prosecutorial prodigy. ...It's nice to see you again. Kay: Ooh, I knew it! You're the whip lady! Franziska: .........You may address me as Ms. von Karma. Kay: Ms. von Karma, I leave the investigation of Allebahst in your hands! Franziska: Thanks. Rest assured, I will outsmart both the smuggling ring and the Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: (The smuggling ring, huh... Perhaps I should ask Franziska a bit more about them before I head into Allebahst. Ah, and I mustn't forget to thank Ambassador Palaeno for all that he has done for me.) After talking with Franziska von Karma and Colias Palaeno: Edgeworth: Well, shall we get going? ???: Edgeworth: What's wrong, Kay? Kay: I didn't get permission to enter Allebahst... ...so we're going to go gather whatever info we can over on the Babahlese side, OK!? Edgeworth: Alright, I'm counting on you two. Kay: Right, and I'm counting on you and Ms. von Karma to sniff out clues in Allebahst! Oh, and Mr. Edgeworth! If you happen to come across my phony, you let me know, OK!? If you tell me, I'll rush on over straight away no matter where you are! Edgeworth: .................. I'll let you know when the time comes. Edgeworth: (...Hm?) Gwoooooooh! Franziska: What do you think you're doing to my subordinate!? Edgeworth: Y...You're...! ???: Edgey...! Oh, thank the heavens you're here...! I'm in a really, really big pickle, Your Lordship! The Raven, it appeared, poof! And then disappeared, swoosh! And though I am the Steel Samurai, my sword, it... Waaaaaaaaah! I'm so confused, I don't know what anything means anymore! Franziska: Who is this fruitcake!? Larry: I am Larry of the House of Butz: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo, m'lady! Franziska: Now I remember. This... person is one of your friends, isn't he, Miles? Edgeworth: Yes, frighteningly enough... he is. Larry: Hey! What's up with that answer!? Your best bud is in a bind, and you act like it's no big deal! Edgeworth: What sort of \"bind\" are we talking about here...? Larry: The suspect kind! I accidentally became a suspect in a murdeeeeeer! Edgeworth: I see. That is quite the bind. Franziska: ...Not that we're in the least bit surprised. Edgeworth: Yes, I pretty much expected this news... ...from the instant I saw this unlucky face. (His name is Larry Butz. I've known him since grade school, and for as long as I've known him... ...he has been the world's largest source of Trouble with a capital T.) Larry: Hey! What kind of introduction is that!? You're so mean, Edgey! If you're not careful, you might find your tiny number of friends go down by one! Edgeworth: That was uncalled for. Besides, you're............ Wait, hold on. Laaaaaaryyyy! It was you!? YOU'RE the one who wrote my Steel Samurai autograph!? Larry: Hm? Oh, you didn't notice earlier? I even winked at you through my headpiece. Franziska: .........What's going on? And why are you beet-red? Edgeworth: Sorry... but could you not speak to me right now...? ???: Lang: Oh, sorry, am I interrupting your comical, yet melodramatic play? Edgeworth: ! .........Aha. So this is the incident you mentioned earlier. Lang: Mr. Prosecutor, this man... this childhood friend of yours... is our prime suspect. Of what, you ask? Of the murder of a man who had snuck into this embassy, Mask\u2606DeMasque II! Edgeworth: Mask\u2606DeMasque II...? .................. (Only Larry could get himself into yet another mess as fine as this. But no matter what the facts seem to say, Larry is not the type to commit murder. Still, it's a rather daunting stroke of misfortune I've struck. I have to prove... that Larry Butz is innocent of all wrongdoing!) MIB: Shifu! We've identified the victim! Lang: Good work. I'll take that report now. Edgeworth: Agent Lang, would you mind if I took a peek at it as well? Lang: What did I tell you earlier, Mr. Prosecutor? Don't get in my way! There's only enough flesh here to feed one wolf, and that one is me! So, no, you may not take a \"peek\". Edgeworth: But Agent Lang...! ???: Badd: ...Agent Lang. Will you... allow an investigator such as myself... to take a look? Lang: Ah, yes. Of course. ...You, let the detective see the file. Edgeworth: You're... Detective Badd! Badd: You're... the prosecutor, Mr. Edgeworth, right? Edgeworth: Fancy meeting you here, Detective. Badd: You weren't expecting me...? Ever since that day seven years ago... I've chased after the Yatagarasu... non-stop. I even pressured Interpol... into keeping me in the loop... in case a card was ever found. Edgeworth: (What incredible dedication to the case.) Lang: Detective Badd knows the Yatagarasu's M. O. very well. And his passion for the chase hasn't died down in these seven long years. It's something... I can respect. But, Detective Badd, I must ask: are you going to make an ally out of this prosecutor? Badd: My only goal is to arrest the Yatagarasu. If he can get to the bottom of this case, then I'm willing to share info with him. Edgeworth: I am in your debt, Detective Badd. After clearing all Talk options: Edgeworth: In any case, I believe it's high time for me to start my investigation. After correctly deducing spear and golden statue, and examining knife rack, paper in hand, Mask\u2606DeMasque II's head, sword, and flowers on windowsill: Edgeworth: Hmm... I guess that about wraps up my investigation. Hm? That's... Larry: Yo! Pink Princess! How're you feeling? Still feeling ill? Pink Princess: .................. Franziska: ...And yet another strange character comes out of the woodwork. Edgeworth: And so the Pink Princess also comes to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. (I believe I may need to speak with her as well...) After clearing all Talk options with Wendy Oldbag: Officer: Prosecutor von Karma! I've brought the police dog, as you requested, sir! Franziska: Good work. You may leave now, Officer. Edgeworth: Hmm... This dog... Franziska: I requested the assistance of a dog in our search for the Yatagarasu. Lang: Looks like you guys have some pretty bright dogs in this country, too. ???: Woof! Woof! Lang: Hey... You're a real cutie, aren't you? Yeah! That's a good boy! Badd: ...That's the police dog Gumshoe's been taking care of... I think its name is... Missile. Franziska: What a fitting name for a police dog that dashes out in front and attacks. Edgeworth: (That action alone isn't exactly what's going to solve the case for us, you know.) Franziska: Now, Missile. I want you to find some clues! Go! Missile: Woof! Franziska: Good dog. You really are quite bright, aren't you? ...Unlike a certain someone I know. Now, what do we have here? What... is this? It looks like a small hot dog, but... Edgeworth: Hm? Wait, Franziska, isn't that... an official Samurai Dog? Missile: Grrraaaaaaarh! Franziska: Ah! No! Bad Missile! .........He ate it. I wonder if it's alright for him to eat that? Edgeworth: It's just a meat-substance snack featuring the Steel Samurai. I'm sure he'll be fine. Franziska: That's quite a bit of information you gathered there in a single, quick glance. Edgeworth: (We should really be focusing on why there was a Samurai Dog there in the first place.) Franziska: Hm? It looks like that snack wasn't all Missile found. Edgeworth: Oh? And what do we have... here...? Franziska: It appears to be a lady's undershirt. I wonder if Ambassador Alba might have an interest in cross-dressing? Edgeworth: I somehow doubt that. It doesn't look like the shirt would even fit him. (A Samurai Dog and a lady's undershirt... What are these two items doing in a room like this? Given the circumstances, the lady's undershirt could only belong to one person. I suppose I should get this over with and ask the owner of said undershirt about it...) Lady's Undershirt data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: If you could please take a look at this brown-colored undershirt... Oldbag: Oh, Edgey-poo... What is the meaning of this!? Edgeworth: ? Oldbag: Why did you steal that thing from my bags...? All you had to do was ask, and I would've gladly given you as many as you'd like! Edgeworth: Nnnrghk! Th-Thanks, but no thanks! This shirt was found here at this crime scene. Oldbag: What!? Edgeworth: Come now, why don't you just confess... and explain what it's doing here. Oldbag: I know nothing! NOTHING, I tell you! Edgeworth: What!? Oldbag: Oh, I admit that I used the fireplace to dry that shirt! But I can't really help the fact that I had to, you know! Wearing that Pink Princess costume was like being in a sauna! And on top of that, I get fingered as a suspect!? You're too cruel, Edgey-poo! Edgeworth: Are you claiming that you never once set foot inside this room? Oldbag: Of course I am! If I had been the one to find the body, do you think I'd be as calm and relaxed as I am!? I tell you, it's always like this! It's always my fault for some reason or another. That weekly tabloid article is missing? The camera is missing? That lawyer always makes sure it's my fault they're missing. Speaking of missing, there's the matter of my husband. Can you believe when we got married, he said, \"I guess I'm stuck marrying you.\" What kind of way to propose is that!? What he should've done is he should've whispered in my ear, \"I don't deserve you... but I can't help it. Will you marry me?\" Honestly, men these days! Edgeworth: Umm... Well... (I don't believe she is lying about her actions... So I can safely assume she really was drying her shirt by the fireplace on her break. And somehow, the undershirt managed to move from the next room into this one (Undershirt from next door - The undershirt was found in the office fireplace, but how did it get there?)...) I assume the Samurai Dog was also yours...? Oldbag: Ah, that brilliant mind of yours. You really can see through everything about me! Edgeworth: (And so the feeling of dread continues... But I suppose I should ask for more details...) After connecting all possible Logic and clearing \"Samurai Dogs\" Talk option with Wendy Oldbag: Edgeworth: (It would appear that the answer has made itself known.) Lang: You're making quite a confident face there, Mr. Prosecutor. Bring it on! I'm ready to counter any argument you may have! Edgeworth: Very well, then. If you are prepared... ...I'll show you exactly where my deductions have led me! Larry: Good! I'm counting on you, Edgey! Edgeworth: Leave it to me, Larry. My first attack will be... to expose your lie for what it really is. Larry: M-My liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!? Edgeworth: I know that there is still something you are keeping from the rest of us. Larry: Wh-What's wrong with you!? Why is it you won't believe me no matter what I say, Edgey!? Curse you! I should just hurry up and die already if that's how it's gonna be! I'll confess to every murder in the whole world, and then kill myself... ...and throw everything into mass confuuuuuuuuusion! Lang: Heh, you made some wonderful friends as a child, I see. Edgeworth: Larry, I only have one thing to say to you. Larry: Even if you make that face at me, it's no use! A man who is ready to die is strong-willed, you know! Edgeworth: Larry, it doesn't matter what sort of harebrained trouble you've caused... ...I only ask that you do not lie to me. If you cause an innocent person to be judged unfairly because of some insipid lie... ...I will never forgive you! Larry: E...Edgey... Edgeworth: Although, allow me to say... ...that I consider you to be among the innocent in this case. And that I will draw the real killer out. You can trust me on this. Larry: Alright. I... I... This time... This time, I'll tell you the whole truth, OK!? What happened, what didn't happen, the works! Edgeworth: Just what happened will do! Now then, if you would please testify as to what you did up on the roof tonight. Larry: After the show, I left the pushcart in the Rose Garden, and came into the embassy. Then, they took a picture of me shaking hands with the ambassador. After that, and until my next appearance, I had some free time, so I wandered around. That's when I spotted the chimney. A chimney like that is a rare thing, you know. So then, I wanted to play Santa and decided to give it a try. Edgeworth: Larry, I thought I just finished telling you to not lie anymore. Larry: Umm......... But it's... kinda, ultra-embarrassing. Edgeworth: And what exactly is so ultra-embarrassing that you can't tell me!? Larry: Edgey, man! I just said it was embarrassing, so of course I can't just blurt it out! So you're just gonna have to reason it ouuuuuuuuuuuuut of me! Franziska: As your superior, I command you to hurry up and expose this man's lie! Edgeworth: I have every intention to, for I'm not about to let us waste time on such a trifling matter. Larry: After the show, I left the pushcart in the Rose Garden, and came into the embassy. Larry: Then, they took a picture of me shaking hands with the ambassador. Larry: After that, and until my next appearance, I had some free time, so I wandered around. Larry: That's when I spotted the chimney. A chimney like that is a rare thing, you know. Larry: So then, I wanted to play Santa and decided to give it a try. Edgeworth: As I suspected, you do have something to hide, Larry. But what could be so embarrassing that you'd be willing to go to jail for it!? Franziska: This man's mind is a complete mystery to me. Edgeworth: I believe it's a secret to everyone of a normal mindset how Larry's mind works. However, taking into account his usual, women-obsessed way of thinking... ...I believe that his lie this time is also related to a woman, and this is what I intend to prove. Edgeworth: Actually, I believe in the case of this man, playing Santa is actually quite a big deal. Lang: Are you saying that your buddy isn't exactly made of Santa-quality stuff? Edgeworth: Precisely. You hit the nail on the head, Agent Lang. Larry: Hey, Edgey! That's so incredibly mean! Edgeworth: Tell me something, Larry. Did you know that Santa's job is to deliver presents to people all over the world? Larry: Of course I know that! I DID graduate from junior high, you know! Edgeworth: In that case, it's your turn to tell me something. I want you to tell me to whom you were delivering a present to. Larry: Umm... I was, ah... delivering a present to a child not basking in the warm glow (changed from [glow] in the original release) of love? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That must be the most elegant description of you I've ever heard, but a lie is still a lie. Larry: Y-You sure know how to kick a guy when he's down, you know that!? Edgeworth: In any case, the person you wished to deliver a present unto was most certainly this! Lang: Heh, interesting tastes you have there, Mr. Suspect. Larry: D-D-Don't spread lies about me! I totally didn't want to see Ms. Oldbag so much that I'd try to go down a chimney! Owww! Franziska: I advise you to stop right there in your bashing of a lady. Edgeworth: Well, I must admit that I, myself, hardly ever have the want to run into that lady. However... what if you were misinformed, and under the wrong impression? Then what? Lang: Define \"wrong impression\". Edgeworth: I simply mean that the man before you thought to enter the old lady's room... ...without knowing one very important fact. And that fact... is best summed up with this! Edgeworth: This is something the old lady received from her employer for the night. The girl who normally plays the Pink Princess... Mindy, was it again? It seems that this man is quite taken with that actress. Larry: Larry: But that's not true, Edgey! Edgeworth: ...? Larry: She's the one with the hots for me! I just know it! I can feel her sexy beam piercing my heart when she's watching me! Seeeeeexy beam, I tell you! Franziska: You filthy, despicable, inconsiderate, fickle, idiotic, cowardly... ...apparition of a man! You haven't matured at all since we last met! Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: Yes? Lang: This guy... He's got bigger problems than just getting involved in murders, I take it? Edgeworth: I suppose you could put it that way. Larry: Hey! What the heck, man!? I don't get you guys at all! Why do you all have to make me out to be some sort of bad guy!? Edgeworth: To return to the original topic, I propose that at least this much has been made clear. Without any knowledge that Ms. Mindy had fallen ill... ...Larry tried to make his way into the Pink Princess's room. That much we know for sure! Larry: Larry: Hey, Edgey... Looks like I've got the hang of this court thing now. Edgeworth: But we're not in court at the moment... Larry: Shut up! I see what's going on here, and it looks just like what you do in court! Lang: I guess old boy here still has something he'd like to say. Lang Zi says: \"Until the root of the tongue dries, one never knows the whole truth.\" You shouldn't form conclusions until everything is out in the open, which is why I'll listen. Larry: Alright! Then get ready to listen to me defeat Edgey in a battle of wits! Edgeworth: (Larry, have you forgotten that should I \"lose\", your victory prize will be your arrest?) Larry: So you think that all I wanted to do was to go visit Mindy? Well, I dressed up as Santa and climbed up to the chimney, but the smoke was really thick. It was a case of mistaken identity, and that mistake made me late for the speech. Then, to top it all off, I became a suspect in a murder. THAT'S what you really meant. But why would I ever put myself through so much humiliation on purpose!? Edgeworth: .................. Lang: .................. Larry: ..................Hey! Someone say something! Edgeworth: Larry, are you seriously trying to submit this, not as a confession, but as testimony? Larry: So what if I am!? Is there something wrong with that!? My claim is a claim claiming my claim. Do you have a problem with that!? Oldbag: So it was you! You're my stalker! But I should warn you, it doesn't matter what kind of flattery you throw at me. I'm the devoted type of woman who's wholly focused on one man, and one man only! And as long as Edgey-poo is alive, I can't just drop him and be unfaithful! No, I can't! Although, earlier, I was tempted just a tiny-winy bit by that wolf-man! But that was just a test of my love for my dear Edgey-poo, which I passed with flying colors! But from now on, I will stay completely true to my beloved Edgey-poo for the rest of eternity! I swear it! Larry: Aaaaah! I-I'm so inspired! Franziska: You're such an inconsiderate, cowardly, idiotic, and all-around completely worthless man! Edgeworth: (I thought I heard something ominous just now, but perhaps it was just my imagination.) I believe there is nothing further for me to prove at this point... Larry: What do you mean!? Of course you've still got something to prove! You still have to show some proof that I was trying to meet up with Mindy! Edgeworth: \"Proof\", you say? Larry: Remember, Edgey!? Everything is evidence in court, right!? Edgeworth: You mean, \"Evidence is everything in court,\" Larry, but I understand your point. Larry: Yeah, see! I'm totally a pro at this now! Edgeworth: Very well. If you wish to see the evidence... ...then let me show you the last piece of evidence you'll ever wish to see. Larry: So you think that all I wanted to do was to go visit Mindy? Larry: Well, I dressed up as Santa and climbed up to the chimney, but the smoke was really thick. Larry: It was a case of mistaken identity, and that mistake made me late for the speech. Larry: Then, to top it all off, I became a suspect in a murder. THAT'S what you really meant. Larry: But why would I ever put myself through so much humiliation on purpose!? Edgeworth: (This whole testimony is one giant confession of all that he's done tonight. He's practically begging me to show why he bothered to put himself through all of this.) Edgeworth: Larry, don't even think about denying that you have knowledge of this letter. Larry: H-H-H-H-H-Hey! Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Why are you showing that thing to me!? Franziska: \"W\u00e9ndy, I'll be descending on you from above tonight. Your loving knight\" Well, isn't that just romantic? Edgeworth: But you weren't able to \"descend on her from above\", were you... Mr. Loving Knight? Larry: Aaaaaaaaaaaarghn! I-I have no idea what you're talking about! I don't remember a thing! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You can pretend to be ignorant all you'd like, but it's written right here. This letter proves that you were not out to meet the old lady... ...but rather, that you were attempting to pay Ms. Mindy a visit! (What part of this letter shows that the person Larry had intended to meet was Mindy?) Edgeworth: Larry, I suggest you take up penmanship lessons. That is... ...if you never wish to experience this level of embarrassment ever again. Larry: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the heck!? What are you talking about!? Speak English! Edgeworth: You wrote \"Mindy\" so sloppily that it became \"W\u00e9ndy\" to the average eye. Larry: ...Hey, stop picking on me... It's so embarrassiiiiiiiiiing! Lang: There, there. Isn't that what childhood friends are for? They're the best, aren't they? ...For punching. But that will have to wait until we're off of this crime scene. Larry: Eek! Edgey! Save me from the scary man! Edgeworth: Sure, if you're willing to make amends. Starting with your incredibly embarrassing mistake! Larry: .........That... That... That wasn't me! Edgeworth: Come again? Larry: It's a fake! Someone's out to get me, so they made that fake letter... ...to set me uuuuuuuuup! Franziska: Accept your defeat graciously! Larry: But... you guys are being so mean... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Penmanship analysis. Larry: What's that? Edgeworth: No matter who, all people have certain unique features to their handwriting. Ergo, all we have to do is compare the handwriting in this letter to a sample of yours... ...and we'll know soon enough who it was that sent this letter. Larry: I...I...I... I'll never write another thing in my life! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Tsk, tsk, tsk... It's no use, Mr. Loving Knight. For you've already graciously provided me with a sample of your handwriting! Edgeworth: This autograph and our mysterious letter... If we compare the handwriting, we'll know the answer to our questions soon enough. Larry: Gnn...nnn... Nnnnnnnn...! Edgeworth: Confess now, Larry... to your miserable failure! Larry: I...I'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorry! I... I... I did it... It was me causing trouble again... I admit it. You hit the nail right on the head... Edgey... Edgeworth: (So, he finally confesses...) Larry: I saw the Pink Princess being carried around in a stretcher, and got worried, alright!? I wanted to go into Mindy's room, but the doctors wouldn't let me in. So what choice did I have!? It was the chimney or bust, Edgey! Franziska: Your mind jumped from the door to the chimney? What a criminally overactive imagination. Larry: Well, at least I was honest and wrote Mindy a letter, and stuck it under the door. That way, she wouldn't be so shocked when I came down through the chimney! Edgeworth: (Except for the fact that the letter was an utter failure at conveying said sentiment...) Larry: I'm really, really sorry... Edgeworth: Larry, you may be a shameful, good-for-nothing blight on the face of humanity... ...however, I always knew you weren't the killer. I told you to trust me... ...because, at the very least, I can attest to that about you. Larry: Edgey... You're... Aaaack! Franziska: We've lost a lot of valuable time because of you...! Larry: Owwwwwwwww! Franziska: In any case, I believe we can say that we now know exactly what happened. Mr. Larry Butz sought to climb down the chimney... ...not for access to the crime scene... ...but to enter the room of the elderly lady next door. Lang: Lang: Great job, Mr. Prosecutor. Although, I still find it a bit unbelievable that the two of you are friends. Edgeworth: .................. Lang: But the suspicion on that guy over there... ...isn't completely resolved yet, so don't get any funny ideas about running off, OK? Larry: Owwwww...w? H-Hey... What--? Edgey... What does the wolf-man mean when he says I'm not off the hook yet? Edgeworth: .........He means the murder weapon. Larry, did you forget? There are two layers of suspicion hanging over your head. Lang: That's exactly what I mean. We can't only rely on the words of the suspect, after all. We may have figured out where he was and what he was doing all night... ...but the blood-stained Samurai Sword that was left at the crime scene... As long as there is no satisfactory explanation for that... ...this wolf will refuse to ease up on his bite! Larry: Eeeeeek! Edgey! That guy... He looks like he's seriously about to take a bite out of me! Edgeworth: I'm well aware. And you should be as well, that this upcoming battle will be crucial. Lang: Thanks to the cooperation of our lovely bumbler... ...I've been dealt a very nice hand, and a sweet trump card. Looks like we're about to enter the final bout! Now, Mr. Prosecutor! Let's see what you've got! Edgeworth: (I can easily point out the contradiction in the supposed \"murder weapon\"... ...but the real problem for me is figuring out what the real murder weapon is. This will be a high-stakes gamble! But this is one game I can't afford to lose!) Lang: I was the one who found the body of the victim, DeMasque II. Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood. It was supposed to be in the Steel Samurai's dressing room, but I found it here instead. Plus, I found the murder weapon's owner, the suspect, Larry Butz in here, too. Edgeworth: Isn't it a bit far-fetched to accuse someone simply on the basis of ownership? Lang: But this owner wanted to sneak onto the crime scene. I think that's plenty to go on, don't you? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you're alluding to his reason for being by the chimney, we've already established that! Lang: Lang: Hold on there, Mr. Prosecutor. You two are long-time friends, right? Who's to say you didn't fabricate the evidence to give him an alibi? Edgeworth: .........You're accusing me of fabricating evidence? Lang: You think I can believe anything you produce? Forging evidence is all you prosecutors do! Edgeworth: .........! (This man has some serious issues with prosecutors...) Larry: But come on, I can't think up something as complicated as that! Right, Edgey!? Edgeworth: Larry, I can agree because I know you and your personality well. However, Agent Lang knows nothing about you... or me, for that matter. (I sense his hatred for my entire profession emanating from his entire being. Meaning that the only way I can prove Larry's innocence is to present irrefutable evidence.) Lang: I was the one who found the body of the victim, DeMasque II. Lang: Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood. Lang: Beside him was the Samurai Sword... covered in the victim's blood. Lang: I suspect he beat the victim to death with that thing. Lang: It was supposed to be in the Steel Samurai's dressing room, but I found it here instead. Lang: Plus, I found the murder weapon's owner, the suspect, Larry Butz in here, too. Edgeworth: (It's simply not possible that the Samurai Sword is the real murder weapon. So I should focus on proving that point to Agent Lang first.) Edgeworth: Do you know what this is, Agent Lang? Lang: Heh, it's a long spear, right? We used to use those a lot in my country a long time ago. Piercing, mowing people down... Spears are the weapon of heroes throughout history. Franziska: It's the next most effective weapon after the whip. Edgeworth: (I think the whip is in a slightly different category...) Lang: So, what's your point? Are you going to tell me that the spear is the real weapon? Edgeworth: No. I simply want you to take a look at this section here. Lang: The way it's bent...? Edgeworth: Precisely. Apparently, a certain troublemaker hit it against a wall in this embassy earlier. And as you can clearly see, the insides of the Steel Samurai's weapons are hollow. In other words, they're replicas that aren't strong enough to deliver a damaging blow... ...let alone the multiple strikes necessary to bludgeon someone to death. And yet, there is not even a dent in the Samurai Sword. How do you explain that!? Lang: A...Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Larry: Oh, yeah... The sword and the spear are made of the same stuff, so they bend easily! But I wish they'd make them out of better stuff! Because the spear got bent... ...I wasn't able to do my special \"Early Summer Rain Jab!\" move! Man, I got such an earful from the director of the play for not doing it in the show! Edgeworth: (The Steel Samurai's special move was changed tonight because of him...!?) Samurai Spear data updated in my Organizer. Larry: Yeoooooooooowch! Franziska: That's more than enough of your whiny whimpering! Now... back on the topic of the spear. Edgeworth: Yes, let's return to the real topic of discussion. (This is where the real gamble begins. I don't have a real strategy, per se... ...so all I can do for now is let the chips fall where they may.) Franziska: Using guesswork and taking risks in place of real logic is hardly the Von Karma way. It's neither smart nor very clever. Edgeworth: Ms. von Karma, as you know, unlike your father, I am not a genius prosecutor. Plus, I doubt his record of a 40-year win streak will ever be broken. Franziska: .................. Edgeworth: But perhaps, it is for the best if it remains unbroken. For no one should've conceived of the notion to \"convict all defendants\" in the first place! Franziska: Franziska: What a foolishly foolish statement from a foolish fool who hates to lose... It's the job of a prosecutor to make sure that all defendants are found guilty in court. There is nothing more important in this world than a perfect victory! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That may be your opinion, however, I don't believe that's all we are. Lang: .........! Edgeworth: As a prosecutor, what I pursue is not the perfect victory, but the perfect truth. And if that means that the bridge I must cross will crumble beneath my feet... ...then let it crumble as I walk on towards the truth! Lang: Lang: You're good at keeping me entertained, Mr. Prosecutor! But you know... humans are delicate creatures. The slightest bump and we expire. I'd like you to consider, if you will, the possibility that... ...the sword was used in such a way that the attack killed DeMasque II without bending it. Edgeworth: .................. Lang: So, what do you think of my hypothetical scenario? I think you know what to do here, right? And what you need! Edgeworth: Of course. (What I need is evidence even he (changed from [Agent Lang] in the original release) can't refute! This is it! It's time to bring this to a close!) Lang: It's possible to use the Samurai Sword to kill someone. And under these circumstances, it's the only logical conclusion. We searched the Embassy, top to bottom, but the victim's blood is only on that weapon. So isn't it only natural that suspicion would fall onto the owner of said weapon? Edgeworth: How long do you intend to cling onto that preposterous theory? Lang: As long as I want, because we examined every corner within the walls of this Embassy. There's no stone we've left unturned! And we have managed to come up with only one logical conclusion! That the only place inside this embassy with the victim's blood on it is this sword. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You left no stone unturned? Is that a fact? Lang: Lang: If you've got something to say, then say it in the only way I respect, Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: Yes, of course. In that case, allow me to make it all crystal clear for you! Lang: It's possible to use the Samurai Sword to kill someone. Lang: And under these circumstances, it's the only logical conclusion. Lang: We searched the Embassy, top to bottom, but the victim's blood is only on that weapon. Lang: So isn't it only natural that suspicion would fall onto the owner of said weapon? Edgeworth: ...I can prove to you... the possibility that the murder weapon is something else... ...but I cannot do so on my strength alone. Franziska: Franziska: Miles Edgeworth. What are you running straight into a quagmire for? I thought you said that you were busy in pursuit of the perfect truth. And if that's the case, then show me this perfect truth, if it exists at all! Edgeworth: Don't worry. Thanks to you, I've already prepared myself to do just that. Franziska: There's no need to thank me. I'm simply doing what any good superior would. Edgeworth: Heh... I suppose you are. Very well, then. I will show you the possibility of a different murder weapon. Edgeworth: If you believe that there is no other door of possibility left to open... ...then allow me to force one open for you! Lang: Lang: Hmph! And how do you plan to do that? Edgeworth: By showing you what may possibly be the real murder weapon. Lang: Lang: Ha! Ha ha ha ha! The \"real\" murder weapon? I hate to repeat myself... ...but my men have already searched every last inch of this embassy! And they've concluded that nothing else could've been used as the weapon! Knowing these facts, do you still want to press forward with your little hypothesis? Edgeworth: Of course. Because it's not possible that your men inspected everything in their investigation. Lang: Lang: What are you talking about!? I don't appreciate mind games, and I don't appreciate it when people like you slander my men! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not slandering them, I assure you! I'm merely pointing out that their investigative dragnet has a few holes in it! Namely, that there is something your men couldn't even lay a finger on. And that item is the real murder weapon! Lang: Aaaaaaaalright then! I'll play along for now! This \"real\" weapon that killed DeMasque II... What exactly is it!? Edgeworth: The real murder weapon, which not a single person has yet to touch, is this! Edgeworth: .........The national treasure of Allebahst. Lang: Lang: You mean the Primidux Statue? Edgeworth: Yes, and as you know, only the ambassador and his secretariat may touch it. Which, I believe, means that neither you nor your men were able to examine it, correct? Lang: Lang: Ha... ha ha ha ha... You know very well that if we did that, there'd be an international incident... ...between the Kingdom of Allebahst and the Republic of Babahl. The two countries' precarious relationship teeters in the balance... ...over a stupid fight related to a sovereignty statue! But I'll be damned if I let something go unexamined! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang, if you could take a look at this... The direction the statue is facing just before and after the crime are different...! And there is only one conclusion I can draw from that. Lang: .................. Go look for Ambassador Alba, and get him to give us the OK to examine the statue. MIB: Shifu! You can't listen to this infidel's words! He is most definitely trying to trick you! Shifu! Please, let's be rational about this! Lang: Grr! Lang Zi says: .........Just go already! MIB: Y-Yes, sir! MIB: Shifu... Lang: Yeah? MIB: I'm really sorry, sir, but I was unable to convince the ambassador. I was unable to obtain permission for us to examine the Primidux Statue. Lang: ...Hmph. I see. Franziska: Wait...! But then, the investigation is at a standstill! Agent Lang! I will go and speak with the ambassador personally! Lang: Save your breath. He may act all weak and frail, but that old man's one tough cookie. But I guess you've gotta be tough when you're representing a whole country, you know? Edgeworth: Agent Lang... Lang: What do you want? Let's just hurry up and examine the statue already. MIB: Wh--!? But Shifu! What about causing an international incident!? Lang: Quiet! I'll take the fall if I have to later! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang, the hypothesis is mine, so if someone is to take the responsibility, let it be me! Lang: Responsibility? If we're going to talk in such heavy terms, maybe I should let you. It'd be a real problem for my men if something were to happen to me. Alright then... Less talk and more investigating! Edgeworth: (If we want to know the truth, we can't stop here! Action must be taken!) Agent Lang, I'd like to run a Luminol chemiluminescence test on the statue. Lang: A Luminol test...? Ah, good thinking. If the statue is the murder weapon, then some of the victim's blood should be on it. Okaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! Let's get the forensics team in here! Lang: Heh! Looks like you hit the jackpot, Mr. Prosecutor. I guess this means that this is the real weapon that killed DeMasque II. Edgeworth: Indeed...! Lang: But I wouldn't celebrate yet if I were you. This doesn't let your friend off the hook. It doesn't prove that he didn't kill DeMasque II, so the charge remains! Edgeworth: ...We are hardly done examining this statue, Agent Lang! Knowing that it IS the real weapon, I believe further examination is required. Lang: Hah, you think so? OK then, knock yourself out! Leads to examination of Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: ...Nngh. Lang: And what do we have here? This dirty smudge... It looks like... a handprint? Heh heh heh heh... Haaa hahahahahahaha! What's a definitive bit of evidence like you doing under here!? Looks like we've got some fingerprints to analyze! Edgeworth: Gnrk! (Worst case scenario, these prints belong to Larry... But it looks like it's too late for me to do anything about that now...!) Lang: Hey! Forensics guy! I want results on these fingerprints ASAP, you hear me!? Forensics: Agent Lang! I have the analysis results, sir! Lang: Good! And!? Forensics: Sir! About the prints we lifted from the bottom of the statue... Well, um... You know the victim of the murder in the Babahlese Embassy...? The prints belong to him, to Mr. Manny Coachen, sir! Lang: But that's--! Wh-What's going on around here!? Edgeworth: No... That's... impossible! (Each Primidux Statue can only be handled by someone of that country. But by the very fact that Mr. Coachen's fingerprints are on this one... ...it leads me to only one conclusion...!) This statue... is actually Babahl's Primidux Statue! Franziska: Impossible! It can't be...! Lang: A...! Aaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiya! Edgeworth: (Larry never once set foot on Babahlese soil, so he was free to go... However... this new piece of information only served to confuse us even further. The ringleader of a smuggling operation was killed with an Allebahstian knife in Babahl... ...and DeMasque II was killed on Allebahstian soil with Babahl's national treasure... ...and the mystery of the Great Thief Yatagarasu, who visited both countries. The pieces were there, but I had yet to see the big picture they were to form.) To be continued Edgeworth: (I've left the DeMasque II investigation to Franziska and returned to Babahl. I suppose my first order of business should be to look into Babahl's statue...) Kay: Mr. Edgewoooorth! Edgeworth: So, Kay, what's the situation? Kay: Oh, it's great! Investigating is so much fun! Edgeworth: (...In other words, they've made absolutely no progress.) Gumshoe: W-We weren't goofing off! Honest, sir! We've been investigating our hearts out! Edgeworth: Very well, then. Would you care to give me an update on your investigation? Gumshoe: ...Ummmmm... Oh! We've had a really fun time, sir! Edgeworth: (I knew it. Zero progress...) In any case, Detective Gumshoe... Gumshoe: Yes, sir? Edgeworth: You have permission to enter the Allebahstian Embassy, is that correct? Gumshoe: Yup! As a local detective, I'm helping out with investigations on both sides, sir! Edgeworth: Good. In that case, I can leave these... pieces of evidence with you. They belong to the lady under the Pink Princess's mask. Gumshoe: The Pink Princess? What kind of lady was playing her, sir? Edgeworth: The kind that was also playing the role of the Pink Badger yesterday. Gumshoe: Ugh! Ooonnngh... Understood, sir... If I happen to run into her, I'll give them back to her. And if I don't... then I guess I'll unload them somewhere... Edgeworth: (He doesn't seem all that enthused to go find her, but I can't blame him.) Evidence that has lost their value given to Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: Now then, I don't believe I'll be needing this anymore either. Kay: Whaaaat!? Are you really going to throw that autograph away!? Edgeworth: Yes, because that Steel Samurai was a fake. Steel Samurai's Autograph scrunched up into a ball and disposed of. Kay: Wait, what? What do you mean by \"fake\"? Edgeworth: (Now then, I believe it's time for a little housekeeping.) Unnecessary evidence has been removed. Remaining evidence has been re-arranged. After clearing Talk option with Dick Gumshoe and presenting Babahl's Primidux Statue or Allebahst's Primidux Statue to Colias Palaeno: Kay: Hey, where are you going? Are you heading back to Allebahst? Edgeworth: Yes, but before I do, I suppose I should give you a summary of what's happened. Kay: ...Oh, I see. So there's been a murder in both countries using an object from the other country...? Edgeworth: That's the gist of it. Babahl is just as strict as Allebahst... ...in their inspection of the people and things that enter their country. Meaning that somehow, both murder weapons were smuggled into the two countries. That's the only logical conclusion that can be drawn. Perhaps the key to the weapon smuggling is the person who traversed both countries... Kay: You mean the fake Yatagarasu!? Edgeworth: In one way or another, the Yatagarasu is connected... Of this I am sure! Now then, where was the Yatagarasu first spotted? Palaeno: I believe it was the rose garden on the Allebahstian side of the embassy. The garden is just on the other side of this boundary. It's where Ambassador Alba was to give a speech tonight. At least, that's where I heard the Yatagarasu had appeared. Edgeworth: In that case, I believe it's vital that I investigate the rose garden posthaste. Kay: Wait, before you go... Take a look at this, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What... is it? Kay: My guess is that it's a guitar pick. I picked it up just now over there. Do you think it'll be of any use? Edgeworth: (There is a little water on it... but how did the water get on it? It doesn't look like there's anything it could get wet from around here...) Kay: I was thinking, they have concerts here at this open-air stage from time to time, right? Edgeworth: Alright, I'll find its owner later... Pick data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Oh, yeah! There's one more thing... Mr. Edgeworth, would you be willing to hold onto this? Edgeworth: What is this? Kay: It's Ms. Yew's perfume. It's the bottle that woman left behind and that I found seven years ago. I thought that one day, it'd be of some use in tracking her down... ...so I kept it safe all this time. Edgeworth: Thank you. I'd be honored to hold onto it for you. Ms. Yew's Perfume data jotted down in my Organizer. Theatrum Neutralis Open-air stage (before approaching door on left side in Theatrum Neutralis) ???: I see you're back, Miles Edgeworth. How are things in Babahl? Although, I can't really say I expect much from Scruffy and that girl. Edgeworth: The investigation into Manny Coachen's death hasn't really progressed any... ...however, the investigation into the Yatagarasu has. Franziska: Ah, yes, the Yatagarasu. Even now, I find it hard to believe. A person who can freely traverse between the two countries at will? Preposterous. Edgeworth: Well, that's what I came here to investigate. I heard that this is where witnesses claim to have seen the Yatagarasu. Franziska: That's correct. Ambassador Alba was to give a speech tonight here in Allebahst. And that's when the Yatagarasu appeared. The shadow of the mysterious thief appeared, and just as suddenly, it vanished... After that, there was the fire at the Babahlese Embassy that the Yatagarasu started. Edgeworth: (I vow that not a single feather from the Yatagarasu shall escape my diligence!) After clearing Talk option with Shi-Long Lang and examining statue of man, pool, and statue of woman: Edgeworth: The suddenly appearing and disappearing shadow of the Yatagarasu... I believe I've figured out its true origin. Franziska: I expected no less from my subordinate. Now, let's hear what you know on the subject. What really cast the shadow of the Yatagarasu? Edgeworth: The suddenly appearing and disappearing shadow of the Yatagarasu... Is it not possible that it was created by this statue? Franziska: Franziska: Are you playing me for a fool, Miles Edgeworth!? This statue bears absolutely no resemblance to the shadow of the Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: You are correct, however, this statue is but one part of the whole picture. Franziska: What do you mean by \"only one part\"...? Edgeworth: What is the other part to the real form of the Yatagarasu's shadow? Franziska: It's... another statue? Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu's shadow was made from the shadows of these two statues. Franziska: Made? What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: Right now, the spotlights are all over the place. This is because they were moved when the guests were in a panicked state. However, if we were to restore the lights to where they were when the thief appeared... Franziska: You believe that the two shadows will create the Yatagarasu's shadow? Edgeworth: Precisely. Now then, watch as I reveal the true form of the Yatagarasu! First, if we set up a spotlight to cast a shadow of \"King Primidux and the Battlefield\"... ...the shadow of the king's statue would appear on the backdrop of the stage. Likewise, if we set a light up on \"The Queen Who Spoke of Love To King Primidux\"... ...her silhouette would also appear on the backdrop to the stage. Franziska: Aha! So if we were to combine the two shadows...! Franziska: ............ It looks nothing like the Yatagarasu's shadow! Miles Edgeworth! How do you explain this grotesque shape!? Edgeworth: C-Calm down, Franziska! The way the light needs to be shone on the queen's statue is wrong... Franziska: What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: I believe that the whole of the king's shadow needs to be used for this to work. However, in the case of the queen, I don't believe her whole shadow is needed. Rather, the person who created the shadow only used one part of her shadow. Franziska: Only one part? Edgeworth: Yes, and that one part alone is enough to fill in the rest of the Yatagarasu's shadow. Franziska: Why didn't you say that in the first place!? Edgeworth: You're right. I-I apologize... Franziska: Now, what part of the queen's statue was used to complete the Yatagarasu's shadow? Edgeworth: Think back to what is missing in our shadow. Five long, thin areas, correct? Now, what does that remind you of? Franziska: Ah! Edgeworth: That's right. It can only be the shadow of the queen's left hand. Franziska, can we please adjust the spotlight's position... ...so that it only shines on the queen's left hand? Franziska: Alright. Let's give it a try and see what we get. Franziska: It's...! Lang: Hmph... Yeah, this is exactly like the shadow I saw. Edgeworth: The culprit must've changed the spotlights' positioning beforehand... ...and then pulled the plug after people saw what the culprit wanted them to see. In their panic, the guests must have moved the spotlights around... ...which we can assume was also a part of the culprit's plan. By the time the lights came back on, the Yatagarasu's shadow had vanished. Franziska: Which means that the shadow was a construct from the very beginning. Edgeworth: So you see, the Yatagarasu never did visit Allebahst tonight. The only country that thief visited was Babahl, although it can be assumed... ...that the Yatagarasu had an accomplice in Allebahst. Franziska: An accomplice? But who...? Edgeworth: I haven't figured that out yet, but I assume it was the person who set up the shadow show. (I sense that the biggest clue yet to solving this case is the existence of this accomplice!) ???: .........How's the investigation going? Edgeworth: Detective Badd, have you come to join us in investigating the Yatagarasu? Badd: I've left the murder... in Agent Lang's charge... And my only target... from the very beginning is the Yatagarasu... so yes... Edgeworth: So... what have you found out? Badd: ...I got a piece of evidence. Edgeworth: May I see it...? Badd: ...Sure, but you might regret it... Franziska: We're here because we are ready to face whatever may come. ...So if you please. Badd: ...When people heard the commotion, bystanders... started gathering. And one woman... claimed, \"I'm tellin' ya I'm a genuine international journalist!\"... She gave me... an interesting picture. Edgeworth: A journalist...? Badd: Well, actually... she's a freelance... cameraman. This... is the photo I got from her. Edgeworth: Wh-What in the world!? Franziska: The Yatagarasu... is flying through the air...! Badd: ...The times, they are a-changing... It's... not just man... ...but evidence... even they lie to us now... Edgeworth: Wh-When was this photo taken? Badd: ...Apparently, right after the fires... on the fourth and fifth floors were put out... It was taken... from a near-by building... that you can see the embassy from. Edgeworth: I see. So this was taken after the fire... Photo of Yatagarasu data jotted down in my Organizer. Badd: The blur in this picture... took off from the Babahlese Embassy... ...flew over the boundary... and headed for the Embassy of Allebahst... Franziska: Franziska: This is simply not possible! People are incapable of flight! Edgeworth: Is that a fact? I've had the \"pleasure\" of dealing with a case involving a \"flying person\" once. Franziska: .............................. Actually, come to think of it, I've come across a case like that as well. Two, actually. Badd: ...Maybe it happens more often than we think... Edgeworth: (Am I up to the task of solving the mystery behind this photograph? Well, the Yatagarasu took off from the Babahlese Embassy, so I should start from there.) Franziska, I need to return to the Babahl investigation for a bit. Franziska: ...Alright. Theatrum Neutralis Kay: Welcome back, Mr. Edgeworth! Now come on! Let's get back to our investigation! Edgeworth: Yes, let's. Rose Garden Franziska: I see you're back. Well, let's continue with the investigation, shall we? Edgeworth: Yes, let's. Kay: To think, after all that running around, we're right back where we started. Edgeworth: It would appear that way... Palaeno: Hi, Mr. Edgeworth. Have you found Manny's killer yet? Edgeworth: I'm terribly sorry, Ambassador Palaeno, but I have yet to find his killer. Palaeno: Then I guess his murder... really was the work of the Yatagarasu... Kay: Let's get one thing straight. It was the work of the FAKE Yatagarasu. The real Yatagarasu is a noble vigilante who is only out to steal the truth... Palaeno: Ms. Faraday... Please don't make such a sad face. If there's anything I can do for you, all you have to do is ask, alright? Kay: Mr. Palaeno... Edgeworth: Actually, there is one thing you can do. Will you allow us to take another look around? We didn't have enough time to conduct a thorough investigation earlier. Palaeno: Oh, sure! Please feel free to investigate to your heart's content. Edgeworth: Also, there are a few questions I'd like to ask you personally, Ambassador. Palaeno: If it will bring a smile back to Ms. Faraday's face, then I'll gladly answer anything. Kay: Thank you, Mr. Palaeno! You're a total gentleman! Palaeno: Ha ha ha. You don't have to waste such nice words on me, little miss! Kay: Hey, Sir Palaeno! Edgeworth: (...Those two sure got chummy awfully quickly.) Kay: You know, it's easy to say we're going to investigate, but where should we begin? Edgeworth: We should probably start by comparing the state of this room before and after the fire. And then, we should look into the matter of the suspicious person you spotted. Kay: Yeah. When I came into this room, that person was already gone. But I'm willing to bet that the person I was chasing is Mr. Coachen's killer. Edgeworth: We don't know that yet; however, it's hard to believe that person is unrelated. Furthermore, because the key the Yatagarasu stole seven years ago was found here... ...it signals that perhaps Ms. Yew is also somehow involved. Kay: I knew it! That woman is almost definitely Mr. Coachen's killer! Edgeworth: Yet again, we don't know that! (There are too many mysteries to be solved here (changed from [in this case] in the original release).) Speaking of the Yatagarasu and mysteries... ...I received a most mysterious photo from Detective Badd. Kay: Uncle Badd!? He's taking part in the investigation, too!? Edgeworth: Yes. He has been chasing after the Yatagarasu for all these years. Kay: Uncle Badd......... Edgeworth: Now then, I was told that this photo was taken just after the fire... Kay: Wh-What--!? This kinda looks like the person in the long coat I was chasing...! Does this mean... that I was chasing the fake Yatagarasu after all? Edgeworth: I don't know the answer to your question, but I don't think people can fly either... Kay: But this could be how that person escaped! Edgeworth: Well, we'll need to investigate a bit more before we can say anything about that. In any case, let's not dawdle any more and pick up our investigation where we left off. After clearing all Talk options with Colias Palaeno: Gumshoe: Oh! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe, have you collected the information that I requested? Gumshoe: Yup! Got it all right here, sir! Here you go, Kay. Feel free to take a look! It's for you, after all. Kay: What is all this, Gummy...? Gumshoe: It's all the information on this room that I got from the Embassy and Interpol people. Now we know exactly how this room was before and after the fire! Edgeworth: Good work, Detective. Gumshoe: Aww, it was nothing, sir! I'm an expert at getting people to talk! Kay: Wow... You two remind me so much of my father and Uncle Badd... Edgeworth: What do you mean? Kay: As prosecutor and detective, your dynamic is just like theirs back in the day. Edgeworth: ......... Kay: Well, don't you worry! I'm going to find my own wonderful partner someday! And when I do, I'm going to become a good Yatagarasu, just like my father, right? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Please don't ask me questions to which I have no answers to, Kay. However, I can say that is truly a wonderful thing to find a partner you can trust. Kay: Heh heh, you bet! So, what now, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Well... I'd like to ask you for a favor. Kay: Yes? Edgeworth: That gadget... Mr. Thief, is it? That thing you call your secret weapon. Kay: Oh, you mean \"Little Thief\"! Heh, you're coming to rely on it, aren't you? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I-I don't need a crutch like that! I'm only asking because I need it for the investigation! From the information Detective Gumshoe gathered, and the ambassador's testimony... ...I'd like you to please re-create this room as it was during the third floor fire. Kay: You got it! Alright, here we go! Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! Now, witness the true power of a real, modern-day Robin Hood! Edgeworth: It seems there are other things besides what the ambassador mentioned that have changed. It's possible that we might find the escape route the person Kay saw used as well. Palaeno: Oooh! Wh-What is this? Is it some sort of light show I was not told about? Kay: This is the power of a true vigilante! It's re-creating the room with the info I inputted! Palaeno: Really!? That is certainly one interesting device you have there, Ms. Faraday! Edgeworth: Ahem. I believe it's about time we returned to our investigation. After examining flames: Edgeworth: These must have been the large green flames Ambassador Palaeno saw. Kay: With flames like these, it's no wonder he couldn't get in! Edgeworth: Kay, by the time you came into this room, had the fire already been put out? Kay: Yeah, the fire had died out or something by that time. Edgeworth: Then this fire in here only burned from the time the fire started on the third floor... ...until the Yatagarasu appeared and caused a stir in Babahl, I suppose. Kay: I guess Mr. Palaeno was just lucky enough to run into this fire as it was burning, huh? Edgeworth: Yes, you could put it that way. And since you were the first to discover the body... ...we can assume that no one else entered the room until that time. No one other than the person you were chasing, of course. Kay: I knew it! That person I saw was definitely up to no good! I mean, that person could even be Mr. Coachen's killer! Edgeworth: That is very likely to be the case. After all, that person came into this room before you... ...and must have chosen this room precisely because they knew no one would be in here. Kay: OK, then maybe the green fire was where it was to prevent anyone from coming in? But then, what did the person set on fire to make the green flames? Edgeworth: Hmm... Well, whatever it is that person burned, it made a rather sizable fire. Kay: And since the fire's green... well, we've seen something that burns green, right!? It's a bit tinier than these flames, but you get what I mean. Edgeworth: Yes, and I do believe that what you are thinking is exactly why these flames are green. Which fire-related piece of evidence burns the same color as these green flames? Edgeworth: This silhouette lantern... Its green flame comes from the whitcrystal oil it's burning. Kay: Yeah! That's the fire I was thinking of, too! I love the green it gives off. Edgeworth: I think we've now established that the green flames were caused by whitcrystal oil. Furthermore, we know that there is only one other thing made from whitcrystal oil. Kay: Oh! You mean that thing Mr. Palaeno was mistaken about, right!? Edgeworth: Yes, precisely... as we found out earlier in our investigation. Gumshoe: Um, what? I don't get it. Can you fill me in, sir!? Edgeworth: Fine, I suppose. I'll explain it in a way that even you can understand. This is the thing made from whitcrystal oil that Ambassador Palaeno was mistaken about! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink is made from whitcrystal oil. Gumshoe: Ohhhh! So, it should burn the same color as the flames in the lantern, right!? Edgeworth: Yes, precisely. However, the green flames in this room were not from a bottle of Babahlese ink. Kay: Because we found the ink Mr. Coachen used on his desk, right!? Edgeworth: Yes. However... we know that Mr. Coachen was smuggling the ink in massive quantities. Now, what do you suppose he made using all that ink? I believe what he made with that ink is the answer to what gave birth to the green flames. Kay: Oh, yeah! I'm beginning to really feel the energy coming from you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Heh... It would appear that I've finally found it, the smuggling ring's real goal!) Made of Babahlese ink, this is the source of the green flames! Edgeworth: What would consume that great of a volume of ink to make...? That would be... ...the counterfeit bills that the smuggling ring made and are circulating in Zheng Fa. Kay: You're kidding!? You're saying that it was Mr. Coachen who made the counterfeit bills...? Edgeworth: I am. I believe you could even go so far as to say that he \"stole\" Babahl's printing press. Ambassador, Mr. Coachen had permission to freely use the printing press, correct? Palaeno: Why, yes. And I do remember seeing him use it in the middle of the night... ...but never did I think he was using it for such a foul deed...! Edgeworth: Ambassador! Because of your secretary's crimes, you will need to be investigated as well! Palaeno: Ah, yes, I suppose so. We've caused a bit of trouble for a few countries, haven't we? Edgeworth: It's my duty to search out all who shielded Mr. Coachen and concealed his crime. For they are the ones who started the fire in order to destroy the evidence! Counterfeit Bills data updated in my Organizer. After clearing \"What you saw\" Talk option with Dick Gumshoe and examining grandfather clock: Edgeworth: (We've examined everything in this office, but there is one thing that bothers me. Perhaps I should ask Ambassador Palaeno about it.) Ambassador Palaeno, there is something I'd like to ask you about. Palaeno: Yes? Edgeworth: About this office, it appears, to me, to be very similar to Ambassador Alba's office. For example, the location of the fireplace and the position of the grandfather clock. Palaeno: Ah, that's right. You've also paid a visit to the Allebahstian side of the embassy. Our two embassies actually used to be one. Edgeworth: (Yes, I know. Even the pamphlet mentioned that.) Palaeno: Which is why the building is bilaterally symmetrical (Bilateral symmetry - Because this used to be one embassy, offices on the two sides are symmetrical.). So no matter which room, the location of the fireplace and the like are exactly the same. Even where the art is located is the same. As my room is currently under renovation... ...we worked hard to make Manny's room look like the ambassador's office. Kay: You mean for your hand shake photo op with the Jammin' Ninja? Palaeno: Yes, that's right. I mean, what's a photo like that worth if it's not taken in the ambassador's office right? Edgeworth: (Yet another odd expression of Babahl's obsessively competitive spirit with Allebahst, I take it?) Thank you, Ambassador. That piece of information is all I needed to connect the dots. Palaeno: ? ...Connect what dots? Well, anyway, I'm glad I was able to be of some help. Edgeworth: The Allebahstian and Babahlese sides of the building are symmetrical to each other. As we know that to be a fact, then this room's fireplace may also hide a secret passageway. Kay: A secret passageway? Edgeworth: In Allebahst, the fireplace turned out to have a revolving back wall. Kay: A revolving wall!? It sounds like something out of a ninja house! Gumshoe: Wow, there was a trick like that built into the fireplace, sir!? Palaeno: What!? Th-This embassy holds THAT kind of secret!? Edgeworth: There seems to be a lot about this room that you don't know about, Ambassador... Palaeno: I guess it's time to pay the bill for letting Manny do so much work for me. Please, I really want to know about the real Manny and what you know about this room. Kay: What are you waiting for, Mr. Edgeworth!? Let's get to the bottom of this! Edgeworth: Agreed. And my first thought is that it's likely the killer used the revolving fireplace (Revolving fireplace used? - It's possible someone used the revolving fireplace wall. I need to examine it more.). Kay: It looks like just another fireplace, though, doesn't it? So, how do you turn it again? Edgeworth: In Allebahst, I had to push where the X was on the far wall of the fireplace. Gumshoe: Oh! I see an X back there, sir! Let's see what happens when I push it... Edgeworth: Gumshoe: Aaaaah! You scared me, sir! Edgeworth: There is something about this fireplace that lies in contradiction to the facts. Kay: Huh? But we found an X where you thought there'd be one, right? Edgeworth: We did, but that's not what I was referring to. Something is missing from this scene. (What does this contradiction mean for us...?) Leads to examination of fireplace Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, you said that you burned some old files in this fireplace today, correct? Palaeno: Yes, I burned quite a few files this morning, actually. Edgeworth: And after you did, you forgot to clean out the ashes from the fireplace, correct? Palaeno: Th-That's right. But why are you asking? And why are you making such a scary face...? Edgeworth: I'm sorry, I admit I am a bit intimidating when I'm serious. ...In any case! Take a good look at this fireplace, and tell me what you find odd about it. Palaeno: Let's see... Huh? Where did all the ashes go...? (Missing ashes - The ashes that should still be in the fireplace are missing. Where did they go...?) Kay: What is the meaning of this, Mr. Edgeworth!? Gumshoe: You don't really think... that Ambassador Palaeno is lying, do you? Edgeworth: No, there is no reason for him to lie. And I don't believe his testimony is wrong, either. It is the fireplace that is causing the contradiction. Kay, I wonder if you might update the fireplace data for me. Kay: You got it! I'll add in the ashes from the burnt files and... Kay: Sounds like we've pretty much figured everything out now, huh!? Edgeworth: Hmph... Well, it was nothing. All I did was follow where our leads led us. Kay: Oh, I sense it coming on! You're about to dazzle us again, right!? Gumshoe: Oh, you mean that!? Well, it's what Mr. Edgeworth is known for, you know! Edgeworth: ...There is really no need for you two to dance around the name of what I'm about to do. Edgeworth: The reason as to why the ashes are missing is simple. Kay: It's not because someone cleaned them up, right? Edgeworth: No, because even if someone did sweep them up, the fireplace is too clean for that. Ambassador Palaeno said that he spilled some Babahlese ink while he was burning the files. And yet, there is not a trace of the spilled ink on the back wall anywhere! Kay: Well then, I don't know what happened. Edgeworth: Well, I'll tell you what happened. The two sides were switched. By using the revolving fireplace wall, the ashes were moved into the neighboring room. Which means that this is a clear indication that the fireplace was used! Revolving Fireplace Wall data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Then, you mean... the person I was chasing... ...disappeared from this room through there...? Edgeworth: Yes, I believe the person you were in pursuit of is Mr. Coachen's killer. And after committing the murder, escaped through the fireplace (Escaped through revolving fireplace - The person Kay was chasing used the fireplace to escape into the room next door.)! Kay: Wow, Mr. Edgeworth! You figured out the killer's escape route! Edgeworth: (I have, but this is only the beginning. Now we have to chase the killer down!) Edgeworth: If the killer used the fireplace in this room to escape into the next... ...then it's only logical for us to \"talk\" with the person who was in the neighboring room. Gumshoe: Well, the person that was in the next room was... Oh! It was that person, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, Detective... Agent Shih-na. Kay: It's looking more and more like Ms. Shih-na is the killer, isn't it? Edgeworth: Let's not jump to conclusions yet. We need to go through what we know so far. She came running straight into this room from the next one, and instantly accused you. Furthermore, she claimed that it could only have been you that killed Mr. Coachen. I don't have any proof yet, however, I KNOW she is hiding something from us! Kay: OK, then! Why don't we go ask Ms. Shih-na herself!? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: No, not yet. There's something that needs to be done first. ...Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Sir! Is it my turn to do something, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Yes. I have a two-part special assignment for you. First, I need you to run a handwriting analysis on DeMasque II's note. Gumshoe: OK! I'll get the lab boys on that right away! Edgeworth: Second, I want you to see if you can fit through the revolving fireplace wall. Gumshoe: R-Right now, sir!? Edgeworth: No, next decade... Of course now! We need to test our hypothesis first, don't we? Kay: Go on, Gummy! You can do it! Gumshoe: Alright. I'm gonna do this like a real man! Here I go, through the fireplace and back! Edgeworth: (You shouldn't need to psych yourself up that much for such a simple task, Detective...) Gumshoe: Wow! The wall inside the fireplace really DID turn! Kay: That's so neat! Now, I wanna try going through there, too! Palaeno: Th-There really IS a secret passageway through there... I had no idea...! Edgeworth: Hmm... It would appear that the ash really was pushed into the other room. Furthermore, the Babahlese ink you spilled, Ambassador, is there on the back wall. Gumshoe: OK, here I go, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective, I'd like you to go through there under the same conditions as the killer. Gumshoe: Huh? But there's all that ash and stuff... Edgeworth: And your point is? Now, we're short on time, so if you could please hurry on through. Gumshoe: Nngh... Y-Yes, sir... Kay: OK! So NOW we pretty much have the whole picture, right!? Edgeworth: No, not yet. There remains a few more mysteries to solve... ...such as the Yatagarasu's whereabouts, the other smuggling ring members... ...the two weapons that made it across the border, the key Ms. Yew stole 7 years ago... In fact, we haven't figured out a thing regarding how Ms. Yew is related to these embassies! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: A number of pieces connect in a very complicated way in this case... It's almost enough to make one completely mentally exhausted. Kay: What are you saying, Mr. Edgeworth!? I thought you were the one who said that it's easy if you follow the leads? Edgeworth: Hmph... Was that supposed to be an impression of me, Kay? Kay: If it's info gathering you need, Gummy and I can help with that! Then, all you'd have to do is show off your fancy-schmancy logical deductions! Edgeworth: \"Show off\"...? (Does it seem like I'm being boastful when I do that...?) Kay: Let's not over-complicate matters, OK, Mr. Edgeworth!? We've been so focused, like a laser, on only what seems strange and out of place... ...it's no wonder nothing's clicked and we haven't unlocked anything yet. But, if we think things through calmly, the answer should come to us! Edgeworth: Kay... Kay: That's the sort of thing I say to myself... ...when I'm practicing how to unlock padlocks, you know! Edgeworth: ...That is something that I hope practice doesn't make perfect, for your sake. Kay: Ha ha ha! Yay! Looks like you're back to your straight-laced self again! Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm back, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, I can see that. Good work, Detective. Gumshoe: *cough* *cough* *cough* L-Looks like you can use that fireplace like a door, sir! Kay: Are you alright, Gummy...? Gumshoe: I-I'm OK! It's just a bit of ash and dust, that's all! Edgeworth: Your jacket has gotten quite filthy. I see the hem has practically turned black. Gumshoe: Yeah, well, quite a bit of the unburned ink got on it, sir. Edgeworth: Hmm... I see. Thank you, Detective. You did a fine job. I'll even pay the cleaning bill for the trench coat. Gumshoe: What!? Oh, no, sir! I could never! This is just my old coat, sir! If it was [sic] a coat I actually cared about, then I'd get it cleaned, but, you know... Edgeworth: ...? I see. Very well, then. As you wish. Kay: So because Gummy was able to climb through the fireplace, we know it can be used, right? Edgeworth: Yes, but that's not all we learned. We actually learned one other important fact. Kay: And that is...? Edgeworth: I will have to explain it to you later. Right now, we need to deal with the handwriting analysis. Detective Gumshoe... Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I'll be back before you know it! Edgeworth: The handwriting analysis on Mr. Coachen's handwriting will take a bit of time. Let us go and wait in the Theatrum Neutralis, along with Agent Lang and Agent Shih-na! To be continued Edgeworth: Agent Lang... Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Little cubs, never do they know the real fury of the Elder wolves.\" Edgeworth: (These quotes are definitely becoming increasingly difficult to decipher...) And what does that mean? Lang: It means that you'll never really know how angry I can get. Mr. Prosecutor... The counterfeit bills made with Babahlese ink... they were all of Zheng Fa denominations. Edgeworth: Yes, so I heard from Ms. von Karma. Franziska: But we don't know where the play money has gone. Edgeworth: (They must not have figured out that it was all burned yet...) Lang: Ever since those things showed up in circulation, my country's economy has taken a big hit. Zheng Fa is in financial chaos as we speak... ...because we can't tell the difference between our own bills and the fakes! But it's not just the money; the citizens are also worried. I've staked the honor of the house of Lang on this... ...and have come to this land to capture the mastermind behind this whole mess. I investigated how the bills were made and how the ink was smuggled into Zheng Fa... ...and I pursued the smuggling ring all the way here. But tonight... this is where the final chapter was written. Despite my frantic efforts to chase the smuggler down, someone got to him first... ...and now I'm called to return home without a single answer! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, I... Lang: Don't start. It's not your fault. It's not anyone's fault, Mr. Prosecutor. Ambassador Alba, I'm sorry for all the trouble tonight. Alba: Oh, no, no. It is I who should apologize. It was all because I was not strong enough. If only I was able to think of a better solution... Quercus, you fool! Curse your empty brain! Lang: Heh, you're being too hard on yourself, Ambassador. I take full responsibility for tonight, end of story. Shih-na, let's go. Time to return to our den. Shih-na: .........Yes. Franziska: I don't like to admit it, but there's not much else for us to do but to go home as well. Edgeworth: Agent Lang! A moment, if you ???: Gumshoe: You, Wolf-man and the secretary lady! Hold it! Objection! Pal! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe...! Have you got the results of the handwriting analysis already? Gumshoe: Yup, and that note... was definitely written by Mr. Coachen, sir! Edgeworth: Hmm, just as I thought... Good work, Detective. DeMasque II's Note data updated in my Organizer. Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... How long do you intend to hold us up for? Edgeworth: Hmph... Sorry to have made you wait, but I believe that now everyone is finally here. Agent Shih-na. I'd like to ask you something, if you don't mind. Shih-na: .........Yes? Edgeworth: How exactly did you fail to see the Yatagarasu... ...when you were in the neighboring room to where Mr. Coachen was killed!? I'd like you to explain THAT to us. Lang: What...? Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! What are you doing asking her about something she didn't see? Edgeworth: (Agent Lang hasn't touched the Babahl investigation at all. So I suppose I will need to explain a few things to him first.) Franziska: Miles Edgeworth... I can't even begin to imagine what's going on in that head of yours. Edgeworth: The only thing going on in my head... is the pursuit of the truth! Franziska: Oh? It sounds like you have some sort of plan. Very well, I'll supervise you until the end. Edgeworth: (*sigh* Is she seriously going to treat me as a subordinate for the rest of the day...?) Lang: You're not trying to pick a fight with my subordinate on some flimsy guess, are you? Edgeworth: I'm not trying to \"pick a fight\" and the evidence is hardly flimsy, as you will see. Lang: Hah! I should've known... ...that you and I are destined to fight it out to the very end! Edgeworth: It would appear that way. Lang: Well, I'll prove her innocence, so let's see what you've got, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hmph... With pleasure. (For my opening argument, I'll discuss the Yatagarasu that appeared in Babahl... ...and establish exactly who it was that Kay saw.) Agent Lang. I assume you've been briefed on Kay's testimony? Lang: You mean the \"suspicious person in a coat\" that she saw? Edgeworth: That's right. That person is one of the keys to solving this case. The person who pretended to be the Yatagarasu! Lang: \"Pretended\"? And what do you mean by that!? Edgeworth: I'll get to that in a second. But first, I want to review what Kay's mystery person did (changed from [second, but first, I want to review what this person Kay saw did] in the original release). Kay, if you could please explain for us what the person you were chasing did (changed from [what the person you were chasing did for us] in the original release)... Kay: OK! You got it! I first spotted the suspicious person near the open-air stage on the Babahlese side. I called out to the person, but as soon as I did, that person ran off. I thought it was rather suspicious, so I immediately gave chase. Edgeworth: For the sake of argument, let's call this suspicious person the Yatagarasu. Now, please tell us what happened when you chased the Yatagarasu up to the 3rd floor. Kay: Can do! I chased the Yatagarasu all the way up to the third floor of the Babahlese Embassy. It was a pretty straight chase down the hallway, until the sudden turn. The Yatagarasu disappeared around the corner, so I did my best to catch up. When I turned the corner, I saw the Yatagarasu run into Mr. Coachen's office. I gave chase and ran into the room... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the light, but then... Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Shih-na: ...Who's there!? Kay: By the time I had turned on the lights, the Yatagarasu had disappeared. Edgeworth: When Kay entered the room, the person she was chasing was already gone. Why do you suppose that was, Agent Lang? Lang: ...What do you mean, \"Why do you suppose?\" Isn't it obvious!? The person slipped out through the door behind the girl under the cover of darkness. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Sorry, but I know for a fact that the person didn't escape through that door! Lang: Oh? And how do you know that with such certainly!? Edgeworth: Hmph... That's easy. If the Yatagarasu had left through that door, they would have run right into this person! Lang: Y-Your answer is Shih-na...? Edgeworth: Yes, because let's consider what would've happened if the Yatagarasu had used the door. When Kay screamed upon discovering Mr. Coachen's body... ...the Yatagarasu would've run right into Agent Shih-na, who was in the next room over. Lang: ...Arngh! Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na. Would you mind telling us if you saw the suspicious person in question? Shih-na: .........No, I didn't see anyone. Edgeworth: You see? Therefore, the Yatagarasu could not have escaped through the door as Lang: Lang: It just means that the creep slipped out before Shih-na made it out into the hallway! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. I doubt that, as there was another person in that hallway. A certain detective. Detective Gumshoe, where were you exactly at that time? Gumshoe: M-Me, sir? Well, when I heard Kay's scream... ...I ran towards Mr. Coachen's office from the opposite direction of Agent Shih-na, sir! Edgeworth: So, Agent Lang, can YOU explain how someone could've eluded both of them!? Even you must concede that under these circumstances, the door was not a viable route! Lang: Grr...rrrnoooooooooh! Kay: Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! You nailed him with just an explanation of what happened! Edgeworth: Yes... I've eliminated one of the possible escape routes from that room. (But this is far from over. I need to make Agent Lang aware as well... ...of yet another possible escape route the Yatagarasu could've taken.) Lang: .........! Ha ha ha ha! I get it! So that's what you were trying to show me. Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... Let me guess. This is what you're trying to say, right? Because the door was not a viable escape route, then there must've been another way out! Edgeworth: Precisely. Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! It's time to bust out with our revolving fireplace wall explanation, right!? Edgeworth: No, not quite yet. Kay: Huh!? But why? I thought this would be the perfect time... Edgeworth: The revolving wall on the Babahlese side is known only to four people. And if we use this information unwisely, the truth may escape us in the end. Lang: What's with all the whispering over there? Scared I'll figure out your tactics? Edgeworth: Hmph, nothing of the sort, Agent Lang. Come, let's continue where we left off. Lang: That smug, haughty attitude of yours... You really rub me the wrong way, you know that!? ...Hmph. Well, no matter. I've figured you out already anyway. The only other possible escape route besides the door... is the room's lone window! And since an eerie picture of said escape route exists... Are you saying that this photo captures the moment of the Yatagarasu's escape!? Edgeworth: (I guess Detective Badd must have filled him in on this photo... I have to admit that at first, I thought the window to be a possible escape route as well. However, I now know that to be impossible!) Lang: Now, I realize you may not know this, but... ...humans can't fly. Edgeworth: Of course I know that! That's bloody common sense! Besides, I never said I thought that photo to be of the Yatagarasu's escape route. Lang: ...I suppose not. Alright then, explain yourself. Edgeworth: The shadow in this photo is not the Yatagarasu that Kay was chasing after. Lang: Lang: You can say whatever you'd like in whatever language you want... ...but there's only one language I really understand: the language of evidence! Edgeworth: Very well, then. I present to you, proof that the person Kay saw is not the same as the one in this photo! Edgeworth: Let me explain to you precisely why the shadow in this photo is not the Yatagarasu Kay saw. Kay spotted the Yatagarasu heading for the third floor during the second fire. However, the photo in question was taken just after the first fire! Lang: Grr...rrrnoooooooooooh! Kay: Yeah! Way to go! That's TWICE you've bit him in the butt now! Lang: Lang: We're not done yet! You still have to explain what that shadow is... ...and how the Yatagarasu escaped! I don't suppose you can answer both, can you!? Edgeworth: Regarding the photo, I admit that we don't understand what it means quite yet. Lang: Hah! As I thought. Edgeworth: However, the Yatagarasu's escape route? Now, THAT I can answer. Lang: You can? Well, then, Mr. Prosecutor, go on! Enlighten me! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Even if I explain it, you'll try to find some flaw with what I have to say. You were busy heading up the Allebahstian investigation, correct? In that case, I doubt you'd have much knowledge about the Babahlese side of the case... ...so wouldn't it be best if the lead on that side, Agent Shih-na, explained in my stead? Lang: .........Argh! Shih-na is my subordinate...! If I don't stick up for her, how can I look her in the eyes and call myself her boss...!? Shih-na: .........Lang, it's alright. I can take care of him. Lang: Shih-na. Shih-na: You've shielded me a lot as my boss... ...but it's time for me to prove my worth. Lang: ...Alright. If you're OK with it, then you have my support. Edgeworth: (Finally, it's down to just Agent Shih-na and myself. This is where the battle really begins!) Shih-na: Now then, what is it you'd like to ask? Edgeworth: Hmm, let's see... Why don't we start with your movements inside the Babahlese Embassy? Shih-na: During the first Babahlese fire, I assisted in putting out the fire. During the second fire, I was searching for the Yatagarasu that had appeared in Babahl. While I was searching, I heard a scream coming from the next room over. Although I was in the next room, I was unable to catch a glimpse of the Yatagarasu. To be honest, I'm actually very skeptical that the girl's \"Yatagarasu\" even exists. Shih-na: And that is all I have to say. Kay: But I'm not lying when I say I saw the suspicious person run into Mr. Coachen's office! Like I said earlier... ...I have no intention of retracting my testimony. Shih-na: .........Good. Edgeworth: Just to confirm, did you have a partner when you were on your investigation? Shih-na: No, I moved alone. Edgeworth: In that case, you have no one to corroborate your alibi. Is that correct? Lang: Lang: Are you calling her suspicious because she was in a room by herself!? How pathetic! Edgeworth: ...And it wasn't when Agent Shih-na tried to arrest Kay under the same rationale? Lang: ............! Edgeworth: And how about when you accused Larry because he was the weapon's owner? Lang: ............Grr! Franziska: Not that it's unexpected for that useless lump to get into such a situation. Although, I suppose it's never a good idea to let mistakes go uncorrected. Lang: I will make no excuse for what I did in that situation. Gumshoe: Then you should apologize right now for making Kay out to be the killer, pal! Lang: .........I'm sorry. Shih-na, apologize. Shih-na: ............... .........I'm sorry. Kay: I-It's really OK! I mean, I'm not under suspicion anymore! Right, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Hmph. Well, I never doubted you. Not for one second. Lang: .........And the same goes for me. I believe in Shih-na. Edgeworth: Then let's put that to the test, and see if she is really worthy of your trust. Shih-na: Heh heh... This promises to be interesting. Shih-na: During the first Babahlese fire, I assisted in putting out the fire. Shih-na: During the second fire, I was searching for the Yatagarasu that had appeared in Babahl. Shih-na: While I was searching, I heard a scream coming from the next room over. Shih-na: Although I was in the next room, I was unable to catch a glimpse of the Yatagarasu. Shih-na: To be honest, I'm actually very skeptical that the girl's \"Yatagarasu\" even exists. Edgeworth: Hmph... There seems to be a very large flaw in her testimony. Kay: Oh? Then why don't you show her using what we found out with Little Thief? Edgeworth: Heh... I will, in due time. (The escape route of the Yatagarasu that Kay was in pursuit of... If it turns out that it really does lead right to Agent Shih-na... ...then what is it that she is keeping from us right now?) Edgeworth: Being in the room next to Mr. Coachen's office is the problem with your testimony. Shih-na: .........! Lang: Lang: Mr. Prosecutor... I don't see what problem you're talking about at all! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, do you recall the secret we discovered about the Allebahstian office fireplace? Lang: Huh? Oh, you mean how it connects the office with the room next door? What about it? Edgeworth: Well... Allebahst isn't the only country with secret connecting fireplaces. Lang: Wha--!? Edgeworth: The fireplace in Mr. Coachen's office holds the exact same secret! Lang: Wh...Whaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu didn't escape through the door to the room or the window. The escape route was through the revolving fireplace wall and into the next room over! Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: Now do you see? If the Yatagarasu had escaped into the next room... ...then the thief would've run straight into Agent Shih-na! Meaning that it's impossible for her to have missed the Yatagarasu! Lang: A.........Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaa! Franziska: Wh-What is the meaning of this, Miles!? Edgeworth: Well? Would you care to explain, Agent Shih-na... ...how you managed to completely miss the fleeing Yatagarasu, or shall I? Shih-na: ............ Edgeworth: Your claim that you were in the next room was a lie all along, wasn't it? The truth is, you were the one Kay saw in the coat... ...pretending to be the Yatagarasu, and you were the one she chased after. As you tried to lose her, you ran into Mr. Coachen's office, and headed for the fireplace. Then, you shed your coat in the next room, leaving it there to emerge as \"Agent Shih-na\". After that, you came back around to place Kay under arrest. Does that sound about right? If not, then speak now or forever hold your peace. Shih-na: ............ Gumshoe: How dare you make Kay look like the bad guy when you're the suspicious one, pal!? Shih-na: .........Phwwh... Phwwwwh... Edgeworth: .........! Lang: ...Shih-na...? Shih-na: Hee... hee hee hee......... ...Hee hee hee hee hee... hee hee......... Aha! Ahaha! Ahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Edgeworth: ! (That... That laugh...!) Franziska: I remember this irritating laugh... Gumshoe: Brr... I'm getting chills down my spine...! Kay: .........It can't be... But it has to be...! Lang: Shih-na... What's wrong with you...? Shih-na: Phwwh... I'm sorry. It was so funny that I couldn't help but laugh. Edgeworth: ...\"Funny\", you say? Shih-na: Yes, that you would accuse me of being the Yatagarasu. ...The prosecutors of this country really are all so very strange. Franziska: Do you think you can get away with this by simply laughing it off!? Shih-na: Phwwh... You think I'M taking things too lightly? I think not. It's that prosecutor who is. Edgeworth: .........! Shih-na: Look, everything you said earlier is nothing more than mere speculation. The Yatagarasu fled through the fireplace? Do you have any proof to back up your claim? If you don't, then you haven't proven a thing regarding the Yatagarasu's escape route! Edgeworth: The tone of voice you're taking with me now has certainly changed. Shih-na: Heh heh... That's because it's been a while since I've had this much fun. I think I'll let loose, and then we can have a real battle of wits. Edgeworth: For an agent of Interpol to show me the true power of her mind, it is a great honor. Shih-na: Phwwwh... Don't underestimate me; I'm not some foolish broad, you know. Edgeworth: I know. And that is why I won't hold anything back either as I answer your question. Shih-na: My question...? Edgeworth: Here is your proof that the revolving fireplace wall in Babahl was used recently! Shih-na: I'm sorry, but is this really your honest answer to my question? Edgeworth: Yes. According to Ambassador Palaeno's testimony... ...he said that he was burning some documents in the fireplace with Mr. Coachen. Shih-na: ...Oh? Edgeworth: The ashes of what they burned were left in the fireplace, so they should've been there. However, when we went to investigate the room, the ashes weren't there. Shih-na: Shih-na: Why is that a problem? Maybe someone cleaned them up? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph......... Unfortunately for you, Ambassador Palaeno said that he forgot to. And so the question remains: Why were the ashes missing? ...The answer is simple. When the Yatagarasu went through the fireplace wall... ...the ashes were pushed into the next room by the wall as well! The movement of the ashes that were in Mr. Coachen's office is my proof! Shih-na: Ahah! Ahaha! Ahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Edgeworth: .........And just what is so funny!? Shih-na: Ash as proof...? Are you even allowed to submit such flakey evidence in court? Franziska: You... still wish to fight us? Shih-na: Of course. Why wouldn't I? Edgeworth: In that case, let's hear your counterargument. Shih-na: Phwwwh... My counterargument, huh? This really is just like being in court. Edgeworth: Well, to me, we're simply continuing from where we left off all those years ago. Shih-na: ...Phwwwh. I have no idea what you're talking about. Edgeworth: It doesn't matter if we're at a crime scene or in court, let's finish this here and now! Shih-na: I suppose. I've had a lot of fun today, but I grow weary of this game of cat and mouse. Edgeworth: ...! Shih-na: Let's make this the last testimony, and wrap up this absurd case once and for all! Shih-na: In my eyes, all you've proved is that the rotating fireplace wall was used... ...but you can't really call that proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace, now can you? So then, who was it that used the rotating wall? Show me your answer with real evidence. Remember, we've already finished our very thorough investigation... ...and we found not a single suspicious thing in Mr. Coachen's office. Shih-na: Phwwwh... And there you have it, my counterargument. Edgeworth: ...Arngh! (That's very... impressive. She has seen through to the fact that I have yet to gather that one piece of evidence...) Kay: ............ Gumshoe: What is it, Kay? I haven't heard a peep out of you in quite a while now. Franziska If you don't think you can handle it, feel free to leave the rest of it to us. Kay: But I...! Edgeworth: Kay... Pull yourself together. You are the true heir to the Yatagarasu name, are you not? Kay: ...! Edgeworth: If you want to steal the truth, then you must never take your eyes off of it. This chase you're running to catch the truth... you must see it through to the very end. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... You're right. I... I will see this through to the end. So...... You go get her for me, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hmph... With pleasure. Shih-na: Looks like a lack of evidence has left you wide open, doesn't it? Lang: ...Shih-na. Please... show me you're someone I can trust. Shih-na: ......... Don't worry. This will be the deciding match. You'll see. Edgeworth: (I'm truly sorry, Agent Lang, but I simply can't allow her to escape me again.) Very well then, Agent Shih-na. Shall we begin? Shih-na: Phwwh... I'm ready whenever you are. Shih-na: In my eyes, all you've proved is that the rotating fireplace wall was used... Shih-na: ...but you can't really call that proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace, now can you? Shih-na: So then, who was it that used the rotating wall? Show me your answer with real evidence. Shih-na: Remember, we've already finished our very thorough investigation... Shih-na: ...and we found not a single suspicious thing in Mr. Coachen's office. Kay: So... do you actually have any proof that the Yatagarasu used the fireplace passageway? Edgeworth: No, I haven't found any yet. Kay: Then what are we going to do!? Edgeworth: Hmph. There's no need to worry. Because there is a loophole in Ms. Interpol Agent's argument we can exploit first. (The one in charge of the Babahlese investigation was not Agent Lang. Which means that with Agent Shih-na in charge... ...it's possible she may have tampered with the evidence. That piece of evidence that we found... If there is one thing I DO know, it is that someone tried to hide it from us!) Edgeworth: And that this throws doubt on the purity of your investigation into the Yatagarasu! Shih-na: ...! You still suspect me, I see. Alright then, I ask that you point out what part of my investigation is incomplete. Edgeworth: (The other Interpol agents worked under the command of Agent Shih-na. And is it not possible that the reason the person Kay was chasing chose the third floor... ...was because that person knew there would be no other agents on that floor? Furthermore, we've come to see that Agent Shih-na... ...was only pretending to be investigating the Yatagarasu, to the point of arresting Kay. In that case, there is one location that no one has yet to inspect!) Your team's investigation was incomplete because they failed to inspect this location! Edgeworth: The location, Agent Shih-na, is of course, the room you claimed to have examined. I believe the room next to Mr. Coachen's office warrants a thorough inspection. Shih-na: Even if you do that, I doubt you'll find anything of use to you there. Edgeworth: Hmph. I will be the one to decide that! Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I'm on it! I'll be right back after I check out that room next to the office! Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth... Do you really think that Ms. Shih-na's the Yatagarasu? Edgeworth: ...Yes, if my logic is sound, I believe she is. Kay: Then, I'm not going to let her get away with ruining the name of the Yatagarasu! Franziska: But can you prove she's the Yatagarasu is the question. Edgeworth: If Detective Gumshoe can find what I'm hoping he will find, then I should be able to. Franziska: And just what are you hoping he'll find? Edgeworth: Let's just say this. I had Detective Gumshoe do a little experiment for me earlier. Franziska: An experiment? As if that detective has the brains for high science. Edgeworth: It wasn't that mentally taxing. I had him use the same escape route as the Yatagarasu. Franziska: And what did you find out by doing that? Edgeworth: First, that it's possible for a person to fit through the revolving wall \"door\". Second, that by going through there, his coat was covered in ash and Babahlese ink. Franziska: Who cares what his coat was covered in? It's not worth that much anyway! Edgeworth: Ah, but is it really worth so little? I believe that it's actually quite a meaningful result, the value of which I'm about to prove. Franziska: ...? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! I've found some things you really need to see, sir! Edgeworth: Oh? So what are these things that you found? Gumshoe: Ummm... Some make-up, a coat, and a pair of shoes, sir. Kay: You found a coat!? You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Maybe it's the one the person I was chasing was wearing! Edgeworth: Yes, the possibility does exist. Agent Shih-na. Were these pieces of evidence not in that room when you examined it? Shih-na: Phwwwh... Unfortunately for you, those aren't \"suspicious items\" of any sort. They all belong to me. They were getting in the way, so I stored them in that room. Gumshoe: Aww...! Shih-na: Thank you for bringing them to me. It saves me a trip. May I have them back now? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: These items that the detective brought back are incredibly significant. I request that we be allowed to examine them. Shih-na: Shih-na: They're my personal belongings, so you have no right to touch them without my permission. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I wish to examine them for the sake of the investigation. But if you wish to deny us access to them... Agent Lang, let's hear your opinion on this. Lang: I say, let them look at your stuff, Shih-na. Shih-na: Lang! Lang: Shih-na, let's put it all out in the open. If you're really innocent, then you have nothing to worry about, right? Shih-na: .........I guess so, Alright, go ahead and examine whatever you'd like. After all, I have nothing to hide. Edgeworth: Hmph... Good. Now let us begin. Gumshoe: So which of Agent Shih-na's belongings are you going to examine, sir? Edgeworth: Let's examine the coat. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: It appears you managed to stain your coat rather badly... ...Agent Shih-na. Shih-na: ............ Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu that Kay saw was wearing a coat. And I'm beginning to wonder if this stain wasn't created when you went through the fireplace. Shih-na: Ahah... No, you have it wrong. That soot probably got on my coat when I was helping the police put out the fire. Edgeworth: And what about this dark substance around the hem of your coat? Shih-na: Oh! I didn't realize that the hem was that dirty. I'm sure it's just some water mixed with soot from when I was helping with the fire. Kay: I don't think so! You think you can get away with such a transparent lie!? Gumshoe: Yeah! Don't lie to us, pal! This is the same pattern of dirt that got on my coat when I went through the fireplace! Shih-na: Shih-na: Your words ring hollow in the absence of evidence, you know. So unless you can prove that the dirt on my coat is from the fireplace... Edgeworth: Which I can. Shih-na: Wh...!? How...!? Edgeworth: You did a great job, Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Huh? M-Me, sir? What did I do? Edgeworth: This coat... This is exactly the piece of evidence I was searching for. I had been hoping to find the coat that the person Kay saw was wearing. And thanks to you, we proved that going through the fireplace would sully a coat. Gumshoe: I don't quite get what you're saying, but I'm happy for the praise, sir! Edgeworth: All that remains... ...is for us to show what the dark substance on the coat hem is. Shih-na: Oh? And you think you can do that? Edgeworth: Of course I can. This is the dark substance that sullied the hem of this coat! Shih-na: B-Babahlese ink? Edgeworth: Yes. This is what will prove that the coat went through that fireplace! According to Ambassador Palaeno, he burned some files in the fireplace this morning. Shih-na: You told us about that already, so I don't really see the point in mentioning it again. Edgeworth: My point is that he spilled some ink onto the back wall of the fireplace at that time. Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: If the dark substance on this coat turns out to be Babahlese ink... ...it would prove that you and this coat went through the revolving fireplace wall! Shih-na: ...Ack! Edgeworth: (Sorry to have clipped one of your wings, \"Yatagarasu\", but we're not finished yet.) Shih-na: But you have no way of proving whether or not this is Babahlese ink on the coat hem! Edgeworth: Oh, but I do. And I intend to show that it IS ink in a few seconds. Shih-na: How...!? Edgeworth: How, you ask? Well, since you don't seem to know, allow me to show you. This is how I will prove that the dark substance on the coat is Babahlese ink! Edgeworth: We can find out whether that is Babahlese ink or not by lighting it on fire. Lang: That's how you're going to prove that it's Babahlese ink? Edgeworth: Yes. If you could please cut a section of the dark, stained area for me, I'd appreciate it. Because I will show you, here and now, what the dark substance is! Lang: Shih-na... Sorry to do this, but I'm going to have to cut off a bit of your coat. Shih-na: Go ahead. I wasn't planning to wear it anymore anyway. Edgeworth: Now then, if someone could loan me a lighter or something... Kay: Oh! I've got some matches! I always carry them with me so I can light smoke bombs! Edgeworth: Then, if I could please have one, Kay, we can get this experiment underway. Franziska: The flame...! Lang: It's the same color as the flames whitcrystal oil produces... Which means...! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink is a product of whitcrystal oil. And when lit, the ink produces a green flame. Shih-na: ......... Edgeworth: (Hmph. I believe the time has come to clip the Yatagarasu's other wing.) Kay: Ms. Shih-na... You're the fake Yatagarasu...! The one who killed my father! Shih-na: ......... Edgeworth: It's about time you came clean, Agent Shih-na. Or should I say... ...Calisto Yew!? Lang: Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor... You're not serious, are you? Edgeworth: Do I look like the joking type to you? Shih-na: ...Ahah. Phwwwh... \"Calisto Yew\"? I've never heard that name before in my life. Franziska: That manner of speaking, and that attitude...! You haven't changed a bit in seven years! Gumshoe: You're the defense attorney that killed Mr. Faraday, and then tried to frame me for it! Shih-na: Oh really, and you have proof? You insist that I am this \"Calisto Yew\" woman, but you can't prove it! If you have no proof, then I'm afraid you won't be able to lay a single finger on me. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The raven is a very unique bird, one that flies by the darkness of night. However! The light of dawn has arrived, and it will reveal your true, ugly form to the world! Shih-na: Shih-na: Enough poetry! I want to see some evidence! Franziska: Do you really have something that can prove that she is Calisto Yew? Edgeworth: I do. It's something that the 2nd Yatagarasu has preserved for us these last seven years! Kay: Do me the honor, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: I will, Kay. For we have finally come to the end. We'll prove her to be Calisto Yew with this, and clip this Yatagarasu's wings for good! Edgeworth: This perfume... This will prove you to be Calisto Yew. Shih-na: It will...!? Edgeworth: Kay has preserved it perfectly for us. Surely you remember this bottle? This belonged to Ms. Yew just before she disappeared seven years ago. Naturally, this means that a few of her fingerprints are on here as well. Kay: This is that bottle of perfume you spilled, which I have preserved ever since. Shih-na: ...! Kay: I heard from my father, Byrne Faraday... ...that if stored under the right conditions, a fingerprint can be preserved for decades. Which means that your fingerprints are still on here. Every last one. Shih-na: ......... Edgeworth: We can clear everything up if we were to compare the prints on this to your own! Now come, Agent Shih-na! Will you submit yourself to a fingerprint test!? Shih-na: ...Ahah. Edgeworth: ! Shih-na: Hee... hee hee hee... Ahah. Ahah! Ahah! Ahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! ???: It looks like... you've seen right through me yet again... Ahah... You're sending the biggest chill down my spine, Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Calisto... Yew...! Franziska: So you've shown your true face at last. Yew: This feeling of thrill... it's even greater than that time, seven years ago. Lang: Shih-na! You're...! Yew: Lang, I really enjoyed our days together. You're an insanely strong, nice, kind-hearted... idiot of a man. Lang: So, you were a spy all along? A mole sent by the smuggling ring I've been chasing after... Someone who has been feeding them intel on Interpol all this time!? Yew: Ahah! Very good! Maybe you're not as big of an idiot as I thought! Kay: Calisto Yew... The woman who killed my father seven years ago...! You're her, aren't you!? The fake Yatagarasu! Yew: That's right. Calisto Yew... That's just one of my many names. But even that is just a fa\u00e7ade. .........Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I am... the Great Thief Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: Calisto Yew, this time you won't escape, for this is the end of the road for you. Now come along quietly! Yew: You know, you're the one who left the strongest impression on me... Kay Faraday. And had you not used the Yatagarasu's gadgets, I might've never known who you were. But here you are, being a thorn in my side... just like your father always was. Kay: ...! Edgeworth: Kay! Don't! Kay: Yew! I'll never forgive you for what you did to my father! Yew: Phwwwh... You really are just like him. Mr. Faraday, too, possessed such laughable honesty! Edgeworth: Kay! Gumshoe: Aaaaaaah! You let Kay go right now, pal! Franziska: You despicable...! Kay: Let go of me! You filthy... Arngh! Yew: You think I'm a fake, don't you? Well, unfortunately for you, I'm the real Yatagarasu. Kay: But that's impossible! My father was the one who created Little Thief! Yew: Ahaha! Hey, Edgeworth. The Yatagarasu has three legs. Do you know why that is? Edgeworth: Why it has three legs...? Badd: There are three main reasons why the Yatagarasu will always be one step ahead! First! The Yatagarasu always knows the exact location of the target object. Second! The Yatagarasu always knows exactly how to disarm the security system. Edgeworth: No, it can't be! Yew: Did you finally figure it out? Do you finally know the real identity of the Yatagarasu!? Edgeworth: The real identity of the Yatagarasu is... Edgeworth: The real identity of the Yatagarasu is neither Byrne Faraday nor Calisto Yew. But by the same token, they are also both the real Yatagarasu. Yew: Ha ha! How very perceptive of you! Kay: N-No way! Edgeworth: The single person known as the Great Thief Yatagarasu never existed. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I... No! I refuse to believe this! Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu is known to have three special skills. Skill number one. The Yatagarasu always knows the exact location of the target object. And a lawyer would have the opportunity to learn the layout of client corporations. Skill number two. The Yatagarasu always knows exactly how to disarm the security system. And a good prosecutor would be well-versed in the ways of a criminal. ???: And skill number three... The Yatagarasu doesn't leave a single shred of evidence behind... ever... Edgeworth: D-Detective Badd! Badd: ...It was only natural for the Yatagarasu to never leave evidence behind. Because the lead detective on the case... hid it all away... Edgeworth: Y-You're the third member of the Yatagarasu!? Badd: ...Yew. ...I've been looking for you for a long time. Seven long years, but I've finally got you... Yew: Ahah! Why, Mr. Badd! Long time no see. What happened to us? We used to be such a great team. Kay: If you were such a great team, then why did you kill my father seven years ago!? Yew: Ha ha ha. Why indeed? It was nothing personal, really. He was just another person I had to kill. Kay: ...! How can you say that...!? Yew: I grow weary of this, and it's about time for everything to come to an end. And this time, I won't miss. Edgeworth: Stop! Badd: Yeeeeeeeeew! Edgeworth: Kay! Lang: It's over, Shih-na. Kay: Y...! Your leg...! Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Yew: Grrrnk! Badd: You idiot...! What were you thinking, jumping in front of my gun like that...!? What are you risking your life for!? Lang: I'm sorry, Detective Badd, but no matter what sort of past she may have had... ...or even if she is a spy, it doesn't change the fact that she is my subordinate. And as long as she is, I can't allow any harm to come to her, not even from you! Yew: You really are... an idiot, you know that...? Lang: Hah! That's fine with me. You should know by now that this is just how I am. Hey, sis... Franziska: Yes...? Lang: I want you to conduct a full body search. Shih-na might have another weapon on her. Franziska: Alright. Detective Gumshoe, your assistance, please. Gumshoe: Sir! Gumshoe: Hey, I found something! What is this, sir? It looks like the blade of a knife, but it doesn't have a handle. Edgeworth: This is a great find, Detective. Gumshoe: Huh? It is, sir? Edgeworth: Let's try pairing up this blade with this handle. Edgeworth: I believe this blade actually belongs with the handle that was on the murder weapon. Gumshoe: Hey, they fit together perfectly! Edgeworth: This blade must've been taken from the crime scene when the knife handles were switched. Gumshoe: I'm going to go return this Babahlese knife now! Edgeworth: Alright. I trust that you'll make sure that it is returned to Ambassador Palaeno. Babahlese Knife Handle given to Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: I believe this makes it perfectly clear who did it, Calisto Yew! For the only time the handles could've been switched is just after Mr. Coachen's murder. Yew: Ahah...! Edgeworth: Which means that you must be Mr. Coachen's killer! You killed Mr. Coachen with the Allebahstian knife... ...switched the handles, and then took the original blade of the Babahlese knife with you. Later, you allowed yourself to be spotted by Kay near the open-air stage. You used the fireplace to lose her, and then you went back to accuse her of the murder. Does that about sum it up? Yew: Yew: Ahah... You craft an engaging tale, Edgeworth, but there are two problems with it. Edgeworth: Problems? In what respect? Yew: What do you think my real reason was in allowing her to chase after me? Edgeworth: .........? Yew: Phwwh... It was all so I could capture Kay Faraday. Kay: What!? Yew: When I saw you using that device at Gatewater Land, I knew right away... ...that you were Byrne Faraday's daughter. Ahah! I became curious, so I researched a little into your background. That's how I found out that you were on the trail of the Yatagarasu. Kay: So that's why you tried to pin Mr. Coachen's murder on me? Yew: Yes... I knew you would show up at this embassy tonight. So I thought to use you. But pinning the murder on you wasn't my only goal. Kay: You had another? Yew: Heh heh, yes. Once I had you under arrest, I had planned to search you... ...and take back the device that rightfully belongs to me, the true Yatagarasu. Kay: You were going to take Little Thief away from me!? Yew: Seven years ago, it was thanks to that device that Faraday was able to infiltrate this place. But he stole more than he should've. I had a tough time recovering that precious key. Edgeworth: Then, the person who stole the Yatagarasu's Key was Mr. Faraday...!? Badd: Yew... That incident seven years ago... What was the catalyst behind it? Yew: In the eyes of the smuggling ring, the Yatagarasu was becoming a bit of a problem. ...It wasn't an especially pleasant assignment. Kay: ......... Edgeworth: Then why!? Why did you become a member of the Yatagarasu!? Yew: Why? There is no \"why\". I was destined to betray everyone from the very beginning. Edgeworth: From the beginning? What is that supposed to mean? Yew: The person I take orders from hasn't changed... Even now, to this day. Edgeworth: ! (Does this mean that the leader of the smuggling ring wasn't Mr. Coachen? Then... the real ringleader is still out there pulling the strings!) Lang: Are you done asking what you need to know? Because if so, we should probably get going. And you're going to tell me everything you did tonight. Do you understand, Shih-na? Yew: I guess I should tell you, then, that I was the one who set the Babahlese Embassy on fire. Edgeworth: And why did you do that? Yew: Ahah... I suppose it was to destroy all evidence of the counterfeit bills. Lang: That was what the smuggling ring was trying to do...? But then, why start two fires!? Yew: Sorry, but I can't tell you anything about the ring. It's your job to complete your investigation, after all. I've had my fun. Now, it's your turn to enjoy the ride. Kay: ...Wait! Ye... I mean, Ms. Shih-na. Yew: Yes? Kay: When I fell to the floor earlier, these fell at my feet. Yew: What about them...? Kay: They're such pretty hair sticks that I thought... well, that I should return them to you. Yew: Ha ha... You can have them. They're of no use to me anymore. If you don't want them, you can always just throw them away. Kay: .........No, I want to keep them. Yew: Ahah... Suit yourself. .........Oh, that's right. I almost forgot, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hm...? Yew: About the second problem I had with your story... I didn't kill anyone tonight. Edgeworth: What...? Yew: I'm not saying that as a sore loser. Think of it as a hint, if you will. Lang: Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: Yes, Agent Lang? Lang: Mark my words, I'm not done here, and I'll be back! And it's got nothing to do with duty or anything, because this has become my personal case. I may have been shot... ...but I'll show you just how dangerous a wounded wolf can be! Edgeworth: (His anger appears to have negated the sensation of pain in his injured leg...) It's finally over, Kay. Kay: I feel like I've peered into her heart a little, you know? And it's so cold, and dark... and incredibly lonely. The person who was giving her all these commands... ...the one who thought my father was a problem to be removed... Edgeworth: That person is the real ringleader behind the smuggling ring! Kay: Um, Mr. Edgeworth, I have a favor to ask. Can you... hold onto these hair sticks for me? They're really pretty, just like the ones they were selling for the Jammin' Ninja show... ...but until this case is over, I don't think I can look at them without being overcome. Edgeworth: ...I understand. I'll take good care of them for you. (Hm...? There is a bit of soil stuck on the ends of these sticks...) Hair Sticks data jotted down in my Organizer. Gumshoe: Oh! I guess it's that time already, huh!? Franziska: So it's midnight... the dawn of another day. Gumshoe: Hey, pops! Thanks a bunch! You've really done a lot for everyone all these years! Edgeworth: Detective Badd, don't tell me today is the day...? Badd: Yeah... it is. With this... I can retire in peace. ...It was down to the wire, and we almost didn't make it... ...but we did it... we solved everything. Edgeworth: But that's just it; we haven't solved everything yet. The ringleader of the smuggling ring you, the Yatagarasu, were chasing after... Badd: ...The legend of that Yatagarasu... is now over. Mr. Edgeworth... That bit of logic earlier... it was brilliant. Edgeworth: ... Badd: I feel like... I can leave it all in your hands. ...I'm counting on you. Kay: Is it really true, Uncle Badd? Were you also a part of the Yatagarasu...? Badd: As I said to you earlier... Kay... I'm truly sorry. I wanted... nothing but a peaceful life for you... Kay: Uncle Badd... Gumshoe: Hey, don't take it so seriously! It's all just one big joke, right!? Franziska: ...Unfortunately, it isn't. Gumshoe: O-Oh, come on, sir! She's just yanking on my chain, isn't she, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Detective Badd... Wait, no, you are no longer a detective... Mr. Badd, I'd like to ask you about the Yatagarasu. Gumshoe: ...Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth... Badd: Mr. Edgeworth... ...Here, I should give these back to you. Edgeworth: These are... ...the pages from my KG-8 case files that the Yatagarasu stole from my office! Gumshoe: Huh? Wait? WHAT!? Badd: Mr. Edgeworth, I must apologize for last night. Edgeworth: So the Yatagarasu who stole into my room was you, was it? Gumshoe: Wait... then that means... WHAAAAAAAAAAT!? T-Tell me it's not true...! Th-That's too insane for me to believe, sir! Badd: It's true... Even if it's not something you want to hear. The KG-8 Incident... It was a very emotionally trying case. We stood in that courtroom... Faraday as the prosecutor... and I as the lead detective. Faraday had... evidence in his possession... that would prove the defendant guilty. However... because it was stolen, the defendant... was found innocent. Yew was... the elder sister... of the victim in the case. When the defendant was pronounced \"not guilty\"... she... let out a great wail. That's when we realized... that there was a limit... to what the law could do. The only way to bring someone like that to justice was to do so outside of the courts... That's what we thought... at the time. ...That's how we... formed the Yatagarasu... ...and vowed to bring to light... any dirty dealings companies had with the ring... ...including companies that dealt with... the Amano Group... Edgeworth: Mr. Amano's conglomerate...? Badd: We called ourselves the Yatagarasu... and flexed our collective muscle... We exposed all sorts of shady dealings... as a warning to the business world as a whole... By doing that... we were able to stop... the higher ups from covering things up. And then... it was finally time... We had finally arrived at the moment when... we'd find out the ringleader's true identity. It was then that Yew literally stabbed us in the heart... and Faraday... he died for it... Edgeworth: .................. Kay: But why...? Wasn't she the sister of the victim in the KG-8 Incident? Badd: ...After Faraday's death, I looked into her past... And that's when I found out... that she was a phony. The victim of the KG-8 Incident, Cece Yew... ...she ...never had a sister. Edgeworth: What? Then that means... Badd: \"Shih-na\" wasn't the only fake name she used! \"Calisto Yew\" was also another pseudonym! From the very beginning... that woman was a spy sent by the smuggling ring! Franziska: She said it herself; \"I was destined to betray everyone from the very beginning.\" Badd: Anyway... Let's return to the real topic at hand... Mr. Edgeworth... this \"trump card\" that we stuck onto this page of the case file... ...please use it wisely. Edgeworth: \"Trump card\"...? Badd: That photo that we stuck on there... Try peeling it off. Behind it... slumbers a piece of evidence... that Faraday hid away all those years ago. Edgeworth: It's the mark of the Yatagarasu... But why? Badd: This is... a \"directives card\"... from the big boss. Take a look... at the back. This was something... Coachen had on him at the time of the KG-8 Incident... ten years ago. That blood... is from the victim of the incident, Ms. Cece Yew... Edgeworth: But why is the card adorned with the mark of the Yatagarasu? Badd: The reason why... we called ourselves... the Yatagarasu... ...was because... of the three-legged raven mark that the smuggling ring's boss used. Apparently, orders from the boss... would come on these cards, without fail. The person who received the order... was supposed to burn it immediately after reading it. And apparently... it burns a bright green flame when set ablaze... Edgeworth: So you mean, the cards were written in Babahlese ink...? Badd: The fact that the card that Coachen was sent made it into Faraday's hand at all... ...is nothing short of a miracle. We decided... that whenever we stole anything... ...we would send a \"card\" along with it... to the police. Edgeworth: So that's what those white cards are! Badd: The Great Thief that used the mark... that only those within the ring would know... It was our message... to the ringleader... ...that we were only a few steps behind. Trump Card data jotted down in my Organizer. Badd: And one more thing... Detective Gumshoe. I'm entrusting this to you. Gumshoe: What is this, sir? Badd: This is what I was talking about earlier. During the KG-8 Incident trial, Faraday had this in his possession... ...this important, definitive piece of evidence... Edgeworth: But I thought it was stolen, How do you have it...? Badd: The person who stole it from us... ten years ago... ...was a man by the name of Ernest Amano... And he had it locked and hidden away... for all this time. But we forced him to tell us where it was finally... after the other day's kidnapping case. Video Tape data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: This video...! Portsman: Wh--! Don't come any closer! I'm warning you! Edgeworth: This is the same video as the one Mr. Portsman was trying to conceal from me! Badd: Yeah, it would seem that even he was caught up in the ring's web. Amano was preparing to take on the boss someday... ...and the video was his insurance. That's where that prosecutor comes in... He was to retrieve the video. On top of that... he was apparently instructed to sneak into your office... ...and steal the trump card... You saw it for yourself, right? The card that told him to preserve the evidence. Edgeworth: Then, that card was not the calling card of the Yatagarasu... ...but rather, a directives card from the ringleader to Mr. Portsman? Badd: The two pieces together make for a strong weapon for whoever holds them. Edgeworth: The evidence Mr. Portsman thought to withhold from me... ...and the one that you stole from my office last night... Both pieces are illegal, and for me to use either one is... Badd: Whether you use them or not... is up to you. But they will be of help to you... when you take on someone who is above the law. Edgeworth: (Is the boss one of those who \"cannot be brought to court\" that Mr. Faraday spoke of?) Detective Badd... There is no limit to the law, for it is the people who determine the limits to them. Badd: You still insist that, even now? You really are something else. I leave the rest in your hands. Now then, Detective Gumshoe. The handcuffs. It's time to lock up... the last remaining member of the Yatagarasu. Gumshoe: Pops... Badd: ...Don't ever lose your detective's spirit. Gumshoe: Nnnnrrrgh... Pops! Why is this happening!? This isn't justice! Badd: Like I always told you... do not get emotionally involved. ...Now let's go. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Is this really the end of a legend...? To be continued \nLang: One of Allebahst's knives was used in Babahl to murder Mr. Coachen. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I concur that this knife crossed over country lines. Lang: Good, but that's not the only thing that did. We mustn't forget about the other weapon! The knife was only one. Lang: And the murder weapon in the killing of DeMasque II is Babahl's Primidux Statue. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you're saying that the Primidux Statue was also brought over by Franziska? Lang: Like I told you before, that's the only way it makes sense! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And how exactly did she bring it over? Lang: I... haven't figured that out yet. Edgeworth: Hmph... That's a rather weak statement, considering how sure you are. Lang: Maybe, but there is one thing I do know for sure. Lang: Somehow, these two objects were able to penetrate the two countries' impenetrable security. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Impenetrable\"...? I should hardly think so. Lang: Lang: You've seen the top of the wall between the two countries, right? Who in the world could cross over that? Kay: Yeah, not even I could climb over that thing with all that barbed wire... Lang: The only way into either embassy is through the doors in the Theatrum Neutralis. So the only way for the knife and the Primidux Statue to traverse the two countries... ...is through those security camera-equipped, well-guarded doors. Present Babahl's Primidux Statue or Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Agent Lang, those two items are not the only two to cross the border tonight.\" Lang: The only one who traversed the two countries just before and after the crimes was you. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was Franziska really the only person to have traveled between the two countries? Lang: According to the guards at both doors, she is the only one to go back and forth. The sis there was in Allebahst when the Yatagarasu showed. And then, just before you guys found Mr. Coachen's body, she entered Babahl. I think we can assume that's when she brought the knife into Babahl. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Then how do you explain the Primidux Statue? Lang: ...I haven't quite figured that out yet. However, the fact that the two weapons crossed the border... ...proves that the killer must have also traveled across the country lines! Edgeworth: (The only things to cross the border are the Primidux Statue and the knife? I should hardly think that those are the only two items, Agent Lang...!) Edgeworth: Agent Lang, those two items are not the only two to cross the border tonight. Lang: Oh? Edgeworth: DeMasque II was killed with Babahl's Primidux Statue, yes. But if that's the case, then tell me, where did Allebahst's Primidux Statue go? Lang: To Babahl...! Edgeworth: Precisely. And if the two statues really were switched... ...then this means that both statues were smuggled across the border at some point. Which means that a total of three items were smuggled across the embassies! Lang: Hmm... I guess so. But you know what? It doesn't matter the number of items, only that the sis is the only one who could've done it! Because the only person who went back and forth between Allebahst and Babahl is her! Edgeworth: (Is that really true? Was there no one else who traveled between the two countries? Actually, there was definitely another person; one who paid a visit to both sides of the wall!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Is that really so, Agent Lang? Lang: Ha ha ha ha! What a lousy time to try and bluff your way out of this! I checked out what the guards said, along with the security cameras' footage. You're not going to overturn my hypothesis that easily! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But suppose there was some other way other than through the theater doors? Lang: What other way...? Edgeworth: (The other entity that managed to cross the border unharmed... If I point it out, it would open up a whole new possibility! And though I hesitate to bring this out... ...as long as this entity exists, the impossible road becomes a possibility.) Lang: It looks like you've got some clever idea in mind. Edgeworth: I do, and I can show it to you through a single piece of evidence. Lang: Tch! Fine, then. Let's see this piece of evidence that will show me this \"other route\"! Edgeworth: This piece of evidence will show us another way to move between the two countries! Present Photo of Yatagarasu Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Agent Lang, I'm sure you are familiar with this unforgettable photo.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I believe this is the piece of evidence that will show you how! Lang: ......... What about it? You're going to have to explain because I don't see another road or anything here (changed from [else] in the original release)! Edgeworth: B-But how can you not see!? Wolves are known for their keen eyesight! Lang: Sorry, but the only thing I see is the crud that you're hoping will stick to the wall. Edgeworth: (I need to think calmly about this and find that other road the smuggled goods took...) Leads back to: \"This piece of evidence will show us another way to move between the two countries!\" Edgeworth: Agent Lang, I'm sure you are familiar with this unforgettable photo. Lang: Tch...! That supernatural photo!? Like I said before... Humans can't fly. Edgeworth: No, of course not. I understand that perfectly well. Lang: And don't start claiming that Shih-na somehow grew wings, either. Edgeworth: I wouldn't dream of claiming that. Lang: And I won't allow you to take back what you've said either! I'll say it again; it's not humanly possible to fly through the air without wings! So you'd better have a good explanation for this, Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: ...Arngh! (But how can I prove who it was that flew through the air in this photo!? Wait. \"Not humanly possible\"...? Eureka...!) Very well. You will have your explanation! Lang: It sounds like you have a good idea simmering inside that head of yours... Let's hear it! The face hidden within this photo's blurry, trailed shadow is...!? Present Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Naturally, the shadow is the third smuggled object, the Primidux Statue replica.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is the face behind the shadow! Lang: Lang: I thought I said that you'd better have a GOOD explanation. I can't make heads or tails of what you're trying to say with that! Edgeworth: Nnrgh! (W-Was I wrong...?) Lang: Come on... Hurry up and show me what that shadow that's flying through the air is! Edgeworth: Even had you not barked that at me, I would've gladly done so, Agent Lang. (I need to go over it one more time. The man-shaped shadow that flew through the air, wrapped in the darkness of the night... Its real shape can only be this one thing!) Leads back to: \"Let's hear it! The face hidden within this photo's blurry, trailed shadow is...!?\" Edgeworth: Naturally, the shadow is the third smuggled object, the Primidux Statue replica. Lang: You can't be serious! Edgeworth: The Yatagarasu... or rather, Calisto Yew dressed as Agent Shih-na, was inside Babahl. She dressed the replica statue up in clothes, and launched it through the air. Lang: Lang: Hah... Mr. Prosecutooooooor! You left out a very crucial bit in your explanation. Edgeworth: I know I did. Lang: She \"launched it through the air\"!? Hah... And how exactly did she do thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (He is literally baring his fangs at me...! But he has a point. How exactly did it move through the air like that? As long as this remains unsolved, we won't be able to move any closer to the truth! Which reminds me, didn't he say this earlier...?) Lang: Hey, sis... I remember that just before Ambassador Alba went to give his speech... ...he called you into his office, right? Edgeworth: (So, just before the murder, Franziska was called here, right into this very room. If that's the case... then that may be another avenue I can pursue.) Agent Lang. In order for me to answer that question... ...I will need to hear testimony from Ms. von Karma. Franziska: ! Lang: Oh...? What are you up to now, pretty boy? Edgeworth: Earlier, you mentioned something of interest to me. You said that just before the murder occurred... ...Ms. von Karma had been in this room because Ambassador Alba had called for her. And for that reason alone, you believe her to be the killer. Lang: Yeah, I guess I did say something like that. Edgeworth: In that case, I believe it is my duty to ask her what her side of the story is. Lang: Hah! Do you really think a criminal would tell us the honest truth? Franziska: How dare you!? As I've said numerous times, there is absolutely no proof that I am the killer! Miles Edgeworth! Don't tell me you suspect me, too!? Edgeworth: I don't. However, I can't ignore the fact that you were in this room at one point in time. Which is why I would like to hear about it from you (changed from [your movements in this room] in the original release). Franziska: Krngh! Edgeworth: Franziska... I feel that I still don't have enough information... ...which is why your testimony is incredibly important to the outcome of this case. Franziska: ............ Alright. So? What would you like me to talk about? Edgeworth: Hmm... I'd like you to please testify to your movements up until you came into this room (changed from [in this room until the murder occurred] in the original release). Lang: Hmph... Alright, let's try this your way for a change. But if what she has to say turns out to be a waste of time... ...I'll place her under arrest faster than you can howl \"Nooooooooooooo!\" Edgeworth: Hmph... As you wish. Testimony -- Movements in Allebahst -- Franziska: As I said earlier, I was assigned to guard duty in the Allebahstian Embassy. After I saw the Steel Samurai off on his way towards the ambassador's office... ...I returned to the rose garden for a bit, and checked up on the security situation. After all the preparations were in place, I was called back by Ambassador Alba to his office. Edgeworth: Franziska, I want us to make this clear from the very beginning... ...so what I wish to confirm is that the only time span in which you were in this office... ...was before the murder occurred. Is that correct? Franziska: Yes, of course. Edgeworth: I see. (For now, the only way that I can see for us to break out of this situation... ...is to ask Franziska about her testimony in more detail.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I thought your duty was to fact-find anything you could about the smuggling ring? Franziska: Yes, that was my job. But upon hearing that the Yatagarasu had sent a calling card to the Embassy... ...Ambassador Alba called upon us to protect the Embassy instead. That incident seven years ago... Or have you forgotten what happened here back then? Edgeworth: Nngh... (Anything related to that case we were involved in appears to be rather painful for her. It's not exactly one I can readily forget myself...) Franziska: Hmph... It looks like you remember the case after all. Edgeworth: Of course I do. Franziska: I inspected every location, every possible escape route... ...and every aspect of the police's security detail. I did all that, then after that... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were at the theater as well? Franziska: Yes, and I suppose you were also there as well, watching that stage show? Edgeworth: Well, yes. (So Franziska was there...) Franziska: Hmph... Well, after the show was over and I saw the Steel Samurai off... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Why did you need to confirm the degree of preparation for even the speech? Franziska: For security's sake, of course. What other reason could I have had? No one knew just how the Yatagarasu had planned on getting in, right? Edgeworth: Yes, I suppose you're right. Franziska: And in the end, the Yatagarasu did choose to appear in the rose garden... Even if it did turn out to be nothing more than a shadow... Arngh... Who would've thought that she would use a shadow!? Edgeworth: Ack! C-Calm down, Franziska! (She must still be nursing a grudge over the fact that she couldn't figure it out herself.) Franziska: Hmph... Anyway, there was no one in the rose garden. And we were aware that the speech was set to start soon thereafter. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: At that time, DeMasque II's body had yet to be found in this room, is that correct? Franziska: That's right. But Ambassador Alba was here. One could hardly miss his rather large presence. Edgeworth: Hmm... Lang: Hmph! A criminal will say anything to get out of getting arrested! How do we know you're not lying!? Franziska: Well, if you need proof, I'd be happy to oblige you. Lang: Seriously!? Franziska: Like I keep telling you... ...when I arrived at this office, Ambassador Alba was already here. He was standing by the flower box on the windowsill, watering his plants. Alba: Ah, I can attest to that. I remember speaking with the lovely lady around that time here in my office. Lang: Grr! Alright, then... Add that statement to your testimony, and let's hear some details. Edgeworth: (So Ambassador Alba was in this room at the time, was he...?) Adds statement \"When I arrived, Ambassador Alba was watering the flowers on the windowsill.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: For the sake of being thorough, I'd like to ask you something. How did you know that Ambassador Alba was watering his plants at the windowsill? Franziska: What do you mean by that? Edgeworth: The entrance to this room is on this side, however, the window is on the opposite side. If what you say is true, then when you entered the room, his body would've been like a wall. He would've been blocking your view of what he was doing. Isn't that not correct? Franziska: I suppose it was a bit hard to see around him. But fortunately for me Ambassador Alba is not an immovable wall. Edgeworth: ...? Franziska: I knocked before I entered, and as I did, he turned around to greet me... ...with a watering can in his hand. So it's only natural to believe that he was watering his plants, right? Edgeworth: I suppose. Franziska: After his greeting, we spent a little time talking about his flowers. He had obtained them himself, and is growing them with the utmost care, you know. Alba: Yes... The plants in this room... They are all like my children. Franziska: The passionflowers in the flower box on the windowsill are growing beautifully, too. All four of them are in full bloom. Edgeworth: ! Ms. von Karma, what did you say just now? Franziska: I said that the flowers are growing beautifully. What about that statement do you not understand? Edgeworth: (What do I not understand? I do not understand why a certain thing is the way it is...) I'd like for you to append that statement to your testimony. Franziska: Very well. Adds statement \"There were four large passionflowers in full bloom in the flower box.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: For the sake of being thorough, I'd like to ask you something.

Edgeworth: I suppose. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'd like to confirm this with you one more time. There were four passionflowers in bloom in that box, correct? Franziska: Yes. I should hardly think I could have miscounted such eye-catching flowers. Edgeworth: (There must be a deeper meaning to this statement. And it appears that I must take a gamble on its meaning for me to make any progress!) Edgeworth: (The Primidux Statues were already switched by the time the murder happened. In light of that fact, what Franziska saw in this room before the crime... ...is of incredible importance!)Franziska: As I said earlier, I was assigned to guard duty in the Allebahstian Embassy. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I thought your duty was to fact-find anything you could about the smuggling ring? Franziska: Yes, that was my job.

Edgeworth: I suppose. Franziska: There were four large passionflowers in full bloom in the flower box. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'd like to confirm this with you one more time. There were four passionflowers in bloom in that box, correct? Franziska: Yes. I should hardly think I could have miscounted such eye-catching flowers. Edgeworth: (There must be a deeper meaning to this statement. And it appears that I must take a gamble on its meaning for me to make any progress!) Present Passionflowers Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Franziska...\" Edgeworth: (The Primidux Statues were already switched by the time the murder happened. In light of that fact, what Franziska saw in this room before the crime... ...is of incredible importance!) Edgeworth: Franziska... For some odd reason... your testimony contradicts with this piece of evidence. Franziska: It does appear that way. Lang: Hah! I know it! I knew we couldn't trust your words, sis! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! What are you doing discrediting Ms. von Karma like this!? Gumshoe: Yeah, sir! If you keep this up, she's gonna get taken away, sir! Eeek! Franziska: All I've done is state what I saw! I have not made (changed from [made not] in the original release) a single mistake in my testimony! And for this... I am still under suspicion for murder. Is the number of flowers really all that important at this juncture, Miles? Edgeworth: At the very least, it is a contradiction in this enigmatic case. One that I find hard to dismiss as irrelevant. Lang: Hah! Then let's hear it, Mr. Prosecutor! What does the number of flowers have to do with anything? What does it prove? Edgeworth: I believe the answer to that will become clear if we were to examine that flower box. (How did this contradiction come about...? There must be something behind this discrepancy!) Alba: Th-They're my beloved flowers. I've grown them with the utmost care. So I ask that you please be gentle with them as you examine them, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hmph... I understand. (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Examine flowers Edgeworth: The name of these flowers... I believe they're called \"passionflowers\". Despite being called \"flowers\", they are actually a species of vine. They appear to be growing well, and are well-supported by these plant supports. Lang: Yeah, but no matter how I look at it, it looks like there are only two here to me! You realize, don't you, sis... Your little lie has failed you! Franziska: Arngh! Miles Edgeworth! Hurry up and shut this man up for me already! Edgeworth: Hmm... (I suppose I will need to use some evidence to \"shut him up\", won't I...?) Show evidence Edgeworth: Hmph... I believe I have just the piece of evidence you require. Lang: Oh? You do, do you!? You have such confidence in the face of your current plight... ...but I highly doubt it'll last until the end! Edgeworth: Hmph... You howl like a wolf, Agent Lang... ...but we'll see if you have any bite to back up that bark after you see the evidence! The truth the passionflowers reveal can be seen in this piece of evidence! Present Hair Sticks Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Shih-na, who was supposedly in Babahl the entire time, had these \"hair sticks\" on her...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well? What do you think now, Agent Lang? Lang: Lang: Hah! You may talk big... but as usual, it's nothing more than a big bluff! Edgeworth: Gnrk! (Was I wrong!? Perhaps I should gather a bit more information before I attempt this again...) Leads back to examination of windowsill Don't have evidence to show Edgeworth: (Not yet... I still have a thing or two left to examine.) Leads back to examination of windowsill Examine watering can Edgeworth: This watering can has a rather robust design. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Why are you telling us stuff we can clearly see for ourselves!? Plus, if you keep wasting time talking about that, Ms. von Karma's gonna get arrested! Edgeworth: Nngh... (I'd better examine something else.) Examine flower box Edgeworth: This flower box... It appears to be made of marble. Franziska: It looks that way. But, so what? Is it something that's so important that you absolutely had to mention it? Edgeworth: N-No, not exactly, but... Franziska: .........Miles Edgeworth. You DO understand our current situation, don't you? Edgeworth: Y-Yes, of course. I am fully aware of the situation. Franziska: Oh? Then in that case, allow me to ask you once again. Is what the flower box is made out of really all that important? Edgeworth: Nngh... (It would appear that the construction of the flower box is not that important.) Examine holes in soil Edgeworth: (Hm...? This patch of soil looks as though it has had something removed from it.) Lang: Heh! What are you doing, Mr. Prosecutor? Why'd you clam up all of a sudden? I'm still here, waiting for an explanation, you know! Edgeworth: Did you know, Agent Lang? Flowers are best appreciated in silence. Lang: ...Tch. Edgeworth: (It looks like two things were pulled out of this flower box...) Edgeworth: Shih-na, who was supposedly in Babahl the entire time, had these \"hair sticks\" on her... ...that look exactly like the plant supports in this flower box. In other words, I believe it can be said that these \"hair sticks\" are in actuality... ...support sticks for the passionflowers! Lang: Heh! And so what!? Is this really all that important to the case? Examine evidence Hair Sticks Top of hair stick Edgeworth: Aha... So this ring-like section... ...is there to support vines like passionflowers up, huh? But if that's all they were meant to do, then what is this notch on the top end? Kay: Maybe it's for string or something to run through? To help the stick stay upright? Edgeworth: A notch for string to run through, huh? Tip of hair stick Edgeworth: I suppose this dirt was from when this plant support was stuck in the flower box. Kay: I guess that's why only the tip is dirty, huh? Edgeworth: Yes. Edgeworth: Of course it is. It means that we've found yet another item that was smuggled between the countries tonight. Lang: Aiya! Edgeworth: Think about it logically, Agent Lang. These sticks were originally in Allebahst... ...but somehow, they wound up in Shih-na's hands, who was in Babahl the whole night. So make no mistake! These sticks were smuggled somehow, just like the knife and statue! Lang: Arngh! Hmph! Very well, then! I want to hear from you exactly how they wound up in Babahl! Edgeworth: (How did these support sticks find their way to Babahl and why? There must be some reason as to why they ended up there... Aha! So that's why!) Agent Lang, if you would please take a look at this and tell me its shape. Lang: Hmph! It's just another stick, isn't it!? Edgeworth: Hmph... And so it is. But the shape of the support sticks is what is important. For when they are used with something in this room, that's when it all comes into focus. And the object that completes the picture when used with the support sticks is...! Present crossbow Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Th-That's a crossbow... Wait! You're not really suggesting...!?\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is what was used with the support sticks! Lang: .........Come again? Edgeworth: Isn't it obvious? Someone used those with this... Franziska: \"Those with this\"...? Could you be any more vague!? Why don't you try again!? Edgeworth: Y-Yes, I suppose I should. (It would appear that this was insufficient in conveying what I had wanted to say. The answer should become obvious to me if I just think calmly about it once more. But the only thing that can really connect the two offices together has to be this!) Leads back to: \"And the object that completes the picture when used with the support sticks is...!\" Lang: Th-That's a crossbow... Wait! You're not really suggesting...!? Edgeworth: I am. These hair sticks... or rather, plant support sticks... They make for perfect  arrows! Lang: Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Edgeworth: (I've done it! I've found the common thread that connects the two offices! But this thread has yet to be completely untangled. Even using the arrows, how does this explain how the statues were transported? Furthermore, who could it have been who fired these sticks as arrows? There MUST be a common thread that ties all of these things together!) Examine evidence Crossbow Arrows Loop on arrow Edgeworth: I thought these loops were just an eccentric design quirk... ...but who knew that they were actually arrow fletchings? Lang: Lang: Mr. Prosecutor! Hold up a second! You do realize what happens when you tie a statue to an arrow, right? They don't fly at all! Argument -- Border-Crossing, Pt. 2 -- Lang: So Babahl's statue was draped in the Yatagarasu's clothes, and then shot over here? Even if you fired the arrows from this side, they wouldn't go far with a statue tied to them! I don't think I need to tell you that the Primidux Statues didn't sprout wings. You're a realist, after all, aren't you? Edgeworth: The Primidux Statues didn't sprout wings...? Hmph. Of course they didn't. Lang: Glad you understand. I feel much better already. I was afraid for a second that you were unaware of that crucial fact! Edgeworth: It's only crucial because you're under the belief that wings are necessary to this equation. Lang: What? Edgeworth: You need to free your mind a bit more, and let it fly like a bird on the wind. The Primidux Statues flew, but not on a wing. Allow me a bit of your time, and I'll explain this mysterious phenomenon to you! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But that incredible scene just happened to have been caught on film, resulting in this photo. Lang: Hah! And what an incredible scene it was! This photo was taken by a freelance photojournalist, right? Edgeworth: Yes, so I hear. Lang: And not every photojournalist is known to be honest, right? Especially not the ones that sell photos of spirits and giant creatures to tabloids. Edgeworth: Yes, I know what you mean. I've seen those sorts of photos many a time in court. But there have been times when those photos have turned out to be telling the truth. If you had ever stood in a court of law, you would know that it's entirely plausible. Lang: Hah! You really believe the stuff you're spewing right now? A courtroom certainly is a strange place, if what you say is true. But there really is something odd about that photo no matter how you look at it. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But we are in agreement that an arrow by itself would reach the other side, correct? Lang: But just the arrow by itself is pretty meaningless, don't you think, Mr. Prosecutor? Because the things they wanted to smuggle were a lot bigger than nothing! Edgeworth: No, that's not necessarily true. Lang: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (What I need right now... ...is not further discussion of my conclusions; it's the launching of my conclusions! What the shooter wanted to launch with the crossbow was not the statues themselves! But rather, something a crossbow can launch that can be used to move the statues!) Adds statement \"If it wasn't a statue that was tied to the arrows, then what did the crossbow launch...?\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The thing the crossbow launched...? Allow me to show you the answer! Lang: Well, come on, then! Show me what you've got! But I warn you! I'll know when you're just bluffing! Edgeworth: This is what was launched from this Allebahstian office with the crossbow! Present Wire Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Finally...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence is what was launched from here in Allebahst! Lang: Lang: And what purpose, exactly, did launching that serve? Because if you're joking, it's not gonna be a fit of laughter I'm about to launch into! Edgeworth: Ack! (That was not the kind of launch I was looking for.) Lang: Hah! I knew you couldn't explain this whole thing in a down-to-earth manner! Leads back to rebuttal Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Finally...\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence is what was launched from here in Allebahst!

The statues didn't need wings to fly. Lang: Then how would YOU explain things? I'm almost looking forward to whatever fantastical explanation you come up with! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Of course, and I assure you that my hypothesis is firmly grounded in reality. Lang: Hah! Well, all I'm hearing is the fantasy of a desperate man! Edgeworth: At times, even reality itself can be a mysterious thing. Even you must admit that. Lang: Heh, do I? If it's so true, then why don't you go ahead and show me!? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I think I understand what went sailing through the air! Edgeworth: Hmph... I suppose that's because you're an expert at things that fly through the air. Kay: What did you expect from the second Yatagarasu!? Edgeworth: Indeed. Now, to show Agent Lang what really went soaring through the air tonight.Lang: So Babahl's statue was draped in the Yatagarasu's clothes, and then shot over here? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But that incredible scene just happened to have been caught on film, resulting in this photo. Lang: Hah! And what an incredible scene it was!

Now, to show Agent Lang what really went soaring through the air tonight. Edgeworth: Finally... Finally, we have reached this point in our discussion. For I present to you, that which was carried by the arrow from the crossbow! Lang: Heh. I get it now, Mr. Prosecutor... I can see exactly what you are trying to say! You're saying that the wire was tied to an arrow and then shot into Mr. Coachen's office! All the way from the fifth floor of the Allebahstian Embassy... ...down to the third floor of the Babahlese Embassy! If what you're claiming is really what happened... ...I can see how Allebahst's Primidux Statue could be moved. Gravity could be used to move the statue down the wire from the fifth to the third floor. But then, what about Babahl's Primidux Statue? The dark shadow in this photo is clearly flying away from Babahl! Going in the opposite way of gravity, from the third floor of the Babahlese Embassy... ...up to the fifth floor of the Allebahstian Embassy...! How do you explain that!? Edgeworth: (Aha! I think I finally see how the gears behind this whole trick work (changed from [works] in the original release, correcting the typo)!) Agent Lang, the \"motion\" used behind this trick... I wonder if perhaps you have yet to envision how it works in your head? Lang: \"Motion\"? What motion? Edgeworth: This is the motion that was employed to smuggle Babahl's Primidux Statue! Rotary motion Leads to: \"I believe it was done via rotary motion.\" Swinging motion Edgeworth: A swinging motion was employed. Lang: Heh! You sure thought that one through, Mr. Prosecutor! Because if they used that... ...the statue would swing right into the building's wall! Edgeworth: Arngh! (H-He does have me there...) Lang: For shame! You should sign yourself up for grade school physics for not realizing that! Edgeworth: Nnrrrrgh... (I'm at a loss for words to that... I need to calm down and think through this once more. There is only one feasible motion that could've been used to send the statue up!) Leads back to: \"This is the motion that was employed to smuggle Babahl's Primidux Statue!\" Bungee action Edgeworth: A bit of bungee action was employed! Lang: ...Bungee action? Are you saying that the wire acted as a bungee cord, and then the statue was hauled up? Edgeworth: That's a simple way of putting it, but yes. Lang: Lang: Hah! Did you think about the weight of the statue at all? That thing is solid gold! Before that thing ever reached the office window, the wire would've snapped! Edgeworth: Nngh... Lang: But OK, let's consider your idea and say that the wire has the elasticity required. If you fired that kind of wire from a crossbow... ...the arrow could come sailing back at the person who shot it! Talk about dangerous! Edgeworth: Nnrrrrgh! (H-He's absolutely right...) Lang: I thought this sort of thing was common knowledge. I'm having a bit of hard time right now dealing with a jurisdiction thief... ...who lacks understanding of the most basic things like physics, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: (...Unfortunately for me, it appears that Agent Lang is correct. I need to calm down and think through this once more. There is only one feasible motion that could've been used to send the statue up!) Leads back to: \"This is the motion that was employed to smuggle Babahl's Primidux Statue!\" Edgeworth: I believe it was done via rotary motion. If the two statues were transported simultaneously... Lang: Lang: \"Simultaneously\"!? Get real! The statues would collide somewhere along the way! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Did I ever say that there was only one line of wire between the two offices? If you shot an arrow with the two ends of a wire tied to it, a circular belt can be formed. Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Don't object and call a success what is beyond reasonability.\" Taking into account the tension difference between the two wires... ...the top one would sag too much to the point where the statues would collide anyway! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang... As you know, the Primidux Statue is a one-of-a-kind national treasure. And the fact that Babahl's statue is a hollow replica of the real statue... ...it would naturally be lighter than the real one, meaning that my idea is very possible! Lang: Lang Zi says: HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWL! Edgeworth: Here is what I believe happened. Ms. Yew and her mystery co-conspirator set themselves up in the two different rooms. The co-conspirator bridged the rooms by shooting the 2 ends of the wire down on 1 arrow. Then the two of them covered the statues and proceeded to transport the statues. After the switch was completed, another arrow was fired... ...carrying the other end of the wire down to Babahl, where it was to be disposed of. And to do that, Ms. Yew hid it inside the grandfather clock. Q.E.D. Lang: ...Hah! Ha ha ha ha... Grr! Franziska: This proves it, right, Agent Lang!? That I'm not the killer! Lang: Not yet, sis. I still haven't had my dessert yet. Right, Mr. Prosecutor? Edgeworth: The proof is in the pudding, as it were? Lang: Pudding IS a nice dessert. So? Do you think you can do it? Can you prove that what you said is what happened? Because remember, if you can't... ...I'll be taking a certain someone back home with me as a souvenir! Edgeworth: I agree that as long as there is no proof, my hypothesis remains just that. However... ...what I have laid out is no mere hypothesis, for there is one more piece of evidence. Lang: One more? This should be interesting. You think you have a piece of evidence that will turn your hypothesis into fact...? Well then, let's see it, Mr. Prosecutor! Edgeworth: (The thing that made it possible to create a circular belt out of a length of wire... I believe that it is right here in this very room! Now then, I believe this is what made the circular belt transportation method possible!) Present ceiling fan Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Hah! Looks like you dropped another bomb on us again!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The circular belt method was made possible thanks to this part of the room! Lang: Hah! Don't you mean \"impossible\", Mr. Prosecutor? Franziska: ...I have to say, I agree. Lang: Haaa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Even the one in the most precarious situation here agrees with me! Franziska: I am a Von Karma... ...and as I have a name to uphold... ...I refuse to accept anything that is less than perfect! Edgeworth: Nngh... (I guess I was mistaken... I need to take another good look at this room. There is something here that made it possible to create a circular belt out of wire!) Leads back to: \"Now then, I believe this is what made the circular belt transportation method possible!\" Lang: Hah! Looks like you dropped another bomb on us again! Franziska: The last piece to the trick... are two pulleys! Edgeworth: Precisely! The ceiling fans double as pulleys in this case! And thanks to the fact that there is one installed in each of the offices... ...the ceiling fans made for the perfect pulley set for the wire to run on! Lang: A...Aaa......... Arruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh! Edgeworth: (This must be it! This is how the smugglers bypassed the impenetrable security!) Lang: Ha... Ha ha ha ha ha! Grr... You really are something else, Mr. Prosecutor! I bet you've figured it all out already, haven't you!? You know who the bug hotshot that set up this real-life stage show is, don't you!? Edgeworth: (The person who set up this rather large and complex stage show... ...needs to be someone who had foreknowledge of... ...the existence of a ceiling fan in both the Allebahstian and Babahlese offices. And that the passionflowers' support stakes could be used as arrows...) The real mastermind behind this case......... Lang: Well!? Don't you dare make this wolf wait for his food! Franziska: Why are you so hesitant, Miles Edgeworth? If you can't say who it is, why don't you present something like you always do!? Edgeworth: (A single point of the finger here, and this case will explode into an international incident. However! It's already too late for me to stop the forward momentum! It appears that I have no choice now... but to rush in!) There is a piece of evidence that will point us to who the mysterious mastermind is! Present Passionflowers or Crossbow Arrows Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This smuggling could not have been possible without the use of the crossbow.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And this is it! Lang: Lang: Where's my real dessert!? How long do you intend to keep it from me!? That piece of evidence isn't satisfying at all! Edgeworth: Ack! (Then stop being so picky with your food! The person who concocted the trick used to smuggle the statues... I should already have the piece of evidence that shows who that is. I just have to present it. No matter what the cost!) Leads back to: \"There is a piece of evidence that will point us to who the mysterious mastermind is!\" Edgeworth: This smuggling could not have been possible without the use of the crossbow. Furthermore, the arrows that were shot by the crossbow... ...were plucked, as it were, from the flower box in this very room. They were planted so long ago that the passionflowers had the time to grow so big... ...that Ms. von Karma didn't even notice the arrows when she visited this room today! Lang: ............ Edgeworth: On top of all this, the fact that the culprit knew that both offices had ceiling fans... ...tells us that the person has very detailed information on the embassy's layout. So as you may have already guessed, the person I am accusing of hatching this plan... ...is the person who grew the flowers in the flower box with the utmost care. Thus, it can only be you! Quercus Alba! Franziska: ! Lang: ! Alba: .................. Franziska: Are you out of your mind, Miles Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: I'm certain of what I am saying, and I am sure that he is the culprit. Lang: Heh... Heh heh heh heh......... Haaa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Tell me, Mr. Prosecutor. What was the ambassador trying to accomplish by doing all that stuff you just outlined? Why in the world would he need to use a trick like that? Edgeworth: I understand your need to doubt me. However, there is one thing that stands out to me as very odd. Lang: Just one thing, huh? Edgeworth: (The one, single end result Ambassador Alba sought to obtain... If we were to examine the focus of this complex trick... ...I believe we will finally find the answer to everything!) Everything will become clear once we examine this piece of evidence! Present Allebahst's Primidux Statue Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I would fully understand the reasoning had the situation been the reserve.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Lang: You want us to examine this? Edgeworth: Yes, for I believe that by examining it, we will finally have all of our answers. Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Items that become evidence should never have any part overlooked.\" All evidence related to this case are fine and don't need to be examined again! Edgeworth: Ack! (I-It would appear that I was mistaken... Agent Lang is correct... Most of the evidence has already undergone intense scrutiny. However, there is one piece that has only been partially checked... And that piece, which lies at the heart of the smuggling, is what I should present!) Leads back to: \"Everything will become clear once we examine this piece of evidence!\" Edgeworth: I would fully understand the reasoning had the situation been the reserve. However, to go through the trouble of swapping the real Primidux Statue for the fake... I sense a very shady reason for such a bizarre action! And who better to ask for that reason than King Primidux himself! Lang: I see... Ambassador, we'll be examining that statue now, with or without your permission! Alba: .............................. Examine head Leads to: \"Hmm... This guy kind of looks like the Steel Samurai, don't you think?\" Examine sword Edgeworth: With his sword drawn like that, there is an aura of valor and bravery around King Primidux. Kay: He looks so cool standing like that with the sword stuck in the ground in front of him. Maybe I should try and come up with some cool pose with a shuriken or something! Edgeworth: (I am seriously beginning to think that her real goal in life is to become a ninja.) Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. There isn't anything particularly odd about the sword, right? Edgeworth: No, not really. I suppose we should examine a different area of the statue now. Examine shield Edgeworth: A shield, huh... There doesn't seem to be anything unusual about it. Kay: I bet it's supposed to mean that the guy is protecting something! Edgeworth: I don't think it's supposed to have that deep of a meaning behind it. Kay: In that case, what are we wasting time with this for? Let's look at some other area! Examine handprint on bottom Edgeworth: These are Mr. Coachen's fingerprints. The fact that they're on here suggests that this statue once belong to Babahl. Kay: So it was smuggled from Babahl to Allebahst, huh? Edgeworth: (Why was there a need for them to smuggle it in?) Kay: Hmm... This guy kind of looks like the Steel Samurai, don't you think? Maybe it's because they look alike that he was picked to be the goodwill ambassador? Edgeworth: I suppose that's possible. ............Hm? Take a look at this area around the base of his neck. It looks like a gap. Kay: Hey! You're right! Maybe it's meant to be some kind of secret? Edgeworth: Perhaps it's possible to open the statue from this gap in its construction! Lang: What...!? Franziska: Hurry up and open it, Miles! Edgeworth: ...Alright, here goes. Kay: Wow! It really did open up! Hey, what's this thing that fell out? Edgeworth: Hm...? I believe a more thorough examination of it is required. Examine plate Leads to: \"What in the...!? Is this...!?\" Edgeworth: What in the...!? Is this...!? Lang: Hey! Is this what I think it is...!? Franziska: It's a plate... for making counterfeit bills! Edgeworth: Somehow... it appears that we've at long last arrived... ...at the exit to this complex labyrinth! We finally hold within our hands, one of the counterfeit money plates... ...and the reason why the replica was smuggled into Allebahst to begin with! Counterfeit Plate data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: The Primidux Statue can only be handled by the ambassador or the secretariat. And the replica is nothing more than a hollow shell covered in gold. These two circumstances make the statue the ideal object in which to hide contraband. After receiving the statue containing the counterfeit plate from Shih-na... ...the ambassador had the misfortune of accidentally running into DeMasque II. Surprised by the thief, the ambassador raised the replica statue at DeMasque II, and... Then, in order to frame the Steel Samurai of the murder... ...he covered the Samurai Sword in blood. Well, Ambassador Alba? Examine evidence Counterfeit Plate Front side Edgeworth: It's a counterfeit plate used to make counterfeit Zheng Fa bills. It's incredibly detailed, and even includes a phoenix taking off into the sky. With plates as finely crafted as these, it's no wonder the fakes are so hard to spot. Alba: .................. Lang: You're... the leader of the smuggling ring? My country is a mess... ...and it's all because of you!? Franziska: YOU'RE... the one who killed DeMasque II? Edgeworth: Answer us! Alba: ..................I never thought... I never thought... that you would figure things out to this level. Edgeworth: ...! Alba: However, there is one point I disagree with you on. The head of the smuggling ring was......... Mr. Coachen. Lang: Lang: Quite screwin' around! I have no sympathy for someone who would try to pass the guilt onto a dead man! If there is one thing I'm sure of, it's that you're the real ringleader, Quercus Alba! Alba: It's not good to speak with such subjectivity, you know, Agent Lang. Lang: \"Subjectivity\"? My conclusion is anything but, and is the result of logic and investigation! Alba: \"Logic and investigation\"? Only seconds ago, you were ready to arrest Ms. von Karma. I don't think we can give such flip-floppy logic any real weight, do you? Lang: Heh......... .........Heh heh heh... Haa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Alba: ? Edgeworth: ? Lang: It looks like you still don't get why I came back. Alba: Excuse me? Lang: You see, the reason I came back... ...is so that I could sink my fangs into your wrinkly, old neck! From the very beginning, my real target has been you! Alba: What? Franziska: Agent Lang! I demand an explanation! Lang: Sorry, sis. I didn't mean to put you through all that. I knew you were innocent from the very beginning. Franziska: You did...? Lang: I knew that this whole incident had been meticulously planned and prepared for. So naturally, the occupant of this room, Ambassador Alba, seemed the most suspicious. But without the ambassador's permission, we couldn't get in to take another look around! Edgeworth: Ah, so that's why you put on this big show to accuse Franziska of the murder! Using Franziska as the bait, you were able to gain us entry and investigative rights! Lang: Yeah, if I hadn't done that, I doubt the ambassador would've given the OK to poke around. Franziska: So that's what all this was about... Very well, I will forgive you. But in exchange for using me as bait... ...you will take some responsibility and help us find the truth! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, for giving me such a great opening... I thank you. Lang: ............You know, I just knew, Mr. Prosecutor... ...that somehow, if we were able to find some proof by investigating this room... ...that you would be able to figure out the real culprit with your special brand of logic. Edgeworth: Heh, the evidence detectives collect combined with the logic of a prosecutor... That's just as it should be in a \"prosecutor - detective team\", right? Lang: Tch. I don't know about all that! But one thing I do know is that I'm itching to see that old man get what's coming to him! Alba: Ho ho. You're quite scary when you want to be, aren't you? Lang: Hey, you were the one who was planning to use me to push all the guilt onto the sis. But unfortunately for you, you misjudged me! Alba: ..................Agent Lang, I wish for you to stop trying to intimidate me. What we need right now is evidence and proof. I wonder if you have what is necessary to prove that I am the head of the smuggling ring? Franziska: Franziska: Don't be such a sore loser! If you really are the head of the smuggling ring... ...then you should acknowledge your crimes with dignity! Alba: Dignity...? That is nothing more than a fool's insincere display of strength. If you really wish for me to acknowledge my crimes... ...then I would like to first see some of this thing you call \"evidence\". Franziska: Grr...! Alba: I tell you... I knew nothing. Really. I didn't even know that a counterfeit plate was hidden inside that statue. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You swapped a real statue that vested in your country the authority to rule for a sake. It doesn't make any sense that you didn't know anything! Alba: It doesn't make sense? Where doesn't it make sense? Can you prove that it doesn't make sense? Edgeworth: Gnnrk! Franziska: ...He's really got us. He's... turned the entire situation around against us. Alba: .................. Edgeworth: (The proof that Interpol has been after which points to this man as the ringleader... If we can somehow find that proof now, then we can see to it that justice is finally served! Is there nothing I can use to break this case wide open!?) ...! The trump card and the video tape... (With those two items... ...we might be able to finally bring this man down. But...! The card is evidence from a case that Mr. Faraday hid away in secret... ...and the tape was stolen by Detective Badd from the police. They're both illegal evidence! No matter what, a protector of the law can't be allowed to use such pieces of evidence!) Manfred: Needless to say... ...we Von Karmas are commanded to achieve nothing but victory! And by any means necessary! Badd: The only way to bring someone like that to justice was to do so outside of the courts... That's what we thought... at the time. Edgeworth: (I no longer follow the path of Manfred von Karma... ...and I won't follow the path of the Yatagarasu! This leaves me with what? What creed will I believe in? If I want to pursue the truth, then I will sully my hands in illegality... ...and if I want to pursue justice, then I will lose the truth! What is the \"law\", and what is \"justice\"? And which path is a \"prosecutor\" supposed to follow!? That choice... is one I must make by my own hand here and now!) Use the trump card Leads to: \"There is no limit to the law. Any limit that exists was set there by man.\" Don't use the trump card Edgeworth: (I am a prosecutor, and I can't allow myself to use evidence such as these!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! If you don't do something, Ambassador Alba is going to get away with it! Edgeworth: Nngh... I know, but... Franziska: Franziska: What are you holding back for? The only thing a Von Karma should pursue is the perfect proof. If you really do have what it takes to complete our argument... ...then there is absolutely no reason not to use it! Edgeworth: Nngh... Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says: \"The reason people judge people is because people are people.\" People weren't born to be chained to the law; laws were born to protect the people. You're the only one here right now who can put this guy out to pasture... ...and that is the only way a second or a third generation of Zheng Fa's people will be born. Can you really still hesitate knowing the fate of a nation rests in your hands? Edgeworth: I... Leads to: \"There is no limit to the law. Any limit that exists was set there by man.\" Edgeworth: (There is no limit to the law. Any limit that exists was set there by man. When a person goes beyond that limit, then the law, too, crosses into new territory! For what reason were laws invented? The answer to that is what I must now show!) Ambassador Alba. I wonder if you might recognize this. Alba: ...! Oh, I wonder what that card is? I've never seen that before in my life. Edgeworth: It's a directives card used by the leader of the ring to relay instructions to his subordinates. Alba: Oh? Is that what it is? Edgeworth: This card was sent to the real culprit behind the KG-8 Incident, ten years ago... A man by the name of Mr. Manny Coachen. Alba: .........Oh. So why do you have such a card in your possession? Edgeworth: Because it was hand-delivered to me... ...by a certain Great Thief... The Yatagarasu! Alba: The Yatagarasu gave that to you...? Don't talk nonsense, and let's be serious, Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof that the card contains directions from the ringleader? Edgeworth: I'll have you know that the card is not the only thing I was given! Alba: What!? Edgeworth: This contains security footage that was shot just before the start of the KG-8 Incident. Alba: ...The KG-8 Incident...? Edgeworth: The card and the video... These two pieces of evidence are what will seal your fate! Alba: ............Hoho, very interesting. I must admit I am very curious now. Very curious indeed in these \"case-deciding\" pieces of evidence you've presented. Edgeworth: (The prey the Yatagarasu has been chasing all this time... now stands before me. I can't allow this man, who has had free reign for ten long years, to simply walk away. Now is the time for me to bring to fruition the valiant spirit that was given to me!) March 15, 1:34 AM Theatrum Neutralis - Lobby Alba: So, what is this interesting thing that you wanted to show me? Edgeworth: (The trump card and the video tape... These two pieces of evidence together make for the ultimate hand! And this is where the real meaning behind Detective Badd's words will be realized!) Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: What you see here is security footage shot just before the KG-8 murder occurred. From this footage, we know that the card is a directives card from the smuggling ring. This is the section that proves that the card was used to relay an order! Present black card Edgeworth: Leads to: \"As you can see, Mr. Coachen is holding the card in his right hand.\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Take a look at this area. Alba: What about that area...? My eyes aren't what they used to be, so I can't see what you're pointing at too well. But from what I can see, it doesn't look like it's related to our conversation... Edgeworth: Nngh...! (It's unrelated...!? I need to remain calm and take another look at this footage. What is the vital clue that shows us that the card was used to relay an order!?) Leads back to: \"This is the section that proves that the card was used to relay an order!\" Edgeworth: As you can see, Mr. Coachen is holding the card in his right hand. Alba: I see. The killer is indeed holding a card with the exact same design on it. But the card and the one you have... Just because they look the same, doesn't mean that they are, does it now? Edgeworth: Ah, but there is a very easy way for me to prove that they are, in fact, one and the same. All we have to do is simply take a look at this! Examine bloodstain Leads to: \"This dark red blood... Yes, this is your proof.\" Examine raven Edgeworth: According to Detective Badd... ...Ambassador Alba's directive cards bear the mark of a three-legged raven... ...or in other words, a yatagarasu. I suppose this mark was the inspiration for their group's name, the Yatagarasu. Examine text Edgeworth: A section of the text has been obscured by blood, but it's clear the writing is Cohdopian. According to Detective Badd... ...\"Silence Cece Yew\"... ...is what is written here... ...along with the method to be used and where she lived. The evil intent displayed in this writing will not go unpunished! Edgeworth: This dark red blood... Yes, this is your proof. Proof that the orders on this card were played out in that terrible tragedy! The blood belonged to the victim of the KG-8 Incident. With a bit of DNA testing, we can very easily verify that as fact. Alba: .................. Edgeworth: If you have no objections... ...then I'd like for you to take a look at this next piece of footage! This car that passed by in front of the victim's apartment building... It's an official Cohdopian government car. Alba: Wh-What!? Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe! If you could please magnify the footage! This area of the footage directly links the smuggling ring with Cohdopia! Present front pocket Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The shape of this pocket...\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This section will make it all clear to us! Alba: .........You must be very tired, Mr. Edgeworth. If you continue presenting completely irrelevant evidence like this... ...I'm afraid your investigation may fall apart. Perhaps it is time for you to retire. Edgeworth: W-Wait! (Arngh! But I was so sure it was this area...! Alright, focus, Miles. The area I should be pointing out is definitely here!) Leads back to: \"This area of the footage directly links the smuggling ring with Cohdopia!\" Edgeworth: The shape of this pocket... and the directives card in it... It tells us that without a doubt, this person in this car is Mr. Coachen! Alba: ...Gnrk! Edgeworth: The license plate on the car was also captured by the security camera. And with it, we can easily find out who was sitting in this car on that day, ten years ago. Alba: Gnnrgh! Edgeworth: Which is why I can say with confidence that you were riding in this car on that day! Alba: Arnnnnnnnnnnnnngh! ..................Hah. Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah! You've done well, boy, to make it this far. However...! About your claim that I was riding in the car at the time... That's going to be mighty difficult to prove. Edgeworth: How so? Alba: The Principality of Cohdopia no longer exists. So naturally, all records from that time period also no longer exist. Edgeworth: (Nngh! That arrogance... What he really means is he's already erased all traces of them!) Alba: Are we finished here, boy? Edgeworth: (The only weapon I have left to me now... is this piece of footage! There must be something here that I can use against him!) Present medal Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Wh-What the...!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Franziska, what do you think about this area? Franziska: If you have to confer with someone, then it's obviously a useless piece of logic! Edgeworth: Gnnoooh! (Arngh! She's right. The only logic that can trap Ambassador Alba is a perfectly iron-clad one. There must be something here in this footage! There must be something that shows that Ambassador Alba was riding in the car that day! No matter how insignificant it may seem, a clue must be hiding here, and I must find it.) Leads back to: \"There must be something here that I can use against him!\" Edgeworth: Wh-What the...! Ambassador Alba! Alba: Yes, what is it? Edgeworth: You were once an army man in the service of Cohdopia. And it was you who made the many missions you participated in successes, correct? Alba: Hmph. Why the sudden back-handed praises, boy? Although, to be sure... ...the brilliant medals on my breast were awarded to me during the era of Cohdopia. But now, I am the only one who owns this particular medal. Edgeworth: In that case... the only person it could be who is sitting in this car is you! Alba: How do you figure that!? Edgeworth: By the medal captured here in this footage! It is clearly the same exact medal as the one on your chest! Alba: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (This is how it will be... But I won't look back. For this is the path that I have chosen!) Alba: Gnnrrr... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. You've moved me with your devotion to this case, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Why is he taking such an arrogant stance with me?) Alba: It's almost looking possible, isn't it? For the lot of you to have come this far... It looks like I just might lose our little game this time. Lang: You might lose the game \"this time\"...? You don't get another round, Mr. Ambassador! Alba: Is that a fact? ...Very well. I've decided to confess and admit my guilt. Franziska: You're... going to confess? Alba: And I will accept whatever punishment that may come as a result. Lang: What the...? Alba: Regarding the DeMasque II murder, I admit it... I did it out of self-defense. Edgeworth: You're claiming it was justified self-defense!? Alba: DeMasque II attacked me, and I felt that my life was in danger. If I hadn't done what I did, I might be the one you found dead instead of him. Lang: Haa ha ha ha ha ha ha! What a pathetic performance! Alba: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! I'm not giving you one! Kay: Wow, you two really know how to laugh at inappropriate times! Edgeworth: If you wish to claim it was justified self-defense, then we will need some evidence. Alba: It's always the evidence with you, isn't it? But if that's what you require, I'll provide it. That man left a mark on me when he attacked! Edgeworth: What!? Alba: I don't particularly want to show it off, but this is proof that it was in self-defense. I'm an old man, and sometimes I don't pay enough attention when I should... Franziska: But DeMasque II didn't have a single weapon on his body! Alba: Hold on. It's nothing to get worked up over, because... I hid the weapon. Franziska: You hid it? Alba: I'm sorry, but as you know, a murder is a murder, even if it's in self-defense. And I couldn't let it become public, seeing as how I AM an ambassador... This is the weapon you seek, my special bonsai trimming shears. Kay: Oongh... It's covered in blood. Alba: He was trembling quite badly during our struggle... ...but that's when he grabbed the shears that were sitting in my office and attacked. So you see, it was an act of self-defense. Kay: Is he right, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Since he has both a wound and the weapon that caused it, it's enough to declare it so. Amb. Alba's Wound data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: N-No way...! Alba: Oh, which reminds me. I guess there is still one more accusation I need to resolve. Smuggling and counterfeiting. Unfortunately, all of that is my secretary's doing. I had no knowledge it was going on. Lang: Lang: Stop spewing nonsense! You're trying to throw my investigation under the bus in your desperation. If you want to get real honest... ...everything in this case can be connected to you! Franziska: The murder of DeMasque II was done in self-defense...!? In my trials, no man escapes his crime alive! Alba: Perhaps so, if you were my opponent in court. However, there is one very important fact that I think you may have forgotten. Edgeworth: And what is that...? .................. A.........Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Lang: Arngh! That's what you mean! Extraterritoriality...! Alba: That's right. This embassy sits on what is effectively Allebahstian soil. So any trial that is to be held will be held in Allebahst. Therefore, the crime I just admitted to will never be tried in your courts. Edgeworth: Agent Lang! What is Interpol's stance on this!? Lang: Agents investigate. That's our job. The judgment of people who have confessed to their crime... that's the court's job. Edgeworth: Gnnrk! Alba: And I've already confessed to all of my crimes, Agent Lang. Furthermore, by the very nature of my position, I have full extraterritorial rights. These rights are effective, even on your country's soil. Therefore... ...no matter where a crime may take place, I will never stand trial in one of your courts! Lang: That arrogance... and your expression... That's nothing like the face of someone who is ready to accept the consequences. Don't tell me you have your own country's judicial system eating right out of your hands! Alba: These \"crimes\" you all speak so seriously of... To me, this has all been nothing more than a game. You may chase me out of this embassy with your accusations... ...but it's no big deal. Allebahst has numerous other embassies in other countries around the world. All you would accomplish is you would change the backdrop of our little game! Edgeworth: (These two layers of protection that extraterritoriality provides him... This is why he is one of those who cannot be brought to court!) Alba: You see now, don't you? I live in a whole different world than you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go and fetch your eviction papers. Edgeworth: Arngh! Is there nothing we can do!? To be continued. March 15, 2:11 AM Theatrum Neutralis - Lobby Gumshoe: I can't believe it, sir! Extraterritoriality... Edgeworth: Yes... and there is nothing we can really do about that. In the end, we didn't have enough authority to bring him to justice. Kay: I can't believe that even though we know he's the boss, we can't lay a finger on him! Edgeworth: I know... Lang: .................. Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, sorry to skip out on you, but I've got some business to take care of. Kay: If we can't even give an evil guy like him a slap on the wrist... ...then what the heck were laws created for!? What good are they!? If the law can't help us... ...then I'll go as the Yatagarasu, and take care of this myself! Edgeworth: Don't you dare! Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: ...Sorry, that was a bit too harsh. Gumshoe: I know how you feel, sir. We're trying to take on an ambassador, after all. And he did tell us earlier to get out of the theater. This is kinda their country, I guess... ...but I feel like I've been slapped across the face for just doing my job. Edgeworth: (What... am I going to do? Should I retreat for now, and formulate a better plan of attack...?) ???: Kay: Come on, everyone! We can't give up yet! Edgeworth: Kay...? Kay: I want you to think about something for a sec! We've never let up for even a second, and as long as we don't stop investigating... ...we might find the \"rotten\" treasure hidden here! Gumshoe: Sh-She's right! Kay: Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ...You're right, Kay. Very well. Let us re-open the investigation and see what we find. Come on, Kay! Kay: Right behind you! Gumshoe: OK! Then I'll go check out Babahl a bit more, sir! Franziska: And I have something that I need to investigate further in Allebahst. Edgeworth: (Now then... ...before I gather any more information, I should do a bit of housekeeping.) Passionflowers data erased from my Organizer. Begin Investigation Theatrum Neutralis - Lobby Edgeworth: Ambassador Alba seemed agitated (Agitated Alba - I sense that there is something he doesn't want us to investigate.) over something. Kay: I wonder why? Edgeworth: There are two special circumstances that surround the ambassador. First, the embassy itself has extraterritorial rights. If something happens on Allebahstian soil... ...we are unable to legally prosecute him. Kay: Cool! It sounds like embassies are the perfect place to steal whatever you want! Edgeworth: ...And murder DeMasque II, run a smuggling operation, and make counterfeit bills apparently. Kay: But I thought all the counterfeiting was done by Mr. Coachen in Babahl? Edgeworth: Yes, he apparently used the embassy's coupon printing press (Coachen's counterfeiting op. - Used Babahlese Embassy's printing press and Babahlese ink to make counterfeit bills.) to do it. But it's the same story over there anyway. Babahl also has extraterritorial rights. Which brings me to my next point: the ambassador's extraterritorial rights. Those rights are effective even in our own country. Kay: Really? Edgeworth: No matter what happens, he can never be tried in our courts. He retains some very special rights, indeed. Basically, no matter what wrongs he may commit, we can't bring him to trial here. Kay: So I guess we really don't stand a chance, do we? Edgeworth: Hmm... We might stand a chance if we can somehow nullify either one of his special rights. Talk Guard by left door Guard: On the orders of Ambassador Alba, no one is allowed into Allebahst. Edgeworth: Nngh! But I thought a lady with a whip passed through here not too long ago. Guard: She is from Interpol, and had the proper paperwork... ...so, while I was reluctant, I had to let her in. Edgeworth: (Heh... Sounds like Franziska alright.) Guard: Besides... if I didn't... that whip of hers... Edgeworth: (.........Yup, definitely Franziska...) Guard by right door Guard: Hello! And welcome to the Embassy of Babahl! Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but I don't really need to enter your country at this time. Guard: Right now, for a limited time here at the Babahlese Embassy... ...we're offering the very special \"Experience the Terrifying Fire's Ashes Tour!\" So, how about it? Shall I sign you up? Edgeworth: ...We're fine, thanks. (We have an investigation to run.) Examine Black backdrop Edgeworth: It's a backdrop they used in the Steel Samurai stage show today. Kay: I loved the climax of that show! \"Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!\" That was the first time I'd seen that special move! But, well, the Jammin' Ninja stage show's climax was much better, of course. Edgeworth: ...Oh, is that a fact? Kay: That scene where he sang for Princess Misola and gave her those hair sticks? I could totally feel the love there in my heart! Edgeworth: (Hmm... Perhaps the Jammin' Ninja is just more popular with female audiences...?) Flowers on left side Edgeworth: Flowers were sent by a variety of people and businesses to celebrate the goodwill event. Even the Steel Samurai received some flowers from the ambassadors. Kay: There are so many bouquets here, it's like a wedding ceremony! Edgeworth: I believe the flowers for those are for a slightly different reason... Kay: What do you mean!? This event was supposed to be like a wedding between Allebahst and Babahl, right? Edgeworth: ...Actually, I believe they're more in a state of divorce. Kay: OK, then! This event was supposed to be their remarriage ceremony! Edgeworth: Hmm... I suppose you could call it that. Photo Edgeworth: This was taken just before the two ambassadors gave their bouquets to the Steel Samurai. (Wait, is it just my imagination... ...or is there something in this picture that I've seen before...? I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Examine Quercus Alba's face Kay: I can't believe he was pretending to be a harmless old grandpa. Talk about deceptive! Edgeworth: I don't suppose anyone expected him to change that drastically... Kay: I bet he's thinking of something evil behind that cheery smile! Edgeworth: Kay, please try to remain calm and focused on the here and now. Kay: Yeah, you're right. Sorry I got all worked up there. Well, the only way we're going to be able to steal the truth is if we keep on investigating! Quercus Alba's bouquet Edgeworth: It appears to be a bouquet of Persian cyclamens and roses. Kay: Wow! You even know the exact species!? I never would've figured you for an expert on flowers! Edgeworth: Nnnnngh... (It's all because of those flowers that old lady sends me every month... Just look at me; I sound like some sort of botanist!) Kay: So, umm, what exactly is this yellow flower here? Edgeworth: Hmm... That one... I'm not sure. Kay: What!? You don't know!? Edgeworth: (As far as I can recall, I've never seen a flower like this before. But I feel as though I've seen this shape somewhere before...) Steel Samurai Edgeworth: There's that troublemaker, standing there smack in the center making two peace signs. Kay: Wow, the Steel Samurai stands out even more than the two ambassadors in this picture! Oh, hey! The person playing the Steel Samurai is one of your friends, right? Edgeworth: ..................No, I have no idea who he is. Kay: Wait! But you just said \"he\"! You knew which gender he was, so you MUST know him, right!? Edgeworth: I beg that you please refrain from talking about that person with me ever again. Colias Palaeno's face Kay: Mr. Palaeno has a really great smile, don't you think!? I bet he was really happy that they were going to become Cohdopia again! Edgeworth: Perhaps... But instead, he became the greatest victim in today's case. An ambassador like him who is always thinking of his country is really to be admired. Kay: Yeah. Although this happened, I hope they'll be able to reunite the country someday. Edgeworth: I hope so as well, but for that to happen, we need to solve this case first. We need to see to it that those who would harm the new Cohdopia are locked away. Kay: And we will! Colias Palaeno's bouquet Edgeworth: Hmm... It seems that lilies are at the center of this bouquet, with an accent of chamomile. Kay: Wow... I can totally smell the wonderful fragrance! Edgeworth: Kay... this is just a picture. Kay: Argh! Look, I know that! But it's nice to imagine things once in a while, ya know? Where's your sense of empathy!? Edgeworth: If you can smell the fragrance of flowers from a photo, that's more like a \"hallucination\". Kay: ! Y-You don't have to be mean about it... Edgeworth: Hmph... Let's just drop this before it's in full bloom. Deduce Quercus Alba's bouquet (after examining Quercus Alba's bouquet) Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Present Allebahstian Knife Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Babahl's national symbol is the butterfly, and Allebahst's is the flower...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Could this piece of evidence be related to this photo somehow? Kay: Huh? Well... Nope! I don't think it's related at all! Edgeworth: (Even though I know she's right, she could have at least tried to humor me a little.) Leads back to examination of photo Edgeworth: Babahl's national symbol is the butterfly, and Allebahst's is the flower... It would appear that someone is employing the old \"hide a tree in a forest\" trick. Kay: What are you mumbling to yourself about...? Wait, what? The handle on this knife... Aaaaaah! Edgeworth: Yes, it's the handle that was supposed to be on the blade that killed Mr. Coachen. The weapon that killed him was carried through the Theatrum Neutralis... ...in the very bouquet Ambassador Alba was carrying! Commemorative Photo data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Hm? The flower motif... It looks like one of the flower petals is missing. Kay: Ooh! And take a look at the weapon itself! It's missing the exact same petal! Edgeworth: Then the knife in this photo is most definitely the same as this murder weapon. Allebahstian Knife data updated in my Organizer. Photo (after correctly deducing Quercus Alba's bouquet) Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Quercus Alba's bouquet Edgeworth: It appears to be a bouquet of Persian cyclamens and roses. Kay: Wow! You even know the exact species!? I never would've figured you for an expert on flowers! Edgeworth: Nnnnngh... (It's all because of those flowers that old lady sends me every month... Just look at me; I sound like some sort of botanist!) Window by right door Edgeworth: You can see the Babahlese Embassy, which is undergoing major renovations. From room expansions to garden upkeep, it looks like a lot of construction is going on. Kay: Mr. Palaeno said that all this work is really hard on him. He said that since Mr. Coachen passed away, that maybe I could work part-time for him. Edgeworth: (She got really chummy with that ambassador...) Kay: What can I say? I just have a good nose for money! Logic Connect \"Renovations\" and \"Coachen's counterfeiting op.\" Edgeworth: We know that the counterfeit bills were printed using the embassy's press... ...but the necessary materials, such as the Babahlese ink and paper... ...must have been hidden in a secure location. But what do you think would've happened if the renovation had begun? Kay: Well, he probably had to find a better hiding place, or get rid of it all. Edgeworth: Right, so we can assume that the renovation was the cause of the plate and bills disposal. And the reason Mr. Coachen was killed as the \"ringleader\" of the smuggling operation. ...Based on what we know, who do you think was the one with the most to gain? Colias Palaeno Edgeworth: The answer is Ambassador Palaeno. Kay: Y-You really think so!? But he was the one who had his embassy's offices burned down... ...and he lost his secretary. Do you really think he profited from any of that? Edgeworth: Hmm... Now that you mention it, perhaps not... (She's right... Ambassador Palaeno has gained absolutely nothing from the events of tonight. With that being the case, there really is only one man who gained from everything!) Leads back to: \"...Based on what we know, who do you think was the one with the most to gain?\" Manny Coachen Edgeworth: The answer is Mr. Coachen himself. Kay: Umm... He was the smuggling ring's boss, right? So maybe he had a lot to gain because of all the money...? But in the end, he was killed... It's kind of sad, really. Edgeworth: Hmm... I suppose there is some truth in that. (No matter how much he may have profited in life, he really didn't gain much in his death. With that being the case, there really is only one man who gained from everything!) Leads back to: \"...Based on what we know, who do you think was the one with the most to gain?\" Quercus Alba Leads to: \"It's the one person who has been erasing all evidence of the smuggling operation...\" Edgeworth: It's the one person who has been erasing all evidence of the smuggling operation... ...from both embassies, the co-conspirator who is mopping up, Ambassador Alba. Ambassador Alba had a very strong motive to kill Manny Coachen (Motive to kill Coachen - Alba could conveniently place all of the guilt for the smuggling onto Coachen.)! Connect \"Agitated Alba\" and \"Motive to kill Coachen\" Edgeworth: The cause of Ambassador Alba's agitation, the \"rotten\" treasure we may find... ...and the motive for killing Mr. Coachen... Ms. Yew said it herself that she didn't kill anyone tonight. If we were to take her words at face value... ...then the reason for the ambassador's nervousness can only be one thing. He didn't want us to discover the real circumstances under which Mr. Coachen was killed. Kay: Then you mean, Ambassador Alba is the real killer? But I thought the two of them were friends? Edgeworth: Maybe they were, but what if Mr. Coachen was the one who first betrayed their friendship? Kay: Oh, I get it! Wasn't Mr. Coachen pushing really hard for Mr. Palaeno... ...to be ambassador after the reunification? Edgeworth: Yes, and that was the real reason why he wanted to steal Allebahst's Primidux Statue. Kay: So Mr. Coachen hired DeMasque II to go steal it for him... ...but when Ambassador Alba found out what he was up to, he killed Mr. Coachen? Edgeworth: It is definitely a possibility at this point. Kay: Those two really were thinking of no one but themselves. But the question now is \"how did he do it?\" Ambassador Alba was in Allebahst... ...but Mr. Coachen's body was discovered in Babahl, right? Edgeworth: Right. And that is what we must solve next. Partner Talk The investigation Kay: We've come too far to give up! We must expose Ambassador Alba's misdeeds, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes, of course. Kay: And we've gotta find a way to steal the truth and get it out there... for my father's sake! Edgeworth: ...Yes, and we will. (The reason for Ambassador Alba's nervousness must still be here somewhere. Furthermore, I need to pin down exactly what happened in here... I'll start by thoroughly examining this room for any information I can find.) Agitated Alba? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! If you don't pay attention, Ambassador Alba is gonna get away! Edgeworth: Y-Yes, I know. Kay: Now hurry up and do that *schwing!* thing you always do! Edgeworth: I have no idea what you are talking about... Kay: What!? You don't!? Oh, come on, you know what I'm talking about! That thing you do! Edgeworth: ...Are you talking about \"Logic\"...? Kay: Yes! That's it! So hurry up and let's *schwing!* already! Edgeworth: A-Alright, alright... (To be honest, it's been a bit hard to connect everything up until now by just looking. However, I should be able to piece things together if I take another look at my leads. Perhaps now is the time to use logic and reason my way to the truth!) Present Video Tape Kay: Uncle Badd entrusted you with this piece of evidence, Mr. Edgeworth. I think he believes that you're the one who will finally bring the truth to light. Edgeworth: ......... Kay: And I believe in you, too, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Kay... After connecting all possible Logic and correctly deducing Quercus Alba's bouquet in photo: Edgeworth: I believe we now understand... ...why Ambassador Alba was so nervous and agitated. It must have something to do with where Mr. Coachen was killed. A place where the Allebahstian ambassador was likely to meet the Babahlese Mr. Coachen. The place where Ambassador Alba happened to have committed the murder is...? Present Theatrum Neutralis Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The only place that makes sense is here, at the Theatrum Neutralis.\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This area is rather suspicious, don't you think? Kay: You really think so? Because I don't see anything odd about it at all! Edgeworth: Nngh... (I guess it's not related after all...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! If you keep doing that, Ambassador Alba is going to get away! Come on! Let's see if we can't get a hold of that treasure known as the truth! Edgeworth: Agreed. Let's see what we can find. Leads back to: \"The place where Ambassador Alba happened to have committed the murder is...?\" Edgeworth: The only place that makes sense is here, at the Theatrum Neutralis. Kay: What? Here? Edgeworth: The goodwill event was being held here today, correct? So the only place that the both of them would have been in is here. Kay: But if that's the case, then everything changes. The theater isn't actually Allebahstian land... ...so that wipes out one of those extraterritorial rights he has! Edgeworth: It makes logical sense, in which case, it is a reason for us to investigate further. Kay: So what should we check out? Edgeworth: Let's see... I believe we should check the immigration records for both Allebahst and Babahl posthaste! Babahl's records should be easy to obtain, however, the problem will be Allebahst. I wonder if they would allow us to see their records, despite the order to vacate... Franziska: Franziska: I'm already one step ahead of you, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Franziska. Franziska: I have here, the security footage from both Allebahst and Babahl. You would do well to take a look at its contents. Security Footage data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: You move fast. Franziska: A Von Karma strives to be perfect in every way! It's not in my nature to keep on retreating like this. I took the liberty of looking over the Babahl investigation reports as well. From now on, you will make no excuse to back down or say that we can't solve this case! Edgeworth: Nngh... I'm sorry about earlier. Franziska: We won't be beaten. Because my cute little subordinate is going to try his very best, isn't he? Edgeworth: (Hasn't she patronized me enough already for a lifetime?) So this video contains footage from Allebahst's immigration screening area? Kay: I really hope there's something in here that we can use! Edgeworth: Which minute's footage should I examine? 5:21 PM Examine timestamp Edgeworth: 5:21 PM... Kay: That's just after the end of the Steel Samurai stage show. Edgeworth: Correct. Kay: We were still inside the theater itself at around this time. All because Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't get out of his seat. Edgeworth: Hmph. I wanted to show the actors my appreciation for a bit and soak in the atmosphere. Kay: Yeah, with your eyes closed and a complete lack of motion except for some breathing. Examine officer Franziska: This man is the immigration officer who was on duty. Kay: He's making a really scary face... even though there's no one around to see it. Franziska: I wonder if he's just the grumpy sort? Although, that wouldn't do much for tourism. Kay: Hey! He smiled a little just now! Franziska: I wonder if he recalled something funny? Kay: Well, even if he did, he still has that hard glare in his eyes. Edgeworth: It would appear that he was born with stern-looking eyes. Franziska: Rather fitting for someone in the security business, I'd say. Examine posters Kay: Ooh, I don't remember all these posters! I wonder what they're of? Edgeworth: Hmm, I do remember a bunch of these hanging in that hallway. Franziska: I believe they were all related to tourism and sightseeing. Edgeworth: In Allebahst? Impossible! If it were Babahl, I could believe that, however... Franziska: No, no. They were posters promoting tourist traps in this country! And I believe they were mostly of Gatewater Land. Edgeworth: I see. So they were targeted at the embassy's staff... Examine door Edgeworth: It's the door leading into the Theatrum Neutralis. Kay: I tried so hard to get through this door, you know, but I just couldn't get in. But it felt soooo great when I finally was allowed to go through there! You know what I really wanted to do, though? I wanted to try sneaking my way in! Edgeworth: (*sigh* At least nothing seems out of the ordinary with the door.) 5:22 PM Examine timestamp Edgeworth: 5:22 PM. At around this time, the Steel Samurai stage show had come to an end... ...and Ambassador Alba was making his way back to his office. Kay: And then later, he shook hands with the Steel Samurai in his office... ...and then, he was going to give a speech in the rose garden. Being an ambassador sounds like a busy, busy job! It's like someone is always stealing your time away! Edgeworth: Yes, I'd imagine it's something like that. (But despite how busy he was, he still managed to find the time to kill Mr. Coachen... ...and move his body somehow from the Theatrum Neutralis.) Examine officer Franziska: This man is the immigration officer who was on duty. Kay: He's making the exact same scary face that he was making a minute ago! Wait. Is it just me, or is he blushing? Franziska: It appears that he gets flustered around the ambassador. Kay: I guess the ambassador's well-respected inside Allebahst, too. Edgeworth: You could say that. The guard doesn't appear to be capable of looking at the ambassador. Examine posters Franziska: Those are posters of this country's tourist spots, though most are of Gatewater Land. Kay: I wonder if Allebahstians in general like theme parks at all? Franziska: The guard who stopped you has been to Gatewater Land a number of times, apparently. Kay: I guess they don't have theme parks in Allebahst, huh? Examine Quercus Alba Edgeworth: I can't believe how completely fooled I was by the way he carried himself. Franziska: He had me fooled, too... According to the files I had sent for earlier, Ambassador Alba... ...was a Cohdopian hero. He saved the royal family from danger countless times. So what bothers me is why would a man like that create a smuggling ring...? Even with all the authority I have, I still haven't been able to figure out why. Edgeworth: (It sounds like the ambassador was a hero who was corrupted by evil. But no matter what happened in the past, we can't let the man he is now escape justice!) Examine door Edgeworth: It's the door leading into the Theatrum Neutralis. Kay: The more the guy tried to keep me out, the more I wanted to get in! It's human nature! But I guess I can't complain too much. I did get let inside in the end. Edgeworth: (*sigh* At least nothing seems out of the ordinary with the door.) 5:23 PM Examine cart Leads to: \"Doesn't something about this lump's shape strike you as odd?\" Examine timestamp Edgeworth: 5:23 PM... This is just after the end of the Steel Samurai stage show... ...and after I had been given that autograph. Kay: You totally had stars in your eyes at that time, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: I-I most certainly did not! Franziska: You had stars in your eyes because of an autograph you received from that man...? Miles Edgeworth... You've just lost any respect I had left for you. Edgeworth: (I believe it's time to change the subject.) Examine officer Edgeworth: It appears that he is inspecting the person coming into the country. Kay: Are you kidding!? It's more like he's NOT checking the Steel Samurai! Hmph! And then they gave me such a hard time! Edgeworth: Hmm... There ARE certain risks involved when you give some people preferential treatment. Examine posters Edgeworth: There certainly is a variety of posters on this wall. Kay: It's kinda hard to see what's written on them, so they just look festive, you know? Franziska: Those are all tourism posters for this country, although most are of Gatewater Land. Kay: I wonder if any Allebahstians actually go to Gatewater Land for fun? It's just really hard to imagine them hanging out there. Edgeworth: True, they do seem to be a nation of extremely serious people... Examine Steel Samurai Edgeworth: On the outside, he may look like the Steel Samurai, but on the inside, it's just Larry. Franziska: Other than the fact that it's that good-for-nothing, nothing else seems out of order. Edgeworth: Wait. You know as well as I that anything can happen if he's involved. Franziska: You're not suggesting that someone else could be under that mask, are you? Edgeworth: No, I don't think that. Just before he entered here, he gave me an autograph, so I'm certain it's Larry under there. Examine door Edgeworth: It's the door connecting that hallway and this theater. Nothing appears to be out of the ordinary. Franziska: Indeed. Edgeworth: Doesn't something about this lump's shape strike you as odd? Kay: Huh? Isn't it supposed to be this shape? Edgeworth: No, there is clearly something odd about the bulge. If only we had the pushcart itself, we could compare and confirm my hunch... Pushcart data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Next, let us check the footage from Babahl's security camera. Kay: I hope it shows us something good. ...Phooey. There wasn't a single sign of a suspicious person or anything. Edgeworth: That, right there, is the contradiction. Kay: Huh? Did I miss something? Edgeworth: You didn't miss anything... because there was nothing to miss. However, what IS missing is the image of Mr. Coachen entering his own country. Kay: But wasn't his body found in Babahl? Edgeworth: It would appear that the true face of our final puzzle has finally revealed itself. Investigation Complete Edgeworth: ! Ambassador Alba...! Alba: I thought I had asked for you and your group to vacate the premises, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Actually, I thought I should let you know that this theater sits on my country's soil. Alba: You've had your fun, and I've enjoyed our little game. I dare say that you've even achieved a new high score. However, once you've recorded a score, that same game can never be replayed again. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Your game is done, and it's game over. Edgeworth: No...! Franziska: Franziska: Where do you think you're going at this time of night? Alba: After admitting to my crime, I was overcome with regret. So I am heading to the airport now to return home. Edgeworth: I'm afraid I can't let you do that. There are still too many issues we need to discuss with you. Alba: You can't stop me, Mr. Edgeworth, and you know it. Edgeworth: Arngh...! ???: Palaeno: Please, may I have a little bit of your time, Ambassador Alba? Alba: Ambassador Palaeno...! Palaeno: Even just a teeny-tiny bit is fine with me. The already strained relationship between our countries is in a precarious situation, you know. Alba: .........Very well. If you insist. I will play just one more round with them, and see what they want. .........Not that they'll get any farther. Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno... Palaeno: Mr. Edgeworth... All I wish for is the normalization of relationships between our two countries. But there is one person standing in the way of that dream. I... I believe in you. You'll do what's right. Edgeworth: ...Thank you for your vote of confidence. Alba: Now then, what was it you wanted to ask me about? I do have a flight to catch, after all. So I'm afraid I'm going to have to limit you to just one question. Edgeworth: That's more than enough, because I only have one question anyway. I want to hear your alibi, about how you couldn't have killed Mr. Manny Coachen! Alba: Ho! I see... You seem to have a good hand this time around. This should be fun. Edgeworth: (This really is the very last chance we have to bring him down. I won't allow even an atom-sized contradiction to slip by!) Testimony -- Ambassador Alba's Alibi -- Alba: Frankly, I still don't understand why I am being placed under suspicion here. Under your hypothetical scenario, Mr. Coachen and I were fellow smugglers. But to get to the point, I was in Allebahst the whole time. So, it's simply not possible for me to have killed him in Babahl. That is my alibi. Edgeworth: ...So that is your alibi? Alba: That is correct. It's simply not possible for me to have committed a crime in Babahl. Now that we cleared that up, I'd appreciate it if you would move out of my way. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I said, \"Hold it!\" Alba: What is it this time? I thought I told you I'd only allow one question. Edgeworth: Hmph... You did, but you still have yet to really answer my one question. Alba: What...? Edgeworth: Until you tell us the truth... I will refuse to budge an inch from where I'm standing! Alba: Hmph... Very well. I'll play with you just a little longer. Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! As my subordinate, and representative of this country's prosecutors... ...you are forbidden to lose! Edgeworth: Of course. That is something I've understood from the start. Kay: ...That guy's the one who... ordered my father killed, isn't he? Edgeworth: ...Yes, I believe so. Kay: The goal of the first Yatagarasu was the capture of the smuggling ring's leader. My father and Uncle Badd... Their legacy will live on... through me! So that's why we've just got to catch him, OK!? Edgeworth: We will. I promise. Now, Ambassador Alba, let's have at the truth now, shall we!? Alba: Heh heh heh... No matter how many times you ask, my answer remains the same. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Being the leader of a smuggling ring while taking on the duties of ambassadorship... Don't you think that the combination is more than enough reason for suspicion? Then there is the matter of the crossbow arrows and the Primidux Statues... Alba: Alba: All of that is nothing more than your flights of fancy. Edgeworth: What do you mean by that!? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It's not a hypothesis! Earlier, we proved it to be what happened. Alba: Ha ha ha... Well, let's leave that to one side for now. Because it doesn't change the fact that I have no motive. Edgeworth: Oh? So you really had no reason to kill Mr. Coachen? Alba: If you want to suppose I had one, then why not. I'll indulge you. After all, this is nothing more than a silly game to me. Edgeworth: Even if that's how you see things, I'd appreciate it if you would take me seriously. Alba: Gwah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haaa! Ahem, I'm sorry. I suppose you are in a bit of a pickle. Very well. A game is no fun if the playing field isn't level. Therefore, I formally claim that I had no motive to kill. Now, let's see you disprove it. Edgeworth: (How can he stand there looking proud when he knows he killed another human being? Well, I'm not going to stand by and just watch him get away with his crimes!) Adds statement \"In that case, what motive would I have had to kill my co-conspirator?\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you serious that just because you were partners, that you had no motive to kill? Alba: I'm only following your hypothetical scenario to its logical conclusion. Haaa ha ha ha ha! Kay: Looks like he's not going to admit it himself that he was in league with Mr. Coachen. Edgeworth: I suppose not. But I do know his relation to the smuggling ring, and to Mr. Coachen. Kay: You mean, he's the ringleader, and that Mr. Coachen was his subordinate, right? Edgeworth: Correct, but I know more than just that. Ms. von Karma, I'm sure you remember the safe in Mr. Coachen's office, correct? Franziska: Yes... The safe had two compartments to it, didn't it? Edgeworth: Yes, and why do you think those stolen goods were being stored in Mr. Coachen's office? Could it be because he was trying to cheat Ambassador Alba behind his back? Franziska: So Mr. Coachen didn't turn the goods over, but decided instead to keep them for himself? I suppose that's possible. Edgeworth: Hmm, it seems to me that both men were only concerned with their own wealth and wellbeing. Kay: Then that means that maybe they didn't have a trusting relationship after all. Edgeworth: What Ambassador Alba had to gain... I believe that is his motive for killing Mr. Coachen! Alba: ...What are you people whispering about amongst yourselves over there? Edgeworth: Ah, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. Now then, let's continue with your testimony! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And what exactly did you do while you were in Allebahst? Alba: I had a meeting with the Steel Samurai, and then I arranged a few files. Around that time, that thief who was sneaking in took me by surprise. Franziska: Franziska: Are you saying that it was DeMasque II that made the first move!? Alba: Yes, and it was after I was attacked that I hit him on the head with the Primidux Statue. Unfortunately, he died from the blow, but it was an act of justified self-defense. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Calling it that doesn't cover up what you really did! Alba: Ha ha ha ha ha. Cover up? No, my boy, I'm not covering up anything; I'm telling the truth! Franziska: You weren't planning to admit to it, which is why you tried to frame the Steel Samurai. If you weren't an ambassador, I'd be letting my whip fly loose on you right now...! Alba: I am terribly sorry that I didn't clean up the body better, but I am a busy man. I had a speech to give in the rose garden after that, you know. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Yet despite that, you still had time to kill Mr. Coachen, didn't you? Alba: Alba: Heh heh heh... Man is evil, and I'm sure you are familiar with the facts, but... ...Mr. Coachen was killed in Babahl while I was all the way in Allebahst. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You insist that it's not possible for you to have killed Mr. Coachen in Babahl... ...and you are correct. Alba: Oh? I thought you would put up a bit more of a fight, but if you must concede to me... Edgeworth: The only thing I am conceding is that it's not possible for you to kill him in Babahl. I am NOT conceding that your alibi is the truth! Alba: Oh... I see. However, no matter how you try, know that you can't crush my alibi. Edgeworth: ...Hmph. You would be wise not to underestimate a prosecutor of this country. Alba: ...Heh, we'll see about that. Edgeworth: So Mr. Coachen was a \"friend\" of Ambassador Alba... Kay: If that's true, then why did the ambassador kill him? It's not like in the case of my father where he ordered someone to do it... Franziska: The problem we have here is we don't know what their exact relationship was. Edgeworth: Indeed. If they had complete trust in each other, then there is no motive for murder. (However, both men were very selfish, and I believe that is from where his motive arose.)Alba: The last time I met with Mr. Coachen was here at the Theatrum Neutralis. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You met with the victim here? Alba: I was watching the Steel Samurai, as was Mr. Coachen, who was sitting nearby. Franziska: I've been meaning to ask, why invite the Steel Samurai as a guest for an embassy event? Alba: I like Steel Samurai Daddy, so I asked for him to be at the event. Edgeworth: .........I see. (So it was by Ambassador Alba's request...) Alba: Now then, will that be all? Edgeworth: N-No, wait...! I'm not finished yet...! Alba: Alba: You're not very good at listening, are you? I told you I don't have the time to listen to a bunch of useless questions. Edgeworth: Ack...! (The time remaining for me to find the truth has just been blown away...!) Present Commemorative Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I'd like you to take a look at this picture.\" Alba: After that, I was in Allebahst the rest of the time, as I stated earlier. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you have anyone who can testify that you never left Allebahst after that? Alba: Of course I do. I was in front of a large crowd to give my speech, wasn't I? Kay: I guess he's not lying about being in Allebahst the whole time. Edgeworth: Yes, as long as he is willing to admit to DeMasque II's murder, then I suppose so. Kay: But he keeps saying that it was justified self-defense... Oh! I get it! OK, so what if I were to pretend to be a real klutz (changed from [being all hollow and sunken] in the original release)... ...and then \"tripped\" into Mr. Medals really hard? That'd count as self-defense, right? (changed from [I run into a klutzy person? Could I call that self-defense?] in the original release) Edgeworth: That's not self-defense; that's just being careless. Kay: Well, you never know until you try! Edgeworth: ...I suggest that you don't. Especially since you've given me a statement of intent. Alba: Now then, will that be all? Edgeworth: N-No, wait...! I'm not finished yet...! Alba: Alba: You're not very good at listening, are you? I told you I don't have the time to listen to a bunch of useless questions. Edgeworth: Ack...! (The time remaining for me to find the truth has just been blown away...!) Alba: In any case, I did not see Mr. Coachen again after that. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you never saw Mr. Coachen again after you left this theater? Alba: That's correct. I'm an incredibly busy man, you know. So it's more likely that Mr. Coachen ran into Ambassador Palaeno. Edgeworth: Even now, you would push his murder on to someone else...!? Palaeno: How dare you!? Saying that I would kill Manny! Franziska: Ambassador Alba! I demand that you refrain from making baseless conjectures! Alba: I was merely offering a possibility. No, this won't do... I can already see this is turning into an international incident. Edgeworth: (Who exactly is pressing who here...? In any case, what I need to do I stay positive and forge on!) Alba: Now then, will that be all? Edgeworth: N-No, wait...! I'm not finished yet...! Alba: Alba: You're not very good at listening, are you? I told you I don't have the time to listen to a bunch of useless questions. Edgeworth: Ack...! (The time remaining for me to find the truth has just been blown away...!) Alba: So you see, there is no time span in which I could've killed him. Wouldn't you agree? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your alibi is that there was no time span in which you could've killed Mr. Coachen? Alba: Yes, because I was in the theater watching the stage show. Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth? Do you remember seeing him sitting in the audience? Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but I don't remember anything outside of what was going on on-stage. Franziska: You shouldn't have been so focused on the show, and paid attention to your surroundings! Palaeno: Mr. Edgeworth... It is a fact that Ambassador Alba came to the theater. But I guess you didn't know that because you didn't see him at the Steel Samurai show. Edgeworth: Well, I do recall that he and you had a photo shoot with the Steel Samurai... Alba: *sigh* It looks like you are finally beginning to understand. Now then, will that be all? Edgeworth: N-No, wait...! I'm not finished yet...! Alba: Alba: You're not very good at listening, are you? I told you I don't have the time to listen to a bunch of useless questions. Edgeworth: Ack...! (The time remaining for me to find the truth has just been blown away...!) Present Commemorative Photo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I'd like you to take a look at this picture.\" Edgeworth: Amazing. Diplomats really do know how to craft answers that don't answer anything. Kay: So if the only place he met the victim was at this theater... ...then when was he killed? Edgeworth: We know that Mr. Coachen didn't return to Babahl alive. Which means that the only time he could've been killed is when they were both here. Kay: And that means that he was planning to kill Mr. Coachen from the start. Edgeworth: I'd like you to take a look at this picture. Alba: It's a rather nice picture, isn't it? It was to commemorate the restoration of relations between our nations. Edgeworth: Oh, it's commemorative, alright. One that captures the proof I need to show that it was you who committed the murder. Alba: Come again? Edgeworth: This is the knife that killed Mr. Coachen. Alba: ! Edgeworth: I see you recognize it, as well you should, for it was you who brought it to this theater. You hid it in among the flowers you were to give to the Steel Samurai! Meaning that you killed Manny Coachen here, at the theater! Alba: Grr...rrr...rrrrrnnngh... Gwah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! .........It's time for me to catch my flight. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: We're not through yet! Alba: Alba: It's game over for you, Mr. Edgeworth. But I thank you for the entertainment. Edgeworth: Nnrgh...! Alba: No matter how passionately you orate, the end result will still be the same. I won't be returning to this country ever again. Edgeworth: (That's right... This man is an ambassador... and he has extraterritorial rights! No matter how hard we chase after him, we won't be able to have him tried in court!) Alba: Yes, that's exactly the face you should be making. The face of a worthless cur. Edgeworth: Nnn... Nnngghhoooooooh! Alba: Now then, ladies and gentlemen, I must bid you farewell. Edgeworth: Nnrgh.........! Edgeworth: (I... The courts... Is there no one who can lay a finger on this man!? Is this really the end...?) Lang: Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Lang: Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Prosecutor! Alba: Get out of my way. My plane is scheduled to take off soon. Lang: Sorry, but you're not going anywhere... Mr. Alba. Alba: I'm through playing games with you people. You can't touch me. If you do, it would spark an international incident, Agent Lang. Lang: .........Sorry, but no, it wouldn't. Alba: What? Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Good job holding the fort down here until I got back. Edgeworth: Hm...? Lang: So, Mr. Alba. Your diplomatic immunity... has just been revoked. Alba: What do you mean \"revoked\"? Spare me this nonsense and let me through. Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Before aiming for the throat, chew the neck shield off first.\" Interpol headquarters and the imperial household of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...took a while to get things rolling, but they finally moved on it. Alba: The imperial household...? You...! What have you done!? Lang: You have been relieved of your duties as ambassador, Mr. Alba. Alba: Wh... Edgeworth: Wh... Franziska: Wh... Alba: Whhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Lang: Effective today, effective right now! And you have Mr. Prosecutor's video tape to thank for this! Kay: The video the Yatagarasu protected...!? Lang: You can't be arrested simply because you're an ambassador? In that case, I thought I'd strip you of that title. You underestimated me, a descendant of the founder of detainment philosophy, Lang Zi. Four thousand years of deeply entrenched connections and networks around the world... ...have really paid off. Alba: It can't be... I don't believe this... My ambassadorship... has been revoked.........!? Lang: Haa ha ha ha! Looks like you're finally coming to grips with your new standing. Kay: Whoo-hoo! Looks like he's turned docile again! Edgeworth: He's probably in shock from the loss of his \"shield\". Franziska: Hmph... What a shame. I had so wanted to use my whip on him! Alba: Why is this happening to me? I'm just a hard-working, honest ambassador... Lang: Lang: Do you really think you can still pull that on us now? We've already ripped away the mask and seen you for who you really are, Mr. Alba! Alba: ...Gnnn... Gwooo.........ooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Alba: Alba: No... I won't be stopped now! Edgeworth: ! (He still intends to fight us!?) Alba: So what if I am no longer an ambassador? You still don't have any evidence on me! The fact remains that you cannot arrest me! Lang: Heh, I'd expected no less from you, the boss of the smuggling ring. Well, the rest is up to you, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: Understood! Alba: Heh heh heh heh... You say that I killed Mr. Coachen in the theater. But even if it's true that there was a knife in my bouquet... ...I left that bouquet in the theater. So anyone could've taken it out from there and used it, right? Besides, the claim that he was killed here itself is odd. After all, wasn't his body discovered in Babahl? Are you claiming that I carried his body all the way over there? Hmph, preposterous! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'll be the one to prove whether it's preposterous or not. Alba: Gnrk...! Edgeworth: Ex-Ambassador Alba, are you ready? Because this is no game. This is war! Testimony -- Alba's Alibi, Pt. 3 -- Alba: I killed Mr. Coachen in this theater using a knife that was stuck in my bouquet? I left that bouquet in the theater! Anyone could've taken the knife from there! Besides, Mr. Coachen's body was discovered in Babahl, right? There is no way for me to have transported his body from the theater to Babahl! Alba: Look, don't you think you've had enough fun with me? You've already stolen my ambassadorship from me. Would you have me surrender, too? Lang: Lang: You have no plans to ever return to this country, isn't that right? Alba: .........! Lang: Did you know that a bunch of your subordinates are seeking asylum because of you!? Alba: ...Ha ha ha. As if I care, Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! Boot this guy out of the embassy, and we can finally end everything. Edgeworth: I know, and I will give it my all to see that he leaves in handcuffs. Without the title of \"ambassador\", he is just another witness! Franziska: Yes... Just another witness. Kay: Alright! What are we waiting for! Let's get this guy! Lang: And get him good! Edgeworth: (I wonder if they understand that all I can do is present evidence to the testimony...?) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That's right. As I explained earlier... ...the commemorative photo shows that you had the knife on your personage. Alba: Alba: You have no proof that the bouquet was prepared by me, isn't that right? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Alba: The fact that there was a knife in the bouquet... was something I wasn't aware of. Lang: Lang: What a pathetic excuse! The weapon that was used is one of your national treasures! It isn't exactly something anyone other than you could touch, let alone take! Alba: I allowed some of my trusted subordinates to handle them. It could've been my secretary. Lang: You... You're an even bigger slime ball than I'd thought...! Edgeworth: You would push the guilt of Mr. Coachen's murder onto one of your subordinates!? Alba: Hmph. In any case, the fact that the knife was in the bouquet means nothing! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You still wish to deny your actions!? Alba: And you still wish to deny reality and accuse me of murder? Edgeworth: What!? I am not in denial! Kay: Arngh! Even though he's not an ambassador anymore, he's still got a real bad attitude! Franziska: I believe it's BECAUSE he's no longer ambassador that he can let himself speak freely. Kay: Well, if he's not holding anything back, then neither should I! Edgeworth: Wait! For the sake of the case, please refrain from what I think you're about to do! Alba: Ah, quite the pair of frightening women you are, but I digress. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Even if he was found in Babahl, he was killed somewhere else! Alba: Alba: Stop bluffing, because you can't prove what you're claiming. If this were a court-martial in my country, you'd have already been removed from the room. Lang: Are you taunting us on purpose, because I'd be happy to show you my claws! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hold on, Agent Lang! Allow me to fight him my way... with evidence! Lang: Ha ha ha! I was just joking. I'm not so easily ruffled by the likes of him! Alba: Too bad. Though I'm no longer an ambassador, it still could've been an international incident. Edgeworth: If you have the will to threaten us with that mouth of yours... ...then perhaps you can use it to return to the testimony. Alba: Very well... But to be fair, you should watch what you say as well. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is that really so? You could've easily blackmailed your subordinates to be quiet and then moved the body. Alba: Alba: That's quite an insult to me and my subordinates, and I'm afraid we can't have that! It's very difficult to enter my embassy, as the guards always conduct a thorough check. If someone so much as makes an unnatural movement, it would arouse their suspicions. Franziska: Come to think of it, there wasn't anything unnatural about him in the footage. Edgeworth: Nngh......... (Wait... Let me think about that for a second. Mr. Alba said that the guard would become suspicious if someone acted unnaturally. But then, by the same token... ...the guard would not become suspicious if someone were to act naturally!) Edgeworth: If we re-trace Mr. Alba's movements, we should find some hint to solving this case. Kay: Well, right after the Steel Samurai stage show, he went back to Allebahst, right? Lang: From there, he started preparing for his speech in the Allebahstian Embassy. Franziska: It DOES sound like it wasn't possible for him to have gone to the Babahlese Embassy. Edgeworth: (He couldn't have gone to Babahl, but the body didn't remain at the theater either. Is it possible that the body was temporarily taken to a different location first?)Alba: After I returned to Allebahst, I had my picture taken with the Steel Samurai, shaking hands. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So why was it only with the Steel Samurai? I thought the Pink Princess was also around? Alba: The Pink Princess was suffering from a bad hip at the time... ...and the doctors recommended that she rest. Kay: Wow! So you DO have a soft side after all! Alba: The pain of a bad hip... I suppose none of you can really understand how it feels. Kay: Oh, so you tend to strain your back as well, huh? Lang: But isn't that just because you're normally all hunched over? Edgeworth: (...He did need to keep up the act no matter what, I suppose.) Alba: Hmph... The point of this is not to discuss my back problems! ...For about 15 minutes after our handshake, I was in my office preparing for the speech. Alba: Then, just as I was about to start my speech, the Yatagarasu appeared. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That Yatagarasu was just a trick that you had set up! Alba: Ha ha ha. A most amusing joke. And how do you propose that I \"set it up\"? Edgeworth: If you really want to know, I can explain it in detail for you. You arranged the spotlights in the rose garden so that when you were to take the stage... ...the audience would see the Yatagarasu's \"shadow\". Alba: Oh? That is an interesting tale... Sadly, it has nothing to do with me. Lang: You...! What's it going to take for you to fess up to anything!? Edgeworth: Nngh...! Very well, then. Let's move on to a different question. After the Yatagarasu appeared, what was the state of the rose garden? Alba: Everyone took refuge inside the embassy. I even helped with the effort. And then, once everyone was inside, well... Alba: I feared for the national treasures, so I raced back to my office. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And what happened after you returned to your office? Alba: I don't want to keep on repeating this, however... ...upon my return, I had that stroke of bad luck and bumped into \"Mask Man\". Franziska: Franziska: ...And I don't want to keep on repeating this, either... ...but his name was \"DeMasque II\"! Alba: Hmph. Who cares what he was called!? By the time he got to the Primidux Statue that he was supposed to steal... ...it had already been swapped for the fake. Talk about an unlucky man... being bludgeoned to death with a fake statue! Heh heh heh... Franziska: ............... Kay: Ms. von Karma is really letting her whip fly now! Gumshoe: Eeeeeek! I think the scary part is her silence while she's doing it. Edgeworth: She must be at the limit of her patience as well... (But physical attacks are meaningless here... Only evidence will suffice.) Edgeworth: Arngh! I can't find a single contradiction! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... He's totally dead on the inside! Just like a hollow tree! Gumshoe: You're the only one that can cut him down to size, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Edgeworth: At this point in time, we lack the information require to fight back properly...! Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! You just say the word, and I'll get him talking for you. Franziska: Don't forget that we have plenty of ways to get him to talk. Gumshoe: We've got some real scary people on our side, huh, Kay? Kay: Well, I'm all ready to help out, Gummy! How about you!? Gumshoe: I can't believe even you're getting into this... In that case, I'm ready, too, sir! Edgeworth: Ack! Everyone please calm down! I-I'll think of something. After pressing all statements: Edgeworth: ............Gnrk! (I... I can't find a single flaw in his argument! At this rate, I won't be able to prove that he is actually guilty of anything!) Alba: Are we finished here? Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! Can you not come up with how the body was moved to Babahl!? Gumshoe: Sir...! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Lang: Grr... Even after proving so much... is he going to get away with it...!? Edgeworth: N...Nngh...! (Is this the end...?) ???: ???: It appears that we made it just in time...! Steel Samurai: It would be a great honor if you would allow us to be your allies in battle! Pink Princess: Evil Magistrate! It is time for you to pay! Kay: It's... the Steel Samurai? Steel Samurai: No, you are mistaken! For I am... ...Steel Samurai Daddy! Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo! And this is... ...Pink Princess Mommy! Oldbag: Edgey-poooooooo! Edgeworth: Nrghhhooooooooooh! (The two people that I wanted to see the least.........!) Laaaaaaaarryyyy...! What are you two doing here!? Larry: Way to show your gratitude, Edgey! We just wanted to help, yeesh! I'm gonna get the bad guy with a single thrust of my Samurai Spear... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Go away! Oldbag: How can you be so mean to us, Edgey-poo!? All three of us came to lend a hand, and this is how you treat us!? Franziska: Well, isn't this grand? And I see they managed to find the Iron Infant. Edgeworth: D-Does that really matter right now!? Kay: Hey...! Is it just me, or is the Iron Infant completely soaked? Larry: Hm? Oh, yeah. I found him in Babahl, but he was in the middle of the pool. Edgeworth: ...Wait a second! Larry, go back to what you just said. Larry: Huh? Oh, umm... It appears that we made it... Edgeworth: Not that far back! Something about finding the Iron Infant in Babahl...? (And he found it in a pool? I don't recall there being one in Babahl...) Larry: Oh! THAT! Well, I was in Allebahst the whole time... ...so I have no idea how the Iron Infant wound up in Babahl! I thought I had lost him in the rose garden... ...but I guess maybe this cute kid can swim, huh? Edgeworth: Wait, what? Larry! You lost the Iron Infant in the rose garden? Are you sure about that? Larry: Yeah, I'm sure! But I found him in... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That's enough, Larry! (The Iron Infant that Larry lost managed to move between the two countries. Furthermore, the Iron Infant was found soaked in the middle of a pool? This is what I've been looking for; it's another smuggling route between the countries!) The key to the route the Iron Infant took to travel from Allebahst to Babahl is... the Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: (Is it not the Yatagarasu? No, wait... As Ms. Yew was the Yatagarasu... ...it's very unlikely that the Yatagarasu is the key. In that case, how exactly was the Iron Infant smuggled across country lines...? This one thing is the only thing I can think of that can resolve the puzzle!) Leads back to: \"The key to the route the Iron Infant took to travel from Allebahst to Babahl is...\" bilateral symmetry. Leads to: \"Ah, that's right. This embassy was built with bilateral symmetry in mind!\" counterfeiting. Edgeworth: (In order to move the counterfeit bills that were printed in Babahl... ...someone must have made a secret route along which to transport it all. But wait... If there was [sic] such a route... ...Agent Lang and his men would've found it already during their investigation. In that case, there must be another secret smuggling route... ...and I must show the key to that other smuggling route!) Leads back to: \"The key to the route the Iron Infant took to travel from Allebahst to Babahl is...\" Edgeworth: (Ah, that's right. This embassy was built with bilateral symmetry in mind!) Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Y...Yes, sir! Edgeworth: There is a location I wish for you to examine posthaste! It is where I believe the route used to smuggle Mr. Coachen's body lies! Gumshoe: D-Does something like that really exist, sir!? Edgeworth: An embassy built on bilateral symmetry... meaning that this is where we need to examine! Present area between dividing wall and Babahlese Secretariat's Office Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Yes, sir! I'll be back before you know it!\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe... I would like for you to examine this location. Gumshoe: You got it, sir! Gumshoe: ...I'm back, sir! Edgeworth: Good, now report. Gumshoe: Sorry, but... there wasn't anything there, sir... Edgeworth: Wh-What!? (I was wrong...!?) Alba: Hmph hmph hmph hmph hmph... What's wrong? You couldn't find anything there, could you? Not one of your precious \"holes\", huh? Edgeworth: (Arngh...! I need to think about this calmly and rationally. The Iron Infant that Larry lost managed to move between the two countries. Furthermore, the Iron Infant was found soaked in the middle of a pool. So the location that Detective Gumshoe should be investigating... ...is here!) Leads back to: \"An embassy built on bilateral symmetry... meaning that this is where we need to examine!\" Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I'll be back before you know it! Alba: It's too late. It doesn't matter what you do, it's all a waste of time. Lang: Lang: You will stay here with us and wait. Alba: .........! Edgeworth: This is Edgeworth. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! It's here, sir! There is a reservoir here, just like the rose garden! Edgeworth: Just as I suspected...! Kay: What is it? Edgeworth: The two sides of this embassy are mirror images of each other. Which means that there is also a pool at the corresponding location on the Babahlese side. Mr. Coachen's body was moved into Babahl through the pool in Allebahst! Alba: Alba: Avoiding the topic with a vague answer like that is unbecoming of a prosecutor. If you don't mind, I'd like to see more physical proof, if you have any. Edgeworth: The Iron Infant is positively soaked in water. Why do you think that is? It's because he was fished out of a pool, and not just any pool; it was the Babahlese one. I think it's pretty obvious at this point what must be true. The water reservoirs in the two courtyards are connected! Alba: Alba: And where is your proof that the two sides are connected!? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The proof is right there before your eyes; the half-drowned Iron Infant! Alba: Wh...!? Th......This blasted dooooooooooll! Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! I'm back! H-Hey... Don't tell me... you guys figured everything out without me? Edgeworth: We did, thanks to this hero of justice's son. Even if he is just a doll, he managed to help foil the villain. Lang: Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Look, I don't want to say this, but... ...it's kinda unlikely that the body just happened to have passed on through to Babahl. This guy's a doll, and he's small, so I can believe it made it, but... Edgeworth: .........! (He has a point.) Alba: Heh... Heh heh heh. Yes, that's right. I'm glad someone here understands. Mr. Edgeworth, are you going to next propose that a dead body can swim through a pipe? Lang: You see, Mr. Prosecutor? Our chase after this man... ...is far from over! Edgeworth: Agent Lang...! Kay: Why is he helping Mr. Alba out now? Edgeworth: He's not. He realized a flaw in my argument, and is helping to move the logic along. (In which case......... I should return the favor and find an answer!) Lang: And another thing! Mr. Coachen's body was found in his office in Babahl. So what happened to his body after it was transported to the open-air stage? Edgeworth: Hmph... Mr. Alba had an accomplice in Babahl, remember? Lang: You mean... Shih-na, right? Edgeworth: With her there, you can see how it was possible to move the body up to the office. Alba: Alba: Are you seriously claiming that she swam through the connecting pipe with the body? Kay: He's right. Ms. Shih-na would drown if she did that! Edgeworth: (It's hard to imagine that she swam through the connecting pipe...) Alba: It looks like your hypothesis about how the body was moved is still only half-baked. In the end, it's all just the befuddled musings of an accusatory man. Now then, I believe you should give up and allow me passage. Because, from the start, there was no feasible method of transporting the body! Edgeworth: What!? Lang: .........Mr. Prosecutor. Recall Shih-na's movements. Edgeworth: Nngh.........! (What was happening in the embassy around the time Ms. Shih-na was in Babahl...?) Kay: Ooh... if only there was a way to get rid of the water in the pool... Edgeworth: (Get rid of the water...? Aha! That's it!) Alba: Now, I believe this time we really are done, right? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph... Unfortunately for you, it's far from over, Mr. Alba! Alba: You are a most persistent man. Are you saying that you've thought of a way to move the body through the water? Edgeworth: Move the body through the water? That is completely unrelated to how it was done. Alba: Excuse me? Edgeworth: The reason I say that is because... there wasn't any water there at the time! Lang: What do you mean, \"there wasn't any water\"...? Edgeworth: Just what it sounds like. Tonight's events made it possible to drain the water, allowing the body to be moved! Present Fires in Babahl Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Tonight, the Yatagarasu set fire to a variety of locations in the Babahlese Embassy.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Alba: ............ What is the meaning of this? Kay: What is that supposed to prove? Edgeworth: Yes! What is this supposed to be, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Huh? Me!? I, uh, have no idea, sir! Alba: Mr. Edgeworth, that question was directed at you. Edgeworth: (Arngh! It would appear that I presented the wrong piece of evidence.) Alba: It would seem that you didn't hear me just now, so let's try it again, shall we? Edgeworth: Alright, and I'll prove it to you with the evidence! Leads back to: \"Tonight's events made it possible to drain the water, allowing the body to be moved!\" Edgeworth: Tonight, the Yatagarasu set fire to a variety of locations in the Babahlese Embassy. In order to put the fires out, much of the reservoir's water was used. Of course, when the water was used, the reservoir's water level went down... If enough water was drained, the connecting pipe could be used to traverse the border! Alba: Alba: Hmph... So what!? The water level went down? The reservoirs were connected? Does any of this matter? You can't prove any of this! Edgeworth: Hmph... Pretending to be ignorant won't work with me. We both know what kind of situation we're in right now. Even in a game, there comes a critical, game-changing moment. A moment in which you hit a wall that you must overcome in order to beat the game. Alba: I haven't lost yet. Edgeworth: I've found the route you used to smuggle the body, and that route will lead to your defeat! Lang: Lang: Even if all the water was used by the fire fighting effort... ...you still can't really call that a smuggling route. Edgeworth: .........Hmph. I know that. Lang: Ha ha ha! I should've figured that you would notice. Hey, Mr. Alba, how deep are those pools, anyway? Alba: Heh heh heh heh. I'll have you know those pools are extremely deep. And there are no ladders or footholds along the walls, either. Lang: It would be difficult for Shih-na to hold the body and climb up out of the pool... Edgeworth: Hmph. Ladders or footholds along the walls? There was no need for such things. Alba: What do you mean? Edgeworth: If one were to use a certain something, they could go up or down in the pool at will. Lang: Oh? It looks like you've got an answer already. Well? What are you waiting for, Mr. Prosecutor? Enlighten us already! Edgeworth: (The way in which Ms. Shih-na and the body were able to rise up to ground level... If there was a way to control the water level, that could be the way the body was moved!) This was used so that the body and Ms. Shih-na could move up and down in the pool! Present Fountain Spouts Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Mr. Alba used the fountain spouts, in a manner of speaking.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This, Mr. Alba, is what you used! Alba: ...I don't recall ever using that. Lang: ...I don't think that's really applicable, do you, Mr. Prosecutor? Franziska: ...I don't understand how you think at all, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Arngh! (It would appear that I was wrong...) I beg your pardon... Please allow me to present you with another piece of evidence. Leads back to: \"This was used so that the body and Ms. Shih-na could move up and down in the pool!\" Edgeworth: Mr. Alba used the fountain spouts, in a manner of speaking. Lang: He used the fountain spouts...? How so? Edgeworth: The water level in the pools can be controlled by opening and closing the spouts. Ms. Shih-na and the body were lifted upward by their buoyancy in water. The fire on the Babahlese side, and the fire fighting effort... These were set in motion all for the sake of smuggling Mr. Coachen's body! Alba: .........Gnnnnnnrk! Edgeworth: Shall I show you where the final destination of my train of logic leads!? First, Mr. Alba closed the fountain spouts in advance, in preparation of things to come. Then, he took the pushcart that was brought to the rose garden... and pushed it, along with the Iron Infant and Mr. Coachen's body, into the pool. At this time, Ms. Shih-na was busy conveniently starting the first fire in Babahl. She then made for the open-air stage's pool to wait for the fire fighting effort to begin. When the firefighters used the water in that pool, the water level went down... ...and by the time the fire was put out, the pipe between the two pools was exposed. This is when she pushed the pushcart from Allebahst into Babahl. Once that was accomplished, Mr. Alba simply opened the fountain spouts once more... ...and the water level rose up to its original level, along with Ms. Shih-na and the body. After that, Ms. Shih-na used the pushcart to carry the body up to the secretariat's office. There is an elevator in the embassy, after all. So you see... ...even with her small frame, she could've easily transported Mr. Coachen's body. And that wraps up my thorough explanation of how the body was moved! Alba: Gnnn... Gnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooo! Edgeworth: Hmph. Well, Ex-Ambassador Alba? What do you think? Not so untouchable without your precious extraterritorial rights to protect you, are you? Kay: I knew you could do it, Mr. Edgeworth! Way to fight back! Alba: Alba: You accuse me of moving the body across country lines...! But when you get down to the nitty-gritty, you don't have what it takes to indict me! Kay: The \"nitty-gritty\"...? What does the old man want now? Edgeworth: Proof... I believe is what he seeks. Alba: Yes. Proof. Without any, who is to say whether or not any of what you said really happened? Kay: He wants proof? What are we going to do, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: There is no need to worry. I've had all the proof we need all along. (The body wasn't the only thing to go through the pools' connecting pipe tonight. Just as Detective Gumshoe found the pushcart in the open-air stage area... ...so, too, did I find one other item there. And that piece of evidence is what will prove that the pools were the smuggling route!) This was another thing that was smuggled over to Babahl's open-air stage area! Present Pick Edgeworth: Leads to: \"...And what exactly is this?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is the defining piece of evidence that will prove my hypothesis! Alba: Hmph! I don't think it proves a single thing! Edgeworth: Wh-What!? Alba: I think it's about time we put an end to this ridiculous farce of a \"trial\". If I'm not mistaken, all you're doing is trying to trick me with psychological gimmicks. Edgeworth: Arrrrngh! (If I continue on like this, Mr. Alba will find a way to worm his way out of this! The body wasn't the only thing to do through the pools' connecting pipe tonight. There was something else that was brought from the rose garden... ...through the open-air stage, and into the secretariat's office along with the body. Just as Detective Gumshoe found the pushcart in the open-air stage area... ...there must be a reason as to why that other item was there as well!) Leads back to: \"This was another thing that was smuggled over to Babahl's open-air stage area!\" Alba: ...And what exactly is this? Edgeworth: Hmph... You have no idea, do you? This little piece that I found on the Babahlese side will be your undoing. Alba: A guitar pick? Would you care to explain how that is going to \"do me in\", as it were? Edgeworth: Much to your chagrin, perhaps, but this is not a guitar pick. Alba: Wh...What...? Edgeworth: This is something I found at the open-air stage which was transported with the body. I naturally assumed that you would recognize it... since you took a photo with it, after all. But since you don't, allow me to show you what this fragment from the stage area (changed from [allow me [sic] fill you in on what I found at the stage actually] in the original release) belongs to! Present Allebahstian Knife Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Let us take a good look at the murder weapon that was used to kill Manny Coachen.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is what the fragment belongs to! Lang: Lang: Don't you dare chicken out on me after we've come all this way! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! I demand that you show the correct piece of evidence now! Gumshoe: Yeah, sir! Do the ol' presenting thing proud and do it right! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes, yes, I understand. (It would appear that this evidence isn't enough to convince any of them...) Alba: Hmph! What's wrong? You seem to have alienated all of your friends. Edgeworth: Not quite. They're merely watching out for me. And pointing out to me which piece of evidence I should be presenting! I naturally assumed that you would recognize it... since you took a photo with it, after all. Leads back to: \"I naturally assumed that you would recognize it...\" Edgeworth: Let us take a good look at the murder weapon that was used to kill Manny Coachen. On the handle of this knife, there is a beautifully blooming flower. However, it would appear that it's missing a single petal. Alba: Gnn...nnrrgh... Edgeworth: Now, let's see what happens when we try to fit this \"pick\" in that open slot. Kay: It's a perfect fit! Edgeworth: I assume that the petal must have fallen off of the flower during Mr. Coachen's murder. And then, it was accidentally placed into the pushcart along with Mr. Coachen's body. Alba: Alba: Gnrrr... That's an interesting story, nothing more. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. Oh, I assure you it's more than just a story. Because for some odd reason, this flower petal was wet when I found it. Alba: It was wet... you say...? Edgeworth: Yes, and the only place it could've gotten wet from is the open-air stage's pool! Now I ask you, how did a part of the weapon which was smuggled into the theater... ...wind up in the open-air stage area on the Babahlese side of the embassy? I don't think I need to waste any words explaining this, as this petal explains it all for me. It proves that someone went from the rose garden's pool on through into Babahl! Alba: Impossible!!! Lang: The people of Zheng Fa have been waiting to see you, face to face, Mr. Alba. I'll tell everyone back home we'll be there soon. You should be happy. Alba: I... This... Why!? Edgeworth: Why? It's a little late to be asking that question. You should've known from the very beginning... ...when you took your first life! No matter how you may plot, or how you may try to cover it all up... ...you can never hide from your crime and what you've done. Because we're here to see to it that justice is served to people like you. Alba: Alba: You... can't call what you've given a \"perfect argument\"! Edgeworth: .................. Kay: You know... ...I don't think this guy is going to ever admit to his wrongdoings, Mr. Edgeworth. Because he values himself above all else. People who can't be negotiated with or people who refuse to admit when they've lost... I don't believe those kinds of people really exist because everyone breaks eventually... Edgeworth: You're right. In that case, I have no choice but to use all of the evidence I have. I'll use it all until he breaks under the weight of his crimes! Mr. Alba, I request that you testify once more. (This really will be... the end of the line...!) To be continued March 15, 3:33 AM Theatrum Neutralis - Lobby Edgeworth: Mr. Alba, I request that you testify once more. Alba: As if there is anything else for me to testify about. Edgeworth: (I still have yet to fully prove that it was Mr. Alba who murdered Mr. Coachen...) Well... I would like to hear about your movements before the murder occurred. I wonder if you could tell us about what you did here at the Theatrum Neutralis? Alba: ...Very well. I suppose I could tell you about that. Heh heh heh... Because about all I did was watch the Steel Samurai stage show. Edgeworth: Hmph, elaborating on even that alone is good enough for me. (The only way for me to place this man under arrest is to pinpoint the exact location... ...of where the murder took place, for that is the key to this investigation!) Testimony -- The Steel Samurai's Show -- Alba: I watched from the last row. The stage was well-lit, but it was dark out in the audience. I swear I was there in the audience, but it's hard to prove that, I suppose. I do remember the contents of the show very well, though. Is that proof enough for you? Those moving scenes were seared into this old man's heart. I'll never forget them. Edgeworth: So you were in the theater proper, watching the Steel Samurai stage show, were you? Alba: Of course I was. I have a great fondness for the Steel Samurai. Larry: Heh heh! Yeah! I was pretty cool up there, wasn't I? Edgeworth: You're not the one who was \"cool\"! It's the Steel Samurai who is cool. Kay: Yeah, and the Steel Samurai's special finishing move today was really something, huh!? Larry: Hm? Hey, Edgeeeeey! Who is she!? Who is this super cute girl!? Edgeworth: (She's been standing here this whole time, and only NOW he notices her!?) Her name is Kay Faraday. ...And she's helping me in my investigation. Kay: Sorry I didn't get to introduce myself earlier, but better late than never! Larry: Yeah! So, Kay! I'm Larry Buuuuuuuuutz! Franziska: Silence in the peanut gallery! There's no time for such trivialities at a time like this! Lang: Mr. Prosecutor, this is the final battle, you got that? Edgeworth: I know. This is the end......... for that man there. Lang: Ha ha ha! Now that's the kind of thing I like to hear! I think I'll give trusting you a try, Mr. Prosecutor... or rather, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...! Lang: I leave this critical battle up to you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Have no fear. I will finish the job. (This really is the endgame. The time has come to expose every last one of Mr. Alba's lies!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The last row? I should think that an ambassador would've had special seating reserved. Alba: I wanted my staff to enjoy the Steel Samurai's show as well. So I gave up all of the good seats for them. It was enough for me to simply see him. Oldbag: Hey! The Steel Samurai wasn't the only hero! Let's not forget about the Pink Princess here! Alba: My dear madam... ...if you continue to thrust about like that, your hip may begin to hurt again. Oldbag: Oh, my! Well, aren't you the considerate person when you want to be? But! This young butterfly is on the side of Edgey-poo. So you can spare me the flirtatious come-ons! Alba: ............ Kay: Wow! He's completely frozen! Edgeworth: In frustration, perhaps. I dare say she can be one rather trying opponent. In any case... Mr. Alba, can you actually prove to us that you were watching the show? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you admitting, then, that you have no way of proving to us that you were watching!? Alba: Alba: Quiet! You buzz in my ear like a pesky little fly! If you don't wish to listen quietly until the end of what I have to say... ...then perhaps you should pack up and get out of my way! Edgeworth: Gnrk...! Alba: Hmph... I see that you're willing to be a bit more receptive now. While it's true that it may be difficult to prove that I was out in the audience... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. Well, I remember the contents of the show as well myself. Alba: ...That's nice. Edgeworth: \"That's nice\"!? Franziska: Miles Edgeworth, don't allow yourself to be riled up by him at this important juncture. Edgeworth: Nngh... I wasn't planning to let him... Larry: Well, if you ask me, I think I'M the biggest Steel Samurai expert around here! And didn't you think the climactic scene of today's show was just totally awesome!? Alba: Yes, I remember that well. And that spectacular special move! The way you delivered the final blow against the Evil Magistrate, \"Early Summer Rain Jab\"... Oh, that scene will live on in my heart forever. Larry: Is that how it went? Heh, I totally forgot about that! Edgeworth: How can you forget your own special moves!? That's the special attack that the Steel Samurai uses when he's using the Samurai Spear. Alba: Yes, and today was the first time they showed it off, was it not? If I hadn't watched the show, then how could I answer you with the name of the move? Edgeworth: I suppose you are correct, but if you could, please elaborate on this point for me. Adds statement \"One of the scenes was of his never-before-seen \"Early Summer Rain Jab\" move.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Early Summer Rain Jab\" was a move that was to be unveiled today. Alba: And because I saw that brand new special move, I believe it confirms my alibi. Kay: How sad. The only way he's got to protect himself is that he watched the Steel Samurai. I guess... this guy really has nothing else left... Edgeworth: Yes, and to avoid arrest, you can bet he'll say or do anything. But, with all of us here, there will be no escape for him! Kay: Yeah! We'll find a way to bring him to justice! Edgeworth: Now then, let us continue with your testimony, Mr. Alba. Alba: Hmph. Very well. The Steel Samurai's special move and the various other scenes... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I agree, today will be a day to remember. Especially when we finally make you pay for all the wrongs you've committed! Alba: What!? Kay: Hey! That's what the Steel Samurai says when he defeats the Evil Magistrate! Larry: Heh heh... Actually, that line was just something I ad-libbed! Edgeworth: You may act all surprised, but naturally, you remember this line, don't you? Alba: .........! Of course I do. I just now understand how the Evil Magistrate felt, that's all. Edgeworth: Then allow me to make you identify with the Evil Magistrate some more! Kay: Hey, then that makes you the Steel Samurai, huh? Edgeworth: Heh... Well, if you had to complete the analogy, I suppose then, yes. (And I do believe it's about time to bring the curtains down on this with a bang!) Kay: I wonder if Mr. Alba was really there watching the show? Edgeworth: I don't think so, because the only time he had to commit the murder was during the show. And the only time he could've placed the body into the pushcart... ...was during the scenes when the Iron Infant was not out on-stage. Kay: Then that means that by the end of the stage show... Are you saying that the body was already in the pushcart by then? Larry: No waaaaaaay! I-I... You mean, I was pushing a dead body around!? That you used me in such a foul manner... is unforgivable, Evil Magistrate! Edgeworth: Hmph. Well put, Steel Samurai. And now, I will show to all those present... ...just who is the Evil Magistrate that the Steel Samurai must defeat! Edgeworth: Kay and myself were also in the audience of the Steel Samurai stage show... Kay: ...He's got nothing on the Jammin' Ninja, but he was still cool enough, I guess! Larry: Heh heh! Wasn't my brand new special finishing move totally rad!? Edgeworth: No, don't tell me! It was YOU who thought up the special move!? Larry: Yup! Umm... Now what was it again? \"Extremely Silly Reign Jab!\" ...Was that it? No, wait, it was \"Stubble Breaking Chop!\" ...That doesn't sound quite right. Edgeworth: How can you forget a move you came up with!? (The final piece to Mr. Alba's alibi is that he was watching the Steel Samurai's show. However, if he was busy killing Mr. Coachen, he should not have had the time to do so!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Kay Faraday\nDescription: Young girl purporting to be the 2nd Yatagarasu.

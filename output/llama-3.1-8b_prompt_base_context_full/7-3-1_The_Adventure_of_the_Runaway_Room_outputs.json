I remember it well.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Yes...I think it was some time after ten, wasn't it? Beppo: Oh, yes, sir, that's, that's right, sir. Yes. Ever so cold, it was, sir. F-Freezing in fact. Ryunosuke: And you had four passengers on board at the time. Is that correct? Beppo: Yes, yes, that's right, sir. Not all travelling in the same parts of the b-b-bus, of course, though. No. Judge: And there were no other passengers when the incident took place? No one alighted, for example? Beppo: You're quite right with that, sir. No other passengers like that, no. None. Ryunosuke: (So nobody fled the scene of the crime, then.)  Beppo: I have to say, the boss insists on it running, he does. Every evening. That last b-b-bus of the day. But I, I do wonder sometimes if it's altogether worthwhile. Yes, s-s-sorry to say... Ryunosuke: What do you mean by that? Beppo: Well, what with it being so cold and everything, and only m-making twenty pence on the run, you see... Yes, I, I spend that much at the p-p-pub on the way home just, just trying to warm up again.Press (after Jurors No. 2 and 4 vote guilty, if third, fourth, and fifth statements were pressed) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Yes...I think it was some time after ten, wasn't it?

Yes, I, I spend that much at the p-p-pub on the way home just, just trying to warm up again. I, I just can't believe it, sir. C-Can't believe it... A m-m-murder on my own b-bus. It's t-t-too awful to think about. I h-haven't been able to sh-shake this c-c-cold ever since it happened. Leads to: \"My Lord, I wish to speak!\"Fairplay: The victim and the man accused of killing him were sat next to each other inside the bus.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: And you saw them through the skylight in the roof of the carriage? Fairplay: That's right. When you sit up on the top deck, the window's right there at your feet. There was a lamp on inside, so I had a pretty good view. The two of them were wearing hats and I couldn't exactly make out their faces... ...but there's not a shred of doubt in my mind that it was Mr McGilded. Ryunosuke: How can you be so sure? Fairplay: Well...how can I put it politely? McGilded is a gentleman of...rather small stature. I couldn't have mistaken him for anyone else. Van Zieks: Let's not forget that when the vehicle came to a halt, the only people inside the enclosed cabin... ...were the deceased Mr Mason, and Mr McGilded. There is no room for doubt here. Ryunosuke: Ugh, I really wish there was...Fairplay: Then out of the blue, the accused just reached over and plunged a knife right into his guts!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You actually saw the exact moment it happened? Fairplay: Didn't I already testify to that? ...Or are fair dinkum, hard-working city bankers not considered trustworthy these days? Ryunosuke: Oh, no no! I, I didn't mean that! (This is no good. I've really got his back up.) ...Perhaps you could just tell us what you saw in a little more detail, if that's- My Lord! Judge: Hm? Juror number three? What's the meaning of this? Juror No. 3: My mind is made up, My Lord. Completely and utterly made up! Ryunosuke: Made up about what...? Juror No. 3: I don't like the stinking rich. Never have. They're always up to something or other that they shouldn't be. Every one of them. And that little leprechaun of a man is no exception. Well...he can't fool me! There's no point in wasting time listening to any more of this. That's my opinion on the matter, anyway. ???: Juror No. 1: That is precisely what I was about to say! As the foreman of the jury, it's my duty to set a good example to my fellow jurors. Ryunosuke: What the...? (What is happening here?!) Susato: Let me see... Ah yes, it seems that's how the members of the jury give their verdicts. Ryunosuke: ...With fire? Susato: Apparently, yes. White for innocent, and black for guilty. As the six members of the jury make up their minds about the case... ...one by one, they each cast a ball of fire into the great Scales of Justice...as we saw a moment ago. Ryunosuke: So if those enormous scales fall completely to the black side, does that mean...? Susato: ......... Let's do our very best to make sure that doesn't happen! Ryunosuke: (Ugh... Now I'm even more worried than I was before...) Judge: Very well. The court acknowledges the change in the jury's stance. Counsel for the Defence, please continue with your cross-examination.

I've really got his back up.) ...Perhaps you could just tell us what you saw in a little more detail, if that's- Juror No. 2: My Lord, if you'll forgive the interruption... Judge: Ah, juror number two. Go on... Juror No. 2: Mr McGilded is a pillar of society and a gentleman. And a gentleman's word should be sacrosanct. However... ...those of us in service know we must accept hard truths. Ryunosuke: Wait, what are you about to do? Juror No. 2: Dispose of the rubbish! Ryunosuke: No! Juror No. 2: I don't wish to cause offence, but I do like to eradicate all traces of filth and grime. ???: Juror No. 4: ...I have painstakingly typed every word uttered here today, and cross-referenced all the facts. As such, I am now in a position to draw the only logical conclusion. Ryunosuke: Not again... Susato: That's...four out of six jury members who've proposed a guilty verdict! There are only two left! Ryunosuke: (We've had it... Every time I press these witnesses for more information, I just make the situation worse...) Susato: Nevertheless... ...what we need more than anything at the moment is more information. We're still very much in the dark. Ryunosuke: I suppose I'll just have to keep pressing the witnesses, knowing that more sparks may well fly... Susato: We mustn't give up hope that we'll uncover something that will give us a way to fight back! Ryunosuke: But... ......... Alright, I'll keep trying. (I can't give up. I just need to keep calm and listen to the witnesses' statements again.)Press (after Jurors No. 2 and 4 vote guilty, if first, fourth, and fifth statements were pressed) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You actually saw the exact moment it happened?

I've really got his back up.) ...Perhaps you could just tell us what you saw in a little more detail, if you don't mind? Fairplay: Why don't you ask the young man next to me? Furst: Oh! Me? Oh, well, yes...Furst: That's right. He stabbed him! I screamed, I did! Couldn't help it.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: 'He stabbed him,' you say. And you were sitting up on the roof deck, were you? Furst: Yes, that's right, sir. I was up on the roof seats. I remember seeing the little gent sitting next to the fellow that was stabbed. I'd been thinking about a new hat design, you see. So I was just gazing absent-mindedly around. But then! ...Then I happened to look down through the skylight! It, it, it was sticking right out from his belly! That, that huge, great knife! Judge: Hmph. A grim sight indeed. Ryunosuke: Ah! (That didn't help me at all! The jury look like they're even more convinced my client did it than they were before...) Susato: That appears to have made everyone even more dubious that Mr McGilded is telling the truth. If only we had some evidence to counter their suspicions... Van Zieks: Mr Furst! Furst: Oh! Yes, yes, sir? Van Zieks: Is this the knife you saw? Furst: Oh, good grief! Yes! That's it! The very one, sir! Ryunosuke: Is, is that...? Van Zieks: Yes, Counsel. This is the blade that was driven into the victim's belly like a stake through the heart. Judge: That is a blade of considerable size, Counsel. Van Zieks: It is. And furthermore, the scabbard is emblazoned prominently with a certain initial. The letter 'M'. ...Which seems oddly familiar. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (Please, no...) Van Zieks: 'M' for 'Magnus' perhaps? Or 'McGilded' possibly? ...Take your pick. It seems this particular big name in London made a... magnificent mistake. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But! But there are 'M's everywhere! Like...like... Yes! Like in 'Mason'! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: This blade is far too extravagant for a poor brickmaker to have owned. No! This weapon of murder almost certainly belongs to the accused! Ryunosuke: Ugh... Judge: Hm, not conclusive, but certainly compelling, Counsel. The murder weapon has been entered into the Court Record. My Lord! Judge: Hm? Juror number three? What's the meaning of this? Juror No. 3: My mind is made up, My Lord. Completely and utterly made up! Ryunosuke: Made up about what...? Juror No. 3: I don't like the stinking rich. Never have.

Susato: If this wasn't a court of law... ...I would have felt compelled to use a Susato Takedown for that lapse in judgement. Ryunosuke: No no! I'll, I'll be more careful! Van Zieks: As we have heard! The witness had an unfettered view of events unfolding. Would you not concur, coachman? Your diddering suggests that you would. Beppo: Oh! Y-Yes, sir!Examine evidence Murder Weapon Sheath Susato: That part is the sheath, isn't it? Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Are you alright, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Hm? Oh, sorry, yes. I...just don't really like blades. Susato: Oh... Those don't seem like the words of a man with a large katana slung from his waist. Ryunosuke: That's not a blade; that's Kazuma's soul. Anyway...there's no sense in delaying it. Let's see what the blade looks like. Blood on blade Ryunosuke: Ugh...that looks like a lot of blood. Susato: It surely is blood. The victim's. Ryunosuke: Ugh...an Englishman's blood looks a lot like a Japanese man's blood. Susato: Did you think it wouldn't? Ryunosuke: ...Sorry, it's just that we've only just arrived here in Great Britain. I'm finding it a little hard to adjust. Susato: ...Yes, I do understand. \"M\" insignia Ryunosuke: An ornate letter 'M'... Undeniably Mr Magnus McGilded's initial. Susato: And it's beautifully gilded, too. It must be very valuable, I should think. Ryunosuke: ...Ah! Susato: What is it? Ryunosuke: Look at this 'M'... If you turn it upside-down, it becomes a 'W'! This could change everything! Susato: A 'W'...? Ryunosuke: Yes, this is one of those...you know, turnabout cases! I'm sure of it! Susato: I'm afraid I don't know at all. But what I am sure of is that this is an 'M'. Ryunosuke: Oh. (Well that idea was quickly quashed...)Beppo: As soon as I heard the scream, I stopped my bus. And, and then I saw it, too!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Erm...what exactly did you see? Beppo: Oh, well sir, that would be the p-p-passenger, sir. Yes, c-c-collapsed on the floor, he was. Van Zieks: And by the passenger, obviously you are referring to the victim, Mr Mason, the brickmaker. Beppo: And, and then the other p-p-passenger had that kn-knife in his hand, l-like this... Van Zieks: By the other passenger, obviously you are referring to the accused, Mr Magnus McGilded. Beppo: And then he p-p-p-plunged it down like this, s-stabbing the other passenger in the b-b-belly. Ryunosuke: What?! My Lord! Judge: Hm? Juror number three? What's the meaning of this? Juror No. 3: My mind is made up, My Lord. Completely and utterly made up! Ryunosuke: Made up about what...?

It is hard to believe of one of London's greatest philanthropists, but this is damning indeed. Van Zieks: The law knows no philanthropists, My Lord. Only the innocent...and the guilty. Good deeds mean nothing, when overshadowed by evil. The truth...is everything. Beppo: Couldn't agree more, sir! The truth!Ryunosuke: (Alright, so when it happened, the only two people in the enclosed cabin area were the victim and the defendant. And - so help me - THREE WHOLE PEOPLE witnessed the man I'm trying to defend do the deed...)Susato: I don't like to be pessimistic, but we do seem to be in a rather difficult situation here.Ryunosuke: Ugh... (What am I supposed to think here? Is Mr McGilded really innocent? Or could it be...?)Susato: B-before we jump to conclusions, our first task should be to gather information. We need to understand the case much better than we do at the moment.Ryunosuke: Yes! You're absolutely right. (Let's listen to those witness statements again, a little more carefully this time.)Juror No. 5:My Lord, I wish to speak!Judge: Yes, juror number five? Do I take it that you, too...?Juror No. 5: As the master of the London Guild of Coachmen... ...the idea of a murder being committed in one of the city's carriages is utterly abhorrent to me. It wouldn't be right to make a decision before hearing all the facts, though, I said to myself. But I've heard enough now. The horse has bolted, as they say.Ryunosuke: No, no! Please, just keep an open mind a little long-Juror No. 5: Gee-up now, Silver Blaze! The finish is in sight! Beppo is a long-standing member of the guild, and I trust what the man says.Beppo: Oh, thank you, sir. You're t-t-too kind, sir.Ryunosuke: Ugh, this is t-t-too unkind, sir...Van Zieks: Which now means that five jurors agree to condemn this man. Madam juror number six...Juror No. 6: Yes, dear? What can I do for you?Van Zieks: You have heard the testimonies of the witnesses in the stand.Juror No. 6: Oh yes. I certainly have. Still got my hearing, you know!Van Zieks: Then, pray tell, why are you yet to pronounce your leaning?Juror No. 6: ......... Well, dear, the thing is, I'm a creature of habit, me. I always go to the park at around this time of day, and sit on a nice bench and get on with my knitting.Van Zieks: .........Juror No. 6: There's a lovely little park just near where I live. McGilded Park, it's called.Ryunosuke: ...!Juror No. 6: The gentleman donated it to the city, you know. To put a smile on Londoners' faces, he said. I can't imagine such a fine, young gentleman would have it in him to take another man's life.He is always doing wonderful things for the city.That's right! A man like that wouldn't stab someone, surely?Mother, may we go to the McGilded Public Library later and borrow some more books?Van Zieks: How many Londoners live with their heads in the clouds?! Do you people not know... ...what kind of a man Magnus McGilded really is?Ryunosuke: What kind of a man is he?!Van Zieks: The philanthropist, Magnus McGilded... ...has enough wealth to purchase the entire city he claims to value so highly. But where did all that wealth come from? Your client is a shylock, sir! And one with the very darkest of souls.Ryunosuke: What?!Juror No. 6: Stone the crows!Van Zieks: McGilded lends money at extortionate rates of interest so his victims have no hope of repaying him. When they default, he takes possession of everything they own. He is a vulture that preys on the weak.Juror No. 6: I've, I've never heard any mention of that before...Van Zieks: Your faculties haven't deserted you, I'm sure, madam. So has this thought not crossed your mind? Would a man wealthy enough to buy London in its entirety not have a carriage of his own?Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: What possible reason could this man have had to make use of a public omnibus service?Juror No. 6: Um...Ryunosuke: You're not saying that...?Van Zieks: The victim - a poor brickmaker - had next to nothing to his name, save considerable financial liability. It will come as no surprise that his creditor was the accused, Magnus McGilded. But let it also be known, that the very day Mr Mason was killed, was the final repayment date for his debts.Judge: Good gracious!Van Zieks: The brickmaker was destitute. He had lost his house. He had not a shilling with which to repay his debts. And in the end, this pitiful soul had the very last thing he owned taken from him...his life. By the merciless philanthropist pretender... Magnus McGilded!Ryunosuke: (I don't believe it!)Susato:Susato: If I might add something briefly...?Ryunosuke: Miss Susato?Susato: You claim that the victim had been lent money by Mr McGilded... ...but where is the evidence to support your claim?Van Zieks: ......... ...Pray forgive the discourtesy of filling my hallowed chalice in a court of law...Judge: Ah-ha, there it is! Lord van Zieks's hallowed chalice!Ryunosuke: (How can this be considered acceptable?!)Van Zieks: ...But I find myself in unexpectedly good humour. I had heard ladies from the Far East could show great courage...but I didn't expect to experience it myself.Susato: Ah! As, as judicial assistant to the defence, I am simply doing my job!Van Zieks: What a pity that your display of courage...is in vain. This is the debtors' ledger, which details all monies loaned by the accused. You will find the victim's name clearly recorded inside.Susato: Oh...Van Zieks: Allow me to present this ledger as evidence... ...and pray forgive the discourtesy of raising my chalice in a toast to the enigmatic East at the same time!Judge: A marvellous toast, Counsel! I will gladly accept this new evidence.The debtors' ledger has been entered into the Court Record.Judge: Ah yes, twenty guineas... The victim owed a considerable sum.Examine evidence Debtors' Ledger Clasp Ryunosuke: ...This portfolio must contain all sorts of secrets of London's gentry. Susato: Oh dear... Do you really think we ought to look inside? Ryunosuke: Well, it's not as though we know any of London's gentry personally, is it? Apart from our great detective friend, perhaps. ......... (Actually, I wonder...) Susato: I assure you we will not find Mr Sholmes's name inside! Ryunosuke: Well, let's see what we find... Writing Susato: Gosh, it's crammed full of gentlemen's names, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Well, I suppose they're probably not all gentlemen at all, are they? (After all, not everyone in this country is well off...) Susato: Ah! Goodness! Ryunosuke: What is it? Susato: Look at this! Do you see the name here? Ryunosuke: 'Bruce Fairplay'... ...Should that mean something to me? It, it does sound strangely familiar, actually... Susato: Bruce Fairplay! The witness testifying at this very moment! Ryunosuke: Oh yes, of course! The banker! Why is his name in here? (...Ah, he borrowed twenty guineas, did he?) And look, the repayment date is fast approaching. Susato: It's possible that this is just a coincidence, of course. But this could be very useful information. The details of the debtors' ledger have been updated in the Court Record. Writing (subsequent times) Susato: Gosh, it's crammed full of gentlemen's names, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Well, I suppose they're probably not all gentlemen at all, are they? (After all, not everyone in this country is well off...)Van Zieks: And the accused made quite certain he had ample recompense.Juror No. 6: ......... Well, it would seem I've... ...I've had the wool pulled over my eyes.Van Zieks: Regrettably, madam, that is the modus operandi of the accused.Juror No. 6: And it's such a pretty little park, too. ...What a scoundrel! .........Still... ...maybe it's all for the best.Ryunosuke: Ah! W-Wait a minute! Let's think about this a little more before-Juror No. 6: I don't stand for nonsense!Ryunosuke: ......... (That was it... The last juror's decision...)Susato: ......... ...Ah, according to this Encyclopaedia of British Law... 'When all members of the jury have concluded that the defendant is guilty... ...court proceedings are suspended, and the presiding judge will deliver the final verdict and sentence.' That's what it says here.Ryunosuke: (Haah... The final verdict... It's over then.)Susato: Oh! There's a footnote, though.Ryunosuke: A footnote?Susato: 'However, the defence-'Judge: All six members of the jury are now in agreement in this case.Van Zieks: Allow me to convey my respect for your swift and righteous decision.Judge: According to the laws of this country, I will now conclude the trial... ...by delivering my final verdict. ...I trust there are no objections?Ryunosuke: ......... ......... Miss Susato, just tell me one thing...Susato: Oh! Yes?Ryunosuke: You were in the middle of saying something before. The footnote in your Encyclopaedia of British Law. 'However, the defence...' What did it say next?Susato: O-Oh yes, of course. One moment... 'When all members of the jury have concluded that the defendant is guilty... ...court proceedings are suspended, and the presiding judge will deliver the final verdict and sentence.' Then the footnote says... 'However, the defence... ...has the right to demand a summation examination of the jurors at this point.'Ryunosuke: A...summation...examination...?Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ...A summation examination? From which century has that tome you have there been resurrected?Susato: Ah!Van Zieks: Judging from the binding, I would say that book is at least fifty years old. Any modern text on British Law wouldn't even give such an antiquated procedure a mention. It's a relic. Long forgotten, and certainly no longer practised. So you're out of luck.Susato: Oh...Ryunosuke: What even is it, Miss Susato? This so-called 'summation examination'?Susato: Oh, um... One moment, and I'll read about it.Van Zieks: ...You would demand the right to a procedure before you even understand what it entails? Hmph, typical Nipponese.Susato: Alright, Mr Naruhodo, I think I understand... It seems that under this procedure, we would be able to appeal to the members of the jury.Ryunosuke: To do what...exactly?Susato: Appeal to them to change their leaning and reverse their decisions. And it says here that... ...'If successful, the proceedings of the trial must be resumed.'Ryunosuke: (Make them reverse their decisions...)Judge: Yes, in times gone by, barristers would use a summation examination to attempt to influence the jury's decision. But that procedure became something of a formality with no practical benefit, really. So it rather fell out of use.Susato: I wonder why...Van Zieks: Because it was devoid of purpose.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: Changing just one member of the jury's mind would be hard enough, let alone several. No self-respecting defence barrister would even assert his right to try in this day and age.Susato: ......... Still... ...I don't see any mention of the procedure actually being formally revoked.Van Zieks: What are you suggesting?Susato: I'm suggesting that although it may be antiquated and largely forgotten...it isn't yet extinct.Van Zieks: ...!Susato: What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: (A summation examination... Our last possible option. Do we assert our right to carry it out, or admit defeat?)Assert our right Leads to: \"The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination, My Lord!\"Forget it Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Mr Naruhodo... Are you sure that's the right decision? Ryunosuke: You heard what the judge and the prosecutor said. It's an antiquated procedure. It's history. We barely know our way around the law that's in use today. What hope would we have of pulling it off? Susato: .........  Perhaps what we don't know can work to our advantage. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Susato: In any case, there's really only one course of action available to us here. What we can't afford to do is allow this trial to end! Ryunosuke: ...! (What we don't know can work to our advantage...?) You're right, Miss Susato. Let's bring this antiquated procedure back into the present day! Leads to: \"The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination, My Lord!\"Ryunosuke: The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination, My Lord!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: London is the capital city of the most powerful nation on earth. We have a duty to the world to exemplify the very highest standards of judicial procedure. Summation examinations are an embarrassment that should remain buried!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: But if it's our right, it's our right! I believe it could prove vital in this trial!Judge: The defence's petition is perfectly valid. The court will proceed with the summation examination!Van Zieks: This is madness...Judge: Foreman, are you and the remainder of the jury ready?Juror No. 1: Eh?! Well, erm, I'm not, erm... There was no mention of this in the letter I received, you see, so...Judge: All members of the jury will be asked to explain on what grounds they have reached their decision.Juror No. 1: On what grounds...?Judge: You must all justify your decisions and explain why you believed the defendant to be guilty.Juror No. 1: Well, My Lord, you're rather putting us on the spot...Juror No. 2: This is most irregular. No mention was made of this before.Juror No. 3: I don't really hold with all this 'justifying' lark.Juror No. 4: .........Ryunosuke: (That seems to have thrown the jurors off...)Susato: It seems none of them have experienced this before.Ryunosuke: (Alright then, the summation examination... A defence procedure no practising lawyer has attempted for years, is it? Well, just maybe... ...it might be the opportunity we've been looking for... to turn this trial around!)Judge: So be it, then. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the court hereby calls upon you... ...to state the grounds on which you find the defendant, Magnus McGilded, guilty of this most serious crime.Judicial Findings - The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1: There was no one else inside the carriage at the time, so it has to have been him.Juror No. 2: I trust the driver. He has an excellent memory, it seems. Four passengers, with fares totalling twenty pence.Juror No. 3: He stuck the chap next to him just like this! Brazen, I must say. Absolutely brazen!Juror No. 4: I have simply typed and collated all the statements made thus far, and drawn the logical conclusion.Juror No. 5: You can trust the guild. Fair fares is our motto. We haven't raised prices above fourpence for years.Juror No. 6: The scoundrel, stabbing that poor man on the floor! It beggars belief!Ryunosuke: (I'm starting to wish I hadn't pushed for this now...)Susato: Some of the jurors don't seem to have wonderfully formed arguments, though, do they?Ryunosuke: Well, let's see what we can do. We need to get these six people to change their minds. (I'll have to throw everything I can at them! And use some very persuasive language...)Susato: Just a moment, Mr Naruhodo. According to my book, that's not quite how it works.Ryunosuke: Oh? I thought I was going to have to thaw their icy minds with some heart-warming rhetoric about the defendant.Susato: Unfortunately... ...once the jurors have decided the defendant is guilty, they're unlikely to heed anything the defence says.Ryunosuke: But, but then...Susato: They've reached their conclusions by their own reasoning, you see. Your pleas will sound like excuses. In fact, it could recoil on you. The more you try to persuade them, the more entrenched they may become.Ryunosuke: Then what on earth am I supposed to do?!Susato: Oh dear. I'm just citing what I've read about British law, Mr Naruhodo.Ryunosuke: Right, I'm sorry. ...Do you have any idea how to make this work, then?Susato: Well, from what I can understand... ...the key to this procedure is using the jurors' own words to make your arguments.Ryunosuke: What do you mean?Susato: Well, the six members of the jury are randomly selected members of the public. They may appear to present a united front, but the truth is... ...they are complete strangers, who just happen to find themselves here in the courtroom together.Ryunosuke: And...that's the way to break them down, you mean?Susato: Yes, exactly. We must listen very carefully to what each member of the jury says... ...and see if we can identify any contradictory statements. If we can, we then contrast the statements and pit the corresponding jurors against each other!Ryunosuke: I see. So it's contradictions in what two or more jurors say that we're looking for. In a way, then... ...this is similar to a regular cross-examination.Susato: Oh! Yes, I, I suppose you're right!Ryunosuke: ......... (Find contradictions in their statements and pit the jurors against one another to break them down... Alright, I might be able to pull this off. ...No, that's not right... I HAVE TO pull this off!)Judge: Can we start proceedings, Counsel? I would ask you to take the stand for this. I'm expecting a clear and concise rebuttal!Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord!Jury Examination - The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1: There was no one else inside the carriage at the time, so it has to have been him.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Certainly, the testimonies we've heard suggest the victim and Mr McGilded were alone inside the carriage. Juror No. 1: Precisely my point. Ryunosuke: But! Could there be some other explanation? Something we haven't considered yet? Juror No. 1: Such as...? Ryunosuke: ......... Haha, well, um...perhaps that's something we could, um... all work out together now? Juror No. 1: Now listen here! Maybe you don't know how things work around here because you're...from foreign climes. But we're here to form our opinions as individuals. And I have! Ryunosuke: Ugh... Susato: Oh dear. He doesn't appear to be in the mood to consider an alternative point of view, does he? Ryunosuke: (No, I'm going to have to pit the jurors against one another, like Susato-san said. Finding contradictions in these six people's assertions is the only way I'm going to succeed...)Juror No. 2: I trust the driver. He has an excellent memory, it seems. Four passengers, with fares totalling twenty pence.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But does his ability to recall his takings that night really tell us how trustworthy the man is? Juror No. 2: I manage all His Lordship's cash affairs, so I'm very particular when it comes to accounts. Ryunosuke: I see... Juror No. 2: A single penny can mean the difference between life and death, after all, can't it? Ryunosuke: ...That's, that's a saying in your country? Juror No. 2: My point is, a man who minds his figures is a man you can trust. Those of us in service would swear to that, sir. Ryunosuke: (Does that bench really need any more polishing...?) Juror No. 2: So if the good driver says that he saw Mr McGilded in the act, I don't doubt him. The only task left to do today is disposing of the rubbish. Ryunosuke: (Ah, now wait a minute... One of the other jurors mentioned something about money, I think.) Susato: Now would be a very good time to listen carefully to the jurors' statements again, Mr Naruhodo. If you notice an inconsistency in what two different jurors are saying... Ryunosuke: ...I should expose it by pitting them against each other. (Yes, let's see if I can do just that...)Pit against Juror No. 5's statement (before Jurors No. 3 and 6 vote innocent) Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: They do? Explain yourself, Counsel! Juror No. 2: Me?! Oh dear, what have I said? Juror No. 5: I swear on Silver Blaze's mane and name, I haven't the first idea what you're talking about! Ryunosuke: According to the group testimony we've heard so far... ...there were four passengers on the omnibus on the night in question. And according to the coachman, Mr Beppo, he took twenty pence in fares. Juror No. 4: Quite right. I have those precise details typed neatly here in front of me. Ryunosuke: And juror number five also told us the following: The fare for the omnibus...is always fourpence. Juror No. 5: That it is. A fair and convenient single price. Just the way London's carriages should be operated! Ryunosuke: But that doesn't add up at all. In fact, it leaves a glaring discrepancy in the facts. Juror No. 5: Why, man, why?! Ryunosuke: Four passengers paying fourpence each. If you do the multiplication... Juror No. 2: Ah! It would be sixteen pence! Ryunosuke: Exactly. As I said, it doesn't add up. The figures are different. By fourpence, in fact. ...Or precisely one person's fare. Judge: One person's fare? Ryunosuke: Yes! In other words, on the omnibus that night... ...it's distinctly possible...there was another passenger we've heard nothing about! Judge: Good gracious! Juror No. 5: This, this can't be right! The coachmen of the guild are good, honest men, one and all! Trustworthiness is our watchword! Juror No. 4: The figures your coachman claims most certainly do not add up. Your watchword, good sir, is a fallacy! Juror No. 5: I beg your pardon?! Ryunosuke: Mr Guildmaster, I think you ought to consider that if this trial were to end now... ...the news will surely spread all over London. The news that one of your coachmen tried to hide the fact that he lets nefarious characters ride his omnibus. Juror No. 5: ...! Alright then, how do I make it so this miserable trial doesn't end, hm? Susato: Well, according to my book here... ...you simply launch a ball of fire onto the innocent side of the set of scales! Juror No. 1: Now hold your horses there, coachman! We were all in agreement! Why do you have to go and- Juror No. 5: Wait till I get my hands on you, Beppo!!! Juror No. 1: Argh! This is all very irritating... Juror No. 2: Begging your pardon, sir, I'm going to do the same. Juror No. 1: For the love of Mike! Not you as well?! Juror No. 2: A penny can be the difference between a smile and a tear, after all. I certainly can't put my trust in someone who doesn't follow my exacting standards in financial matters. Juror No. 1: Oh really? Juror No. 2: I, for one, think it's only proper that we hear from the witnesses again. Susato: Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue! Ryunosuke: Two more... (Actually... ...there is something else that's bothering me about a couple of their assertions.) Susato: Then that's where you must strike next! Ryunosuke: (So I need to pit two more jurors against each other and show there's another contradiction in their assertions.) Susato: Exactly! You can do it! Judge: Well, the Scales of Justice have shifted, but they still weigh heavy on the side of guilt. Counsel, you have the floor again. Continue with your summation examination! Changes Juror No. 2's statement to \"I'm changing my leaning to innocent. I should like to hear what the slipshod bookkeeper has to say for himself!\" and Juror No. 5's statement to \"Grrr! Beppo! This trial has to continue so I can get to the bottom of this corruption! Not guilty, I say!\"Pit against Juror No. 5's statement (after Jurors No. 3 and 6 vote innocent) Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: They do? Explain yourself, Counsel! Juror No. 2: Me?! Oh dear, what have I said? Juror No. 5: I swear on Silver Blaze's mane and name, I haven't the first idea what you're talking about!

I should like to hear what the slipshod bookkeeper has to say for himself!Juror No. 3: He stuck the chap next to him just like this! Brazen, I must say. Absolutely brazen!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Careful! You, you could hurt somebody with that! Juror No. 3: Tsk! You're a fine one to talk! What of that sword hanging from your waist, hm? Ryunosuke: No no! That's...just my battered soul... Juror No. 3: Well anyway, I despise anyone with too much money. They're all the same. All stabbing some brickmaker or other behind the scenes, you mark my words! Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: That...seems very unlikely, doesn't it? Juror No. 3: Are you mad, man? We know that small shorty is a rotten shylock! Ryunosuke: Well, yes, that does seem to be the case, but- Susato: Mr Naruhodo! Please! Be careful what you say! Juror No. 3: If he's been trying to squeeze money out of us less fortunate, then as far as I'm concerned... ...he's as guilty as sin! The man can hang! Ryunosuke: (Come to think of it... ...didn't one of the other jurors have something to say about the defendant's underhand activities?) Susato: If you've thought of something, Mr Naruhodo, don't let it go! Test your theory! Ryunosuke: (Pit the two jurors whose statements seem to be contradictory against each other...? No time like the present to use [X / Y / R] to 'Pit' them against each other...or I'll never get anywhere...)Pit against Juror No. 6's statement Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: Those two statements are completely contradictory! Judge: Whaaat?! Explain, Counsel, post-haste! Juror No. 6: Oh dearie me! I, I was only knitting a jumper for my other half! Juror No. 3: What is all this claptrap? What does 'contradictory' even mean, I ask you? Ryunosuke: We've heard from more than one witness... ...that they allegedly saw the actual moment when the defendant stabbed the victim. Now, out of curiosity, juror number three... Juror No. 3: What?! Can't you see that I'm busy here? Ryunosuke: ...How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim? What sort of motion was it? Juror No. 3: Ha! Want to test me, do you? It was like this! Stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up! Just like the prim banker said. Judge: Yes, that was Mr Fairplay's testimony. Quite true. Ryunosuke: Now then, juror number six... Juror No. 6: ...Oh! Is that me, is it? What can I do for you, young man? Ryunosuke: How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim, madam? Juror No. 6: Oh, well dear, as far as I understand it... ...it was like this! He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor! ...The coachman said so. Ryunosuke: Now don't move! Take a look at these two jurors! 'He stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up!' And 'He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor!' Judge: Well I never! They're... They're stabbing in totally different directions! Juror No. 3: What?! Juror No. 6: Bless my stitches! What a muddle! Ryunosuke: What this tells us... ...is that there's a strong possibility one of the witnesses isn't telling the truth! Juror No. 6: Oh! Juror No. 3: But why?! Why the dickens would they lie? Ryunosuke: I don't know that yet. But what I do know... ...is that if the trial ends at this point, we may never find out! We may never know the real truth! Ladies and gentlemen of the jury! Can you really let that happen, in all good conscience? Juror No. 6: Lies, you say? Oh dearie me... I can't abide people telling lies! Juror No. 2: The, the scales... Juror No. 5: I don't believe it! Juror No. 1: Juror No. 1: Waaaaaait! Now hear this, my fellow jurors: I warn you, you cannot listen to this man! Look at him, in his black suit! He's...he's...clearly some devious Eastern sorcerer using magic on us all! Ryunosuke: (If I could use magic, do you really think I'd be putting myself through all this?) Juror No. 1: Answer me this, Dark Jinx! Ryunosuke: Huh?! M-Me? Juror No. 1: What exactly is the problem? What of it if two witnesses have slightly different recollections of events? Ryunosuke: What of it? Juror No. 1: Let's say the shylock did stab the victim as he was sat next to him on the omnibus. And this young dandy saw him do it! And now let's say the victim collapsed on the floor, and then the shylock stabbed him again! And this old lady saw him do it! Well? What's to say it didn't happen like that, hm? Juror No. 3: Who are you calling a dandy, sir?! Why, I should take this knife to you! Juror No. 6: Who are you calling old?! Why, I should take this needle to you! Ryunosuke: (Ugh...they're ready to kill each other now... But could the foreman of the jury be right? Did the two witnesses see two different moments of the same crime?)  It's possible Ryunosuke: Hm, it's true... There's an outside chance of almost anything you care to mention. Juror No. 1: Eeexactly the point I've been trying to make! Susato: Before you go any further, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Oh! What is it, Miss Susato? Susato: ...I think you should have a look through the Court Record. Ryunosuke: ......... Ah! Susato: You see? This evidence makes it quite clear. There isn't even an outside chance of what the juror is saying! Ryunosuke: (How did I miss that...?) Leads to: \"Unfortunately, Mr Foreman...\" It's out of the question Leads to: \"Unfortunately, Mr Foreman...\" Ryunosuke: Unfortunately, Mr Foreman... Juror No. 1: Hm? What is it, you dark jinx? Come on, out with it! Ryunosuke: ...What you're suggesting is impossible! It's out of the question! Juror No. 2: ...! Juror No. 4: ...! Juror No. 6: ...! Juror No. 1: What, what are you talking about, man? How can you possibly say that? You, you do realise that I'm...I'm only doing my job! As foreman of the jury, I have a responsibility to steer everyone in the right direction. So where's your evidence, man? That's what we want to see! I say the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime. If you say that's out of the question, show me some proof! Ryunosuke: ......... (It looks like the only way I'm going to convince him is to present him with something he can't dismiss. Some irrefutable hard evidence!) As you wish. Juror No. 1: What? Ryunosuke: I'll give you the proof. It's out of the question that the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime...as proven by...  Present Autopsy Report (before Jurors No. 2 and 5 vote innocent) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: This is the victim's autopsy report. According to what's written here, Mr Mason was stabbed in the abdomen... ...only once. Juror No. 1: Eh?! Only once?! Ryunosuke: It's quite simple! The victim was stabbed precisely one time. Which means these witnesses can't possibly have seen it happen two different times! Juror No. 3: Huuurgh...grrr...hyuuurgh... Alright...I concede defeat! Susato: Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue! Ryunosuke: Two more... (Actually... ...there is something else that's bothering me about a couple of their assertions.) Susato: Then that's where you must strike next! Ryunosuke: (So I need to pit two more jurors against each other and show there's another contradiction in their assertions.) Susato: Exactly! You can do it! Judge: Well, the Scales of Justice have shifted, but they still weigh heavy on the side of guilt. Counsel, you have the floor again. Continue with your summation examination! Changes Juror No. 3's statement to \"I'm no lover of the rich, but I despise liars even more! Innocent is my call, for now at least!\" and Juror No. 6's statement to \"Dear me, you can't make accusations based on lies! I wonder if the poor man is innocent after all...\"' Present Autopsy Report (after Jurors No. 2 and 5 vote innocent) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: This is the victim's autopsy report. According to what's written here, Mr Mason was stabbed in the abdomen... ...only once. Juror No. 1: Eh?! Only once?! Ryunosuke: It's quite simple! The victim was stabbed precisely one time. Which means these witnesses can't possibly have seen it happen two different times! Juror No. 3: Huuurgh...grrr...hyuuurgh... Alright...I concede defeat! Leads to: \"...Wait! That, that means...\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...this clear piece of evidence! Well, Mr Foreman? Juror No. 1: ......... Do you know what they say about me, young man? They say I've got no powers of persuasion. Ryunosuke: Oh, I see... Erm... I'm sorry to hear that...? Juror No. 1: But no one will need persuading about this: You're even worse than me! Ryunosuke: Aaagh! (Two different moments... In other words, the victim was stabbed two times... Ah! But we have evidence that clearly contradicts that possibility!) If you'll allow me another chance...I'd like to present you with one more piece of evidence to consider. Leads back to: \"It's out of the question that the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime...as proven by...\"Juror No. 3: I'm no lover of the rich, but I despise liars even more! Innocent is my call, for now at least!Juror No. 4: I have simply typed and collated all the statements made thus far, and drawn the logical conclusion.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Um... Juror No. 4: ......... Ryunosuke: What have you been doing all this time? Juror No. 4: 'What have you been doing all this time?'... There. ...I should have thought it was obvious. I am recording everything that takes place as part of these proceedings. Ryunosuke: And...what have you learnt from that? Juror No. 4: For example, at this moment in time, the judge has used his gavel eleven times in total... ...the prosecution has snorted derisively at your remarks seven times in total... ...and, I might add, each time you have gawped like a simpleton. Ryunosuke: ...Thank you. (And what's the point exactly?) So anyway, madam, are you able to explain why you think the defendant is guilty? Juror No. 4: ......... That is a conclusion I have drawn as a result of the copious notes I have typed. Ryunosuke: Clearly! But I'm asking you to explain WHY you've drawn that conclusion! Juror No. 4: Please don't distract me. It makes it extremely hard to concentrate on my note-keeping. Ryunosuke: (This is going nowhere...)Juror No. 5: You can trust the guild. Fair fares is our motto. We haven't raised prices above fourpence for years.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That's how much it costs to take the omnibus? Juror No. 5: That's right. As the guildmaster, I decided to set a policy for all drivers across the city. One fare, no matter which bus you take or how far you're going. We have to compete with the rise of the motor car, you see. Us coachmen have to make a stand together! Ryunosuke: Motor cars, you say? Juror No. 5: Yes. And this murder on one of our buses is extremely damaging to our cause! It's beyond the pale! It'll lead to a decline in passengers, you mark my words! And it's all that rascal's fault! He has to pay! Ryunosuke: (Is it the crime or his buses he's more worried about...?) Juror No. 5: Anyway, every member of my guild is reliable and trustworthy. So if the driver says he saw him do it, that fellow in the dock is as guilty as sin!Pit against Juror No. 2's statement (before Jurors No. 3 and 6 vote innocent) Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: They do? Explain yourself, Counsel! Juror No. 2: Me?! Oh dear, what have I said? Juror No. 5: I swear on Silver Blaze's mane and name, I haven't the first idea what you're talking about! Ryunosuke: According to the group testimony we've heard so far... ...there were four passengers on the omnibus on the night in question. And according to the coachman, Mr Beppo, he took twenty pence in fares. Juror No. 4: Quite right. I have those precise details typed neatly here in front of me. Ryunosuke: And juror number five also told us the following: The fare for the omnibus...is always fourpence. Juror No. 5: That it is. A fair and convenient single price. Just the way London's carriages should be operated! Ryunosuke: But that doesn't add up at all. In fact, it leaves a glaring discrepancy in the facts. Juror No. 5: Why, man, why?! Ryunosuke: Four passengers paying fourpence each. If you do the multiplication... Juror No. 2: Ah! It would be sixteen pence! Ryunosuke: Exactly. As I said, it doesn't add up. The figures are different. By fourpence, in fact. ...Or precisely one person's fare. Judge: One person's fare? Ryunosuke: Yes! In other words, on the omnibus that night... ...it's distinctly possible...there was another passenger we've heard nothing about! Judge: Good gracious! Juror No. 5: This, this can't be right! The coachmen of the guild are good, honest men, one and all! Trustworthiness is our watchword! Juror No. 4: The figures your coachman claims most certainly do not add up. Your watchword, good sir, is a fallacy! Juror No. 5: I beg your pardon?! Ryunosuke: Mr Guildmaster, I think you ought to consider that if this trial were to end now... ...the news will surely spread all over London. The news that one of your coachmen tried to hide the fact that he lets nefarious characters ride his omnibus. Juror No. 5: ...! Alright then, how do I make it so this miserable trial doesn't end, hm? Susato: Well, according to my book here... ...you simply launch a ball of fire onto the innocent side of the set of scales! Juror No. 1: Now hold your horses there, coachman! We were all in agreement! Why do you have to go and- Juror No. 5: Wait till I get my hands on you, Beppo!!! Juror No. 1: Argh! This is all very irritating... Juror No. 2: Begging your pardon, sir, I'm going to do the same. Juror No. 1: For the love of Mike! Not you as well?! Juror No. 2: A penny can be the difference between a smile and a tear, after all. I certainly can't put my trust in someone who doesn't follow my exacting standards in financial matters. Juror No. 1: Oh really? Juror No. 2: I, for one, think it's only proper that we hear from the witnesses again. Susato: Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue! Ryunosuke: Two more... (Actually... ...there is something else that's bothering me about a couple of their assertions.) Susato: Then that's where you must strike next! Ryunosuke: (So I need to pit two more jurors against each other and show there's another contradiction in their assertions.) Susato: Exactly! You can do it! Judge: Well, the Scales of Justice have shifted, but they still weigh heavy on the side of guilt. Counsel, you have the floor again. Continue with your summation examination!

It beggars belief!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I, I really think you should stop waving that needle around... Juror No. 6: You heard what the good coachmen said before, didn't you? That hideous man stabbed the poor fellow! Just like this! Ryunosuke: Y-Yes... That is what he said, you're right. Juror No. 6: ......... McGilded Park is such a lovely little place, too. I've always enjoyed resting my legs there while I get on with my knitting. And I had thought that anyone who donated such a delightful place must be a fine fellow indeed. I suppose I was wrong. ......... Whoever would have thought he was a miserable, murdering moneylender with not a scrap of remorse?! Ryunosuke: (Oh help... She's as sure as sure can be that he's guilty now...) Susato: The old lady certainly seems to know her mind, doesn't she?Pit against Juror No. 3's statement Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: Those two statements are completely contradictory! Judge: Whaaat?! Explain, Counsel, post-haste! Juror No. 6: Oh dearie me! I, I was only knitting a jumper for my other half! Juror No. 3: What is all this claptrap? What does 'contradictory' even mean, I ask you? Ryunosuke: We've heard from more than one witness... ...that they allegedly saw the actual moment when the defendant stabbed the victim. Now, out of curiosity, juror number three... Juror No. 3: What?! Can't you see that I'm busy here? Ryunosuke: ...How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim? What sort of motion was it? Juror No. 3: Ha! Want to test me, do you? It was like this! Stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up! Just like the prim banker said. Judge: Yes, that was Mr Fairplay's testimony. Quite true. Ryunosuke: Now then, juror number six... Juror No. 6: ...Oh! Is that me, is it? What can I do for you, young man? Ryunosuke: How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim, madam? Juror No. 6: Oh, well dear, as far as I understand it... ...it was like this! He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor! ...The coachman said so. Ryunosuke: Now don't move! Take a look at these two jurors! 'He stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up!' And 'He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor!' Judge: Well I never! They're... They're stabbing in totally different directions! Juror No. 3: What?! Juror No. 6: Bless my stitches! What a muddle! Ryunosuke: What this tells us... ...is that there's a strong possibility one of the witnesses isn't telling the truth! Juror No. 6: Oh! Juror No. 3: But why?! Why the dickens would they lie? Ryunosuke: I don't know that yet. But what I do know... ...is that if the trial ends at this point, we may never find out! We may never know the real truth! Ladies and gentlemen of the jury! Can you really let that happen, in all good conscience? Juror No. 6: Lies, you say? Oh dearie me... I can't abide people telling lies! Juror No. 2: The, the scales... Juror No. 5: I don't believe it! Juror No. 1: Juror No. 1: Waaaaaait! Now hear this, my fellow jurors: I warn you, you cannot listen to this man! Look at him, in his black suit! He's...he's...clearly some devious Eastern sorcerer using magic on us all! Ryunosuke: (If I could use magic, do you really think I'd be putting myself through all this?) Juror No. 1: Answer me this, Dark Jinx! Ryunosuke: Huh?! M-Me? Juror No. 1: What exactly is the problem? What of it if two witnesses have slightly different recollections of events? Ryunosuke: What of it? Juror No. 1: Let's say the shylock did stab the victim as he was sat next to him on the omnibus. And this young dandy saw him do it! And now let's say the victim collapsed on the floor, and then the shylock stabbed him again! And this old lady saw him do it! Well? What's to say it didn't happen like that, hm? Juror No. 3: Who are you calling a dandy, sir?! Why, I should take this knife to you! Juror No. 6: Who are you calling old?! Why, I should take this needle to you! Ryunosuke: (Ugh...they're ready to kill each other now... But could the foreman of the jury be right? Did the two witnesses see two different moments of the same crime?)  It's possible Ryunosuke: Hm, it's true... There's an outside chance of almost anything you care to mention. Juror No. 1: Eeexactly the point I've been trying to make! Susato: Before you go any further, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Oh! What is it, Miss Susato? Susato: ...I think you should have a look through the Court Record. Ryunosuke: ......... Ah! Susato: You see? This evidence makes it quite clear. There isn't even an outside chance of what the juror is saying! Ryunosuke: (How did I miss that...?) Leads to: \"Unfortunately, Mr Foreman...\" It's out of the question Leads to: \"Unfortunately, Mr Foreman...\" Ryunosuke: Unfortunately, Mr Foreman... Juror No. 1: Hm? What is it, you dark jinx? Come on, out with it! Ryunosuke: ...What you're suggesting is impossible! It's out of the question! Juror No. 2: ...! Juror No. 4: ...! Juror No. 6: ...! Juror No. 1: What, what are you talking about, man? How can you possibly say that? You, you do realise that I'm...I'm only doing my job! As foreman of the jury, I have a responsibility to steer everyone in the right direction. So where's your evidence, man? That's what we want to see! I say the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime. If you say that's out of the question, show me some proof! Ryunosuke: ......... (It looks like the only way I'm going to convince him is to present him with something he can't dismiss. Some irrefutable hard evidence!) As you wish. Juror No. 1: What? Ryunosuke: I'll give you the proof. It's out of the question that the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime...as proven by...  Present Autopsy Report (before Jurors No. 2 and 5 vote innocent) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: This is the victim's autopsy report. According to what's written here, Mr Mason was stabbed in the abdomen... ...only once. Juror No. 1: Eh?! Only once?! Ryunosuke: It's quite simple! The victim was stabbed precisely one time. Which means these witnesses can't possibly have seen it happen two different times! Juror No. 3: Huuurgh...grrr...hyuuurgh... Alright...I concede defeat! Susato: Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue! Ryunosuke: Two more...

So...we just need to find two jurors with contradictory statements and pit them against each other. ...Which is so much easier said than done!' Is that perhaps what were just thinking? Ryunosuke: How did you know?! Susato: Well, I took the liberty of doing some research, in case you happened to find yourself in just such a situation. Shall I read you what I found out? It is a little long, I'm afraid...  Not right now Susato: '...If I have to rely on advice right from the start, how will I get on later?

Ryunosuke: (I know what I have to do. Let's listen to those assertions one more time...) Please go ahead Susato: Very well. Listen to this...

(She wasn't joking when she said it was long.) Susato: The first step is to listen very carefully to what each individual juror has to say. Then I'm sure you'll start to see which ones might not quite agree with each other. Ryunosuke: Alright then...

Is it cold in here, or is it just me?)Van Zieks: As your antiquated tome no doubt says, the prosecution may not speak during a summation examination. So I honoured a deathly silence...and listened to the charade. It seems I overestimated the intelligence of the jury.Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Juror No. 3: ...!Van Zieks: ...Well, no matter. There is nothing so hard to prove as a self-evident truth, it would seem. No... And why else would we grace the courtroom with our presence after all? So, let us proceed to the next round of battle.

You will explain the various misgivings brought to our attention by the defence's summation examination!Witness Testimony - Various Misgivings -Beppo: I, I only c-carried f-four passengers that night! I swear it! ...B-B-But, um...Fairplay: Well, I for one was told I had to pay fivepence for the bus.Furst: He fiddled us on the fare, he did! And then I saw that blood-curdling sight as well... It's all too much!Fairplay: I tell you, I saw McGilded stabbing that man! Everything I said before stands!Beppo: Oh yes... Yes, he s-s-stabbed him. Yes he did. ...I, I think so, yes.Judge: Counsel, make sense of this for me, please.Van Zieks: The phantom fifth passenger conjured into existence by my learned Eastern friend never existed. The confusion has arisen from the coachman's sly little... cozenage.Beppo: Uhhh...Juror No. 5: Beppo! Explain yourself!Beppo: I'm t-terribly sorry, G-G-Guildmaster!Juror No. 5: The guild's fare is fourpence across the board! You know that! Am I to understand that you've been overcharging our passengers by a penny a fare?Beppo: It's, it's so c-c-cold... And the last r-run of the day is always h-h-half empty...Judge: ......... You have been dishonest, coachman.Beppo: Uhhh... I'm s-sorry...Juror No. 5: You're a disgrace, Beppo! A disgrace! And your selfish actions have brought dishonour on the entire guild!Furst: If I may, sir...? I had to pay tenpence on the bus just last week.Juror No. 5: WHAAAAAAT?Susato: Four passengers at fivepence each is... Yes, twenty pence. I've done the arithmetic ten times already, but I just can't make the result come out differently!Ryunosuke: ...No, that...figures.Judge: Well, it would appear that one of the aforementioned misgivings has already been explained. So, Counsel for the Defense... Your cross-examination, if you please.Van Zieks: We've already had the pleasure of a protracted summation examination today. I see you intend to continue the parlour games.Ryunosuke: ......... ...Absolutely!Cross-Examination - Various Misgivings -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Susato Mikotoba\nDescription: A judicial assistant sent to Britain on a study tour.

No. Judge: And there were no other passengers when the incident took place? No one alighted, for example? Beppo: You're quite right with that, sir. No other passengers like that, no. None. Ryunosuke: (So nobody fled the scene of the crime, then.)  Beppo: I have to say, the boss insists on it running, he does. Every evening. That last b-b-bus of the day. But I, I do wonder sometimes if it's altogether worthwhile. Yes, s-s-sorry to say... Ryunosuke: What do you mean by that? Beppo: Well, what with it being so cold and everything, and only m-making twenty pence on the run, you see...

Fairplay: That's right. When you sit up on the top deck, the window's right there at your feet. There was a lamp on inside, so I had a pretty good view. The two of them were wearing hats and I couldn't exactly make out their faces... ...but there's not a shred of doubt in my mind that it was Mr McGilded. Ryunosuke: How can you be so sure? Fairplay: Well...how can I put it politely? McGilded is a gentleman of...rather small stature. I couldn't have mistaken him for anyone else.

I'm finding it a little hard to adjust. Susato: ...Yes, I do understand. \"M\" insignia Ryunosuke: An ornate letter 'M'... Undeniably Mr Magnus McGilded's initial.

Still got my hearing, you know!Van Zieks: Then, pray tell, why are you yet to pronounce your leaning?Juror No. 6: ......... Well, dear, the thing is, I'm a creature of habit, me. I always go to the park at around this time of day, and sit on a nice bench and get on with my knitting.Van Zieks: .........Juror No. 6: There's a lovely little park just near where I live. McGilded Park, it's called.Ryunosuke: ...!Juror No. 6: The gentleman donated it to the city, you know. To put a smile on Londoners' faces, he said. I can't imagine such a fine, young gentleman would have it in him to take another man's life.He is always doing wonderful things for the city.That's right! A man like that wouldn't stab someone, surely?Mother, may we go to the McGilded Public Library later and borrow some more books?Van Zieks: How many Londoners live with their heads in the clouds?! Do you people not know... ...what kind of a man Magnus McGilded really is?Ryunosuke: What kind of a man is he?!Van Zieks: The philanthropist, Magnus McGilded... ...has enough wealth to purchase the entire city he claims to value so highly. But where did all that wealth come from? Your client is a shylock, sir! And one with the very darkest of souls.Ryunosuke: What?!Juror No. 6: Stone the crows!Van Zieks: McGilded lends money at extortionate rates of interest so his victims have no hope of repaying him. When they default, he takes possession of everything they own. He is a vulture that preys on the weak.Juror No. 6: I've, I've never heard any mention of that before...Van Zieks: Your faculties haven't deserted you, I'm sure, madam. So has this thought not crossed your mind? Would a man wealthy enough to buy London in its entirety not have a carriage of his own?Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: What possible reason could this man have had to make use of a public omnibus service?Juror No. 6: Um...Ryunosuke: You're not saying that...?Van Zieks: The victim - a poor brickmaker - had next to nothing to his name, save considerable financial liability. It will come as no surprise that his creditor was the accused, Magnus McGilded. But let it also be known, that the very day Mr Mason was killed, was the final repayment date for his debts.Judge: Good gracious!Van Zieks: The brickmaker was destitute. He had lost his house. He had not a shilling with which to repay his debts. And in the end, this pitiful soul had the very last thing he owned taken from him...his life. By the merciless philanthropist pretender... Magnus McGilded!Ryunosuke: (I don't believe it!)Susato:Susato: If I might add something briefly...?Ryunosuke: Miss Susato?Susato: You claim that the victim had been lent money by Mr McGilded... ...but where is the evidence to support your claim?Van Zieks: ......... ...Pray forgive the discourtesy of filling my hallowed chalice in a court of law...Judge: Ah-ha, there it is! Lord van Zieks's hallowed chalice!Ryunosuke: (How can this be considered acceptable?!)Van Zieks: ...But I find myself in unexpectedly good humour. I had heard ladies from the Far East could show great courage...but I didn't expect to experience it myself.Susato: Ah! As, as judicial assistant to the defence, I am simply doing my job!Van Zieks: What a pity that your display of courage...is in vain. This is the debtors' ledger, which details all monies loaned by the accused. You will find the victim's name clearly recorded inside.Susato: Oh...Van Zieks: Allow me to present this ledger as evidence... ...and pray forgive the discourtesy of raising my chalice in a toast to the enigmatic East at the same time!Judge: A marvellous toast, Counsel! I will gladly accept this new evidence.The debtors' ledger has been entered into the Court Record.Judge: Ah yes, twenty guineas... The victim owed a considerable sum.Examine evidence Debtors' Ledger Clasp Ryunosuke: ...This portfolio must contain all sorts of secrets of London's gentry. Susato: Oh dear... Do you really think we ought to look inside? Ryunosuke: Well, it's not as though we know any of London's gentry personally, is it? Apart from our great detective friend, perhaps. ......... (Actually, I wonder...) Susato: I assure you we will not find Mr Sholmes's name inside! Ryunosuke: Well, let's see what we find... Writing Susato: Gosh, it's crammed full of gentlemen's names, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Well, I suppose they're probably not all gentlemen at all, are they? (After all, not everyone in this country is well off...) Susato: Ah! Goodness! Ryunosuke: What is it? Susato: Look at this! Do you see the name here? Ryunosuke: 'Bruce Fairplay'... ...Should that mean something to me? It, it does sound strangely familiar, actually... Susato: Bruce Fairplay! The witness testifying at this very moment! Ryunosuke: Oh yes, of course! The banker! Why is his name in here? (...Ah, he borrowed twenty guineas, did he?) And look, the repayment date is fast approaching. Susato: It's possible that this is just a coincidence, of course. But this could be very useful information. The details of the debtors' ledger have been updated in the Court Record. Writing (subsequent times) Susato: Gosh, it's crammed full of gentlemen's names, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Well, I suppose they're probably not all gentlemen at all, are they? (After all, not everyone in this country is well off...)Van Zieks: And the accused made quite certain he had ample recompense.Juror No. 6: ......... Well, it would seem I've... ...I've had the wool pulled over my eyes.Van Zieks: Regrettably, madam, that is the modus operandi of the accused.Juror No. 6: And it's such a pretty little park, too. ...What a scoundrel! .........Still... ...maybe it's all for the best.Ryunosuke: Ah! W-Wait a minute! Let's think about this a little more before-Juror No. 6: I don't stand for nonsense!Ryunosuke: ......... (That was it... The last juror's decision...)Susato: ......... ...Ah, according to this Encyclopaedia of British Law... 'When all members of the jury have concluded that the defendant is guilty... ...court proceedings are suspended, and the presiding judge will deliver the final verdict and sentence.' That's what it says here.Ryunosuke: (Haah... The final verdict... It's over then.)Susato: Oh! There's a footnote, though.Ryunosuke: A footnote?Susato: 'However, the defence-'Judge: All six members of the jury are now in agreement in this case.Van Zieks: Allow me to convey my respect for your swift and righteous decision.Judge: According to the laws of this country, I will now conclude the trial... ...by delivering my final verdict. ...I trust there are no objections?Ryunosuke: ......... ......... Miss Susato, just tell me one thing...Susato: Oh! Yes?Ryunosuke: You were in the middle of saying something before. The footnote in your Encyclopaedia of British Law. 'However, the defence...' What did it say next?Susato: O-Oh yes, of course. One moment... 'When all members of the jury have concluded that the defendant is guilty... ...court proceedings are suspended, and the presiding judge will deliver the final verdict and sentence.' Then the footnote says... 'However, the defence... ...has the right to demand a summation examination of the jurors at this point.'Ryunosuke: A...summation...examination...?Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ...A summation examination? From which century has that tome you have there been resurrected?Susato: Ah!Van Zieks: Judging from the binding, I would say that book is at least fifty years old. Any modern text on British Law wouldn't even give such an antiquated procedure a mention. It's a relic. Long forgotten, and certainly no longer practised. So you're out of luck.Susato: Oh...Ryunosuke: What even is it, Miss Susato? This so-called 'summation examination'?Susato: Oh, um... One moment, and I'll read about it.Van Zieks: ...You would demand the right to a procedure before you even understand what it entails? Hmph, typical Nipponese.Susato: Alright, Mr Naruhodo, I think I understand... It seems that under this procedure, we would be able to appeal to the members of the jury.Ryunosuke: To do what...exactly?Susato: Appeal to them to change their leaning and reverse their decisions. And it says here that... ...'If successful, the proceedings of the trial must be resumed.'Ryunosuke: (Make them reverse their decisions...)Judge: Yes, in times gone by, barristers would use a summation examination to attempt to influence the jury's decision. But that procedure became something of a formality with no practical benefit, really. So it rather fell out of use.Susato: I wonder why...Van Zieks: Because it was devoid of purpose.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: Changing just one member of the jury's mind would be hard enough, let alone several. No self-respecting defence barrister would even assert his right to try in this day and age.Susato: ......... Still... ...I don't see any mention of the procedure actually being formally revoked.Van Zieks: What are you suggesting?Susato: I'm suggesting that although it may be antiquated and largely forgotten...it isn't yet extinct.Van Zieks: ...!Susato: What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: (A summation examination... Our last possible option. Do we assert our right to carry it out, or admit defeat?)Assert our right Leads to: \"The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination, My Lord!\"Forget it Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Mr Naruhodo... Are you sure that's the right decision? Ryunosuke: You heard what the judge and the prosecutor said. It's an antiquated procedure. It's history. We barely know our way around the law that's in use today. What hope would we have of pulling it off? Susato: .........  Perhaps what we don't know can work to our advantage. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Susato: In any case, there's really only one course of action available to us here. What we can't afford to do is allow this trial to end! Ryunosuke: ...! (What we don't know can work to our advantage...?) You're right, Miss Susato. Let's bring this antiquated procedure back into the present day! Leads to: \"The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination, My Lord!\"Ryunosuke: The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination, My Lord!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: London is the capital city of the most powerful nation on earth. We have a duty to the world to exemplify the very highest standards of judicial procedure. Summation examinations are an embarrassment that should remain buried!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: But if it's our right, it's our right! I believe it could prove vital in this trial!Judge: The defence's petition is perfectly valid. The court will proceed with the summation examination!Van Zieks: This is madness...Judge: Foreman, are you and the remainder of the jury ready?Juror No. 1: Eh?! Well, erm, I'm not, erm... There was no mention of this in the letter I received, you see, so...Judge: All members of the jury will be asked to explain on what grounds they have reached their decision.Juror No. 1: On what grounds...?Judge: You must all justify your decisions and explain why you believed the defendant to be guilty.Juror No. 1: Well, My Lord, you're rather putting us on the spot...Juror No. 2: This is most irregular. No mention was made of this before.Juror No. 3: I don't really hold with all this 'justifying' lark.Juror No. 4: .........Ryunosuke: (That seems to have thrown the jurors off...)Susato: It seems none of them have experienced this before.Ryunosuke: (Alright then, the summation examination... A defence procedure no practising lawyer has attempted for years, is it? Well, just maybe... ...it might be the opportunity we've been looking for... to turn this trial around!)Judge: So be it, then. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the court hereby calls upon you... ...to state the grounds on which you find the defendant, Magnus McGilded, guilty of this most serious crime.Judicial Findings - The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1: There was no one else inside the carriage at the time, so it has to have been him.Juror No. 2: I trust the driver. He has an excellent memory, it seems. Four passengers, with fares totalling twenty pence.Juror No. 3: He stuck the chap next to him just like this! Brazen, I must say. Absolutely brazen!Juror No. 4: I have simply typed and collated all the statements made thus far, and drawn the logical conclusion.Juror No. 5: You can trust the guild. Fair fares is our motto. We haven't raised prices above fourpence for years.Juror No. 6: The scoundrel, stabbing that poor man on the floor! It beggars belief!Ryunosuke: (I'm starting to wish I hadn't pushed for this now...)Susato: Some of the jurors don't seem to have wonderfully formed arguments, though, do they?Ryunosuke: Well, let's see what we can do. We need to get these six people to change their minds. (I'll have to throw everything I can at them! And use some very persuasive language...)Susato: Just a moment, Mr Naruhodo. According to my book, that's not quite how it works.Ryunosuke: Oh? I thought I was going to have to thaw their icy minds with some heart-warming rhetoric about the defendant.Susato: Unfortunately... ...once the jurors have decided the defendant is guilty, they're unlikely to heed anything the defence says.Ryunosuke: But, but then...Susato: They've reached their conclusions by their own reasoning, you see. Your pleas will sound like excuses. In fact, it could recoil on you. The more you try to persuade them, the more entrenched they may become.Ryunosuke: Then what on earth am I supposed to do?!Susato: Oh dear. I'm just citing what I've read about British law, Mr Naruhodo.Ryunosuke: Right, I'm sorry. ...Do you have any idea how to make this work, then?Susato: Well, from what I can understand... ...the key to this procedure is using the jurors' own words to make your arguments.Ryunosuke: What do you mean?Susato: Well, the six members of the jury are randomly selected members of the public. They may appear to present a united front, but the truth is... ...they are complete strangers, who just happen to find themselves here in the courtroom together.Ryunosuke: And...that's the way to break them down, you mean?Susato: Yes, exactly. We must listen very carefully to what each member of the jury says... ...and see if we can identify any contradictory statements. If we can, we then contrast the statements and pit the corresponding jurors against each other!Ryunosuke: I see. So it's contradictions in what two or more jurors say that we're looking for. In a way, then... ...this is similar to a regular cross-examination.Susato: Oh! Yes, I, I suppose you're right!Ryunosuke: ......... (Find contradictions in their statements and pit the jurors against one another to break them down... Alright, I might be able to pull this off. ...No, that's not right... I HAVE TO pull this off!)Judge: Can we start proceedings, Counsel? I would ask you to take the stand for this. I'm expecting a clear and concise rebuttal!Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord!Jury Examination - The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1: There was no one else inside the carriage at the time, so it has to have been him.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Certainly, the testimonies we've heard suggest the victim and Mr McGilded were alone inside the carriage. Juror No. 1: Precisely my point. Ryunosuke: But! Could there be some other explanation? Something we haven't considered yet? Juror No. 1: Such as...? Ryunosuke: ......... Haha, well, um...perhaps that's something we could, um... all work out together now? Juror No. 1: Now listen here! Maybe you don't know how things work around here because you're...from foreign climes. But we're here to form our opinions as individuals. And I have! Ryunosuke: Ugh... Susato: Oh dear. He doesn't appear to be in the mood to consider an alternative point of view, does he? Ryunosuke: (No, I'm going to have to pit the jurors against one another, like Susato-san said. Finding contradictions in these six people's assertions is the only way I'm going to succeed...)Juror No. 2: I trust the driver. He has an excellent memory, it seems. Four passengers, with fares totalling twenty pence.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But does his ability to recall his takings that night really tell us how trustworthy the man is? Juror No. 2: I manage all His Lordship's cash affairs, so I'm very particular when it comes to accounts. Ryunosuke: I see... Juror No. 2: A single penny can mean the difference between life and death, after all, can't it? Ryunosuke: ...That's, that's a saying in your country? Juror No. 2: My point is, a man who minds his figures is a man you can trust. Those of us in service would swear to that, sir. Ryunosuke: (Does that bench really need any more polishing...?) Juror No. 2: So if the good driver says that he saw Mr McGilded in the act, I don't doubt him. The only task left to do today is disposing of the rubbish. Ryunosuke: (Ah, now wait a minute... One of the other jurors mentioned something about money, I think.) Susato: Now would be a very good time to listen carefully to the jurors' statements again, Mr Naruhodo. If you notice an inconsistency in what two different jurors are saying... Ryunosuke: ...I should expose it by pitting them against each other. (Yes, let's see if I can do just that...)Pit against Juror No. 5's statement (before Jurors No. 3 and 6 vote innocent) Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: They do? Explain yourself, Counsel! Juror No. 2: Me?! Oh dear, what have I said? Juror No. 5: I swear on Silver Blaze's mane and name, I haven't the first idea what you're talking about! Ryunosuke: According to the group testimony we've heard so far... ...there were four passengers on the omnibus on the night in question. And according to the coachman, Mr Beppo, he took twenty pence in fares. Juror No. 4: Quite right. I have those precise details typed neatly here in front of me. Ryunosuke: And juror number five also told us the following: The fare for the omnibus...is always fourpence. Juror No. 5: That it is. A fair and convenient single price. Just the way London's carriages should be operated! Ryunosuke: But that doesn't add up at all. In fact, it leaves a glaring discrepancy in the facts. Juror No. 5: Why, man, why?! Ryunosuke: Four passengers paying fourpence each. If you do the multiplication... Juror No. 2: Ah! It would be sixteen pence! Ryunosuke: Exactly. As I said, it doesn't add up. The figures are different. By fourpence, in fact. ...Or precisely one person's fare. Judge: One person's fare? Ryunosuke: Yes! In other words, on the omnibus that night... ...it's distinctly possible...there was another passenger we've heard nothing about! Judge: Good gracious! Juror No. 5: This, this can't be right! The coachmen of the guild are good, honest men, one and all! Trustworthiness is our watchword! Juror No. 4: The figures your coachman claims most certainly do not add up. Your watchword, good sir, is a fallacy! Juror No. 5: I beg your pardon?! Ryunosuke: Mr Guildmaster, I think you ought to consider that if this trial were to end now... ...the news will surely spread all over London. The news that one of your coachmen tried to hide the fact that he lets nefarious characters ride his omnibus. Juror No. 5: ...! Alright then, how do I make it so this miserable trial doesn't end, hm? Susato: Well, according to my book here... ...you simply launch a ball of fire onto the innocent side of the set of scales! Juror No. 1: Now hold your horses there, coachman! We were all in agreement! Why do you have to go and- Juror No. 5: Wait till I get my hands on you, Beppo!!! Juror No. 1: Argh! This is all very irritating... Juror No. 2: Begging your pardon, sir, I'm going to do the same. Juror No. 1: For the love of Mike! Not you as well?! Juror No. 2: A penny can be the difference between a smile and a tear, after all. I certainly can't put my trust in someone who doesn't follow my exacting standards in financial matters. Juror No. 1: Oh really? Juror No. 2: I, for one, think it's only proper that we hear from the witnesses again. Susato: Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue! Ryunosuke: Two more... (Actually... ...there is something else that's bothering me about a couple of their assertions.) Susato: Then that's where you must strike next! Ryunosuke: (So I need to pit two more jurors against each other and show there's another contradiction in their assertions.) Susato: Exactly! You can do it! Judge: Well, the Scales of Justice have shifted, but they still weigh heavy on the side of guilt. Counsel, you have the floor again. Continue with your summation examination! Changes Juror No. 2's statement to \"I'm changing my leaning to innocent. I should like to hear what the slipshod bookkeeper has to say for himself!\" and Juror No. 5's statement to \"Grrr! Beppo! This trial has to continue so I can get to the bottom of this corruption! Not guilty, I say!\"Pit against Juror No. 5's statement (after Jurors No. 3 and 6 vote innocent) Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: They do? Explain yourself, Counsel! Juror No. 2: Me?! Oh dear, what have I said? Juror No. 5: I swear on Silver Blaze's mane and name, I haven't the first idea what you're talking about!

I should like to hear what the slipshod bookkeeper has to say for himself!Juror No. 3: He stuck the chap next to him just like this! Brazen, I must say. Absolutely brazen!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Careful! You, you could hurt somebody with that! Juror No. 3: Tsk! You're a fine one to talk! What of that sword hanging from your waist, hm? Ryunosuke: No no! That's...just my battered soul... Juror No. 3: Well anyway, I despise anyone with too much money. They're all the same. All stabbing some brickmaker or other behind the scenes, you mark my words! Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: That...seems very unlikely, doesn't it? Juror No. 3: Are you mad, man? We know that small shorty is a rotten shylock! Ryunosuke: Well, yes, that does seem to be the case, but- Susato: Mr Naruhodo! Please! Be careful what you say! Juror No. 3: If he's been trying to squeeze money out of us less fortunate, then as far as I'm concerned... ...he's as guilty as sin! The man can hang! Ryunosuke: (Come to think of it... ...didn't one of the other jurors have something to say about the defendant's underhand activities?) Susato: If you've thought of something, Mr Naruhodo, don't let it go! Test your theory! Ryunosuke: (Pit the two jurors whose statements seem to be contradictory against each other...? No time like the present to use [X / Y / R] to 'Pit' them against each other...or I'll never get anywhere...)Pit against Juror No. 6's statement Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: Those two statements are completely contradictory! Judge: Whaaat?! Explain, Counsel, post-haste! Juror No. 6: Oh dearie me! I, I was only knitting a jumper for my other half! Juror No. 3: What is all this claptrap? What does 'contradictory' even mean, I ask you? Ryunosuke: We've heard from more than one witness... ...that they allegedly saw the actual moment when the defendant stabbed the victim. Now, out of curiosity, juror number three... Juror No. 3: What?! Can't you see that I'm busy here? Ryunosuke: ...How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim? What sort of motion was it? Juror No. 3: Ha! Want to test me, do you? It was like this! Stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up! Just like the prim banker said. Judge: Yes, that was Mr Fairplay's testimony. Quite true. Ryunosuke: Now then, juror number six... Juror No. 6: ...Oh! Is that me, is it? What can I do for you, young man? Ryunosuke: How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim, madam? Juror No. 6: Oh, well dear, as far as I understand it... ...it was like this! He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor! ...The coachman said so. Ryunosuke: Now don't move! Take a look at these two jurors! 'He stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up!' And 'He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor!' Judge: Well I never! They're... They're stabbing in totally different directions! Juror No. 3: What?! Juror No. 6: Bless my stitches! What a muddle! Ryunosuke: What this tells us... ...is that there's a strong possibility one of the witnesses isn't telling the truth! Juror No. 6: Oh! Juror No. 3: But why?! Why the dickens would they lie? Ryunosuke: I don't know that yet. But what I do know... ...is that if the trial ends at this point, we may never find out! We may never know the real truth! Ladies and gentlemen of the jury! Can you really let that happen, in all good conscience? Juror No. 6: Lies, you say? Oh dearie me... I can't abide people telling lies! Juror No. 2: The, the scales... Juror No. 5: I don't believe it! Juror No. 1: Juror No. 1: Waaaaaait! Now hear this, my fellow jurors: I warn you, you cannot listen to this man! Look at him, in his black suit! He's...he's...clearly some devious Eastern sorcerer using magic on us all! Ryunosuke: (If I could use magic, do you really think I'd be putting myself through all this?) Juror No. 1: Answer me this, Dark Jinx! Ryunosuke: Huh?! M-Me? Juror No. 1: What exactly is the problem? What of it if two witnesses have slightly different recollections of events? Ryunosuke: What of it? Juror No. 1: Let's say the shylock did stab the victim as he was sat next to him on the omnibus. And this young dandy saw him do it! And now let's say the victim collapsed on the floor, and then the shylock stabbed him again! And this old lady saw him do it! Well? What's to say it didn't happen like that, hm? Juror No. 3: Who are you calling a dandy, sir?! Why, I should take this knife to you! Juror No. 6: Who are you calling old?! Why, I should take this needle to you! Ryunosuke: (Ugh...they're ready to kill each other now... But could the foreman of the jury be right? Did the two witnesses see two different moments of the same crime?)  It's possible Ryunosuke: Hm, it's true... There's an outside chance of almost anything you care to mention. Juror No. 1: Eeexactly the point I've been trying to make! Susato: Before you go any further, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Oh! What is it, Miss Susato? Susato: ...I think you should have a look through the Court Record. Ryunosuke: ......... Ah! Susato: You see? This evidence makes it quite clear. There isn't even an outside chance of what the juror is saying! Ryunosuke: (How did I miss that...?) Leads to: \"Unfortunately, Mr Foreman...\" It's out of the question Leads to: \"Unfortunately, Mr Foreman...\" Ryunosuke: Unfortunately, Mr Foreman... Juror No. 1: Hm? What is it, you dark jinx? Come on, out with it! Ryunosuke: ...What you're suggesting is impossible! It's out of the question! Juror No. 2: ...! Juror No. 4: ...! Juror No. 6: ...! Juror No. 1: What, what are you talking about, man? How can you possibly say that? You, you do realise that I'm...I'm only doing my job! As foreman of the jury, I have a responsibility to steer everyone in the right direction. So where's your evidence, man? That's what we want to see! I say the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime. If you say that's out of the question, show me some proof! Ryunosuke: ......... (It looks like the only way I'm going to convince him is to present him with something he can't dismiss. Some irrefutable hard evidence!) As you wish. Juror No. 1: What? Ryunosuke: I'll give you the proof. It's out of the question that the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime...as proven by...  Present Autopsy Report (before Jurors No. 2 and 5 vote innocent) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: This is the victim's autopsy report. According to what's written here, Mr Mason was stabbed in the abdomen... ...only once. Juror No. 1: Eh?! Only once?! Ryunosuke: It's quite simple! The victim was stabbed precisely one time. Which means these witnesses can't possibly have seen it happen two different times! Juror No. 3: Huuurgh...grrr...hyuuurgh... Alright...I concede defeat! Susato: Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue! Ryunosuke: Two more... (Actually... ...there is something else that's bothering me about a couple of their assertions.) Susato: Then that's where you must strike next! Ryunosuke: (So I need to pit two more jurors against each other and show there's another contradiction in their assertions.) Susato: Exactly! You can do it! Judge: Well, the Scales of Justice have shifted, but they still weigh heavy on the side of guilt. Counsel, you have the floor again. Continue with your summation examination! Changes Juror No. 3's statement to \"I'm no lover of the rich, but I despise liars even more!

They say I've got no powers of persuasion. Ryunosuke: Oh, I see... Erm... I'm sorry to hear that...? Juror No. 1: But no one will need persuading about this: You're even worse than me! Ryunosuke: Aaagh! (Two different moments... In other words, the victim was stabbed two times... Ah! But we have evidence that clearly contradicts that possibility!) If you'll allow me another chance...I'd like to present you with one more piece of evidence to consider.

Juror No. 4: ......... Ryunosuke: What have you been doing all this time? Juror No. 4: 'What have you been doing all this time?'... There. ...I should have thought it was obvious. I am recording everything that takes place as part of these proceedings. Ryunosuke: And...what have you learnt from that? Juror No. 4: For example, at this moment in time, the judge has used his gavel eleven times in total... ...the prosecution has snorted derisively at your remarks seven times in total... ...and, I might add, each time you have gawped like a simpleton. Ryunosuke: ...Thank you. (And what's the point exactly?) So anyway, madam, are you able to explain why you think the defendant is guilty? Juror No. 4: ......... That is a conclusion I have drawn as a result of the copious notes I have typed. Ryunosuke: Clearly! But I'm asking you to explain WHY you've drawn that conclusion! Juror No. 4: Please don't distract me. It makes it extremely hard to concentrate on my note-keeping. Ryunosuke: (This is going nowhere...)Juror No. 5: You can trust the guild. Fair fares is our motto. We haven't raised prices above fourpence for years.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That's how much it costs to take the omnibus? Juror No. 5: That's right. As the guildmaster, I decided to set a policy for all drivers across the city. One fare, no matter which bus you take or how far you're going. We have to compete with the rise of the motor car, you see. Us coachmen have to make a stand together! Ryunosuke: Motor cars, you say? Juror No. 5: Yes. And this murder on one of our buses is extremely damaging to our cause! It's beyond the pale! It'll lead to a decline in passengers, you mark my words! And it's all that rascal's fault! He has to pay! Ryunosuke: (Is it the crime or his buses he's more worried about...?) Juror No. 5: Anyway, every member of my guild is reliable and trustworthy. So if the driver says he saw him do it, that fellow in the dock is as guilty as sin!Pit against Juror No. 2's statement (before Jurors No. 3 and 6 vote innocent) Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: They do? Explain yourself, Counsel! Juror No. 2: Me?! Oh dear, what have I said? Juror No. 5: I swear on Silver Blaze's mane and name, I haven't the first idea what you're talking about! Ryunosuke: According to the group testimony we've heard so far... ...there were four passengers on the omnibus on the night in question. And according to the coachman, Mr Beppo, he took twenty pence in fares. Juror No. 4: Quite right. I have those precise details typed neatly here in front of me. Ryunosuke: And juror number five also told us the following: The fare for the omnibus...is always fourpence. Juror No. 5: That it is. A fair and convenient single price. Just the way London's carriages should be operated! Ryunosuke: But that doesn't add up at all. In fact, it leaves a glaring discrepancy in the facts. Juror No. 5: Why, man, why?! Ryunosuke: Four passengers paying fourpence each. If you do the multiplication... Juror No. 2: Ah! It would be sixteen pence! Ryunosuke: Exactly. As I said, it doesn't add up. The figures are different. By fourpence, in fact. ...Or precisely one person's fare. Judge: One person's fare? Ryunosuke: Yes! In other words, on the omnibus that night... ...it's distinctly possible...there was another passenger we've heard nothing about! Judge: Good gracious! Juror No. 5: This, this can't be right!

Juror No. 2: Begging your pardon, sir, I'm going to do the same. Juror No. 1: For the love of Mike! Not you as well?! Juror No. 2: A penny can be the difference between a smile and a tear, after all. I certainly can't put my trust in someone who doesn't follow my exacting standards in financial matters. Juror No. 1: Oh really?

Explain, Counsel, post-haste! Juror No. 6: Oh dearie me! I, I was only knitting a jumper for my other half! Juror No. 3: What is all this claptrap? What does 'contradictory' even mean, I ask you? Ryunosuke: We've heard from more than one witness... ...that they allegedly saw the actual moment when the defendant stabbed the victim. Now, out of curiosity, juror number three... Juror No. 3: What?! Can't you see that I'm busy here? Ryunosuke: ...How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim? What sort of motion was it? Juror No. 3: Ha! Want to test me, do you? It was like this! Stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up! Just like the prim banker said. Judge: Yes, that was Mr Fairplay's testimony. Quite true. Ryunosuke: Now then, juror number six... Juror No. 6: ...Oh! Is that me, is it? What can I do for you, young man? Ryunosuke: How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim, madam? Juror No. 6: Oh, well dear, as far as I understand it... ...it was like this! He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor! ...The coachman said so. Ryunosuke: Now don't move! Take a look at these two jurors! 'He stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up!' And 'He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor!' Judge: Well I never! They're... They're stabbing in totally different directions! Juror No. 3: What?! Juror No. 6: Bless my stitches! What a muddle! Ryunosuke: What this tells us... ...is that there's a strong possibility one of the witnesses isn't telling the truth! Juror No. 6: Oh! Juror No. 3: But why?! Why the dickens would they lie? Ryunosuke: I don't know that yet. But what I do know... ...is that if the trial ends at this point, we may never find out! We may never know the real truth! Ladies and gentlemen of the jury! Can you really let that happen, in all good conscience? Juror No. 6: Lies, you say? Oh dearie me... I can't abide people telling lies! Juror No. 2: The, the scales... Juror No. 5: I don't believe it! Juror No. 1: Juror No. 1: Waaaaaait! Now hear this, my fellow jurors: I warn you, you cannot listen to this man! Look at him, in his black suit! He's...he's...clearly some devious Eastern sorcerer using magic on us all! Ryunosuke: (If I could use magic, do you really think I'd be putting myself through all this?) Juror No. 1: Answer me this, Dark Jinx! Ryunosuke: Huh?! M-Me? Juror No. 1: What exactly is the problem? What of it if two witnesses have slightly different recollections of events? Ryunosuke: What of it? Juror No. 1: Let's say the shylock did stab the victim as he was sat next to him on the omnibus. And this young dandy saw him do it! And now let's say the victim collapsed on the floor, and then the shylock stabbed him again! And this old lady saw him do it! Well? What's to say it didn't happen like that, hm? Juror No. 3: Who are you calling a dandy, sir?! Why, I should take this knife to you! Juror No. 6: Who are you calling old?! Why, I should take this needle to you! Ryunosuke: (Ugh...they're ready to kill each other now... But could the foreman of the jury be right? Did the two witnesses see two different moments of the same crime?)  It's possible Ryunosuke: Hm, it's true... There's an outside chance of almost anything you care to mention. Juror No. 1: Eeexactly the point I've been trying to make! Susato: Before you go any further, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Oh! What is it, Miss Susato? Susato: ...I think you should have a look through the Court Record. Ryunosuke: ......... Ah! Susato: You see? This evidence makes it quite clear. There isn't even an outside chance of what the juror is saying! Ryunosuke: (How did I miss that...?) Leads to: \"Unfortunately, Mr Foreman...\" It's out of the question Leads to: \"Unfortunately, Mr Foreman...\" Ryunosuke: Unfortunately, Mr Foreman... Juror No. 1: Hm? What is it, you dark jinx?

Is it cold in here, or is it just me?)Van Zieks: As your antiquated tome no doubt says, the prosecution may not speak during a summation examination.

There is nothing so hard to prove as a self-evident truth, it would seem. No... And why else would we grace the courtroom with our presence after all? So, let us proceed to the next round of battle.

Yes he did. ...I, I think so, yes.Judge: Counsel, make sense of this for me, please.Van Zieks: The phantom fifth passenger conjured into existence by my learned Eastern friend never existed.

You have been dishonest, coachman.Beppo: Uhhh... I'm s-sorry...Juror No. 5: You're a disgrace, Beppo! A disgrace! And your selfish actions have brought dishonour on the entire guild!Furst: If I may, sir...? I had to pay tenpence on the bus just last week.Juror No. 5: WHAAAAAAT?Susato: Four passengers at fivepence each is... Yes, twenty pence. I've done the arithmetic ten times already, but I just can't make the result come out differently!Ryunosuke: ...No, that...figures.Judge: Well, it would appear that one of the aforementioned misgivings has already been explained. So, Counsel for the Defense... Your cross-examination, if you please.Van Zieks: We've already had the pleasure of a protracted summation examination today. I see you intend to continue the parlour games.Ryunosuke: ......... ...Absolutely!Cross-Examination - Various Misgivings -Beppo: I, I only c-carried f-four passengers that night! I swear it! ...B-B-But, um...Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So, there were only four passengers on your carriage, but you didn't charge them the standard fourpence fare. Is that right? Beppo: ......... It's, it's imp-p-possible to make the last run of the day p-p-pay! I was so c-c-cold, it was all I could d-do to stop myself p-p-passing out! Ryunosuke: ...I'm getting chilblains just listening to you. Beppo: It was t-t-terrible! So I wanted to give myself a p-p-pat on the back for even keeping the b-bus running! Doesn't a d-dedicated coachman d-deserve an extra p-p-penny per p-p-p-p-passenger? Ryunosuke: ...You're digging a deeper hole for yourself here... (If only there had been a fifth passenger on the omnibus that night... Then we would have had another suspect.) Van Zieks: .........Fairplay: Well, I for one was told I had to pay fivepence for the bus.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Does that mean everyone on board that night paid fivepence instead of four? Furst: Well, I paid fivepence, too, sir. Fairplay: And I just told you that I did. Beppo: A flat f-fare of fivepence across the b-b-board! Ryunosuke: (It's not something to be proud of...) Van Zieks: The so-called discrepancy my learned friend identified was nothing of the sort. Much like the phantom killer you so desperately needed, it's gone. Dead...and buried... Ryunosuke: (I'd have been happy if it had ever existed in the first place...)Furst: He fiddled us on the fare, he did! And then I saw that blood-curdling sight as well... It's all too much!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: This 'blood-curdling' sight... You mean the murder, I presume? Furst: Yes, sir! Judge: A loathsome sight. No one should have to witness the horror in the eyes of a man the moment his life is taken. Furst: Oh, well...not exactly, sir. I mean, I didn't actually see the exact moment the gent was stabbed. Judge: Good gracious! Really? Van Zieks: We have another witness who did, however. The banker has already testified to it. Ryunosuke: (Hm, but Mr Furst didn't actually see the point at which the victim was killed. That may turn out to be very significant...) Furst: I heard the banker gent next to me take a sharp intake of breath, see. That's when I looked through the glass. That's, that's when I saw that horrible blade poking out from his belly, all covered in blood! Every time I see a knife now, I can't help screaming. Even when I'm eating...Fairplay: I tell you, I saw McGilded stabbing that man! Everything I said before stands!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you saw the defendant, Mr McGilded, stabbing the victim, Mr Mason, who was sitting next to him? Fairplay: ...That's, that's what I said, isn't it? Ryunosuke: (It was bothering me before, this was. For just a brief moment, he hesitated before answering the question.) Fairplay: Anyway, there was only the two of them inside the carriage, wasn't there? Van Zieks: ...There's been much talk of a fifth passenger. But as yet...zero evidence. Fairplay: Then what are we wasting all this time for, eh? It's black and white! The man's guilty! Ryunosuke: ......... (Something about Mr Fairplay's testimony just...jars with me... I wish I could work out what it was...)Beppo: Oh yes... Yes, he s-s-stabbed him. Yes he did. ...I, I think so, yes.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Earlier, you testified that you saw the moment when the defendant allegedly stabbed the victim, didn't you? Beppo: Oh, yes. Yes, that's right. Ryunosuke: You said that the victim was on the floor, and described the assailant holding the knife in an ice pick grip. Beppo: ......... I, I suppose... ...I m-might have...you know. Yes... P-P-Put the c-cart before the horse, maybe... Judge: What's this? Beppo: Well, I'm q-quite sure about m-most of it... I was d-driving the horses when I heard a scream f-f-from the seats on the roof deck. Furst: Oh! I expect that was me, sir. Beppo: Then when I t-t-turned around...yes. Yes, I s-saw it through the skylight. The g-gentleman was on the floor, and the knife was s-sticking up out of his m-m-midriff. That's right, yes. And the f-f-fellow holding the h-handle was the f-famous man. Yes. Ryunosuke: So, in short... ...you didn't see the moment when the victim was actually stabbed at all? Beppo: ......... ...I, I r-really thought that I did, b-b-but... ...but when I g-go over it again in my head... ...no. I, I suppose I d-didn't actually see the p-precise moment of the s-stabbing, did I? Pursue Bruce Fairplay Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you have something to say about that, Mr Fairplay? Fairplay: Now you listen to me! I know what you're thinking! 'He didn't really see the exact moment the fellow was stabbed! What are the chances of that?' ...Eh? Ryunosuke: ...Are you asking me or telling me? (He's getting flustered. I might be able to extract some new information from him if I answer him cleverly... Could he have just happened to see the exact moment the crime was committed?) No chance! Ryunosuke: Well, it is a little hard to believe, certainly. Unless you spend your time peeping through a skylight on the top of an omnibus, that is. Leads to: \"Peeping?!\" Some days are like that Ryunosuke: Well, I suppose some days are like that. Sooner or later you'll see something you wish you hadn't... ...if you're always peeping through a skylight on the top of an omnibus. Leads to: \"Peeping?!\" Fairplay: Peeping?! I'm a, a respectable city banker, I'll have you know! And I know what I saw! I remember it as clear as a Ballarat day! It was a grim scene, I don't mind telling you... Judge: Thank you, Mr Fairplay. Fairplay: Oh! Excuse me if I was getting a little hot under the collar there, My Lord. Judge: I would ask you to supplement your testimony with a clear statement about what exactly you saw. Fairplay: Oh, I can do that alright. I'll tell you just how grim it was! Adds statement \"D'you think I'd forget the sight of those blood-soaked hands after that butcher stabbed the man?!\" Beppo: In, in fact, now that I c-c-come to think of it... ...it, it m-m-must've already happened when I heard the scream... Juror No. 1: Ah! Juror No. 3: Of course! Juror No. 5: That goes without saying! Ryunosuke: (But I really wish he had said it earlier...) Van Zieks: The autopsy report makes it quite clear that the victim was stabbed only once. Which means... ...the banker was witness to the fatal wound that ended Mr Mason's life. Judge: Hm...Fairplay: D'you think I'd forget the sight of those blood-soaked hands after that butcher stabbed the man?!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Blood-soaked?! Fairplay: Ahem! Well, perhaps 'soaked' is laying it on a little thick, but... But anyway! There was definitely blood all over them. Both of them were covered in it! Ryunosuke: And you saw that from the roof? Through the skylight? Fairplay: Well, the skylight's reasonably large, so I had a pretty good view. And there was a lamp on inside the carriage as well. So I'm quite sure of what I saw! Ryunosuke: (Hm...this banker's latest statement... I feel sure there's something not quite right about it.) Susato: When you feel something doesn't add up, Mr Naruhodo... ...that's when you should have a good look through the Court Record!Present Defendant's Leather Gloves Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Blood-soaked...hands?\"Ryunosuke: (Not long ago, this trial very nearly came to an end. Somehow, we've managed to keep our chances alive here. I can't waste this cross-examination! I have to use it to bring some new facts to light!)Susato: Hm, if you're not careful when you press these witnesses... ...the danger is that the jury will end up believing something...unhelpful, as they did before.Ryunosuke: Maybe. ...But we can't let the fear of that happening stop us from uncovering important new information.Susato: ...! Yes, you're so right.Ryunosuke: (I need to pay careful attention here. I don't want to miss even a flicker of a reaction among these witnesses!)Susato: Remember, if you happen to spot one of the witnesses reacting in a strange way... ...don't hesitate to pursue them as to the reason!Ryunosuke: Blood-soaked...hands?Fairplay: Well, I admit that 'soaked' might be laying it on a little thick, but... But anyway! There was definitely blood all over them. Both of them were covered in it!Ryunosuke: Well, I'm very sorry to disagree, Mr Fairplay, but that's more than a little peculiar.Fairplay: What?Ryunosuke: Here are the gloves worn by the defendant, Mr McGilded, on the night in question.Fairplay: Oh...yes...right...Ryunosuke: And there certainly does appear to be a sizeable dark-coloured stain there. But, as I'm sure you can clearly see... ...it's only on the right-hand glove.Fairplay: Arrrrgh!Ryunosuke: In short, Mr Fairplay... ...your testimony is inconsistent!Fairplay: Gyaaagh! But, but...no! That can't be right!Juror No. 6: So you're the liar here then!Fairplay: Gargh!Juror No. 3: That's right! You were quite clear about it. You said - Hyuurgh! - it was both hands!Fairplay: Grrr...Ryunosuke: Mr Fairplay. If your last statement was a lie... ...it calls your entire testimony into question. You say you saw the moment the victim was stabbed. ...But is that really the truth?!Fairplay: Argh! I...well... I...Van Zieks:Van Zieks: It was a simple mistake. You can't justify accusing this man of lying! Yes, it wasn't both hands; it was only one. But the fact remains... ...the victim's blood was on the accused!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: No! Mr Fairplay categorically stated that he saw blood 'all over both hands'! Which means there's a strong possibility that this witness was deliberately trying to mislead the court!Fairplay: Gaaargh! Why? Why?! I'm a city banker, for pity's sake! My word should be...the gold standard! I'm a gentleman, not some guttersnipe! Upstanding members of society don't prevaricate!Ryunosuke: (He's claiming to have no reason to lie... But is that really the case?)Susato: Mr Naruhodo! If we had some evidence to explain why Mr Fairplay might be lying... ...it could turn the tide in this trial completely!Ryunosuke: (Something to show this man has a compelling reason to lie in his testimony...)There's no evidence Ryunosuke: Yes. ...If only we had some evidence like that. Judge: Hmph. So the defence has nothing? Fairplay: Whew... Susato: Ah! Mr Naruhodo! Did you see that? Ryunosuke: Yes... He let out an audible sigh of relief. (Does that mean there IS some evidence that would show why he might lie?) Susato: I think perhaps...we should consult the Court Record again. From Mr Fairplay's reaction, I wonder if there's some evidence we haven't properly examined yet. Ryunosuke: (Yes, we ought to look at everything in as much detail as possible!) My Lord! Judge: Yes, Counsel? Ryunosuke: The defence is ready to present evidence! Evidence that will clearly demonstrate why Mr Fairplay had reason to lie in his testimony! Judge: I'm afraid, Counsel... ...that before I can allow that to happen, I shall have to penalise you for that reckless about-turn. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (I suppose that's fair play...) Leads to: \"...Very well.\"I have evidence Ryunosuke: My Lord! Judge: Yes, Counsel? Ryunosuke: The defence is ready to present evidence! Judge: By Jove! Are you sure? Ryunosuke: Yes. Evidence that will clearly demonstrate why Mr Fairplay had reason to lie in his testimony! Fairplay: GAAARGH!!! Leads to: \"...Very well.\"Judge: ...Very well. I hereby call on the defence to present its evidence. The evidence that demonstrates a motive for the witness's alleged deception of the court!Present Debtors' Ledger (after examining writing) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"This is a list of the debtors who owe money to Mr McGilded.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Judge: Yes... I believe this evidence does indeed demonstrate a deception of sorts. The deception by the defence that it is in any way competent. Ryunosuke: Ah... Van Zieks: A deception that won't pass muster in a British court of law, my...unlearned friend. Here's to that message being carved into your mind. Ryunosuke: Uwaaaaaagh! Susato: Mr Naruhodo... I wonder if perhaps there are some details we've overlooked in the Court Record. Do you think it might be wise to check over all the evidence again? Ryunosuke: (Yes, it looks like I need to thoroughly examine every piece of evidence we have...) Leads back to: \"...Very well.\"Ryunosuke: This is a list of the debtors who owe money to Mr McGilded.Van Zieks: ...Yes, a list of innocent victims, crippled by the accused's extortion.Ryunosuke: The point is, among the names of these debtors is your name... ...Mr Bruce Fairplay.Fairplay: ...!Judge: What?! Mr Fairplay! Are you currently indebted financially to the accused?Fairplay: Arrrgh! No! Well...it's, it's barely worthy of being called a debt...Ryunosuke: According to this ledger, you owe twenty guineas. Not an inconsiderable sum of money, wouldn't you say?Fairplay: Argh! Well, well what of it?!Ryunosuke: Let's suppose Mr McGilded were to be found guilty of murder... What would become of your debt in that case?Judge: Hm, these documents state that the loan agreement is forged between two individual parties. Therefore, were the creditor - the defendant here - to be sentenced to a capital punishment... ...all outstanding debts which were owed to him would be annulled. They would cease to exist.Susato: Cease to exist?!Ryunosuke: Mr Fairplay! Is it not the case that you claimed in your testimony to have seen something you never in fact saw... ...in a devious attempt...to annul your debt of twenty guineas to the defendant!Fairplay: Gugh... GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! ...Mr Bruce Fairplay!Fairplay: Y-Yes, My Laaarghd?Judge: Let me ask you again. And be aware that your answer may have most serious implications upon your future, sir.Fairplay: Grrr...Judge: Did you or did you not... ...see the precise moment in time at which the defendant is alleged to have thrust a knife into the victim?Fairplay: ......... .........Ryunosuke: Your silence speaks volumes! You did NOT tell the truth in your testimony!Fairplay: Alright! Now let's not make a melodrama out of this. Perhaps I did...overstate the truth a pinch.Ryunosuke: A pinch?Fairplay: But it makes no difference! I definitely remember seeing blood on McGilded's hands! Both of them!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: And yet! Only one of the defendant's gloves, which we have here as evidence, is stained!Fairplay: Grrr... So you keep saying!Furst: ......... I, I wonder if I might be allowed to speak, sir?Judge: Go ahead, Mr Furst.Furst: Well, the thing is...I think I remember seeing it myself, as it happens.Ryunosuke: Seeing what?Furst: The blood, sir. On the assailant's hands. I think... Yes, I'm, I'm almost sure that it was on both of his hands, not just one.Ryunosuke: Wha...? WHAAAT?!Judge: Hmph. It would appear that we're going to need further testimony from all you witnesses. This time, I would like to know precisely what you DID and what you did NOT see! ...Do I make myself perfectly clear?Fairplay: Y-Yaaarghsss...Susato: Mr Naruhodo! This is good news! The course of the trial seems to have shifted slightly at last!Ryunosuke: Yes! (I might finally have a chance to turn things around here...)Witness Testimony - What the Witnesses Really Saw -Fairplay: There was blood on both hands of the assailant. I sincerely and distinctly remember that! However...I, I suppose you might say that I didn't see the exact moment the stabbing transpired...if that matters.Furst: I remember seeing the knife. And, and I remember seeing both of the attacker's hands with blood on them.Beppo: I, I d-didn't actually s-see anything myself. No. N-Not until I h-heard that scream.Fairplay: Anyway, the fact remains! There can't have been anyone else inside that carriage, or we all would have seen!Judge: Well, lo and behold... ...in truth of fact, not one of you was witness to the crucial moment the crime was perpetrated!Fairplay: I, I apologise, My Lord! But... But honestly... Argh! There was no one else inside that carriage, and the man's hands were covered in blood! Grrr... That much incriminating evidence is tantamount to saying we saw the man do it!Ryunosuke: That's...really not what testimony is about.Van Zieks: ...Let us examine the interior of the omnibus once more. The victim's fresh blood is clearly visible on the seat, corroborating the witnesses' accounts. In other words, there is no substantial - nor significant - change in the facts of the case.Judge: Hm... Very well.

Fairplay: That's right. When you sit up on the top deck, the window's right there at your feet. There was a lamp on inside, so I had a pretty good view. The two of them were wearing hats and I couldn't exactly make out their faces... ...but there's not a shred of doubt in my mind that it was Mr McGilded. Ryunosuke: How can you be so sure?

Ah yes, it seems that's how the members of the jury give their verdicts. Ryunosuke: ...With fire? Susato: Apparently, yes. White for innocent, and black for guilty. As the six members of the jury make up their minds about the case... ...one by one, they each cast a ball of fire into the great Scales of Justice...as we saw a moment ago.

So I was just gazing absent-mindedly around. But then! ...Then I happened to look down through the skylight! It, it, it was sticking right out from his belly! That, that huge, great knife! Judge: Hmph. A grim sight indeed. Ryunosuke: Ah! (That didn't help me at all! The jury look like they're even more convinced my client did it than they were before...) Susato: That appears to have made everyone even more dubious that Mr McGilded is telling the truth. If only we had some evidence to counter their suspicions... Van Zieks: Mr Furst! Furst: Oh! Yes, yes, sir? Van Zieks: Is this the knife you saw? Furst: Oh, good grief! Yes! That's it! The very one, sir! Ryunosuke: Is, is that...? Van Zieks: Yes, Counsel. This is the blade that was driven into the victim's belly like a stake through the heart. Judge: That is a blade of considerable size, Counsel. Van Zieks: It is. And furthermore, the scabbard is emblazoned prominently with a certain initial. The letter 'M'. ...Which seems oddly familiar. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (Please, no...) Van Zieks: 'M' for 'Magnus' perhaps? Or 'McGilded' possibly? ...Take your pick. It seems this particular big name in London made a... magnificent mistake. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But! But there are 'M's everywhere! Like...like... Yes! Like in 'Mason'! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: This blade is far too extravagant for a poor brickmaker to have owned. No! This weapon of murder almost certainly belongs to the accused! Ryunosuke: Ugh... Judge: Hm, not conclusive, but certainly compelling, Counsel. The murder weapon has been entered into the Court Record. My Lord! Judge: Hm? Juror number three? What's the meaning of this? Juror No. 3: My mind is made up, My Lord. Completely and utterly made up! Ryunosuke: Made up about what...? Juror No. 3: I don't like the stinking rich. Never have. They're always up to something or other that they shouldn't be. Every one of them. And that little leprechaun of a man is no exception. Well...he can't fool me! There's no point in wasting time listening to any more of this. That's my opinion on the matter, anyway. ???: Juror No. 1: That is precisely what I was about to say! As the foreman of the jury, it's my duty to set a good example to my fellow jurors. Ryunosuke: What the...? (What is happening here?!) Susato: Let me see... Ah yes, it seems that's how the members of the jury give their verdicts. Ryunosuke: ...With fire? Susato: Apparently, yes. White for innocent, and black for guilty. As the six members of the jury make up their minds about the case... ...one by one, they each cast a ball of fire into the great Scales of Justice...as we saw a moment ago. Ryunosuke: So if those enormous scales fall completely to the black side, does that mean...? Susato: ......... Let's do our very best to make sure that doesn't happen! Ryunosuke: (Ugh... Now I'm even more worried than I was before...) Judge: Very well. The court acknowledges the change in the jury's stance. Counsel for the Defence, please continue with your cross-examination.

Susato: Nevertheless... ...what we need more than anything at the moment is more information. We're still very much in the dark.

Susato: We mustn't give up hope that we'll uncover something that will give us a way to fight back! Ryunosuke: But... ......... Alright, I'll keep trying. (I can't give up. I just need to keep calm and listen to the witnesses' statements again.)Press (after Jurors No. 2 and 4 vote guilty, if first, third, and fifth statements were pressed) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: 'He stabbed him,' you say.

Susato: If this wasn't a court of law... ...I would have felt compelled to use a Susato Takedown for that lapse in judgement. Ryunosuke: No no! I'll, I'll be more careful! Van Zieks: As we have heard! The witness had an unfettered view of events unfolding. Would you not concur, coachman? Your diddering suggests that you would. Beppo: Oh! Y-Yes, sir!Examine evidence Murder Weapon Sheath Susato: That part is the sheath, isn't it? Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Are you alright, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Hm? Oh, sorry, yes. I...just don't really like blades. Susato: Oh... Those don't seem like the words of a man with a large katana slung from his waist. Ryunosuke: That's not a blade; that's Kazuma's soul. Anyway...there's no sense in delaying it. Let's see what the blade looks like. Blood on blade Ryunosuke: Ugh...that looks like a lot of blood. Susato: It surely is blood. The victim's. Ryunosuke: Ugh...an Englishman's blood looks a lot like a Japanese man's blood. Susato: Did you think it wouldn't? Ryunosuke: ...Sorry, it's just that we've only just arrived here in Great Britain. I'm finding it a little hard to adjust. Susato: ...Yes, I do understand. \"M\" insignia Ryunosuke: An ornate letter 'M'... Undeniably Mr Magnus McGilded's initial. Susato: And it's beautifully gilded, too. It must be very valuable, I should think. Ryunosuke: ...Ah! Susato: What is it? Ryunosuke: Look at this 'M'... If you turn it upside-down, it becomes a 'W'! This could change everything! Susato: A 'W'...? Ryunosuke: Yes, this is one of those...you know, turnabout cases! I'm sure of it! Susato: I'm afraid I don't know at all. But what I am sure of is that this is an 'M'. Ryunosuke: Oh. (Well that idea was quickly quashed...)Beppo: As soon as I heard the scream, I stopped my bus. And, and then I saw it, too!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Erm...what exactly did you see? Beppo: Oh, well sir, that would be the p-p-passenger, sir. Yes, c-c-collapsed on the floor, he was.

Good deeds mean nothing, when overshadowed by evil. The truth...is everything. Beppo: Couldn't agree more, sir! The truth!Ryunosuke: (Alright, so when it happened, the only two people in the enclosed cabin area were the victim and the defendant. And - so help me - THREE WHOLE PEOPLE witnessed the man I'm trying to defend do the deed...)Susato: I don't like to be pessimistic, but we do seem to be in a rather difficult situation here.Ryunosuke: Ugh... (What am I supposed to think here? Is Mr McGilded really innocent? Or could it be...?)Susato: B-before we jump to conclusions, our first task should be to gather information. We need to understand the case much better than we do at the moment.Ryunosuke: Yes! You're absolutely right. (Let's listen to those witness statements again, a little more carefully this time.)Juror No. 5:My Lord, I wish to speak!Judge: Yes, juror number five? Do I take it that you, too...?Juror No. 5: As the master of the London Guild of Coachmen... ...the idea of a murder being committed in one of the city's carriages is utterly abhorrent to me. It wouldn't be right to make a decision before hearing all the facts, though, I said to myself. But I've heard enough now. The horse has bolted, as they say.Ryunosuke: No, no! Please, just keep an open mind a little long-Juror No. 5: Gee-up now, Silver Blaze! The finish is in sight! Beppo is a long-standing member of the guild, and I trust what the man says.Beppo: Oh, thank you, sir. You're t-t-too kind, sir.Ryunosuke: Ugh, this is t-t-too unkind, sir...Van Zieks: Which now means that five jurors agree to condemn this man. Madam juror number six...Juror No. 6: Yes, dear? What can I do for you?Van Zieks: You have heard the testimonies of the witnesses in the stand.Juror No. 6: Oh yes. I certainly have. Still got my hearing, you know!Van Zieks: Then, pray tell, why are you yet to pronounce your leaning?Juror No. 6: ......... Well, dear, the thing is, I'm a creature of habit, me. I always go to the park at around this time of day, and sit on a nice bench and get on with my knitting.Van Zieks: .........Juror No. 6: There's a lovely little park just near where I live. McGilded Park, it's called.Ryunosuke: ...!Juror No. 6: The gentleman donated it to the city, you know. To put a smile on Londoners' faces, he said. I can't imagine such a fine, young gentleman would have it in him to take another man's life.He is always doing wonderful things for the city.That's right! A man like that wouldn't stab someone, surely?Mother, may we go to the McGilded Public Library later and borrow some more books?Van Zieks: How many Londoners live with their heads in the clouds?! Do you people not know... ...what kind of a man Magnus McGilded really is?Ryunosuke: What kind of a man is he?!Van Zieks: The philanthropist, Magnus McGilded... ...has enough wealth to purchase the entire city he claims to value so highly. But where did all that wealth come from? Your client is a shylock, sir! And one with the very darkest of souls.Ryunosuke: What?!Juror No. 6: Stone the crows!Van Zieks: McGilded lends money at extortionate rates of interest so his victims have no hope of repaying him. When they default, he takes possession of everything they own. He is a vulture that preys on the weak.Juror No. 6: I've, I've never heard any mention of that before...Van Zieks: Your faculties haven't deserted you, I'm sure, madam. So has this thought not crossed your mind? Would a man wealthy enough to buy London in its entirety not have a carriage of his own?Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: What possible reason could this man have had to make use of a public omnibus service?Juror No. 6: Um...Ryunosuke: You're not saying that...?Van Zieks: The victim - a poor brickmaker - had next to nothing to his name, save considerable financial liability. It will come as no surprise that his creditor was the accused, Magnus McGilded. But let it also be known, that the very day Mr Mason was killed, was the final repayment date for his debts.Judge: Good gracious!Van Zieks: The brickmaker was destitute. He had lost his house. He had not a shilling with which to repay his debts. And in the end, this pitiful soul had the very last thing he owned taken from him...his life. By the merciless philanthropist pretender... Magnus McGilded!Ryunosuke: (I don't believe it!)Susato:Susato: If I might add something briefly...?Ryunosuke: Miss Susato?Susato: You claim that the victim had been lent money by Mr McGilded... ...but where is the evidence to support your claim?Van Zieks: ......... ...Pray forgive the discourtesy of filling my hallowed chalice in a court of law...Judge: Ah-ha, there it is! Lord van Zieks's hallowed chalice!Ryunosuke: (How can this be considered acceptable?!)Van Zieks: ...But I find myself in unexpectedly good humour. I had heard ladies from the Far East could show great courage...but I didn't expect to experience it myself.Susato: Ah! As, as judicial assistant to the defence, I am simply doing my job!Van Zieks: What a pity that your display of courage...is in vain. This is the debtors' ledger, which details all monies loaned by the accused. You will find the victim's name clearly recorded inside.Susato: Oh...Van Zieks: Allow me to present this ledger as evidence... ...and pray forgive the discourtesy of raising my chalice in a toast to the enigmatic East at the same time!Judge: A marvellous toast, Counsel! I will gladly accept this new evidence.The debtors' ledger has been entered into the Court Record.Judge: Ah yes, twenty guineas... The victim owed a considerable sum.Examine evidence Debtors' Ledger Clasp Ryunosuke: ...This portfolio must contain all sorts of secrets of London's gentry. Susato: Oh dear... Do you really think we ought to look inside? Ryunosuke: Well, it's not as though we know any of London's gentry personally, is it? Apart from our great detective friend, perhaps. ......... (Actually, I wonder...) Susato: I assure you we will not find Mr Sholmes's name inside! Ryunosuke: Well, let's see what we find... Writing Susato: Gosh, it's crammed full of gentlemen's names, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Well, I suppose they're probably not all gentlemen at all, are they? (After all, not everyone in this country is well off...) Susato: Ah! Goodness! Ryunosuke: What is it? Susato: Look at this! Do you see the name here? Ryunosuke: 'Bruce Fairplay'... ...Should that mean something to me? It, it does sound strangely familiar, actually... Susato: Bruce Fairplay! The witness testifying at this very moment! Ryunosuke: Oh yes, of course! The banker! Why is his name in here? (...Ah, he borrowed twenty guineas, did he?) And look, the repayment date is fast approaching. Susato: It's possible that this is just a coincidence, of course. But this could be very useful information. The details of the debtors' ledger have been updated in the Court Record. Writing (subsequent times) Susato: Gosh, it's crammed full of gentlemen's names, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Well, I suppose they're probably not all gentlemen at all, are they? (After all, not everyone in this country is well off...)Van Zieks: And the accused made quite certain he had ample recompense.Juror No. 6: ......... Well, it would seem I've... ...I've had the wool pulled over my eyes.Van Zieks: Regrettably, madam, that is the modus operandi of the accused.Juror No. 6: And it's such a pretty little park, too. ...What a scoundrel! .........Still... ...maybe it's all for the best.Ryunosuke: Ah! W-Wait a minute! Let's think about this a little more before-Juror No. 6: I don't stand for nonsense!Ryunosuke: ......... (That was it... The last juror's decision...)Susato: ......... ...Ah, according to this Encyclopaedia of British Law... 'When all members of the jury have concluded that the defendant is guilty... ...court proceedings are suspended, and the presiding judge will deliver the final verdict and sentence.' That's what it says here.Ryunosuke: (Haah... The final verdict... It's over then.)Susato: Oh! There's a footnote, though.Ryunosuke: A footnote?Susato: 'However, the defence-'Judge: All six members of the jury are now in agreement in this case.Van Zieks: Allow me to convey my respect for your swift and righteous decision.Judge: According to the laws of this country, I will now conclude the trial... ...by delivering my final verdict. ...I trust there are no objections?Ryunosuke: ......... ......... Miss Susato, just tell me one thing...Susato: Oh! Yes?Ryunosuke: You were in the middle of saying something before. The footnote in your Encyclopaedia of British Law. 'However, the defence...' What did it say next?Susato: O-Oh yes, of course. One moment... 'When all members of the jury have concluded that the defendant is guilty... ...court proceedings are suspended, and the presiding judge will deliver the final verdict and sentence.' Then the footnote says... 'However, the defence... ...has the right to demand a summation examination of the jurors at this point.'Ryunosuke: A...summation...examination...?Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ...A summation examination? From which century has that tome you have there been resurrected?Susato: Ah!Van Zieks: Judging from the binding, I would say that book is at least fifty years old. Any modern text on British Law wouldn't even give such an antiquated procedure a mention. It's a relic. Long forgotten, and certainly no longer practised. So you're out of luck.Susato: Oh...Ryunosuke: What even is it, Miss Susato? This so-called 'summation examination'?Susato: Oh, um... One moment, and I'll read about it.Van Zieks: ...You would demand the right to a procedure before you even understand what it entails? Hmph, typical Nipponese.Susato: Alright, Mr Naruhodo, I think I understand... It seems that under this procedure, we would be able to appeal to the members of the jury.Ryunosuke: To do what...exactly?Susato: Appeal to them to change their leaning and reverse their decisions. And it says here that... ...'If successful, the proceedings of the trial must be resumed.'Ryunosuke: (Make them reverse their decisions...)Judge: Yes, in times gone by, barristers would use a summation examination to attempt to influence the jury's decision. But that procedure became something of a formality with no practical benefit, really. So it rather fell out of use.Susato: I wonder why...Van Zieks: Because it was devoid of purpose.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: Changing just one member of the jury's mind would be hard enough, let alone several. No self-respecting defence barrister would even assert his right to try in this day and age.Susato: ......... Still... ...I don't see any mention of the procedure actually being formally revoked.Van Zieks: What are you suggesting?Susato: I'm suggesting that although it may be antiquated and largely forgotten...it isn't yet extinct.Van Zieks: ...!Susato: What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: (A summation examination... Our last possible option. Do we assert our right to carry it out, or admit defeat?)Assert our right Leads to: \"The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination, My Lord!\"Forget it Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Mr Naruhodo... Are you sure that's the right decision? Ryunosuke: You heard what the judge and the prosecutor said. It's an antiquated procedure. It's history. We barely know our way around the law that's in use today. What hope would we have of pulling it off? Susato: .........  Perhaps what we don't know can work to our advantage. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Susato: In any case, there's really only one course of action available to us here. What we can't afford to do is allow this trial to end! Ryunosuke: ...! (What we don't know can work to our advantage...?) You're right, Miss Susato. Let's bring this antiquated procedure back into the present day! Leads to: \"The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination, My Lord!\"Ryunosuke: The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination, My Lord!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: London is the capital city of the most powerful nation on earth. We have a duty to the world to exemplify the very highest standards of judicial procedure. Summation examinations are an embarrassment that should remain buried!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: But if it's our right, it's our right! I believe it could prove vital in this trial!Judge: The defence's petition is perfectly valid. The court will proceed with the summation examination!Van Zieks: This is madness...Judge: Foreman, are you and the remainder of the jury ready?Juror No. 1: Eh?! Well, erm, I'm not, erm... There was no mention of this in the letter I received, you see, so...Judge: All members of the jury will be asked to explain on what grounds they have reached their decision.Juror No. 1: On what grounds...?Judge: You must all justify your decisions and explain why you believed the defendant to be guilty.Juror No. 1: Well, My Lord, you're rather putting us on the spot...Juror No. 2: This is most irregular. No mention was made of this before.Juror No. 3: I don't really hold with all this 'justifying' lark.Juror No. 4: .........Ryunosuke: (That seems to have thrown the jurors off...)Susato: It seems none of them have experienced this before.Ryunosuke: (Alright then, the summation examination... A defence procedure no practising lawyer has attempted for years, is it? Well, just maybe... ...it might be the opportunity we've been looking for... to turn this trial around!)Judge: So be it, then. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the court hereby calls upon you... ...to state the grounds on which you find the defendant, Magnus McGilded, guilty of this most serious crime.Judicial Findings - The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1: There was no one else inside the carriage at the time, so it has to have been him.Juror No. 2: I trust the driver. He has an excellent memory, it seems. Four passengers, with fares totalling twenty pence.Juror No. 3: He stuck the chap next to him just like this! Brazen, I must say. Absolutely brazen!Juror No. 4: I have simply typed and collated all the statements made thus far, and drawn the logical conclusion.Juror No. 5: You can trust the guild. Fair fares is our motto. We haven't raised prices above fourpence for years.Juror No. 6: The scoundrel, stabbing that poor man on the floor! It beggars belief!Ryunosuke: (I'm starting to wish I hadn't pushed for this now...)Susato: Some of the jurors don't seem to have wonderfully formed arguments, though, do they?Ryunosuke: Well, let's see what we can do. We need to get these six people to change their minds. (I'll have to throw everything I can at them! And use some very persuasive language...)Susato: Just a moment, Mr Naruhodo. According to my book, that's not quite how it works.Ryunosuke: Oh? I thought I was going to have to thaw their icy minds with some heart-warming rhetoric about the defendant.Susato: Unfortunately... ...once the jurors have decided the defendant is guilty, they're unlikely to heed anything the defence says.Ryunosuke: But, but then...Susato: They've reached their conclusions by their own reasoning, you see. Your pleas will sound like excuses. In fact, it could recoil on you. The more you try to persuade them, the more entrenched they may become.Ryunosuke: Then what on earth am I supposed to do?!Susato: Oh dear. I'm just citing what I've read about British law, Mr Naruhodo.Ryunosuke: Right, I'm sorry. ...Do you have any idea how to make this work, then?Susato: Well, from what I can understand... ...the key to this procedure is using the jurors' own words to make your arguments.Ryunosuke: What do you mean?Susato: Well, the six members of the jury are randomly selected members of the public. They may appear to present a united front, but the truth is... ...they are complete strangers, who just happen to find themselves here in the courtroom together.Ryunosuke: And...that's the way to break them down, you mean?Susato: Yes, exactly. We must listen very carefully to what each member of the jury says... ...and see if we can identify any contradictory statements. If we can, we then contrast the statements and pit the corresponding jurors against each other!Ryunosuke: I see. So it's contradictions in what two or more jurors say that we're looking for. In a way, then... ...this is similar to a regular cross-examination.Susato: Oh! Yes, I, I suppose you're right!Ryunosuke: ......... (Find contradictions in their statements and pit the jurors against one another to break them down... Alright, I might be able to pull this off. ...No, that's not right... I HAVE TO pull this off!)Judge: Can we start proceedings, Counsel? I would ask you to take the stand for this. I'm expecting a clear and concise rebuttal!Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord!Jury Examination - The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1: There was no one else inside the carriage at the time, so it has to have been him.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Certainly, the testimonies we've heard suggest the victim and Mr McGilded were alone inside the carriage. Juror No. 1: Precisely my point. Ryunosuke: But! Could there be some other explanation? Something we haven't considered yet? Juror No. 1: Such as...? Ryunosuke: ......... Haha, well, um...perhaps that's something we could, um... all work out together now? Juror No. 1: Now listen here! Maybe you don't know how things work around here because you're...from foreign climes. But we're here to form our opinions as individuals. And I have! Ryunosuke: Ugh... Susato: Oh dear. He doesn't appear to be in the mood to consider an alternative point of view, does he? Ryunosuke: (No, I'm going to have to pit the jurors against one another, like Susato-san said. Finding contradictions in these six people's assertions is the only way I'm going to succeed...)Juror No. 2: I trust the driver. He has an excellent memory, it seems. Four passengers, with fares totalling twenty pence.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But does his ability to recall his takings that night really tell us how trustworthy the man is? Juror No. 2: I manage all His Lordship's cash affairs, so I'm very particular when it comes to accounts. Ryunosuke: I see... Juror No. 2: A single penny can mean the difference between life and death, after all, can't it? Ryunosuke: ...That's, that's a saying in your country? Juror No. 2: My point is, a man who minds his figures is a man you can trust. Those of us in service would swear to that, sir. Ryunosuke: (Does that bench really need any more polishing...?) Juror No. 2: So if the good driver says that he saw Mr McGilded in the act, I don't doubt him. The only task left to do today is disposing of the rubbish. Ryunosuke: (Ah, now wait a minute... One of the other jurors mentioned something about money, I think.) Susato: Now would be a very good time to listen carefully to the jurors' statements again, Mr Naruhodo. If you notice an inconsistency in what two different jurors are saying... Ryunosuke: ...I should expose it by pitting them against each other. (Yes, let's see if I can do just that...)Pit against Juror No. 5's statement (before Jurors No. 3 and 6 vote innocent) Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: They do? Explain yourself, Counsel! Juror No. 2: Me?! Oh dear, what have I said? Juror No. 5: I swear on Silver Blaze's mane and name, I haven't the first idea what you're talking about! Ryunosuke: According to the group testimony we've heard so far... ...there were four passengers on the omnibus on the night in question. And according to the coachman, Mr Beppo, he took twenty pence in fares. Juror No. 4: Quite right. I have those precise details typed neatly here in front of me. Ryunosuke: And juror number five also told us the following: The fare for the omnibus...is always fourpence. Juror No. 5: That it is. A fair and convenient single price. Just the way London's carriages should be operated! Ryunosuke: But that doesn't add up at all. In fact, it leaves a glaring discrepancy in the facts. Juror No. 5: Why, man, why?! Ryunosuke: Four passengers paying fourpence each. If you do the multiplication... Juror No. 2: Ah! It would be sixteen pence! Ryunosuke: Exactly. As I said, it doesn't add up. The figures are different. By fourpence, in fact. ...Or precisely one person's fare. Judge: One person's fare? Ryunosuke: Yes! In other words, on the omnibus that night... ...it's distinctly possible...there was another passenger we've heard nothing about! Judge: Good gracious! Juror No. 5: This, this can't be right! The coachmen of the guild are good, honest men, one and all! Trustworthiness is our watchword! Juror No. 4: The figures your coachman claims most certainly do not add up. Your watchword, good sir, is a fallacy! Juror No. 5: I beg your pardon?! Ryunosuke: Mr Guildmaster, I think you ought to consider that if this trial were to end now... ...the news will surely spread all over London. The news that one of your coachmen tried to hide the fact that he lets nefarious characters ride his omnibus. Juror No. 5: ...! Alright then, how do I make it so this miserable trial doesn't end, hm? Susato: Well, according to my book here... ...you simply launch a ball of fire onto the innocent side of the set of scales! Juror No. 1: Now hold your horses there, coachman! We were all in agreement! Why do you have to go and- Juror No. 5: Wait till I get my hands on you, Beppo!!! Juror No. 1: Argh! This is all very irritating... Juror No. 2: Begging your pardon, sir, I'm going to do the same. Juror No. 1: For the love of Mike! Not you as well?! Juror No. 2: A penny can be the difference between a smile and a tear, after all. I certainly can't put my trust in someone who doesn't follow my exacting standards in financial matters. Juror No. 1: Oh really? Juror No. 2: I, for one, think it's only proper that we hear from the witnesses again. Susato: Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue! Ryunosuke: Two more... (Actually... ...there is something else that's bothering me about a couple of their assertions.) Susato: Then that's where you must strike next! Ryunosuke: (So I need to pit two more jurors against each other and show there's another contradiction in their assertions.) Susato: Exactly! You can do it! Judge: Well, the Scales of Justice have shifted, but they still weigh heavy on the side of guilt. Counsel, you have the floor again. Continue with your summation examination! Changes Juror No. 2's statement to \"I'm changing my leaning to innocent. I should like to hear what the slipshod bookkeeper has to say for himself!\" and Juror No. 5's statement to \"Grrr! Beppo! This trial has to continue so I can get to the bottom of this corruption! Not guilty, I say!\"Pit against Juror No. 5's statement (after Jurors No. 3 and 6 vote innocent) Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: They do? Explain yourself, Counsel! Juror No. 2: Me?! Oh dear, what have I said? Juror No. 5: I swear on Silver Blaze's mane and name, I haven't the first idea what you're talking about!

I should like to hear what the slipshod bookkeeper has to say for himself!Juror No. 3: He stuck the chap next to him just like this! Brazen, I must say. Absolutely brazen!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Careful! You, you could hurt somebody with that! Juror No. 3: Tsk! You're a fine one to talk! What of that sword hanging from your waist, hm? Ryunosuke: No no! That's...just my battered soul... Juror No. 3: Well anyway, I despise anyone with too much money. They're all the same. All stabbing some brickmaker or other behind the scenes, you mark my words! Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: That...seems very unlikely, doesn't it? Juror No. 3: Are you mad, man? We know that small shorty is a rotten shylock! Ryunosuke: Well, yes, that does seem to be the case, but- Susato: Mr Naruhodo! Please! Be careful what you say! Juror No. 3: If he's been trying to squeeze money out of us less fortunate, then as far as I'm concerned... ...he's as guilty as sin! The man can hang! Ryunosuke: (Come to think of it... ...didn't one of the other jurors have something to say about the defendant's underhand activities?) Susato: If you've thought of something, Mr Naruhodo, don't let it go! Test your theory! Ryunosuke: (Pit the two jurors whose statements seem to be contradictory against each other...? No time like the present to use [X / Y / R] to 'Pit' them against each other...or I'll never get anywhere...)Pit against Juror No. 6's statement Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: Those two statements are completely contradictory! Judge: Whaaat?! Explain, Counsel, post-haste! Juror No. 6: Oh dearie me! I, I was only knitting a jumper for my other half! Juror No. 3: What is all this claptrap? What does 'contradictory' even mean, I ask you? Ryunosuke: We've heard from more than one witness... ...that they allegedly saw the actual moment when the defendant stabbed the victim. Now, out of curiosity, juror number three... Juror No. 3: What?! Can't you see that I'm busy here? Ryunosuke: ...How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim? What sort of motion was it? Juror No. 3: Ha! Want to test me, do you? It was like this! Stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up! Just like the prim banker said. Judge: Yes, that was Mr Fairplay's testimony. Quite true. Ryunosuke: Now then, juror number six... Juror No. 6: ...Oh! Is that me, is it? What can I do for you, young man? Ryunosuke: How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim, madam? Juror No. 6: Oh, well dear, as far as I understand it... ...it was like this! He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor! ...The coachman said so. Ryunosuke: Now don't move! Take a look at these two jurors! 'He stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up!' And 'He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor!' Judge: Well I never! They're... They're stabbing in totally different directions! Juror No. 3: What?! Juror No. 6: Bless my stitches! What a muddle! Ryunosuke: What this tells us... ...is that there's a strong possibility one of the witnesses isn't telling the truth! Juror No. 6: Oh! Juror No. 3: But why?! Why the dickens would they lie? Ryunosuke: I don't know that yet. But what I do know... ...is that if the trial ends at this point, we may never find out! We may never know the real truth! Ladies and gentlemen of the jury! Can you really let that happen, in all good conscience? Juror No. 6: Lies, you say? Oh dearie me... I can't abide people telling lies! Juror No. 2: The, the scales... Juror No. 5: I don't believe it! Juror No. 1: Juror No. 1: Waaaaaait! Now hear this, my fellow jurors: I warn you, you cannot listen to this man! Look at him, in his black suit! He's...he's...clearly some devious Eastern sorcerer using magic on us all! Ryunosuke: (If I could use magic, do you really think I'd be putting myself through all this?) Juror No. 1: Answer me this, Dark Jinx! Ryunosuke: Huh?! M-Me? Juror No. 1: What exactly is the problem? What of it if two witnesses have slightly different recollections of events? Ryunosuke: What of it? Juror No. 1: Let's say the shylock did stab the victim as he was sat next to him on the omnibus. And this young dandy saw him do it! And now let's say the victim collapsed on the floor, and then the shylock stabbed him again! And this old lady saw him do it! Well? What's to say it didn't happen like that, hm? Juror No. 3: Who are you calling a dandy, sir?! Why, I should take this knife to you! Juror No. 6: Who are you calling old?! Why, I should take this needle to you! Ryunosuke: (Ugh...they're ready to kill each other now... But could the foreman of the jury be right? Did the two witnesses see two different moments of the same crime?)  It's possible Ryunosuke: Hm, it's true... There's an outside chance of almost anything you care to mention. Juror No. 1: Eeexactly the point I've been trying to make! Susato: Before you go any further, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Oh! What is it, Miss Susato? Susato: ...I think you should have a look through the Court Record. Ryunosuke: ......... Ah! Susato: You see? This evidence makes it quite clear. There isn't even an outside chance of what the juror is saying! Ryunosuke: (How did I miss that...?) Leads to: \"Unfortunately, Mr Foreman...\" It's out of the question Leads to: \"Unfortunately, Mr Foreman...\" Ryunosuke: Unfortunately, Mr Foreman... Juror No. 1: Hm? What is it, you dark jinx? Come on, out with it! Ryunosuke: ...What you're suggesting is impossible! It's out of the question! Juror No. 2: ...! Juror No. 4: ...! Juror No. 6: ...! Juror No. 1: What, what are you talking about, man? How can you possibly say that? You, you do realise that I'm...I'm only doing my job! As foreman of the jury, I have a responsibility to steer everyone in the right direction. So where's your evidence, man? That's what we want to see! I say the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime. If you say that's out of the question, show me some proof! Ryunosuke: ......... (It looks like the only way I'm going to convince him is to present him with something he can't dismiss. Some irrefutable hard evidence!) As you wish. Juror No. 1: What? Ryunosuke: I'll give you the proof. It's out of the question that the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime...as proven by...  Present Autopsy Report (before Jurors No. 2 and 5 vote innocent) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: This is the victim's autopsy report. According to what's written here, Mr Mason was stabbed in the abdomen... ...only once. Juror No. 1: Eh?! Only once?! Ryunosuke: It's quite simple! The victim was stabbed precisely one time. Which means these witnesses can't possibly have seen it happen two different times! Juror No. 3: Huuurgh...grrr...hyuuurgh... Alright...I concede defeat! Susato: Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue! Ryunosuke: Two more... (Actually... ...there is something else that's bothering me about a couple of their assertions.) Susato: Then that's where you must strike next! Ryunosuke: (So I need to pit two more jurors against each other and show there's another contradiction in their assertions.) Susato: Exactly! You can do it! Judge: Well, the Scales of Justice have shifted, but they still weigh heavy on the side of guilt. Counsel, you have the floor again. Continue with your summation examination! Changes Juror No. 3's statement to \"I'm no lover of the rich, but I despise liars even more! Innocent is my call, for now at least!\" and Juror No. 6's statement to \"Dear me, you can't make accusations based on lies! I wonder if the poor man is innocent after all...\"' Present Autopsy Report (after Jurors No. 2 and 5 vote innocent) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: This is the victim's autopsy report. According to what's written here, Mr Mason was stabbed in the abdomen... ...only once. Juror No. 1: Eh?! Only once?! Ryunosuke: It's quite simple! The victim was stabbed precisely one time. Which means these witnesses can't possibly have seen it happen two different times! Juror No. 3: Huuurgh...grrr...hyuuurgh... Alright...I concede defeat! Leads to: \"...Wait! That, that means...\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...this clear piece of evidence! Well, Mr Foreman? Juror No. 1: ......... Do you know what they say about me, young man? They say I've got no powers of persuasion. Ryunosuke: Oh, I see... Erm... I'm sorry to hear that...? Juror No. 1: But no one will need persuading about this: You're even worse than me! Ryunosuke: Aaagh! (Two different moments... In other words, the victim was stabbed two times... Ah! But we have evidence that clearly contradicts that possibility!) If you'll allow me another chance...I'd like to present you with one more piece of evidence to consider. Leads back to: \"It's out of the question that the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime...as proven by...\"Juror No. 3: I'm no lover of the rich, but I despise liars even more!

Juror No. 4: ......... Ryunosuke: What have you been doing all this time? Juror No. 4: 'What have you been doing all this time?'... There. ...I should have thought it was obvious. I am recording everything that takes place as part of these proceedings. Ryunosuke: And...what have you learnt from that? Juror No. 4: For example, at this moment in time, the judge has used his gavel eleven times in total... ...the prosecution has snorted derisively at your remarks seven times in total... ...and, I might add, each time you have gawped like a simpleton. Ryunosuke: ...Thank you. (And what's the point exactly?) So anyway, madam, are you able to explain why you think the defendant is guilty? Juror No. 4: ......... That is a conclusion I have drawn as a result of the copious notes I have typed. Ryunosuke: Clearly! But I'm asking you to explain WHY you've drawn that conclusion! Juror No. 4: Please don't distract me. It makes it extremely hard to concentrate on my note-keeping. Ryunosuke: (This is going nowhere...)Juror No. 5: You can trust the guild. Fair fares is our motto. We haven't raised prices above fourpence for years.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That's how much it costs to take the omnibus? Juror No. 5: That's right. As the guildmaster, I decided to set a policy for all drivers across the city. One fare, no matter which bus you take or how far you're going. We have to compete with the rise of the motor car, you see. Us coachmen have to make a stand together! Ryunosuke: Motor cars, you say? Juror No. 5: Yes. And this murder on one of our buses is extremely damaging to our cause! It's beyond the pale! It'll lead to a decline in passengers, you mark my words! And it's all that rascal's fault! He has to pay! Ryunosuke: (Is it the crime or his buses he's more worried about...?) Juror No. 5: Anyway, every member of my guild is reliable and trustworthy. So if the driver says he saw him do it, that fellow in the dock is as guilty as sin!Pit against Juror No. 2's statement (before Jurors No. 3 and 6 vote innocent) Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other!

The figures are different. By fourpence, in fact. ...Or precisely one person's fare. Judge: One person's fare? Ryunosuke: Yes! In other words, on the omnibus that night... ...it's distinctly possible...there was another passenger we've heard nothing about! Judge: Good gracious! Juror No. 5: This, this can't be right! The coachmen of the guild are good, honest men, one and all! Trustworthiness is our watchword! Juror No. 4: The figures your coachman claims most certainly do not add up. Your watchword, good sir, is a fallacy! Juror No. 5: I beg your pardon?! Ryunosuke: Mr Guildmaster, I think you ought to consider that if this trial were to end now... ...the news will surely spread all over London. The news that one of your coachmen tried to hide the fact that he lets nefarious characters ride his omnibus. Juror No. 5: ...! Alright then, how do I make it so this miserable trial doesn't end, hm? Susato: Well, according to my book here... ...you simply launch a ball of fire onto the innocent side of the set of scales! Juror No. 1: Now hold your horses there, coachman! We were all in agreement! Why do you have to go and- Juror No. 5: Wait till I get my hands on you, Beppo!!! Juror No. 1: Argh! This is all very irritating... Juror No. 2: Begging your pardon, sir, I'm going to do the same. Juror No. 1: For the love of Mike! Not you as well?! Juror No. 2: A penny can be the difference between a smile and a tear, after all. I certainly can't put my trust in someone who doesn't follow my exacting standards in financial matters. Juror No. 1: Oh really? Juror No. 2: I, for one, think it's only proper that we hear from the witnesses again. Leads to: \"...Wait! That, that means...\"Juror No. 5: Grrr! Beppo! This trial has to continue so I can get to the bottom of this corruption! Not guilty, I say!Juror No. 6: The scoundrel, stabbing that poor man on the floor! It beggars belief!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I, I really think you should stop waving that needle around... Juror No. 6: You heard what the good coachmen said before, didn't you? That hideous man stabbed the poor fellow! Just like this! Ryunosuke: Y-Yes... That is what he said, you're right. Juror No. 6: ......... McGilded Park is such a lovely little place, too. I've always enjoyed resting my legs there while I get on with my knitting. And I had thought that anyone who donated such a delightful place must be a fine fellow indeed. I suppose I was wrong. ......... Whoever would have thought he was a miserable, murdering moneylender with not a scrap of remorse?! Ryunosuke: (Oh help... She's as sure as sure can be that he's guilty now...) Susato: The old lady certainly seems to know her mind, doesn't she?Pit against Juror No. 3's statement Ryunosuke:   Ryunosuke: Those two statements are completely contradictory! Judge: Whaaat?! Explain, Counsel, post-haste! Juror No. 6: Oh dearie me! I, I was only knitting a jumper for my other half! Juror No. 3: What is all this claptrap? What does 'contradictory' even mean, I ask you? Ryunosuke: We've heard from more than one witness... ...that they allegedly saw the actual moment when the defendant stabbed the victim. Now, out of curiosity, juror number three... Juror No. 3: What?! Can't you see that I'm busy here? Ryunosuke: ...How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim? What sort of motion was it? Juror No. 3: Ha! Want to test me, do you? It was like this! Stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up! Just like the prim banker said. Judge: Yes, that was Mr Fairplay's testimony. Quite true. Ryunosuke: Now then, juror number six... Juror No. 6: ...Oh! Is that me, is it? What can I do for you, young man? Ryunosuke: How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim, madam? Juror No. 6: Oh, well dear, as far as I understand it... ...it was like this! He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor! ...The coachman said so. Ryunosuke: Now don't move! Take a look at these two jurors! 'He stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up!' And 'He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor!' Judge: Well I never! They're... They're stabbing in totally different directions! Juror No. 3: What?! Juror No. 6: Bless my stitches! What a muddle! Ryunosuke: What this tells us... ...is that there's a strong possibility one of the witnesses isn't telling the truth! Juror No. 6: Oh! Juror No. 3: But why?! Why the dickens would they lie? Ryunosuke: I don't know that yet. But what I do know... ...is that if the trial ends at this point, we may never find out! We may never know the real truth! Ladies and gentlemen of the jury! Can you really let that happen, in all good conscience? Juror No. 6: Lies, you say? Oh dearie me... I can't abide people telling lies! Juror No. 2: The, the scales... Juror No. 5: I don't believe it! Juror No. 1: Juror No. 1: Waaaaaait! Now hear this, my fellow jurors: I warn you, you cannot listen to this man! Look at him, in his black suit! He's...he's...clearly some devious Eastern sorcerer using magic on us all! Ryunosuke: (If I could use magic, do you really think I'd be putting myself through all this?) Juror No. 1: Answer me this, Dark Jinx! Ryunosuke: Huh?! M-Me? Juror No. 1: What exactly is the problem? What of it if two witnesses have slightly different recollections of events? Ryunosuke: What of it? Juror No. 1: Let's say the shylock did stab the victim as he was sat next to him on the omnibus. And this young dandy saw him do it! And now let's say the victim collapsed on the floor, and then the shylock stabbed him again! And this old lady saw him do it! Well? What's to say it didn't happen like that, hm? Juror No. 3: Who are you calling a dandy, sir?! Why, I should take this knife to you! Juror No. 6: Who are you calling old?! Why, I should take this needle to you! Ryunosuke: (Ugh...they're ready to kill each other now... But could the foreman of the jury be right? Did the two witnesses see two different moments of the same crime?)  It's possible Ryunosuke: Hm, it's true... There's an outside chance of almost anything you care to mention. Juror No. 1: Eeexactly the point I've been trying to make! Susato: Before you go any further, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Oh! What is it, Miss Susato? Susato: ...I think you should have a look through the Court Record. Ryunosuke: ......... Ah! Susato: You see? This evidence makes it quite clear. There isn't even an outside chance of what the juror is saying! Ryunosuke: (How did I miss that...?) Leads to: \"Unfortunately, Mr Foreman...\" It's out of the question Leads to: \"Unfortunately, Mr Foreman...\" Ryunosuke: Unfortunately, Mr Foreman... Juror No. 1: Hm? What is it, you dark jinx? Come on, out with it! Ryunosuke: ...What you're suggesting is impossible! It's out of the question! Juror No. 2: ...! Juror No. 4: ...! Juror No. 6: ...! Juror No. 1: What, what are you talking about, man? How can you possibly say that? You, you do realise that I'm...I'm only doing my job! As foreman of the jury, I have a responsibility to steer everyone in the right direction. So where's your evidence, man? That's what we want to see! I say the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime. If you say that's out of the question, show me some proof! Ryunosuke: ......... (It looks like the only way I'm going to convince him is to present him with something he can't dismiss. Some irrefutable hard evidence!) As you wish. Juror No. 1: What? Ryunosuke: I'll give you the proof. It's out of the question that the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime...as proven by...  Present Autopsy Report (before Jurors No. 2 and 5 vote innocent) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: This is the victim's autopsy report. According to what's written here, Mr Mason was stabbed in the abdomen... ...only once. Juror No. 1: Eh?! Only once?! Ryunosuke: It's quite simple! The victim was stabbed precisely one time. Which means these witnesses can't possibly have seen it happen two different times! Juror No. 3: Huuurgh...grrr...hyuuurgh... Alright...I concede defeat! Susato: Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue! Ryunosuke: Two more... (Actually... ...there is something else that's bothering me about a couple of their assertions.) Susato: Then that's where you must strike next! Ryunosuke: (So I need to pit two more jurors against each other and show there's another contradiction in their assertions.) Susato: Exactly! You can do it! Judge: Well, the Scales of Justice have shifted, but they still weigh heavy on the side of guilt. Counsel, you have the floor again. Continue with your summation examination! Changes Juror No. 3's statement to \"I'm no lover of the rich, but I despise liars even more! Innocent is my call, for now at least!\" and Juror No. 6's statement to \"Dear me, you can't make accusations based on lies! I wonder if the poor man is innocent after all...\"' Present Autopsy Report (after Jurors No. 2 and 5 vote innocent) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: This is the victim's autopsy report. According to what's written here, Mr Mason was stabbed in the abdomen... ...only once. Juror No. 1: Eh?! Only once?! Ryunosuke: It's quite simple! The victim was stabbed precisely one time. Which means these witnesses can't possibly have seen it happen two different times! Juror No. 3: Huuurgh...grrr...hyuuurgh... Alright...I concede defeat! Leads to: \"...Wait! That, that means...\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...this clear piece of evidence! Well, Mr Foreman? Juror No. 1: ......... Do you know what they say about me, young man? They say I've got no powers of persuasion. Ryunosuke: Oh, I see... Erm... I'm sorry to hear that...? Juror No. 1: But no one will need persuading about this: You're even worse than me! Ryunosuke: Aaagh! (Two different moments... In other words, the victim was stabbed two times... Ah! But we have evidence that clearly contradicts that possibility!) If you'll allow me another chance...I'd like to present you with one more piece of evidence to consider. Leads back to: \"It's out of the question that the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime...as proven by...\"Juror No. 6: Dear me, you can't make accusations based on lies! I wonder if the poor man is innocent after all...First time Susato: 'Hm... So...we just need to find two jurors with contradictory statements and pit them against each other. ...Which is so much easier said than done!' Is that perhaps what were just thinking? Ryunosuke: How did you know?! Susato: Well, I took the liberty of doing some research, in case you happened to find yourself in just such a situation. Shall I read you what I found out? It is a little long, I'm afraid...  Not right now Susato: '...If I have to rely on advice right from the start, how will I get on later? No, I need to work this out for myself now!' ...Is that perhaps what you were just thinking? Ryunosuke: How did you know?! Susato: Well, that sort of attitude...is most admirable, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: (I know what I have to do. Let's listen to those assertions one more time...) Please go ahead Susato: Very well. Listen to this... During the summation examination, you will hear the assertions of the six members of the jury. In this situation, the counsel for the defence should use [X / Y / R] and 'Pit' with impunity! Having done so, you will be able to compare the chosen assertion with those of the other jurors. Select the corresponding buttons to listen to the other jurors' assertions again. Note that you cannot choose the assertion of the juror you initially selected... ...nor can you choose assertions of jurors who have changed their leaning to 'not guilty' already. Once you've compared the various jurors' assertions... ...work out which two contradict each other, and then 'Pit' them together with [X / Y / R] to pull them apart! Ryunosuke: I see... (She wasn't joking when she said it was long.) Susato: The first step is to listen very carefully to what each individual juror has to say. Then I'm sure you'll start to see which ones might not quite agree with each other. Ryunosuke: Alright then... (Let's get this right now, so I never have to listen to that long and boring explanation again!) Susato: That's the spirit!Subsequent times Susato: What do you think, Mr Naruhodo? I took the liberty of doing some research to help us navigate a situation such as this...  Not right now Susato: '...If I have to rely on advice right from the start, how will I get on later? No, I need to work this out for myself now!' ...Is that perhaps what you were just thinking? Ryunosuke: How did you know?! Susato: Well, that sort of attitude...is most admirable, Mr Naruhodo!

(Let's get this right now, so I never have to listen to that long and boring explanation again!) Susato: That's the spirit!Ryunosuke: (...Wait! That, that means... ...four jurors are now leaning to not guilty!)Susato: We've done it, Mr Naruhodo! We've won!Juror No. 1: What are you playing at, you dandy fool?!Juror No. 3: Shut your trap, sir! No one deceives me!Juror No. 1: But we had a consensus!Juror No. 3: I said shut your trap! I know a liar when I see one! And if the chap ever dares to cross the threshold of my shop... ...I'll take this razor-sharp blade...and shave every last hair off his head!Ryunosuke: (Please tell me he's a barber...)Judge: Well! In a quite remarkable turn of events... ...the defence's summation examination has flipped the balance of the Scales of Justice! The jurors now stand at two for guilty...and four for not guilty! Accordingly, there is no longer a large enough majority among the jury for me to adjudicate... ...and the trial must continue! I hereby ask the defence, prosecution and witnesses to return to their places. And I call upon all of you to continue to pursue the truth!Judge: So...Lord Van Zieks. Continue to substantiate the case for the prosecution, if you please.Van Zieks: Having savoured the rich aroma of the carmine contents of this hallowed chalice... ...it may seem crass to crush it to dust. ...Pray forgive the discourtesy.Judge: L-Lord van Zieks!Ryunosuke: (Brrr... Is it cold in here, or is it just me?)Van Zieks: As your antiquated tome no doubt says, the prosecution may not speak during a summation examination. So I honoured a deathly silence...and listened to the charade. It seems I overestimated the intelligence of the jury.Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Juror No. 3: ...!Van Zieks: ...Well, no matter. There is nothing so hard to prove as a self-evident truth, it would seem. No... And why else would we grace the courtroom with our presence after all? So, let us proceed to the next round of battle. Bring forth the witnesses once more!Van Zieks: Witnesses! I trust you heard the summation examination we have just had to...endure?Beppo: Oh, y-yes, sir, that I did, sir.Fairplay: Of course I heard it!Furst: Oh yes, sir. I heard it.Judge: You, sir, on the end... The coachman. I believe it's 'Beppo'?Beppo: Y-Yes, sir, My Lord, sir?Judge: If it transpires that in your previous testimony... ...you were attempting to veil the presence of a fifth passenger on your omnibus... ...you will be found guilty of perjury! You are advised to bear that in mind, sir.Beppo: Uhhh... Oh mio Dio... Uhhh...Judge: Now then, witnesses. I hereby call on you to testify before the court again. You will explain the various misgivings brought to our attention by the defence's summation examination!Witness Testimony - Various Misgivings -Beppo: I, I only c-carried f-four passengers that night! I swear it! ...B-B-But, um...Fairplay: Well, I for one was told I had to pay fivepence for the bus.Furst: He fiddled us on the fare, he did! And then I saw that blood-curdling sight as well... It's all too much!Fairplay: I tell you, I saw McGilded stabbing that man! Everything I said before stands!Beppo: Oh yes... Yes, he s-s-stabbed him. Yes he did. ...I, I think so, yes.Judge: Counsel, make sense of this for me, please.Van Zieks: The phantom fifth passenger conjured into existence by my learned Eastern friend never existed. The confusion has arisen from the coachman's sly little... cozenage.Beppo: Uhhh...Juror No. 5: Beppo! Explain yourself!Beppo: I'm t-terribly sorry, G-G-Guildmaster!Juror No. 5: The guild's fare is fourpence across the board! You know that! Am I to understand that you've been overcharging our passengers by a penny a fare?Beppo: It's, it's so c-c-cold... And the last r-run of the day is always h-h-half empty...Judge: ......... You have been dishonest, coachman.Beppo: Uhhh... I'm s-sorry...Juror No. 5: You're a disgrace, Beppo! A disgrace! And your selfish actions have brought dishonour on the entire guild!Furst: If I may, sir...? I had to pay tenpence on the bus just last week.Juror No. 5: WHAAAAAAT?Susato: Four passengers at fivepence each is... Yes, twenty pence. I've done the arithmetic ten times already, but I just can't make the result come out differently!Ryunosuke: ...No, that...figures.Judge: Well, it would appear that one of the aforementioned misgivings has already been explained. So, Counsel for the Defense... Your cross-examination, if you please.Van Zieks: We've already had the pleasure of a protracted summation examination today. I see you intend to continue the parlour games.Ryunosuke: ......... ...Absolutely!Cross-Examination - Various Misgivings -Beppo: I, I only c-carried f-four passengers that night! I swear it! ...B-B-But, um...Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So, there were only four passengers on your carriage, but you didn't charge them the standard fourpence fare. Is that right? Beppo: ......... It's, it's imp-p-possible to make the last run of the day p-p-pay! I was so c-c-cold, it was all I could d-do to stop myself p-p-passing out! Ryunosuke: ...I'm getting chilblains just listening to you. Beppo: It was t-t-terrible! So I wanted to give myself a p-p-pat on the back for even keeping the b-bus running! Doesn't a d-dedicated coachman d-deserve an extra p-p-penny per p-p-p-p-passenger? Ryunosuke: ...You're digging a deeper hole for yourself here... (If only there had been a fifth passenger on the omnibus that night... Then we would have had another suspect.) Van Zieks: .........Fairplay: Well, I for one was told I had to pay fivepence for the bus.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Does that mean everyone on board that night paid fivepence instead of four? Furst: Well, I paid fivepence, too, sir. Fairplay: And I just told you that I did. Beppo: A flat f-fare of fivepence across the b-b-board! Ryunosuke: (It's not something to be proud of...) Van Zieks: The so-called discrepancy my learned friend identified was nothing of the sort. Much like the phantom killer you so desperately needed, it's gone. Dead...and buried... Ryunosuke: (I'd have been happy if it had ever existed in the first place...)Furst: He fiddled us on the fare, he did! And then I saw that blood-curdling sight as well... It's all too much!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: This 'blood-curdling' sight... You mean the murder, I presume? Furst: Yes, sir! Judge: A loathsome sight. No one should have to witness the horror in the eyes of a man the moment his life is taken. Furst: Oh, well...not exactly, sir. I mean, I didn't actually see the exact moment the gent was stabbed. Judge: Good gracious! Really? Van Zieks: We have another witness who did, however. The banker has already testified to it. Ryunosuke: (Hm, but Mr Furst didn't actually see the point at which the victim was killed. That may turn out to be very significant...) Furst: I heard the banker gent next to me take a sharp intake of breath, see. That's when I looked through the glass. That's, that's when I saw that horrible blade poking out from his belly, all covered in blood! Every time I see a knife now, I can't help screaming. Even when I'm eating...Fairplay: I tell you, I saw McGilded stabbing that man! Everything I said before stands!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you saw the defendant, Mr McGilded, stabbing the victim, Mr Mason, who was sitting next to him? Fairplay: ...That's, that's what I said, isn't it? Ryunosuke: (It was bothering me before, this was. For just a brief moment, he hesitated before answering the question.) Fairplay: Anyway, there was only the two of them inside the carriage, wasn't there? Van Zieks: ...There's been much talk of a fifth passenger. But as yet...zero evidence. Fairplay: Then what are we wasting all this time for, eh? It's black and white! The man's guilty! Ryunosuke: ......... (Something about Mr Fairplay's testimony just...jars with me... I wish I could work out what it was...)Beppo: Oh yes... Yes, he s-s-stabbed him. Yes he did. ...I, I think so, yes.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Earlier, you testified that you saw the moment when the defendant allegedly stabbed the victim, didn't you? Beppo: Oh, yes. Yes, that's right. Ryunosuke: You said that the victim was on the floor, and described the assailant holding the knife in an ice pick grip. Beppo: ......... I, I suppose... ...I m-might have...you know. Yes... P-P-Put the c-cart before the horse, maybe... Judge: What's this? Beppo: Well, I'm q-quite sure about m-most of it... I was d-driving the horses when I heard a scream f-f-from the seats on the roof deck. Furst: Oh! I expect that was me, sir. Beppo: Then when I t-t-turned around...yes. Yes, I s-saw it through the skylight. The g-gentleman was on the floor, and the knife was s-sticking up out of his m-m-midriff. That's right, yes. And the f-f-fellow holding the h-handle was the f-famous man. Yes. Ryunosuke: So, in short... ...you didn't see the moment when the victim was actually stabbed at all? Beppo: ......... ...I, I r-really thought that I did, b-b-but... ...but when I g-go over it again in my head... ...no. I, I suppose I d-didn't actually see the p-precise moment of the s-stabbing, did I? Pursue Bruce Fairplay Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you have something to say about that, Mr Fairplay? Fairplay: Now you listen to me! I know what you're thinking! 'He didn't really see the exact moment the fellow was stabbed! What are the chances of that?' ...Eh? Ryunosuke: ...Are you asking me or telling me? (He's getting flustered. I might be able to extract some new information from him if I answer him cleverly... Could he have just happened to see the exact moment the crime was committed?) No chance! Ryunosuke: Well, it is a little hard to believe, certainly. Unless you spend your time peeping through a skylight on the top of an omnibus, that is. Leads to: \"Peeping?!\" Some days are like that Ryunosuke: Well, I suppose some days are like that. Sooner or later you'll see something you wish you hadn't... ...if you're always peeping through a skylight on the top of an omnibus. Leads to: \"Peeping?!\" Fairplay: Peeping?! I'm a, a respectable city banker, I'll have you know! And I know what I saw! I remember it as clear as a Ballarat day! It was a grim scene, I don't mind telling you... Judge: Thank you, Mr Fairplay. Fairplay: Oh! Excuse me if I was getting a little hot under the collar there, My Lord. Judge: I would ask you to supplement your testimony with a clear statement about what exactly you saw. Fairplay: Oh, I can do that alright. I'll tell you just how grim it was! Adds statement \"D'you think I'd forget the sight of those blood-soaked hands after that butcher stabbed the man?!\" Beppo: In, in fact, now that I c-c-come to think of it... ...it, it m-m-must've already happened when I heard the scream... Juror No. 1: Ah! Juror No. 3: Of course! Juror No. 5: That goes without saying! Ryunosuke: (But I really wish he had said it earlier...) Van Zieks: The autopsy report makes it quite clear that the victim was stabbed only once. Which means... ...the banker was witness to the fatal wound that ended Mr Mason's life. Judge: Hm...Fairplay: D'you think I'd forget the sight of those blood-soaked hands after that butcher stabbed the man?!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Blood-soaked?! Fairplay: Ahem! Well, perhaps 'soaked' is laying it on a little thick, but... But anyway! There was definitely blood all over them. Both of them were covered in it! Ryunosuke: And you saw that from the roof? Through the skylight? Fairplay: Well, the skylight's reasonably large, so I had a pretty good view. And there was a lamp on inside the carriage as well. So I'm quite sure of what I saw! Ryunosuke: (Hm...this banker's latest statement... I feel sure there's something not quite right about it.) Susato: When you feel something doesn't add up, Mr Naruhodo... ...that's when you should have a good look through the Court Record!Present Defendant's Leather Gloves Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Blood-soaked...hands?\"Ryunosuke: (Not long ago, this trial very nearly came to an end. Somehow, we've managed to keep our chances alive here. I can't waste this cross-examination! I have to use it to bring some new facts to light!)Susato: Hm, if you're not careful when you press these witnesses... ...the danger is that the jury will end up believing something...unhelpful, as they did before.Ryunosuke: Maybe. ...But we can't let the fear of that happening stop us from uncovering important new information.Susato: ...! Yes, you're so right.Ryunosuke: (I need to pay careful attention here. I don't want to miss even a flicker of a reaction among these witnesses!)Susato: Remember, if you happen to spot one of the witnesses reacting in a strange way... ...don't hesitate to pursue them as to the reason!Ryunosuke: Blood-soaked...hands?Fairplay: Well, I admit that 'soaked' might be laying it on a little thick, but... But anyway! There was definitely blood all over them. Both of them were covered in it!Ryunosuke: Well, I'm very sorry to disagree, Mr Fairplay, but that's more than a little peculiar.Fairplay: What?Ryunosuke: Here are the gloves worn by the defendant, Mr McGilded, on the night in question.Fairplay: Oh...yes...right...Ryunosuke: And there certainly does appear to be a sizeable dark-coloured stain there. But, as I'm sure you can clearly see... ...it's only on the right-hand glove.Fairplay: Arrrrgh!Ryunosuke: In short, Mr Fairplay... ...your testimony is inconsistent!Fairplay: Gyaaagh! But, but...no! That can't be right!Juror No. 6: So you're the liar here then!Fairplay: Gargh!Juror No. 3: That's right! You were quite clear about it. You said - Hyuurgh! - it was both hands!Fairplay: Grrr...Ryunosuke: Mr Fairplay. If your last statement was a lie... ...it calls your entire testimony into question. You say you saw the moment the victim was stabbed. ...But is that really the truth?!Fairplay: Argh! I...well... I...Van Zieks:Van Zieks: It was a simple mistake. You can't justify accusing this man of lying! Yes, it wasn't both hands; it was only one. But the fact remains... ...the victim's blood was on the accused!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: No! Mr Fairplay categorically stated that he saw blood 'all over both hands'! Which means there's a strong possibility that this witness was deliberately trying to mislead the court!Fairplay: Gaaargh! Why? Why?! I'm a city banker, for pity's sake! My word should be...the gold standard! I'm a gentleman, not some guttersnipe! Upstanding members of society don't prevaricate!Ryunosuke: (He's claiming to have no reason to lie... But is that really the case?)Susato: Mr Naruhodo! If we had some evidence to explain why Mr Fairplay might be lying... ...it could turn the tide in this trial completely!Ryunosuke: (Something to show this man has a compelling reason to lie in his testimony...)There's no evidence Ryunosuke: Yes. ...If only we had some evidence like that. Judge: Hmph. So the defence has nothing? Fairplay: Whew... Susato: Ah! Mr Naruhodo! Did you see that? Ryunosuke: Yes... He let out an audible sigh of relief. (Does that mean there IS some evidence that would show why he might lie?) Susato: I think perhaps...we should consult the Court Record again. From Mr Fairplay's reaction, I wonder if there's some evidence we haven't properly examined yet. Ryunosuke: (Yes, we ought to look at everything in as much detail as possible!) My Lord! Judge: Yes, Counsel? Ryunosuke: The defence is ready to present evidence! Evidence that will clearly demonstrate why Mr Fairplay had reason to lie in his testimony! Judge: I'm afraid, Counsel... ...that before I can allow that to happen, I shall have to penalise you for that reckless about-turn. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (I suppose that's fair play...) Leads to: \"...Very well.\"I have evidence Ryunosuke: My Lord! Judge: Yes, Counsel? Ryunosuke: The defence is ready to present evidence! Judge: By Jove! Are you sure? Ryunosuke: Yes. Evidence that will clearly demonstrate why Mr Fairplay had reason to lie in his testimony! Fairplay: GAAARGH!!! Leads to: \"...Very well.\"Judge: ...Very well. I hereby call on the defence to present its evidence. The evidence that demonstrates a motive for the witness's alleged deception of the court!Present Debtors' Ledger (after examining writing) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"This is a list of the debtors who owe money to Mr McGilded.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Judge: Yes... I believe this evidence does indeed demonstrate a deception of sorts. The deception by the defence that it is in any way competent. Ryunosuke: Ah... Van Zieks: A deception that won't pass muster in a British court of law, my...unlearned friend. Here's to that message being carved into your mind. Ryunosuke: Uwaaaaaagh! Susato: Mr Naruhodo... I wonder if perhaps there are some details we've overlooked in the Court Record. Do you think it might be wise to check over all the evidence again? Ryunosuke: (Yes, it looks like I need to thoroughly examine every piece of evidence we have...) Leads back to: \"...Very well.\"Ryunosuke: This is a list of the debtors who owe money to Mr McGilded.Van Zieks: ...Yes, a list of innocent victims, crippled by the accused's extortion.Ryunosuke: The point is, among the names of these debtors is your name... ...Mr Bruce Fairplay.Fairplay: ...!Judge: What?! Mr Fairplay! Are you currently indebted financially to the accused?Fairplay: Arrrgh! No! Well...it's, it's barely worthy of being called a debt...Ryunosuke: According to this ledger, you owe twenty guineas. Not an inconsiderable sum of money, wouldn't you say?Fairplay: Argh! Well, well what of it?!Ryunosuke: Let's suppose Mr McGilded were to be found guilty of murder... What would become of your debt in that case?Judge: Hm, these documents state that the loan agreement is forged between two individual parties. Therefore, were the creditor - the defendant here - to be sentenced to a capital punishment... ...all outstanding debts which were owed to him would be annulled. They would cease to exist.Susato: Cease to exist?!Ryunosuke: Mr Fairplay! Is it not the case that you claimed in your testimony to have seen something you never in fact saw... ...in a devious attempt...to annul your debt of twenty guineas to the defendant!Fairplay: Gugh... GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! ...Mr Bruce Fairplay!Fairplay: Y-Yes, My Laaarghd?Judge: Let me ask you again. And be aware that your answer may have most serious implications upon your future, sir.Fairplay: Grrr...Judge: Did you or did you not... ...see the precise moment in time at which the defendant is alleged to have thrust a knife into the victim?Fairplay: ......... .........Ryunosuke: Your silence speaks volumes! You did NOT tell the truth in your testimony!Fairplay: Alright! Now let's not make a melodrama out of this. Perhaps I did...overstate the truth a pinch.Ryunosuke: A pinch?Fairplay: But it makes no difference! I definitely remember seeing blood on McGilded's hands! Both of them!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: And yet! Only one of the defendant's gloves, which we have here as evidence, is stained!Fairplay: Grrr... So you keep saying!Furst: ......... I, I wonder if I might be allowed to speak, sir?Judge: Go ahead, Mr Furst.Furst: Well, the thing is...I think I remember seeing it myself, as it happens.Ryunosuke: Seeing what?Furst: The blood, sir. On the assailant's hands. I think... Yes, I'm, I'm almost sure that it was on both of his hands, not just one.Ryunosuke: Wha...? WHAAAT?!Judge: Hmph. It would appear that we're going to need further testimony from all you witnesses. This time, I would like to know precisely what you DID and what you did NOT see! ...Do I make myself perfectly clear?Fairplay: Y-Yaaarghsss...Susato: Mr Naruhodo! This is good news! The course of the trial seems to have shifted slightly at last!Ryunosuke: Yes! (I might finally have a chance to turn things around here...)Witness Testimony - What the Witnesses Really Saw -Fairplay: There was blood on both hands of the assailant. I sincerely and distinctly remember that! However...I, I suppose you might say that I didn't see the exact moment the stabbing transpired...if that matters.Furst: I remember seeing the knife. And, and I remember seeing both of the attacker's hands with blood on them.Beppo: I, I d-didn't actually s-see anything myself. No. N-Not until I h-heard that scream.Fairplay: Anyway, the fact remains! There can't have been anyone else inside that carriage, or we all would have seen!Judge: Well, lo and behold... ...in truth of fact, not one of you was witness to the crucial moment the crime was perpetrated!Fairplay: I, I apologise, My Lord! But... But honestly... Argh! There was no one else inside that carriage, and the man's hands were covered in blood! Grrr... That much incriminating evidence is tantamount to saying we saw the man do it!Ryunosuke: That's...really not what testimony is about.Van Zieks: ...Let us examine the interior of the omnibus once more. The victim's fresh blood is clearly visible on the seat, corroborating the witnesses' accounts. In other words, there is no substantial - nor significant - change in the facts of the case.Judge: Hm... Very well. Your cross-examination, please, Counsel.Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord!Cross-Examination - What the Witnesses Really Saw -Gina: So I snuck inside the carriage before they 'ooked up the 'orses, just like always.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So...you were already in the omnibus before it even set off on its run? Gina: Well yeah. I mean, wot's the point of spendin' a joey to make a few bob, eh? That's a rum idea, innit? Ryunosuke: (I suppose she means there's no point spending money to make money. ...It actually makes sense.) Judge: Counsel. May I remind you that this girl is a petty thief? Kindly refrain from entertaining her tenets. McGilded: Well, that does clear up the little mystery of the fares an' all. Four payin' passengers at fivepence a piece, makin' the twenty to which the cabman testified. ...And one little scapegrace ridin' for free. Gina: The red conk of a driver always goes for some grub before 'is last run, see. So that's when I slip into the carriage and get meself 'idden under the seat. ...Nice an' easy, right? Van Zieks: But your hiding place is a storage compartment. Full of equipment for the coach...no? Gina: ......... Yeah, there's brushes and buckets and wotnot in there, sure. I always chuck all that out and cram it in a corner somewhere. No one ever seems to bother much. Van Zieks: And yet, according to the report filed by the police officer who first arrived at the scene... ...the compartment was full of such paraphernalia. Gina: ...Well, I don't know nuffin' about that. Like I said, I moved all that stuff out so I could 'ide under the seat. That's all I can tell ya. Judge: Hm... It seems we've reached the end of that line of enquiry. Continue...Gina: But it was a right old waste o' time. I got nuffin' to show for me troubles that night.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: 'A waste of time'? Why is that? Gina: Well, most nights I'm on me own in the God permit at least some o' the time. Judge: I, I beg your pardon? Did you say, 'God permit'? Gina: Oh, yeah. Well that's wot my kind call it. You'd say the 'omnibus', I s'pose. The point is, any normal run, the carriage ain't got no one in it for a while. Ryunosuke: And that's when you come out of your hiding place and get away? Gina: That's it. Only that night... ...this cove was sat on me seat from the start. And 'e didn't budge the whole way, did 'e? Not one inch! I was totally stuck. Judge: Do you mean to tell us that you were present in the carriage for the duration? You were under the seat the entire time while events unfolded in the enclosed cabin? Gina: Yeah. ...Right, Mister? McGilded: To be sure, to be sure. I was as shocked as anyone. You don't expect to lift the cushion you've been sat on and find a child now, do you? Ryunosuke: (Hm... So this Miss Lestrade couldn't possibly be the culprit then...)Gina: I'll tell ya, you can't see a blind thing in that hidin' place. It's pitch in there.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you couldn't see out into the cabin at all? Gina: Not a jot. Most days I push the cushion up wiv me 'ead an' look out the crack. Then I can 'ave a butcher's at who I'm gonna fiddle. Ryunosuke: I thought you were a pickpocket, not a butcher... Gina: I mean, I can 'ave a look. The seat I get under ain't as plush as the other one, see. So most o' the time, the passengers plant 'emselves opposite. But for some reason that night, this 'ere Irishman spent the whole journey right over me 'ead! Ryunosuke: And for that reason, you weren't able to push the cushion up to peek out. I see... Gina: Truth is... ...I ain't too 'appy in small, dark places. Feels too much like bein' thrown in the clink. But it's the only place to 'ide in them carriages, so it's 'Obson's choice. Pursue Magnus McGilded (after pressing fifth statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...Is something wrong, Mr McGilded? McGilded: Oh! I do apologise. Was there sometin' the matter, Counsel? Ryunosuke: I'm just wondering if Miss Lestrade's last comment made something occur to you, perhaps? You seemed to be thinking something to yourself. McGilded: Oh, no no. 'Twas nuttin' important. I was feelin' bad for the poor lass, is all. I remember feelin' desperate meself as a young lad, shut up in the dark. 'Twas terrifying, so it was. Ryunosuke: I see. Yes, I'm sure we can all sympathise. (I'm still scared of the dark now...) McGilded: Aye. And I don't know about yeself... ...but I find that the darkness seems to make everytin' you hear seem that much louder as well. Gina: ......... Yeah... I, I s'pose it does...maybe. Ryunosuke: ...! Miss Lestrade! Did you hear something that night? Anything? An unusual noise, perhaps? Gina: ......... Nah. Not really. All I could 'ear was the Irishman snorin'. McGilded: Bejabers! There's no need to tell the whole world of me foibles, ye little scamp! Susato: What a pity... If only Miss Lestrade had heard something, it might have given us a vital new clue. Ryunosuke: Yes... (What should we make of that last statement of hers?) It's insignificant Ryunosuke: ...Well, I don't think we can draw any particular conclusions from that. Judge: Hmm... Very well, if that is the position of the defence. Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: What's the matter, Miss Susato? Susato: Well...I don't know... Is that really true, do you think? Ryunosuke: It, it must be, surely? She said that she didn't hear anything. Susato: Perhaps that's precisely the point. Could that be important in and of itself? Ryunosuke: ...! (The fact that she heard nothing...) Judge: Continue with the cross-examination, Counsel. Leads back to cross-examination It's profoundly important Ryunosuke: My Lord! I believe the statement just made by the witness is profoundly important! Judge: Profoundly important?! But, but all she said... ...was that she heard nothing! Ryunosuke: Yes! Which is the profoundly important point! I'm almost sure of it! Judge: ...Hm, I'm almost sure that I don't understand the inner workings of your Eastern mind, Counsel. Nevertheless... Miss Gina Lestrade! You will supplement your formal testimony by repeating that last statement, please. Gina: Wot? Supperment? Wot are you on about? Don't gimme all your fancy talk! I know wot yer tryin' to do! Well it won't work on me! Ryunosuke: (That's right, insult the judge. Always a good move...) Adds statement \"I was strainin' me ears to work out wot was goin' on, but all I could 'ear was snorin'.\" Ryunosuke: (Why doesn't she just stick to picking people's pockets in the open, then? I'd say there's some reason that she's not letting on, judging from her demeanour.) Gina: So anyways, I was a bit scared, but I 'ad to just stick it out under there. Nuffin' else for it.Gina: I was strainin' me ears to work out wot was goin' on, but all I could 'ear was snorin'.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you were straining to hear what was happening the entire time? Since the moment you hid yourself? Gina: Um... Not exactly, no. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Gina: Well, there was no one in the cabin to start wiv. I could just push the cushion up and 'ave a butcher's to see wot was wot. But then, when I saw this swell gettin' on, I got me 'ead down so 'e didn't notice me. Ryunosuke: And Mr McGilded sat on the seat under which you were hiding, correct? Gina: Yeah! Would you Adam an' Eve it, eh?! Wot a mug! So then all I could I [sic] do was listen. I was waitin' to jump out o' there as soon as I 'eard 'im leave, see. But would 'e? Not likely! Even though he stopped 'ere an' there, I never 'eard the door open. So I just 'ad to stay put an' listen to 'im drivin' 'is pigs to market. Snorin' like an old dog, 'e was. McGilded: ......... Ryunosuke: (Hm, are there any conclusions we can draw from that, I wonder?) It makes sense Ryunosuke: ......... Well, that all seems to make sense. Judge: You took your time reaching that conclusion, Counsel. Van Zieks: ...Heh. Ryunosuke: (What was that from van Zieks? ...Is he...laughing?) Judge: Very well, then. Continue with the cross-examination. Leads back to cross-examination It doesn't add up Ryunosuke: Miss Lestrade! What you have just told the court... ...is clearly at odds with the facts! Gina: Ah! Judge: At odds?! Are, are you sure, man? Ryunosuke: Absolutely. Van Zieks: It seems my learned Nipponese friend is not as dull-witted as I feared. Ryunosuke: (So van Zieks realised it too...) Judge: Counsel! I must insist that you bolster your claim with evidence! Or some complicit party's name at the very least! Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord! Judge: I expect you to demonstrate this alleged contradiction to the court. Ryunosuke: (According to Miss Lestrade, whilst she was hiding in the omnibus that night... ...she heard nothing but the sound of Mr McGilded snoring. But think, Ryunosuke, think! There's something else she should have heard...) Show a piece of evidence Ryunosuke: Very well, My Lord. Allow me to elaborate... ...on a particular sound that Miss Lestrade could not have failed to hear on the night in question. The sound very clearly explained by the following piece of evidence!  Present anything Ryunosuke: Van Zieks: It would seem phantoms are at work again. This time in my Nipponese friend's ears. Judge: I concur. No sound is apparent to me at all. Ryunosuke: Oh... Van Zieks: Allow me to introduce you to a sound that will be very real indeed, however. The sound of your death throes! Ryunosuke: Gaaargh! (Ugh... He's right. That was loud...) Judge: Well then, Counsel? Leads back to: \"According to Miss Lestrade, whilst she was hiding in the omnibus that night...\" Show a person Ryunosuke: Very well, My Lord. Allow me to elaborate... ...on a particular sound that Miss Lestrade could not have failed to hear on the night in question. The sound very clearly explained by the presence of the following person!  Present 'Thrice-Fired' Mason profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"'Thrice-Fired' Mason...?\" Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Van Zieks: It would seem phantoms are at work again. This time in my Nipponese friend's ears. Judge: I concur. No sound is apparent to me at all. Ryunosuke: Oh... Van Zieks: Allow me to introduce you to a sound that will be very real indeed, however. The sound of your death throes! Ryunosuke: Gaaargh! (Ugh... He's right. That was loud...) Judge: Well then, Counsel? Leads back to: \"According to Miss Lestrade, whilst she was hiding in the omnibus that night...\" Forget it Ryunosuke: (Hm... I just can't seem to think this through...) Sorry, My Lord. I need to withdraw the allegation for now. Van Zieks: ...What you need, Counsel, is to withdraw forever. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Judge: So be it. Continue with the cross-examination. Leads back to cross-examinationGina: Then after a while, I 'ear this loud bang. Nearly jumped out me skin, I did. An' the scream just...came out.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say a 'loud bang', do you mean the noise of someone falling to the floor? Gina: ......... Could've been...I s'pose. I...don't remember so well. Point is, it made me jump. Ryunosuke: And you let out a scream, involuntarily? Gina: That's right. And then I felt the cushion over me 'ead get lighter all of a sudden. Ryunosuke: Presumably when the defendant got up in order to help the victim, yes. Van Zieks: ...Or not. It could equally have been the moment the accused stood in order to stab his victim...could it not? Judge: Well, girl? Did you see what happened at that crucial moment? Gina: ......... Yeah, I saw it. Ryunosuke: ...! Gina: I pushed up the cushion and 'ad a quick butcher's while I 'ad the chance, didn't I? The Irishman was sittin' up the bloke wot 'ad fallen on the floor on the seat opposite. Susato: That matches Mr McGilded's account, of course. Gina: But then! The fella suddenly turns around an' looks right at me! I sunk back down again, but it was too late by then. I should never 'ave risked lookin'...Gina: It's because o' that, this swell found me. ...'E did 'elp me get away, mind.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: And when Mr McGilded discovered you, he pulled you out from your hiding place? Gina: I was scared stiff, I was. 'E dragged me out and sat me down on the seat an' all. Ryunosuke: Next to the victim, Mr Mason? Gina: Yeah... The bloke 'ad a knife in 'is guts. 'E was...still bleedin'. Then the carriage lurched a bit, and 'e ended up fallin' onto me. Susato: Ugh... How awful... Gina: Both me 'ands got covered in blood. It made me feel sick as a dog. Ryunosuke: (Both her hands covered in blood... That must be what the rooftop passengers saw.) After that, I believe you talked with Mr McGilded for a while. Is that correct? Gina: ...'E asked me some stuff. Wanted to know me name an' wot I was up to an' that. Then I 'eard somefin' from up above. Someone screamed. Judge: Yes, Mr Furst on the roof deck, one would presume. Gina: Well I didn't want no one seein' me face, so I didn't look up. Then the 'orses were drawn up smartish and this 'ere Irishman says to me: 'Get back under the seat. I'll see that you can get away later.' Judge: Hm...Susato: All six members of the jury had decided the defendant was innocent.Ryunosuke: For one brief shining moment, yes...Susato: It's clear that they are all still very unsure. If we could just find some conclusive piece of evidence among this new testimony... ...I'm sure we would clinch the verdict we want!Ryunosuke: Yes, I think you're right. (And I have this niggling feeling... Something's bothering me...but I just can't quite put my finger on it.)Judge: 'Thrice-Fired' Mason...?Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord. The sound that Miss Lestrade cannot have failed to hear... ...is that of the victim, Mr Mason, boarding the omnibus!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Explain your reasoning, Counsel!Ryunosuke: Miss Lestrade, allow me to confirm something. You claimed earlier that you were the first person on board the omnibus. Is that correct?Gina: Yeah, 'course I was! I got on while the driver was in the pub, didn't I?Ryunosuke: And...the next person to board the omnibus was Mr McGilded?McGilded: That it was. Not a soul was in the cabin when I climbed aboard. ...At least, not in plain sight.Ryunosuke: So you were, to all intents and purposes, alone in the enclosed cabin of the omnibus at that time?McGilded: Did I not just say as much? I wasn't travellin' with anyone else, if that's what you mean.Gina: Yeah, I saw 'im get on, remember? Through the crack under the seat cushion. 'E was on 'is own for sure.Ryunosuke: And, from what we've heard, the carriage made a number of stops after that on its onward journey. ...During which time, did you not hear the door opening or closing at all?Gina: Nah, I never 'eard it. That's exactly wot I was listenin' for, weren't it? Waitin' for this swell to leave.Ryunosuke: In which case... ...when and how did the victim end up in the carriage?Judge: Ah!Ryunosuke: We know that the victim collapsed inside the enclosed cabin of the omnibus. Therefore... ...Miss Lestrade's statement about what she did - or did not - hear...is at odds with the facts!Gina: Ah!Van Zieks: Yes. This petty thief's statement was clearly flawed.Judge: Lord van Zieks!Ryunosuke: (Yes... He knew. He knew all too well that there was an inconsistency in Miss Lestrade's statement.)Van Zieks: Keh...heh...heh... It would seem words of thanks are in order for my learned friend.Ryunosuke: What are you talking about?Van Zieks: You have demonstrated matters impeccably. This witness, and her...colourful statements... ...are entirely unreliable! Her words are convenient untruths, nothing more!He's dead right...How could the victim possibly not have boarded the omnibus? That makes no sense whatsoever...And this girl is a pickpocket. Let's not forget that.Ryunosuke: Agh! (She, she didn't even say anything!)Juror No. 6: I didn't want to judge the dear little mite just because she has some rather naughty ways. But I must say... ...I can't abide liars.Juror No. 1: And neither can I!Ryunosuke: M-Mr Foreman!Juror No. 1: I didn't want to judge the girl just because she has some less than salubrious ways. But I must say... ...I cannot abide liars.Ryunosuke: Argh!Susato: Mr Naruhodo! That's five jury members leaning towards guilty!Van Zieks: ...Well, your consideration for others is...refreshing, my Nipponese friend. To the considerable troubles you have spared me! ...Yes, very refreshing.Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!McGilded: GAAAAAARGH! What are ye playin' at?! Have ye forgotten who you're workin' for, ye useless Eastern amadan!Juror No. 3: ...This is carnage! It's perfect!Ryunosuke: (Juror number two is the only one left...)Susato: Mr Naruhodo! The way this is going...Ryunosuke: (I know. If we can't find some new way to convince everyone of Mr McGilded's innocence... ...the judge will rule and we'll have lost!)Juror No. 2: I very much wanted to believe the words of one of London's most respected gentlemen. But... ...those of us in service know we must accept hard truths.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Yes, the witness's last statement seems to have revealed a critical inconsistency in her story. However! If we consider the possibility that her statement is in fact the truth... ...it may shed an entirely new light on this whole case!Van Zieks: What are you saying?Gina: ...!McGilded: Counseeel!Juror No. 2: I'm...sorry, sir? Whatever do you mean?Judge: Counsel, I will not tolerate you attempting to prorogue my adjudication! Explain yourself at once!Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: When the accused boarded the omnibus on the night in question, the victim was nowhere to be seen. Subsequently... ...the carriage door was not heard opening a single time, as testified by the witness in the stand.Judge: And yet the victim's body was found inside the carriage.Van Zieks: IF this petty thief's words are to be believed... ...how do you explain the victim's miraculous appearance inside the cabin of the omnibus?Ryunosuke: ......... There's only one way to explain how the victim came to be inside the carriage...He was in there already Ryunosuke: Clearly he was in there already from beforehand! Van Zieks:   Van Zieks: Tell me, my learned friend...what was the function of that 'clearly' in your last sentence? Ryunosuke: Hm? Judge: Well said, Lord van Zieks. The 'clearly' is troubling me also. Ryunosuke: No, no! That's really not the point! The point is that the victim must have been in the carriage from beforehand. Van Zieks: Then answer me this... By 'beforehand', to what specific point in time are you referring? Ryunosuke: ......... Well...clearly...erm... Judge: I shall have to penalise the defence heavily for this irrelevant rambling. Ryunosuke: (Ugh...I must learn to ramble more relevantly...)  Van Zieks: The penalty is evidently not heavy enough...judging from those Nipponese eyes. So I ask you again... Leads back to: \"IF this petty thief's words are to be believed...\"There's another entrance Leads to: \"If the door wasn't opened even once...\"He was put there after he died Ryunosuke: Obviously, the victim must have been placed in the carriage AFTER he was killed! Van Zieks:   Van Zieks: Tell me, my learned friend...what was the function of that 'obviously' in your last sentence? Ryunosuke: Hm? Judge: Well said, Lord van Zieks. The 'obviously' is troubling me also. Ryunosuke: No, no! That's really not the point! The point is that the victim must have been moved into the carriage afterwards. Van Zieks: Then answer me this... How could a cadaver have been placed inside a moving carriage? Ryunosuke: ......... Well...obviously...erm... Judge: I shall have to penalise the defence heavily for this irrelevant rambling. Ryunosuke: (Ugh...I must learn to ramble more relevantly...)  Van Zieks: The penalty is evidently not heavy enough...judging from those Nipponese eyes. So I ask you again... Leads back to: \"IF this petty thief's words are to be believed...\"Ryunosuke: If the door wasn't opened even once... ...the only explanation is that the victim...entered the enclosed cabin some other way!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ...I wondered what new fantasy you would come up with in your blind panic. But behold! The omnibus is here for all to see. Only one side of the enclosed cabin is furnished with a door. The other has only windows. Fixed windows, which cannot possibly open. In short... ...there is no entrance to the cabin other than the door!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: But there could be! There's one possibility you haven't considered.Van Zieks: Oh really?Ryunosuke: Yes. One other way inside that isn't the door. Another opening, the use of which allowed the victim to 'appear' inside the enclosed cabin!Van Zieks: ...!McGilded: ...!Gina: ...!Judge: Alright, Counsel. The defence will identify the location for the court. Here is the omnibus on which the incident occurred. Where on earth is this 'entrance' by which you propose the victim entered the cabin?Present skylight Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The answer is obvious! It can only have been the skylight!\"Present anywhere else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It must have been here! This is how the victim came to be inside the cabin! Van Zieks: ...Humour me a moment while I consider your answer. You propose that it is possible to enter this omnibus without using the door, despite the windows being fixed. Ryunosuke: I, I do, yes... Van Zieks: Well, if you believe such a thing to be possible, pray, do demonstrate. And here's to you remaining inside...until the carriage has taken you back to the port for your inevitable departure. Ryunosuke: ...I'd like to stay here and try again, if it's all the same to you... Leads back to: \"Alright, Counsel.\"Ryunosuke: The answer is obvious! It can only have been the skylight!Judge: I say! The skylight?Van Zieks:Van Zieks: Your ludicrous proposal almost has me lost for words. However-Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: The skylight may well be large enough for someone to pass through!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: So you claim! But do you have a shred of evidence to support your addle-brained theory?Ryunosuke: ......... Both Mr McGilded and Miss Lestrade said the same in their testimonies... They each claim to have heard a loud thud, such as the noise made by someone falling to the floor.Judge: Yes, which has already been explained... ...as the sound of the victim falling from his seat having been assaulted with the dagger.Ryunosuke: Yes, it has. But! Would a man slipping from the seat onto the floor really have made such a loud noise as the witnesses describe? A noise loud enough to cause Miss Lestrade let out an involuntary cry, in fact...Judge: Good, good gracious!Ryunosuke: Perhaps in fact... ...that was the moment that the victim made his entrance into the cabin. No, let me rephrase that: The victim didn't enter the cabin as such... He fell into it!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: You're now suggesting...that the victim fell from the skylight into the cabin? That's simply impossible!Ryunosuke: How can you be so sure?Van Zieks: Because if the victim had fallen inside through the skylight as you say... ...the passengers on the roof deck would have seen it happen. And yet...not one person made mention of such events in their testimony.Ryunosuke: Well, um... Yes...that's true, but...McGilded:McGilded: Might a humble fella...make a wee comment here?Ryunosuke: Mr, Mr McGilded?!McGilded: ...To be sure now, the two fellas who were sat on the roof that testified afore... ...said nuttin' of the victim fallin' through the skylight. But...it seems to me, My Lord, that 'tis not so much a case of them not sayin', but... ...Aye... ...'tis a case of them bein' unable to say.Ryunosuke: Wha...?McGilded: I tink perhaps the two fellas... ...do be havin' sometin' of a compellin' reason not to mention what happened. Would youse not agree...fine ladies and gentlemen of the jury?Juror No. 1: Hmmmmmmph!Juror No. 2: Oh my...my goodness! Surely not...Juror No. 3: Those two chaps on the roof...?Juror No. 5: You mean, the ones who stuck that knife in the man were...?Juror No. 6: Aaaaaagh!???:Fairplay: Just what exactly are you insinuating here, you...you blitherer?!Furst: You rotter, he said! You rotter! What are you insinuating?Fairplay: This is a flaming outrage! I've a good mind to give you a blinker in a minute!Furst: He'll give you a shiner in a minute, he said! And so will I!Ryunosuke: Mr Fairplay!Fairplay: You're effectively accusing me - a city gentleman and well-respected banker!Furst: And me! A, a very angry hatter!Fairplay: Suggesting that someone like me could have stabbed that man in the guts, it's...it's... It's a disgrace! It's scandalous! It's...ARGH! I protest! I protest in the strongest possible terms!Furst: That's right! I protest, too! About you, you rotten scoundrel!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! This is not the time, witnesses! I will not permit this wanton invasion of the stand! Return to the anteroom at once!Fairplay: But, but this is beyond reason, My Lord! Argh! It's outrageous!Furst: It's, it's very hurtful, you know!Van Zieks: My Lord, if I may comment?Judge: Go ahead, Lord van Zieks.Van Zieks: It was the defence that incited this outburst from the witnesses. My learned friend has seen fit to abandon all protocol and accuse the witnesses without proof.Ryunosuke: A-Accuse? I, I never intended to...Van Zieks: ...It seems, young Nipponese, that your command of the English tongue is wanting.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: You proposed to this court that the victim fell through the skylight from the roof deck of the omnibus. That hypothesis cannot possibly stand without the rooftop passengers being aware of the events. You have branded these gentlemen liars! You have intimated their criminal guilt! In our British courts of law, that is what is termed a baseless accusation!Ryunosuke: ...! (I know I was rash to put this idea forward without any actual evidence, but... ...you can't just dismiss it without a second thought!)Juror No. 3: What are we wasting time for? Get them to - Hnurgh! - testify!Ryunosuke: ...!Juror No. 1: I thought there was something fishy about that hat from the moment I laid eyes on the fellow!Juror No. 5: We have to see this matter through now. One way or another!Juror No. 2: If there's filth and rubbish in our midst, we must dispose of it at once!Tes-ti-fy! Tes-ti-fy! Tes-ti-fy!Susato: What's...what's happening, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: The spectators in the public gallery are... They're in a complete frenzy!Judge: Mr Fairplay and Mr Furst...Fairplay: Um...My Lord...?Judge: You... You will take the stand again and make another formal testimony... ...in reference to the indictment brought by the defence!Fairplay: Um... Y-Yes...My Lord...Furst: I, I didn't come here for this...McGilded: .........Ryunosuke: (There's no time to think this through. All I can do...is keeping [sic] pushing forward!)Witness Testimony - Refuting the Accusation -Fairplay: We were the only two people up on that roof deck, dead or alive! ...I can swear to that!Furst: If anything had happened where we were sitting, don't you think one or the other of us would have noticed?Fairplay: In any case, neither of us know the first thing about the victim. We had no reason to kill the man!Furst: The skylight was shut the entire time, I tell you! We couldn't possibly have opened it!Fairplay: If you're so sure the victim fell through the skylight, where's your proof?Judge: Hm... I must say that on listening to this testimony, it is somewhat hard to imagine... ...how either witness could have performed any malevolent act on this open rooftop deck... ...without the other noticing forthwith.Fairplay: That's right, you see!Furst: We're innocent, I tell you!Juror No. 4: ...Although logically, of course, the argument falls down if the two of you were in collusion with one another.Fairplay: What?!Furst: Eh?!Van Zieks: According to investigations by Scotland Yard... ...the two witnesses share no common dealings.Juror No. 3: Hah! Well I don't trust coppers any more than I trust the stinking rich!Ryunosuke: (Something doesn't feel right here... The trial is going in our favour, really. So why do I feel so uneasy...?)Judge: Counsel for the Defence, over to you. Your cross-examination, please.Ryunosuke: Oh!

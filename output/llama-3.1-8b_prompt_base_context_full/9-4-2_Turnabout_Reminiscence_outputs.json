The piece of cloth that she conjured up has taken me back to many years ago... Defendant: Yeah, that's right. I did it. I killed the guy. But it was the Great Thief Yatagarasu that told me to do it! ???: Lawyer: I ask the defendant... Just what exactly are you trying to say? Defendant: Don't you get it? I know the true identity of the Yatagarasu! ...The Yatagarasu is the man standing over there at the prosecutor's bench! Prosecutor: Are you saying... that I'm the Yatagarasu? Defendant: Don't you dare deny it! You told me to kill him when you snuck into the embassy! Lawyer: Are you claiming that Mr. Faraday is the Yatagarasu? Defendant: That's exactly what I'm saying! Prosecutor: Prosecutor: Mr. Rell! I think we've heard just about enough out of you...! Defendant: Your Honor! Please listen to me! I'm telling the truth... You've gotta believe meeeeeee! Judge: Hmph... In accordance with the defendant's accusation... ...a new prosecutor shall be called to replace Mr. Faraday. This court will be in recess until the new prosecutor is ready. Edgeworth: (...It's almost time for me to enter the courtroom. And, so it is that my first assignment as a prosecutor will be... ...as a replacement for a prosecutor who has been accused by the defendant.) ???: Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ! ...Sir. ???: Have you read over all of the documents regarding this trial? Edgeworth: Yes, sir. I've memorized everything there is to know. ???: Very good. The paperwork for the prosecutor substitution is just about complete. Edgeworth... always bear in mind that as your mentor, I, Manfred von Karma... ...will accept nothing short of perfection. Edgeworth: I understand, sir. To have the chance to stand in court at such an early stage in my career... ...I am honored and proud. Manfred: As I have watched over your studies, I am giving you this very rare chance. Prove yourself. Crush the defendant's pathetic lies into oblivion. Edgeworth: .........Yes, sir! (That such a legendary prosecutor will be watching (changed from [is watching over] in the original release) and judging my performance... ...I have to be perfect in every way!) Edgeworth: If it is true that the Yatagarasu showed up at the Cohdopian Embassy... ...what could he or she have been after? Manfred: Hmph... No doubt to steal any suspicious accounting records and release them publicly. Or, more likely, to steal secrets from the Cohdopian Embassy itself... ...since the item that the Yatagarasu stole from there was sent to the police. Edgeworth: What was it that the Yatagarasu sent to the police? Manfred: ...I don't know the details. Anything related to the Yatagarasu is getting the top-secret treatment. Still, I find it very ironic. By returning the stolen item to the police, it was proof positive that the Yatagarasu... ...had infiltrated the embassy on the same day the staff member was killed. Criminals have a way of incriminating themselves, wouldn't you say? Edgeworth: That would have to be the first time the Yatagarasu has left evidence behind, correct? Manfred: Yes, indeed. If you wish to learn more about the Yatagarasu, then I suggest you ask Faraday. Edgeworth: Mr. Faraday...? Manfred: He happens to be the prosecutor in charge of the Yatagarasu case, as well. Edgeworth: (He's the prosecutor in charge of both the KG-8 Incident and the Yatagarasu case? Mr. Faraday really has a lot on his plate...) Manfred: ...What is it, little girl? ???: ......... ...You're scary, mister. Manfred: ! Edgeworth: Did you need something? ???: Umm... I want to trade these coins with you! Edgeworth: A fistful of dimes, quarters, and pennies... but it looks like you've exactly a dollar. Is this what you want? ???: Thanks! That's exactly what I needed! Edgeworth: Could that child be here to watch the trial? Manfred: How disrespectful for a child like that to be running around inside the courthouse! Does no one have respect for this country's judicial system anymore!? Bailiff: The paperwork for the prosecutor substitution is complete! Manfred: Why you! Do you even know how much time there is left before the trial resumes!? Bailiff: I... I-I'm so sorry! Manfred: I can have you mopping up this courthouse instead of protecting it in an instant! Bailiff: ! *gulp* Edgeworth: It's no bother, sir. Not being completely prepared could prove to be a perfect handicap for me. Manfred: Hmph. A proud one you are. You had better collect the evidence from Faraday and prepare yourself. It's time for your debut, Edgeworth! Manfred: .................. Edgeworth: .................. Manfred: Just what is going on!? Why isn't Faraday here yet!? How is it possible that the defense is not prepared yet, either!? Edgeworth: Bailiff... Where is Mr. Faraday? Bailiff: I-I'm not sure... I wasn't really paying attention... Judge: Ah, you must be the one Mr. von Karma recommended... I hear this will be your first trial. I look forward to seeing how you perform. Oh, by the way, was there someone celebrating a birthday during the recess? I could have sworn that I heard a popper going off... Come to think of it... The other day with my grandson... Edgeworth: Sir, it looks like the trial is about to resume, however... Manfred: ...Yes, it will be all but impossible to prove the witness a liar... ...without the evidence from Faraday! What is that blasted buffoon up to!? ???: I-I-It's an emergency, siiiiiirs! Judge: S-Silence! Manfred: There shall be no yelling in this sacred hall of law! Bailiff! Remove that man from this courtroom at once! ???: P-Please... wait! You have to listen to me! There's an emergency! Defendant Lobby No. 2...! M-Mr. Faraday and the defendant... Th-The two of them... They're... They're both dead, Your Honor! Judge: Wh--!? Manfred: Wh--!? Edgeworth: Wh--!? Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? ???: Stay back! Edgeworth: Ungh...! ???: ...No one's allowed on the crime scene... Period. Edgeworth: (Just who does this... oddball think he is...?) ???: This is becoming quite the hotspot... Edgeworth: (Isn't she Mr. Rell's defense attorney...?) ???: H-Hey, you! No running in the hallway, pal! Edgeworth: And who are you to tell me what to do? (I'll never find out what's going on like this. It's time for some civil discourse.) After clearing all Talk options with Tyrell Badd, Calisto Yew, and Dick Gumshoe: Bailiff: Ms. Yew! There is someone here who wishes to see you... Yew: ......Who is it? Bailiff: A Cohdopian Embassy staff member by the name of Manny Coachen. Yew: Wh--! Badd: .........! Edgeworth: (What's going on? Detective Badd and Ms. Yew's moods just changed all of a sudden. Wait a second... Wasn't Manny Coachen...!?) Yew: I'll be right there. Coachen: It's nice to see you again... Ms. Yew. Yew: Why are you here? I have no desire to ever see you again. Coachen: Now, now... Actually, would you mind stepping outside for a brief chat? Yew: ........Fine. Let's go. Manfred: ...Badd. Badd: Von Karma...? It's been a long time. Manfred: I knew you would show up. You usually do when the Yatagarasu is involved, and I see this case is no exception. Edgeworth: Do you know Detective Badd, sir? Manfred: Yes. He's like an old bloodhound that never leaves the scene of a crime. If only he would get a promotion and move on. Badd: It's the crime scene where a detective is most useful and effective. Manfred: Hmph! It's not like I don't know that. Moving on though, Badd. The man that I just passed by... ...was he not the suspect from the KG-8 Incident!? Edgeworth: (So I was right...!) Manfred: Just what is that man doing, wandering around here!? That Faraday... I can't believe he let such an easy catch get away! Imbecile! I would've proved his guilt in three minutes! Badd: Von Karma! ...I think you've said enough for now. It's in poor taste to speak like that about the departed. Manfred: Hmph... Very well. Back on topic... I'm placing Edgeworth in charge of the investigation here... ???: ???: Papa! How can you place him in charge!? Edgeworth: Franziska... What are you doing here? Franziska: I'm here for summer vacation, what else? Edgeworth: (Franziska von Karma... So she is here on vacation from Germany... She is the daughter of Manfred von Karma and a student of his, who's also junior to me.) Franziska: You're the one who's junior to me! And don't you forget it! Edgeworth: You're not conveniently avoiding the Bar Examination, are you? Franziska: Hah... If you were able to pass, then I'll have absolutely no trouble at all. I'll never allow myself to lose to you! Never! Edgeworth: (Why does she always have to be this competitive...?) Franziska: Anyway... Papa... Are you really assigning Miles Edgeworth to cover the case? Manfred: Yes, I am. Why do you ask? Franziska: Well, you know... I'm close to becoming a prosecutor myself... And I am 100% confident that I can do a better job than him! Edgeworth: (That's just like Franziska. She has no problem bad-mouthing someone right in front of them.) Manfred: ...Badd. Badd: Yeah...? Manfred: These two will be conducting the investigation. Badd: What? You want me to let both of these kids loose on the crime scene? Manfred: Hah. This is a perfect opportunity for them to work on their prosecutorial skills. Badd: A crime scene is not a place for children to be messing around in! Manfred: I'm the one with the authority over this crime scene, Badd. ...And I will not tolerate complaining. Badd: ...Knngh...! Manfred: Edgeworth! Franziska! I leave this case to the two of you. Edgeworth: Understood, sir. Franziska: Yes, Papa. Manfred: I'll go take care of the paperwork now. Remember, I'll accept nothing but a perfect report from the both of you. Do not disappoint me. Badd: Hold up, Von Karma.........! I still... haven't agreed to this! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth...! Edgeworth: It's been quite some time, Franziska. Franziska: This will be the perfect chance for us... ...to see which of us is truly worthy of the Von Karma name. Edgeworth: Would it kill you to at least say hello? Franziska: Unngh... Umm... Long time no see. Edgeworth: Very good. Franziska: Just because you became a prosecutor first doesn't mean you can act all proud! Edgeworth: (S-She hasn't changed a bit...) Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! As I was saying, we shall see which one of us is worthy of the Von Karma name... Badd: For cryin' out loud... I've been reduced to a babysitter... Edgeworth: (It looks like Mr. von Karma was successful in convincing the detective. That's just like him; he never fails.) Now, I'd appreciate it if you could quickly run me through the facts, Detective Badd. Badd: You're better off checking things out on your own. Edgeworth: ...Very well. (Seems like getting help from Detective Badd will be a most arduous task...) Edgeworth: (Nngh... Is the only real explanation that they killed each other simultaneously...?) Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! You should listen to someone until they are finished talking! Edgeworth: Umm... What are you talking about? Franziska: I'll only say it one more time... This is a competition to see who is truly worthy of the Von Karma name! Edgeworth: A competition...? Franziska: The person that figures out the truth first wins. Edgeworth: Hmph... So the person who doesn't discover the truth is a dishonor to the name? Franziska: Exactly! I don't care that you became a prosecutor before me... ...I simply refuse to hear any more foolish things come from your foolishly, foolish mouth. Edgeworth: Hmph... Fine, whatever makes you happy. Franziska: Can I take that as you accepting my challenge? Edgeworth: Once again... Whatever makes you happy. Franziska: Hah... Well then, let's begin the investigation, shall we? I'm going to find the perfect evidence and prettily present it like the professional I am. Edgeworth: (Competing to discover the truth behind a crime -- how delightfully... childish.) Badd: You kids, over there! Hold it! Edgeworth: \"Kid\"!? Franziska: Ha! Serves you right, Miles. He just called you a kid...! Badd: ...I said \"kids\", kid. Franziska: H-How dare you call me a kid as well!? Badd: I'll do what I please. And I won't allow you to cause a ruckus on my crime scene. Hey, big guy. You're... going to watch over these two. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Detective Badd, sir! Now, do what I say from now on kids, OK!? Franziska: You'd better not get in our way, Scruffy! You'll feel the bite of my whip if you do! Gumshoe: E-Eeek! Th-Then you, p-prosecutor boy! Let's get your investigation started already, alright!? Edgeworth: (Great. Now, even THAT detective is treating me like a child...) Gumshoe: Alright! It's time to get investigating! Get a move on, prosecutor boy! Edgeworth: ...My name is Miles Edgeworth. And if you were [sic] to call me \"prosecutor boy\" one more time... ...it will be my duty as a prosecutor to \"look into\" your monthly salary. Gumshoe: Wh-What!? And what would you do with my salary after you saw how much it was!? Edgeworth: That's up to you now, isn't it? Gumshoe: Really!? Sounds good, pal! Edgeworth: (He's so na\u00efve...) Edgeworth: Detective Badd, may I have a word with you? Badd: ...What is it? Edgeworth: It appears that both a knife and a gun were used as murder weapons. Badd: ...Yeah, it does. Edgeworth: That leads us to our first question of the investigation. Where did the men acquire the weapons? Badd: ...The gun was inside of Faraday's bag. It was a piece of evidence that was presented in the trial earlier today. It was used... to kill the Cohdopian Embassy staff member. But... I never heard anything about the knife. Mr. Rell was being held by the police. There's no way he could have brought it in. Which means it's possible that Faraday had the knife on him from the start as well. Edgeworth: (Could it have been a piece of evidence that had yet to be presented...? But then, why doesn't Detective Badd know about it? Wait! What if...!?) It's possible that Mr. Faraday brought the knife in under the guise of prosecutorial evidence. He could have then brought it out and attacked Mr. Rell with it. Badd: Huh... Maybe you've got a brain in there after all, kid. Edgeworth: Nngh...! (Is he going to treat me like a child forever!?) Badd: ...It looks like Mr. Faraday attacked Mr. Rell first, who then counterattacked... That's the only logical conclusion you can draw from a scene like this. Edgeworth: (Hmm... Not yet. I feel that it's much too early to be drawing conclusions already. I must first find conclusive evidence, so as to protect (changed from [ensure] in the original release) the honor of the Von Karma name.) After examining gun, Byrne Faraday's left hand, and knife: Edgeworth: Mr. Rell's cause of death was from being shot, correct? Gumshoe: That's what we think, but it's hard to tell with him lying face down. Edgeworth: Death is bad enough, but it's truly lamentable that someone would try to hide the truth. Gumshoe: ...Um, are you sure they were trying to hide something? Edgeworth: (I can't confirm Mr. Rell's cause of death with his body positioned like that.) Detective Badd, I'd like to examine the bodies in further detail, if possible... Franziska: What's this? You're not able to form a theory with them the way they are? Edgeworth: I believe an examination of the bodies is vital to finding the perfect evidence, don't you? Franziska: Hmm... I suppose you do have a point. Well!? Hurry up and get on with it! Badd: ...Labbie. Forensics: Yes, sir! We've taken enough photos of the scene, sir. Badd: ...And there you have it. Edgeworth: .................. Badd: .................. Edgeworth: D-Do you not approve? Badd: ...Of course not. Edgeworth: What!? Badd: Investigation of a crime scene is the work of a detective. So don't touch a thing. Hey, big fella, turn over the bodies for me, will you? Gumshoe: O-OK......... Please forgive me, Mr. Faraday, sir...! Badd: Gumshoe... do not get emotionally involved. Remember, you're a detective! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Understood, sir! Leads to examination of bodies After connecting all possible Logic and examining both wounds, open window, and TV: Gumshoe: I guess there's not much left to investigate, huh? They really did kill each other... Edgeworth: No... We can't conclude that quite yet. There's still something I find very peculiar here. The theory that they simply killed one another is too simplistic in this case. In fact, there is actually a contradiction that shows there is another possibility! Gumshoe: No way, pal! Really!? Edgeworth: Hmph... I suppose I will just have to show you the contradiction (changed from [conflict] in the original release) in this crime scene. Leads to examination of bodies Edgeworth: Now we come face to face with the contradiction I spoke of, and it is... this! Mr. Faraday used his left hand to write with his fountain pen. Ergo, he is left-handed. And yet, the handgun is in his right hand! Don't you find it odd that the left-handed Mr. Faraday would hold the gun in his right hand? That. lady and gentlemen... is the great contradiction haunting this crime scene! Gumshoe: Hey, you're right, pal! That does seem kinda strange! But... How could something like that happen? Edgeworth: The facts add up to one conclusion, and one alone. Someone else put the gun in Mr. Faraday's hand after he died. Gumshoe: Someone else...!? Edgeworth: Plastic bags scattered on the floor, and a gun in the wrong hand... I sense the presence of a shadowy figure behind this case. A person of vile intent who is serious about keeping the truth from us! Badd: Here's the autopsy report. Franziska: \"It is probable for that Mr. Rell survived for a short time after he was shot. However, Mr. Faraday died instantaneously from his stabbing.\" Interesting... Crime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer. Franziska: It looks like we now know everything we need to know about this case. Edgeworth: Are you sure we know everything...? Franziska: Of course! The incident began with Mr. Faraday attempting to get his revenge. The prosecutor went into a rage from being accused, and tried to kill the defendant... But, the defendant fought back and they ended up killing each other. It's all very clear and simple. There is absolutely no margin for doubt. Edgeworth: Do you really believe that to be the truth? Franziska: Hah! Are you saying that just because I figured out the truth before you... ...that you don't want to believe it's true? Edgeworth: N-Nngh... Franziska: It's alright. If you disagree with my argument, then prove me wrong. Well, if there are any contradictions to be found, that is... Edgeworth: Don't worry, I will. Franziska: Mr. Faraday's death was instantaneous, while Mr. Rell survived for a short time. From this, it is obvious that Mr. Faraday died after he shot Mr. Rell. And Mr. Rell, while on the brink of death, stole Mr. Faraday's knife and stabbed him. Those are the facts of this case. Edgeworth: (Mr. Faraday's death was instantaneous, therefore, he must've attacked first... Proving that logic to be false is probably the fastest way to show her that she's wrong. In that case, I should first look for any holes in her theory!) Franziska: Mr. Faraday's death was instantaneous, while Mr. Rell survived for a short time. Franziska: From this, it is obvious that Mr. Faraday died after he shot Mr. Rell. Franziska: And Mr. Rell, while on the brink of death, stole Mr. Faraday's knife and stabbed him. Franziska: They struggled, and Mr. Rell used the last of his strength to counterattack Mr. Faraday. Franziska: Those are the facts of this case. Edgeworth: (There's something strange about Franziska's theory... I should compare her claim with the data I've gathered thus far. I just know there's a contradiction somewhere!) Edgeworth: If the two men were fighting, their struggle would've surely caused quite a bit of noise. However, Detective Gumshoe testified that he heard absolutely nothing! Franziska: Hah. You place too much faith in that detective's testimony, you know. But for the sake of argument, let's say there wasn't a fight. How, then, did Mr. Rell get his hands on the knife? Edgeworth: Mr. Faraday's bag was sitting right here in Lobby No. 2. It is not hard to imagine that perhaps Mr. Rell saw a chance and took it out at some point! Franziska: .................. So... What you're saying this: Mr. Rell took a chance when he saw the opportunity, and took the knife from the bag. And then Mr. Faraday shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed...? Edgeworth: Hmm......... (Isn't there something... strange in Franziska's statement just now?) Edgeworth: It's simply not possible for Mr. Faraday to have shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed! Edgeworth: According to the coroner's report, Mr. Faraday died instantaneously, meaning... ..that he died immediately upon being stabbed by the knife! Ergo, he could not possibly have fired the gun after that! Franziska: ...Ooh, you got me. Edgeworth: But of course. Franziska: Well then, if the report is correct, then there is only one correct explanation. If we suppose that Mr. Rell attacked first... ...then Mr. Faraday, who died instantaneously, would have been unable to kill Mr. Rell. Therefore, Mr. Rell must have stabbed Mr. Faraday after he was shot. Then they both died. That is the only explanation that makes logical sense! Edgeworth: Negating your opponent's ideas in order to prove your own theory... I see you've been studying, Franziska. Franziska: I just wanted to explain it to you as simply as possible. Before you foolishly propose a foolish theory that only a foolish fool like you could. Edgeworth: Hmph... How na\u00efve of you to believe that only your opinions are valid... ...and still expect to discover the truth that the crime scene offers you... Franziska... You've still got a ways to go. Franziska: What are you talking about!? Are you saying there's a flaw in my logic!? Edgeworth: (Mr. Faraday died instantly... And the fact that he did is what gives rise to the contradiction in this scene!) The contradiction here in this crime scene is...! Edgeworth: Let me get this straight. What you are arguing is this: Mr. Faraday took the gun from his evidence bag and shot Mr. Rell. Then, the wounded Mr. Rell found an opportunity to take the knife and strike back. Upon being stabbed, Mr. Faraday died on the spot, and Mr. Rell died thereafter. If that's the case, then how do you explain this? Take a good look at the order in which their bodies are piled. Franziska: ............N-No...! Edgeworth: Mr. Faraday's body is lying on top of Mr. Rell's. Therefore... ...Mr. Rell must have died before Mr. Faraday! Franziska: I-Impossible! Edgeworth: (Yes, I agree that it seems strange no matter what angle you approach it from... ...which means that the real mystery behind this crime scene that we must solve is--!) Franziska: Franziska: No...! Not so fast, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What now...? Franziska: I simply think that you ought to think a bit more outside the box... And that it's even clearer now that the incident started with Mr. Faraday's murderous intent! Edgeworth: (She sure bounced back quickly. An explanation won't be enough this time. It's going to take some very decisive evidence to prove her wrong!) Franziska: It was just chance that Mr. Faraday's body fell on top of Mr. Rell's. The two bodies fell into a pile... ...which indicates that they attacked each other at the same time. It really doesn't matter in the slightest that they fell in the opposite order. Edgeworth: (I just know that Franziska's explanation isn't absolutely correct. All I have to do is find a hole in her logic! Once I do, I can then present her with the evidence that proves the contradiction!) Franziska: It was just chance that Mr. Faraday's body fell on top of Mr. Rell's. Franziska: The two bodies fell into a pile... Franziska: ...which indicates that they attacked each other at the same time. Franziska: That fact indicates that they attacked each other at the same time from close range. Franziska: It really doesn't matter in the slightest that they fell in the opposite order. Edgeworth: (The fact that the order that they attacked each other in... ...varies from the order they fell in doesn't cause a problem for me. However, there's definitely one certain aspect that I'm having trouble swallowing!) Edgeworth: So you believe they killed each other at close range...? Sorry, but that's impossible. Just as it is written in the crime scene notes... ...the firing of the handgun did not leave a gunpowder burn on Mr. Rell's clothes. Therefore... Mr. Rell and the gun... ...must have been separated by a distance of at least two or three yards! Franziska: Aaaaah! Edgeworth: (Yes... This is by far the biggest contradiction! The two bodies are piled up on each other, yet the gun was fired from a distance. And with there being no chance that Mr. Rell moved that far after being shot... ...that leaves only one possible explanation!) Franziska: Wh-What a completely foolish line of foolish thought from a thoroughly foolish fool! If I'm not right... ...then who was it that made the first move with the intent to kill, huh!? Who!? Edgeworth: The person that attacked first with murderous intent? That would be... Edgeworth: Here in this room... ...contradictions appear no matter which man we claim attacked first. Thus, there can be only one explanation. There was... a third person here! Franziska: ...! Edgeworth: It was that third person who killed both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell... ...and set their bodies up to make it look like a double murder... That third person is the real culprit! Franziska: ............ Miles Edgeworth... There's just one thing you're missing. Edgeworth: ...Evidence, correct? Franziska: Exactly. Everything you've said up until now is nothing but a story played out in your head. However, this is where the real test begins. Can you prove that there was a third person involved in this crime!? Edgeworth: ...Of course. (If a third person was [sic] truly here, that fact would resolve the glaring contradiction. The proof that this has all been a set-up, made to look like they killed each other... I'll present it, and lay bare the final piece of the puzzle that's not yet in place! What is the piece of evidence that proves there is a third person involved...?) Edgeworth: The gun in Mr. Faraday's hand and the plastic bag with his blood on it... These two items point to the presence of a third person. Franziska: How so...? Edgeworth: Recall Detective Gumshoe's testimony. Gumshoe: I was in the hallway the whole time, but I didn't hear a single peep of a struggle. Edgeworth: If there wasn't a struggle in this room... ...then there shouldn't be any plastic bags on the ground. Meaning that someone else must've deliberately scattered them around! Franziska: ...! Edgeworth: Do you not see the possibility in this? Disregarding the gun for the moment... ...there's a high probability of blood splatter when a knife is used on a person. If the culprit held the knife with a plastic bag around it... ...they could use the bag to catch any blood splatter from when they withdrew the knife. Then, by spreading a few more plastic bags around, mixing the bloody one in with them... ...and arranging the room to make it look like there was a struggle between the two... ...they were able to conceal their presence! Franziska: Aaaaaaaaah! Badd: Looks like... we've still got a long way to go in this investigation... Edgeworth: Yes. ???: Gumshoe: Wh-What the heck's up with you, pal!? Yew: Mr. Badd, I advise you to place Detective Gumshoe under arrest. Gumshoe: Wh...WHAAAAAAAAAAAT!? Badd: ......What's the meaning of this? Yew: Hah! Looks like you're not man enough to discipline your own subordinates. Badd: ...Don't you dare...! Yew: That detective claims he was there, standing in front of the door the entire time... ...but I have it on good authority that it was all a giant lie! Badd: ......! Edgeworth: ...Ms. Yew! I ask that you please explain that last statement! Yew: I'll let His Honor explain it himself. Judge: I-I saw it with my own eyes, I tell you! During the recess, there was a period of time when there was no one in the hallway! Gumshoe: Whaaaaaaaaaaat!? Yew: See, Mr. Badd? So I ask you, why would a detective who was supposedly doing his job the whole time... ...want to fabricate such a lie? Badd: ...Gumshoe. Did you... Did you kill Faraday...!? Gumshoe: N-Noooooooooooooooooo! Of course not, sir! Franziska: It would appear that the one who set this whole crime scene up is that detective. ...Which basically renders his testimony a complete lie and wholly invalid. It looks like your \"perfect\" logic has just come tumbling down, Miles. Edgeworth: Nngh... Gumshoe: I was in the hallway the whole time, but I didn't hear a single peep of a struggle. Edgeworth: (Was that statement really a lie...?) Badd: ...Detective Gumshoe. You're now a suspect in the murder of two men. Now, spit out the truth, or so help me...! Gumshoe: I...I haven't lied to anyone, sir! Honest! I really was really there... I was in the hallway the whole time! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective Badd, I ask that you please do not act without my permission. After all, I am the one that is heading up this investigation, am I not? Badd: .........Don't talk like you know what's going on, boy... Edgeworth: All I want is for this investigation to run perfectly. Franziska: Perfection is the only wish of a disciple of Von Karma, after all. Edgeworth: Therefore, before you take Detective Gumshoe into custody... ...I'd like to set the record straight on something. Badd: ...And what's that...? Edgeworth: (Hmm, what should I ask Detective Gumshoe about...?) Edgeworth: I suppose the one thing I'd like (changed from [liked] in the original release, correcting the typo) clarified... ...is Detective Gumshoe's motive for committing this crime. Badd: Hmph... Motive, huh. Gumshoe... You got a grudge against Faraday or anything...? Gumshoe: N-No, sir! Not me! Not a single bad thing against Mr. Faraday, sir! Badd: ...Is that a fact...? Yew: Yew: ...You really have a problem with lying, don't you, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I'm telling you... I AM NOT LYING! Franziska: The more unnatural you act, the more suspicious you become, you know. Yew: If you want a motive, Edgeworth, I have one for you right here. Edgeworth: Could you please share it with us? However, be forewarned that I won't hesitate to object to flights of fancy... ...because all I'm interested in is the perfect explanation. Yew: Phwwh! Ahahahahahaha! You're serious, aren't you? ...Fine. You amuse me, so I'll humor you with a little courtroom practice. Yew: It was... about a week ago. I saw the detective get chewed out by a livid Faraday in front of the precinct. He stood there super pale, as Mr. Faraday yelled, \"That's a salary cut for you, you nitwit!\" A brand new detective suddenly getting his salary cut -- that's reason enough for a grudge. Well? How's that for the \"perfect explanation\"? Gumshoe: Y-You totally misunderstand me, pal! No matter how mad I get, I could never hold a grudge! Badd: .........Quiet. We can't trust anything you say...! Gumshoe: Sir... Edgeworth: (Hmm... There's nothing wrong with the motive she proposed, per se... ...but there are some gaps in her logic that need to be filled in. Ms. Yew's \"perfect explanation\"... ...may not be so \"perfect\" at all...!) Yew: It was... about a week ago. Yew: I saw the detective get chewed out by a livid Faraday in front of the precinct. Yew: He stood there super pale, as Mr. Faraday yelled, \"That's a salary cut for you, you nitwit!\" Yew: A brand new detective suddenly getting his salary cut -- that's reason enough for a grudge. Yew: Well? How's that for the \"perfect explanation\"? Edgeworth: (Detective Gumshoe certainly had a motive to kill Mr. Faraday. However, there is just one thing I can't wrap my head around in this explanation. I'll just have to force Ms. Yew to explain herself fully!) Edgeworth: Alright, if you could clear this one thing up for me...! Edgeworth: I understand Detective Gumshoe's potential motive for killing Mr. Faraday... ...however, what about his motive for killing Mr. Rell? Yew: His motive for killing Rell? Like I would know. Edgeworth: Hmph... If there was [sic] no clear motive for both of the murders... ...then I doubt this incident would've occurred. Wouldn't you agree? Yew: .................. Edgeworth: Is there anyone else who might have had a grudge against either of the two men? Or should we look into that ourselves? Yew: Oh... In that case... .........I have absolutely no idea. Edgeworth: .........! (What? But that's impossible! She must know SOMETHING!) Yew: Phwwh... Wait... Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Can you please not glare at me like that? ...It makes me laugh. Phwwwwwh! Edgeworth: (Grr...! I didn't even do anything, and you're already laughing away!) Yew: Well, anyway... the way I see it, as long as he had a motive to kill one of the two... ...this crime would've played out the way it did anyway. Edgeworth: ...Oh? Would you care to explain your logic? And this time, please try to provide a truly perfect explanation. Yew: Phwwwwh...! Perfect this, perfect that... Stop being so uptight, or is that a requisite trait for being a Von Karma? Ahahahaha! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! I demand that you shut this rude woman up! Edgeworth: (...I wish you'd BOTH be quiet for just one second...) Yew: Ahem... Oh well. I guess I'll just have to explain it to you kids. Yew: There's no one out there with a motive to kill both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell. All you really have to establish is that someone had a grudge against one of the two men. Mr. Rell, who happened to be there, became a witness to Mr. Faraday's murder. Therefore, he was killed out of necessity, and set up to look like they had killed each other. Edgeworth: (I wonder if that's really true... Is there no one out there with a grudge against both men? I should take another hard look at the evidence for this morning's case. The second KG-8 Incident, as people are calling it, involving an Embassy staff member... ...and the two men who both wound up as suspects in the case... Is there someone else I'm overlooking who is somehow related to them?) Yew: There's no one out there with a motive to kill both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell. Yew: All you really have to establish is that someone had a grudge against one of the two men. Yew: Mr. Rell, who happened to be there, became a witness to Mr. Faraday's murder. Yew: Therefore, he was killed out of necessity, and set up to look like they had killed each other. Edgeworth: (I have to admit, her explanation makes sense. However, there is also something she overlooked in her testimony. I should present that piece of evidence, and see if I can't make her see the truth!) Edgeworth: Ms. Yew. I believe there is someone you overlooked in making your statement. Or rather... is it because you'd rather not bring this person up...? Yew: .........What do you mean? Edgeworth: We are looking for someone with a reason to kill both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell... I can think of at least one person that fits the bill! He was the suspect in the original KG-8 Incident... ...and a member of the Cohdopian Embassy staff, Mr. Manny Coachen! Yew: ...! Edgeworth: That's right. The very man who came to visit you earlier out in the hallway. Yew: .................. Edgeworth: The man who killed a member of the Cohdopian Embassy staff, Mr. Rell... ...and the man who was the lead prosecutor of the KG-8 Incident, Mr. Faraday... Are you telling me that Mr. Coachen has no reason at all to kill both of these men? Yew: Well......... I suppose he might have a reason or two... Gumshoe: You! You covered for me, pal! ...Maybe you're not such a bad guy after all. Edgeworth: Don't get ahead of yourself. You're still a suspect, make no mistake about that! The perfect evidence, the perfect testimony... These are the only things I wish to hold. Gumshoe: B-But I didn't do it...! Edgeworth: Hmph... You will stay under my authority, and go investigate Mr. Manny Coachen for me. And remember, I will not be very forgiving should any of this leak out-- ???: Badd: You want to investigate Coachen...? You'd just be wasting your time... Edgeworth: And why is that? Badd: ...Coachen was up in the viewing gallery, watching the trial... or so I was told. Every cop in this place has been keeping an eye on the guy since he arrived... Franziska: Then the only real suspect we have is still Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: ...I suppose so. Gumshoe: No way... Come on, Detective Badd! You've gotta believe me, sir! I really was in that hallway the whole time, sir! I never took a single step into this room, sir! Badd: ...OK, then are you saying... there was someone else who passed through the hallway? Gumshoe: I-I... No... There was no one else, sir. Badd: .........Then why should I believe you didn't do it...!? Franziska: That is one incredibly foolish detective. Standing right in front of a crime scene all by himself... It's as good as a confession of guilt. Edgeworth: (I have to admit it's a bit strange. Most criminals will fabricate some sort of lie to escape their crimes. And if that detective really wanted to prove that he is innocent... ...you'd think he would at the very least offer up \"I spaced out while on duty\" or the like.) Badd: ...Come on, Gumshoe. Time for your interrogation... Gumshoe: .........Detective Badd... Franziska: Miles Edgeworth... I will go ahead and report this to Papa. Judge: And that, as they say is that! Right, everyone? Ho ho ho. Yew: Well, I suppose we should both be getting back to our real jobs now, huh? Edgeworth: Before we do, Ms. Yew, there is something I'd like to speak with you about. Yew: ...What is it? Edgeworth: Ms. Yew... I believe that I have proof of your connection to the KG-8 Incident. Yew: That file is your proof? Very well, then... Why don't you tell me exactly how I'm related to the KG-8 Incident? Edgeworth: Your connection to the KG-8 Incident... ...is through the victim! Yew: .........! Edgeworth: The victim's name is Cece Yew. You will note that she has the same last name as you. Can you really still tell me with a straight face that you are not related to this case? Yew: .........Phwwwwh. Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! ...Sorry, but we're not related. Edgeworth: Wh--!? Yew: .........Just kidding. You asked that question with such a serious look on your face... ...that I couldn't help but... Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Edgeworth: Mmmrrrrgh...! Ms. Yew, I ask that you please tell me the truth. Yew: ..................Ahem. Alright. I'll tell you everything I know. After clearing all Talk options with Calisto Yew: Yew: Well, this is about all I know. Haha... Sorry. Guess I wasn't much help, huh? Edgeworth: That's not true. I'm sorry I made you recall such a painful time in your life. Yew: Phwwh...... Ahahahahahahaha! Edgeworth, you really are too serious for your own good. You really need to learn to relax. We wouldn't want you to die of stress, would we? Edgeworth: ...Thank you for the advice, but there's no need to worry. I work in my own way, and I will catch this criminal in my own way as well. You'll see. Yew: Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Look at you with your game face on, ready to go! Edgeworth: I...! I'm making no such face! Yew: Did you know? Laughter is the best medicine, Edgeworth. Don't you get tired of making such a serious face all the time? Edgeworth: I'm charged with making sure that all the criminals of this world are found guilty. I... have no need for laughter. Yew: There you go, making that face again. Oh well. I've got to get going. I still have a few loose ends I need to tie up. Edgeworth: (.................. The KG-8 Incident and this murder investigation... It is my belief that these two cases are related to each other somehow. Plus, that detective... Detective Gumshoe...It's obvious he's lying, even though the lie is hurting his chances. ...Clearly, this case is far from over. But whether or not that detective is the murderer... ...can only be determined once I've completed my perfect investigation. Mr. von Karma... I swear to uphold your honorable name, or my name isn't Miles Edgeworth!) To be continued \nJudge: During the recess... I, um... I went to the restroom. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor... Why exactly did you pay a visit to the restroom, if I may ask? Judge: Oh! Well, isn't it obvious!? What else do you go to the restroom for!? Or, maybe... I-I-I-I-I knew it...! You suspect me of some sort of tomfoolery, don't you! Edgeworth: Please stay calm, Your Honor! (This is going to be much harder than I anticipated...) Judge: I-I'm sorry... You're right... I need to think things through with a level head. I'm just nervous because so much has happened today with this trial. Let's see... I announced a recess, and a time for us to reconvene... But having done all that, I still wasn't able to go the restroom right away. Edgeworth: And why couldn't you? Judge: Mr. Faraday had been accused, so I had paperwork to process regarding a new prosecutor. Once I had finished that, I was finally able to make a mad dash to the restroom. Edgeworth: (At least he stayed consistent on the \"going to the restroom\" part of his testimony...) Judge: There is a window on the hallway side. In other words, I could see into the hallway. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, did you really go to the men's restroom? Judge: Wh-Wh--!? What is the meaning of that statement!? Edgeworth: I simply meant... that perhaps you went to a restroom on a different floor. Judge: I had to go for such a long time... It was all I could do to dash to the closest one to the courtroom. Edgeworth: (Hmm... I suppose that's only natural, given his circumstances...) Judge: I ran from the courtroom, through this floor's main lobby and down the hallway. Once you enter, you can see there's a window just above the urinals. Edgeworth: And it was through that window that you witnessed Detective Gumshoe, Your Honor? Judge: Yes, exactlyyyyyyy! Edgeworth: Y-Your Honor! There is no need to yell! I can hear you just fine! Judge: Oh! I guess I put a little too much into that last answer. Now then, let's continue with the testimony. Judge: As I entered, I saw that detective buying something from the vending machines. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you sure that the person you witnessed was Detective Gumshoe, Your Honor? Judge: Yes, I'm absolutely sure. It's hard to miss someone of his stature, even from as far away as the restroom. Besides, I can't think of anyone else with that kind of hairstyle and big, beige coat. Edgeworth: Well, I was simply wondering if you were mistaken in what you saw... Judge: What!? Preposterous! My eyes are sharp as can be! Ready to see through lies to the truth! Although, recently, things do seem to be a bit fuzzier than they used to be... Edgeworth: (Clearly, his eyes are not the only things that have gone fuzzy!) Judge: But allow me to say with all the honor and dignity of a judge... ...I am not mistaken in what I saw! Judge: But when I was about to exit the restroom, he had completely disappeared! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: He disappeared? But Your Honor, didn't you just say... ...\"I saw that detective buying something from the vending machines\"? Judge: Why, yes! Yes, I did! The restroom window looks over the courtyard and right into the hallway. But! Just as I was about to exit, I took another look, and there was no one in sight! .................. That led me to the only solution to this mystery. That detective must've gone into the crime scene, Lobby No. 2 at that pooooooooooint! Edgeworth: (So he looked into the hallway from the restroom, and over the courtyard, did he...?) Present Det. Gumshoe's Fingerprints Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Wh-What was that finger wag for, Mr. Edgeworth!?\" Judge: A detective that goes missing while on duty... That sounds mighty suspicious to meeeee! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, I ask that you please remain calm. Judge: Nononononononononono! I-I-I-I'm cerfectly palm! Edgeworth: (You're being anything but \"perfectly calm\"!) Franziska: It appears that His Honor could not have been mistaken in what he saw. Edgeworth: Hmph, I suppose so, given his line of sight. However, Franziska, why do you suppose our lines of sight are so different? Franziska: ...If you're referring to my height... Edgeworth: C-Can't you hold that whip still for just a second!? Now, about His Honor's testimony... ...I believe his line of sight to be an important factor. Franziska: If it's that important, why don't you hurry up and tell him already? Edgeworth: (I will, but there is one more thing I need to do if I am to correct His Honor's testimony. I am going to need to retrace Detective Gumshoe's movements!) Judge: Wh-What was that finger wag for, Mr. Edgeworth!? And don't you know it's rude to shout \"Objection!\" while someone is giving testimony? Edgeworth: Hah. If you truly are a man of the law, then you must always be vigilant. For example, I (changed from [I, myself,] in the original release) never let an opportunity to shout \"Objection!\" pass me by! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth. It's one thing to be passionate about your job, but this is real life. Edgeworth: (This is what some people may say is the pot calling the kettle black...) Your Honor, I wonder if you might take a look at this for me? Judge: What is that filth!? How dare someone dirty the hallway bench like that!? Who is the culprit!? That party is hereby found GUILTY of uncleanliness!!! Edgeworth: If you must know, the uncouth bench sullier... ...has already been placed under arrest, thanks to your earlier testimony, Your Honor. Judge: Oh? ...Well that's good. But who was it? Edgeworth: We were able to discover something from the smudge on the bench. Namely, Detective Gumshoe's fingerprints. Judge: Not happy with committing just murder, he had to go and dirty the courthouse, too!? GUILTY! Edgeworth: Your Honor. Please calm down. While it's true that the detective is the one who made the mess on the bench... ...we have not yet established that this action is related to the double murder. Judge: What do you mean? Edgeworth: I believe that the Detective bought a pack of Swiss rolls from the vending machine... ...and then, promptly sat down on the bench to eat one. The cake crumbs and pieces of chocolate on the floor under the bench... ...and Detective Gumshoe's fingerprints prove my conclusions to be true. Judge: Oh... But I still don't understand. Is this whole thing related to how I couldn't see him as I was leaving the restroom? Edgeworth: Heh... It is indeed! The window in the hallway was built rather high up into the wall... ..at around a grown adult's chest height. As evidence, I submit that Franziska herself was unable to see out of that window. Franziska: ......... Edgeworth: Nnghooooh! (I knew I shouldn't have used her height as evidence!) ...B-Basically, what this means is that the area directly under the hallway window... ...is a blind spot when the hallway is being viewed from the men's restroom! Judge: Th-Then!? Edgeworth: Hmph... It seems that you have made the connection. If someone were to sit on the bench under the window... Yes, even someone as large as Detective Gumshoe... ...would effectively disappear from sight! Judge: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: Hmph. Do you finally see, Your Honor? Your testimony has just proven that Detective Gumshoe was in the hallway the entire time. Judge: Judge: ...Ah! Sorry! I didn't mean to say it with that much enthusiasm. All I wanted to do was try saying it once. Here, let me try that again... \"Hold it!\" Edgeworth: ...Is there something of value that you'd like to say? Judge: Yes, actually, there is! I remembered something else just now! Mr. Edgeworth! Please allow me to testify to the court one more time! Franziska: Even if we overruled him, he'd just keep on talking, wouldn't he? Edgeworth: That might not be a bad thing. The more info the better in a perfect investigation, right? Testimony -- What I Saw, Pt. 2 -- Judge: I suppose it's possible you can't see a seated person from the restroom window. However, that doesn't mean that the Detective was sitting there when I looked! Anyway! I forgot to testify earlier about probably the most important detail... As I was leaving the restroom, I heard the loud \"BANG!\" of a gunshot! Edgeworth: Gnnnnrrrrrk... Judge: How was that!? That is the testimony of one who judges the crimes of others! Edgeworth: Your Honor... Could you try to state the important facts first next time!? Franziska: I agree! Before you go around judging others, you should learn to judge your own words! Judge: Eeeek! ...I-I'm sorry! But honestly, I thought that sound was just a noise popper until just now! Edgeworth: (Now that he mentions it, right before we re-started the trial, he did talk about that...) Judge: Oh, by the way, was there someone celebrating a birthday during the recess? I could have sworn that I heard a popper going off... Come to think of it... The other day with my grandson... Edgeworth: (The most critical point in this argument is when did the Judge look into the hallway? And whether that lines up with when the gun was actually fired.) Your Honor, if I may... I'd like to clarify a few details in your testimony! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In that case, do you concede that you were overconfident in your last testimony? Judge: N-Now hold on there! I just said that it's possible you can't see a seated person from the restroom this time! But you know something? I don't think you know when the prints you referenced were left on that bench, do you!? Edgeworth: Nngh! Judge: While you have proven that it's possible the Detective was sitting... ...I still have a problem with just when those fingerprints were left. Edgeworth: (He's right. I have yet to prove when the fingerprints were left on that bench... While he feigns ignorance. His Honor has seen a lot of life... This Judge... I mustn't underestimate him!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: As we established, you went to the restroom during the recess. However, at what point in the recess did you look into that hallway? Judge: Hmm... After I called for a recess, I handled the change of prosecutor paperwork... Maybe about 20 minutes until we reconvened...? Yes, that sounds about right. Edgeworth: Hmph... Just as I expected. Judge: Wh-What were you expecting? And I demand to know what that all-knowing smile is for! Edgeworth: Your Honor... That statement you made just now is very important. I'd like for you to append it to your testimony. Judge: A-Alright. If you insist. Adds statement \"Let's see... I looked into that hallway about 20 minutes before we were to reconvene.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmm... Twenty minutes before we reconvened... Very well, what did you do after that? Judge: Let's see... I had to make some preparations, so I rushed straight back to the courtroom. I also had to track down a few pieces of paperwork for the various bailiffs. Edgeworth: So you rushed back to the courtroom, despite having just heard a gunshot? Judge: Well, at the time... I thought it was just the sound of a noise popper. I really couldn't think of any other explanation than someone having a birthday party. But now... Now that this has happened... Edgeworth: I see... (Thinking back, the Judge did mention something to that effect when we reconvened...) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If it's something that forgettable, I don't need to hear it! Judge: Eek! B-But! All I did was forget to mention it! Franziska: That sort of excuse may work on other people, but not on a Von Karma! Judge: Oh! But it's such an important piece of testimony! Please give me a chance to present it! Edgeworth: Hmm... I suppose I have no choice in the matter. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, about what you just said... Judge: I know! I couldn't believe it myself! But I heard it! \"BANG!\" went the gunshot! I heard it loud and clear! And then I had a knee-jerk reaction, \"Aah!\" and jumped into the air! Like this! Yes, just like this! With a quick, \"Aah!\" Edgeworth: ......Your Honor. Please remain calm when you're trying to explain yourself to me. Judge: Yes, sir! Sorry about that. Now then, I must gather myself, yes... When I heard the gunshot, there was no one in the hall! I should know! I looked! There was no one theeeeeeere! Edgeworth: (This judge's emotion circuits appear to be stuck on \"overreact\".) Franziska: At this point, nothing stands out to me as a contradiction in his testimony... Edgeworth: Hmph... Franziska. If I'm correct, this testimony is hardly precision quality. Franziska: ...I know that. And that's why I said, \"At this point.\" Edgeworth: Hmm... I think my first line of attack will be to draw more information from His Honor. Edgeworth: I believe... that we've finally found the flaw in His Honor's testimony. Franziska: Yet sadly, he's completely oblivious to it. But I guess I can't really expect him to be aware of it. Well!? What are you waiting for!? Hurry up and fill him in! ...At least that thing finally came in handy. Edgeworth: Indeed. Now let's see what happens... ...when I present it to His Honor!\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Manfred von Karma\nDescription: My mentor who has never known defeat in 35 years.

The piece of cloth that she conjured up has taken me back to many years ago... Defendant: Yeah, that's right. I did it. I killed the guy. But it was the Great Thief Yatagarasu that told me to do it! ???: Lawyer: I ask the defendant... Just what exactly are you trying to say? Defendant: Don't you get it? I know the true identity of the Yatagarasu! ...The Yatagarasu is the man standing over there at the prosecutor's bench! Prosecutor: Are you saying... that I'm the Yatagarasu? Defendant: Don't you dare deny it! You told me to kill him when you snuck into the embassy! Lawyer: Are you claiming that Mr. Faraday is the Yatagarasu? Defendant: That's exactly what I'm saying! Prosecutor: Prosecutor: Mr. Rell! I think we've heard just about enough out of you...! Defendant: Your Honor! Please listen to me! I'm telling the truth... You've gotta believe meeeeeee! Judge: Hmph... In accordance with the defendant's accusation... ...a new prosecutor shall be called to replace Mr. Faraday. This court will be in recess until the new prosecutor is ready. Edgeworth: (...It's almost time for me to enter the courtroom. And, so it is that my first assignment as a prosecutor will be... ...as a replacement for a prosecutor who has been accused by the defendant.) ???: Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ! ...Sir. ???: Have you read over all of the documents regarding this trial? Edgeworth: Yes, sir. I've memorized everything there is to know. ???: Very good. The paperwork for the prosecutor substitution is just about complete. Edgeworth... always bear in mind that as your mentor, I, Manfred von Karma... ...will accept nothing short of perfection. Edgeworth: I understand, sir. To have the chance to stand in court at such an early stage in my career... ...I am honored and proud. Manfred: As I have watched over your studies, I am giving you this very rare chance. Prove yourself. Crush the defendant's pathetic lies into oblivion. Edgeworth: .........Yes, sir! (That such a legendary prosecutor will be watching (changed from [is watching over] in the original release) and judging my performance... ...I have to be perfect in every way!) Edgeworth: If it is true that the Yatagarasu showed up at the Cohdopian Embassy... ...what could he or she have been after? Manfred: Hmph... No doubt to steal any suspicious accounting records and release them publicly. Or, more likely, to steal secrets from the Cohdopian Embassy itself... ...since the item that the Yatagarasu stole from there was sent to the police. Edgeworth: What was it that the Yatagarasu sent to the police? Manfred: ...I don't know the details. Anything related to the Yatagarasu is getting the top-secret treatment. Still, I find it very ironic. By returning the stolen item to the police, it was proof positive that the Yatagarasu... ...had infiltrated the embassy on the same day the staff member was killed. Criminals have a way of incriminating themselves, wouldn't you say? Edgeworth: That would have to be the first time the Yatagarasu has left evidence behind, correct? Manfred: Yes, indeed. If you wish to learn more about the Yatagarasu, then I suggest you ask Faraday. Edgeworth: Mr. Faraday...? Manfred: He happens to be the prosecutor in charge of the Yatagarasu case, as well. Edgeworth: (He's the prosecutor in charge of both the KG-8 Incident and the Yatagarasu case? Mr. Faraday really has a lot on his plate...) Manfred: ...What is it, little girl? ???: ......... ...You're scary, mister. Manfred: ! Edgeworth: Did you need something? ???: Umm... I want to trade these coins with you! Edgeworth: A fistful of dimes, quarters, and pennies... but it looks like you've exactly a dollar. Is this what you want? ???: Thanks! That's exactly what I needed! Edgeworth: Could that child be here to watch the trial? Manfred: How disrespectful for a child like that to be running around inside the courthouse! Does no one have respect for this country's judicial system anymore!? Bailiff: The paperwork for the prosecutor substitution is complete! Manfred: Why you! Do you even know how much time there is left before the trial resumes!? Bailiff: I... I-I'm so sorry! Manfred: I can have you mopping up this courthouse instead of protecting it in an instant! Bailiff: ! *gulp* Edgeworth: It's no bother, sir. Not being completely prepared could prove to be a perfect handicap for me. Manfred: Hmph. A proud one you are. You had better collect the evidence from Faraday and prepare yourself. It's time for your debut, Edgeworth! Manfred: .................. Edgeworth: .................. Manfred: Just what is going on!? Why isn't Faraday here yet!? How is it possible that the defense is not prepared yet, either!? Edgeworth: Bailiff... Where is Mr. Faraday? Bailiff: I-I'm not sure... I wasn't really paying attention... Judge: Ah, you must be the one Mr. von Karma recommended... I hear this will be your first trial. I look forward to seeing how you perform. Oh, by the way, was there someone celebrating a birthday during the recess? I could have sworn that I heard a popper going off... Come to think of it... The other day with my grandson... Edgeworth: Sir, it looks like the trial is about to resume, however... Manfred: ...Yes, it will be all but impossible to prove the witness a liar... ...without the evidence from Faraday! What is that blasted buffoon up to!? ???: I-I-It's an emergency, siiiiiirs! Judge: S-Silence! Manfred: There shall be no yelling in this sacred hall of law! Bailiff! Remove that man from this courtroom at once! ???: P-Please... wait! You have to listen to me! There's an emergency! Defendant Lobby No. 2...! M-Mr. Faraday and the defendant... Th-The two of them... They're... They're both dead, Your Honor! Judge: Wh--!? Manfred: Wh--!? Edgeworth: Wh--!? Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? ???: Stay back! Edgeworth: Ungh...! ???: ...No one's allowed on the crime scene... Period. Edgeworth: (Just who does this... oddball think he is...?) ???: This is becoming quite the hotspot... Edgeworth: (Isn't she Mr. Rell's defense attorney...?) ???: H-Hey, you! No running in the hallway, pal! Edgeworth: And who are you to tell me what to do? (I'll never find out what's going on like this. It's time for some civil discourse.) After clearing all Talk options with Tyrell Badd, Calisto Yew, and Dick Gumshoe: Bailiff: Ms. Yew! There is someone here who wishes to see you... Yew: ......Who is it? Bailiff: A Cohdopian Embassy staff member by the name of Manny Coachen. Yew: Wh--! Badd: .........! Edgeworth: (What's going on? Detective Badd and Ms. Yew's moods just changed all of a sudden. Wait a second... Wasn't Manny Coachen...!?) Yew: I'll be right there. Coachen: It's nice to see you again... Ms. Yew. Yew: Why are you here? I have no desire to ever see you again. Coachen: Now, now... Actually, would you mind stepping outside for a brief chat? Yew: ........Fine. Let's go. Manfred: ...Badd. Badd: Von Karma...? It's been a long time. Manfred: I knew you would show up. You usually do when the Yatagarasu is involved, and I see this case is no exception. Edgeworth: Do you know Detective Badd, sir? Manfred: Yes. He's like an old bloodhound that never leaves the scene of a crime. If only he would get a promotion and move on. Badd: It's the crime scene where a detective is most useful and effective. Manfred: Hmph! It's not like I don't know that. Moving on though, Badd. The man that I just passed by... ...was he not the suspect from the KG-8 Incident!? Edgeworth: (So I was right...!) Manfred: Just what is that man doing, wandering around here!? That Faraday... I can't believe he let such an easy catch get away! Imbecile! I would've proved his guilt in three minutes! Badd: Von Karma! ...I think you've said enough for now. It's in poor taste to speak like that about the departed. Manfred: Hmph... Very well. Back on topic... I'm placing Edgeworth in charge of the investigation here... ???: ???: Papa! How can you place him in charge!? Edgeworth: Franziska... What are you doing here? Franziska: I'm here for summer vacation, what else? Edgeworth: (Franziska von Karma... So she is here on vacation from Germany... She is the daughter of Manfred von Karma and a student of his, who's also junior to me.) Franziska: You're the one who's junior to me! And don't you forget it! Edgeworth: You're not conveniently avoiding the Bar Examination, are you? Franziska: Hah... If you were able to pass, then I'll have absolutely no trouble at all. I'll never allow myself to lose to you! Never! Edgeworth: (Why does she always have to be this competitive...?) Franziska: Anyway... Papa... Are you really assigning Miles Edgeworth to cover the case? Manfred: Yes, I am. Why do you ask? Franziska: Well, you know... I'm close to becoming a prosecutor myself... And I am 100% confident that I can do a better job than him! Edgeworth: (That's just like Franziska. She has no problem bad-mouthing someone right in front of them.) Manfred: ...Badd. Badd: Yeah...? Manfred: These two will be conducting the investigation. Badd: What? You want me to let both of these kids loose on the crime scene? Manfred: Hah. This is a perfect opportunity for them to work on their prosecutorial skills. Badd: A crime scene is not a place for children to be messing around in! Manfred: I'm the one with the authority over this crime scene, Badd. ...And I will not tolerate complaining. Badd: ...Knngh...! Manfred: Edgeworth! Franziska! I leave this case to the two of you. Edgeworth: Understood, sir. Franziska: Yes, Papa. Manfred: I'll go take care of the paperwork now. Remember, I'll accept nothing but a perfect report from the both of you. Do not disappoint me. Badd: Hold up, Von Karma.........! I still... haven't agreed to this! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth...! Edgeworth: It's been quite some time, Franziska. Franziska: This will be the perfect chance for us... ...to see which of us is truly worthy of the Von Karma name. Edgeworth: Would it kill you to at least say hello? Franziska: Unngh... Umm... Long time no see. Edgeworth: Very good. Franziska: Just because you became a prosecutor first doesn't mean you can act all proud! Edgeworth: (S-She hasn't changed a bit...) Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! As I was saying, we shall see which one of us is worthy of the Von Karma name... Badd: For cryin' out loud... I've been reduced to a babysitter... Edgeworth: (It looks like Mr. von Karma was successful in convincing the detective. That's just like him; he never fails.) Now, I'd appreciate it if you could quickly run me through the facts, Detective Badd. Badd: You're better off checking things out on your own. Edgeworth: ...Very well. (Seems like getting help from Detective Badd will be a most arduous task...) Edgeworth: (Nngh... Is the only real explanation that they killed each other simultaneously...?) Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! You should listen to someone until they are finished talking! Edgeworth: Umm... What are you talking about? Franziska: I'll only say it one more time... This is a competition to see who is truly worthy of the Von Karma name! Edgeworth: A competition...? Franziska: The person that figures out the truth first wins. Edgeworth: Hmph... So the person who doesn't discover the truth is a dishonor to the name? Franziska: Exactly! I don't care that you became a prosecutor before me... ...I simply refuse to hear any more foolish things come from your foolishly, foolish mouth. Edgeworth: Hmph... Fine, whatever makes you happy. Franziska: Can I take that as you accepting my challenge? Edgeworth: Once again... Whatever makes you happy. Franziska: Hah... Well then, let's begin the investigation, shall we? I'm going to find the perfect evidence and prettily present it like the professional I am. Edgeworth: (Competing to discover the truth behind a crime -- how delightfully... childish.) Badd: You kids, over there! Hold it! Edgeworth: \"Kid\"!? Franziska: Ha! Serves you right, Miles. He just called you a kid...! Badd: ...I said \"kids\", kid. Franziska: H-How dare you call me a kid as well!? Badd: I'll do what I please. And I won't allow you to cause a ruckus on my crime scene. Hey, big guy. You're... going to watch over these two. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Detective Badd, sir! Now, do what I say from now on kids, OK!? Franziska: You'd better not get in our way, Scruffy! You'll feel the bite of my whip if you do! Gumshoe: E-Eeek! Th-Then you, p-prosecutor boy! Let's get your investigation started already, alright!? Edgeworth: (Great. Now, even THAT detective is treating me like a child...) Gumshoe: Alright! It's time to get investigating! Get a move on, prosecutor boy! Edgeworth: ...My name is Miles Edgeworth. And if you were [sic] to call me \"prosecutor boy\" one more time... ...it will be my duty as a prosecutor to \"look into\" your monthly salary. Gumshoe: Wh-What!? And what would you do with my salary after you saw how much it was!? Edgeworth: That's up to you now, isn't it? Gumshoe: Really!? Sounds good, pal! Edgeworth: (He's so na\u00efve...) Edgeworth: Detective Badd, may I have a word with you? Badd: ...What is it? Edgeworth: It appears that both a knife and a gun were used as murder weapons. Badd: ...Yeah, it does. Edgeworth: That leads us to our first question of the investigation. Where did the men acquire the weapons? Badd: ...The gun was inside of Faraday's bag. It was a piece of evidence that was presented in the trial earlier today. It was used... to kill the Cohdopian Embassy staff member. But... I never heard anything about the knife. Mr. Rell was being held by the police. There's no way he could have brought it in. Which means it's possible that Faraday had the knife on him from the start as well. Edgeworth: (Could it have been a piece of evidence that had yet to be presented...? But then, why doesn't Detective Badd know about it? Wait! What if...!?) It's possible that Mr. Faraday brought the knife in under the guise of prosecutorial evidence. He could have then brought it out and attacked Mr. Rell with it. Badd: Huh... Maybe you've got a brain in there after all, kid. Edgeworth: Nngh...! (Is he going to treat me like a child forever!?) Badd: ...It looks like Mr. Faraday attacked Mr. Rell first, who then counterattacked... That's the only logical conclusion you can draw from a scene like this. Edgeworth: (Hmm... Not yet. I feel that it's much too early to be drawing conclusions already. I must first find conclusive evidence, so as to protect (changed from [ensure] in the original release) the honor of the Von Karma name.) After examining gun, Byrne Faraday's left hand, and knife: Edgeworth: Mr. Rell's cause of death was from being shot, correct? Gumshoe: That's what we think, but it's hard to tell with him lying face down. Edgeworth: Death is bad enough, but it's truly lamentable that someone would try to hide the truth. Gumshoe: ...Um, are you sure they were trying to hide something? Edgeworth: (I can't confirm Mr. Rell's cause of death with his body positioned like that.) Detective Badd, I'd like to examine the bodies in further detail, if possible... Franziska: What's this? You're not able to form a theory with them the way they are? Edgeworth: I believe an examination of the bodies is vital to finding the perfect evidence, don't you? Franziska: Hmm... I suppose you do have a point. Well!? Hurry up and get on with it! Badd: ...Labbie. Forensics: Yes, sir! We've taken enough photos of the scene, sir. Badd: ...And there you have it. Edgeworth: .................. Badd: .................. Edgeworth: D-Do you not approve? Badd: ...Of course not. Edgeworth: What!? Badd: Investigation of a crime scene is the work of a detective. So don't touch a thing. Hey, big fella, turn over the bodies for me, will you? Gumshoe: O-OK......... Please forgive me, Mr. Faraday, sir...! Badd: Gumshoe... do not get emotionally involved. Remember, you're a detective! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Understood, sir! Leads to examination of bodies After connecting all possible Logic and examining both wounds, open window, and TV: Gumshoe: I guess there's not much left to investigate, huh? They really did kill each other... Edgeworth: No... We can't conclude that quite yet. There's still something I find very peculiar here. The theory that they simply killed one another is too simplistic in this case. In fact, there is actually a contradiction that shows there is another possibility! Gumshoe: No way, pal! Really!? Edgeworth: Hmph... I suppose I will just have to show you the contradiction (changed from [conflict] in the original release) in this crime scene. Leads to examination of bodies Edgeworth: Now we come face to face with the contradiction I spoke of, and it is... this! Mr. Faraday used his left hand to write with his fountain pen. Ergo, he is left-handed. And yet, the handgun is in his right hand! Don't you find it odd that the left-handed Mr. Faraday would hold the gun in his right hand? That. lady and gentlemen... is the great contradiction haunting this crime scene! Gumshoe: Hey, you're right, pal! That does seem kinda strange! But... How could something like that happen? Edgeworth: The facts add up to one conclusion, and one alone. Someone else put the gun in Mr. Faraday's hand after he died. Gumshoe: Someone else...!? Edgeworth: Plastic bags scattered on the floor, and a gun in the wrong hand... I sense the presence of a shadowy figure behind this case. A person of vile intent who is serious about keeping the truth from us! Badd: Here's the autopsy report. Franziska: \"It is probable for that Mr. Rell survived for a short time after he was shot. However, Mr. Faraday died instantaneously from his stabbing.\" Interesting... Crime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer. Franziska: It looks like we now know everything we need to know about this case. Edgeworth: Are you sure we know everything...? Franziska: Of course! The incident began with Mr. Faraday attempting to get his revenge. The prosecutor went into a rage from being accused, and tried to kill the defendant... But, the defendant fought back and they ended up killing each other. It's all very clear and simple. There is absolutely no margin for doubt. Edgeworth: Do you really believe that to be the truth? Franziska: Hah! Are you saying that just because I figured out the truth before you... ...that you don't want to believe it's true? Edgeworth: N-Nngh... Franziska: It's alright. If you disagree with my argument, then prove me wrong. Well, if there are any contradictions to be found, that is... Edgeworth: Don't worry, I will. Franziska: Mr. Faraday's death was instantaneous, while Mr. Rell survived for a short time. From this, it is obvious that Mr. Faraday died after he shot Mr. Rell. And Mr. Rell, while on the brink of death, stole Mr. Faraday's knife and stabbed him. Those are the facts of this case. Edgeworth: (Mr. Faraday's death was instantaneous, therefore, he must've attacked first... Proving that logic to be false is probably the fastest way to show her that she's wrong. In that case, I should first look for any holes in her theory!) Franziska: Mr. Faraday's death was instantaneous, while Mr. Rell survived for a short time. Franziska: From this, it is obvious that Mr. Faraday died after he shot Mr. Rell. Franziska: And Mr. Rell, while on the brink of death, stole Mr. Faraday's knife and stabbed him. Franziska: They struggled, and Mr. Rell used the last of his strength to counterattack Mr. Faraday. Franziska: Those are the facts of this case. Edgeworth: (There's something strange about Franziska's theory... I should compare her claim with the data I've gathered thus far. I just know there's a contradiction somewhere!) Edgeworth: If the two men were fighting, their struggle would've surely caused quite a bit of noise. However, Detective Gumshoe testified that he heard absolutely nothing! Franziska: Hah. You place too much faith in that detective's testimony, you know. But for the sake of argument, let's say there wasn't a fight. How, then, did Mr. Rell get his hands on the knife? Edgeworth: Mr. Faraday's bag was sitting right here in Lobby No. 2. It is not hard to imagine that perhaps Mr. Rell saw a chance and took it out at some point! Franziska: .................. So... What you're saying this: Mr. Rell took a chance when he saw the opportunity, and took the knife from the bag. And then Mr. Faraday shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed...? Edgeworth: Hmm......... (Isn't there something... strange in Franziska's statement just now?) Edgeworth: It's simply not possible for Mr. Faraday to have shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed! Edgeworth: According to the coroner's report, Mr. Faraday died instantaneously, meaning... ..that he died immediately upon being stabbed by the knife! Ergo, he could not possibly have fired the gun after that! Franziska: ...Ooh, you got me. Edgeworth: But of course. Franziska: Well then, if the report is correct, then there is only one correct explanation. If we suppose that Mr. Rell attacked first... ...then Mr. Faraday, who died instantaneously, would have been unable to kill Mr. Rell. Therefore, Mr. Rell must have stabbed Mr. Faraday after he was shot. Then they both died. That is the only explanation that makes logical sense! Edgeworth: Negating your opponent's ideas in order to prove your own theory... I see you've been studying, Franziska. Franziska: I just wanted to explain it to you as simply as possible. Before you foolishly propose a foolish theory that only a foolish fool like you could. Edgeworth: Hmph... How na\u00efve of you to believe that only your opinions are valid... ...and still expect to discover the truth that the crime scene offers you... Franziska... You've still got a ways to go. Franziska: What are you talking about!? Are you saying there's a flaw in my logic!? Edgeworth: (Mr. Faraday died instantly... And the fact that he did is what gives rise to the contradiction in this scene!) The contradiction here in this crime scene is...! Edgeworth: Let me get this straight. What you are arguing is this: Mr. Faraday took the gun from his evidence bag and shot Mr. Rell. Then, the wounded Mr. Rell found an opportunity to take the knife and strike back. Upon being stabbed, Mr. Faraday died on the spot, and Mr. Rell died thereafter. If that's the case, then how do you explain this? Take a good look at the order in which their bodies are piled. Franziska: ............N-No...! Edgeworth: Mr. Faraday's body is lying on top of Mr. Rell's. Therefore... ...Mr. Rell must have died before Mr. Faraday! Franziska: I-Impossible! Edgeworth: (Yes, I agree that it seems strange no matter what angle you approach it from... ...which means that the real mystery behind this crime scene that we must solve is--!) Franziska: Franziska: No...! Not so fast, Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What now...? Franziska: I simply think that you ought to think a bit more outside the box... And that it's even clearer now that the incident started with Mr. Faraday's murderous intent! Edgeworth: (She sure bounced back quickly. An explanation won't be enough this time. It's going to take some very decisive evidence to prove her wrong!) Franziska: It was just chance that Mr. Faraday's body fell on top of Mr. Rell's. The two bodies fell into a pile... ...which indicates that they attacked each other at the same time. It really doesn't matter in the slightest that they fell in the opposite order. Edgeworth: (I just know that Franziska's explanation isn't absolutely correct. All I have to do is find a hole in her logic! Once I do, I can then present her with the evidence that proves the contradiction!) Franziska: It was just chance that Mr. Faraday's body fell on top of Mr. Rell's. Franziska: The two bodies fell into a pile... Franziska: ...which indicates that they attacked each other at the same time. Franziska: That fact indicates that they attacked each other at the same time from close range. Franziska: It really doesn't matter in the slightest that they fell in the opposite order. Edgeworth: (The fact that the order that they attacked each other in... ...varies from the order they fell in doesn't cause a problem for me. However, there's definitely one certain aspect that I'm having trouble swallowing!) Edgeworth: So you believe they killed each other at close range...? Sorry, but that's impossible. Just as it is written in the crime scene notes... ...the firing of the handgun did not leave a gunpowder burn on Mr. Rell's clothes. Therefore... Mr. Rell and the gun... ...must have been separated by a distance of at least two or three yards! Franziska: Aaaaah! Edgeworth: (Yes... This is by far the biggest contradiction! The two bodies are piled up on each other, yet the gun was fired from a distance. And with there being no chance that Mr. Rell moved that far after being shot... ...that leaves only one possible explanation!) Franziska: Wh-What a completely foolish line of foolish thought from a thoroughly foolish fool! If I'm not right... ...then who was it that made the first move with the intent to kill, huh!? Who!? Edgeworth: The person that attacked first with murderous intent? That would be... Edgeworth: Here in this room... ...contradictions appear no matter which man we claim attacked first. Thus, there can be only one explanation. There was... a third person here! Franziska: ...! Edgeworth: It was that third person who killed both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell... ...and set their bodies up to make it look like a double murder... That third person is the real culprit! Franziska: ............ Miles Edgeworth... There's just one thing you're missing. Edgeworth: ...Evidence, correct? Franziska: Exactly. Everything you've said up until now is nothing but a story played out in your head. However, this is where the real test begins. Can you prove that there was a third person involved in this crime!? Edgeworth: ...Of course. (If a third person was [sic] truly here, that fact would resolve the glaring contradiction. The proof that this has all been a set-up, made to look like they killed each other... I'll present it, and lay bare the final piece of the puzzle that's not yet in place! What is the piece of evidence that proves there is a third person involved...?) Edgeworth: The gun in Mr. Faraday's hand and the plastic bag with his blood on it... These two items point to the presence of a third person. Franziska: How so...? Edgeworth: Recall Detective Gumshoe's testimony. Gumshoe: I was in the hallway the whole time, but I didn't hear a single peep of a struggle. Edgeworth: If there wasn't a struggle in this room... ...then there shouldn't be any plastic bags on the ground. Meaning that someone else must've deliberately scattered them around! Franziska: ...! Edgeworth: Do you not see the possibility in this? Disregarding the gun for the moment... ...there's a high probability of blood splatter when a knife is used on a person. If the culprit held the knife with a plastic bag around it... ...they could use the bag to catch any blood splatter from when they withdrew the knife. Then, by spreading a few more plastic bags around, mixing the bloody one in with them... ...and arranging the room to make it look like there was a struggle between the two... ...they were able to conceal their presence! Franziska: Aaaaaaaaah! Badd: Looks like... we've still got a long way to go in this investigation... Edgeworth: Yes. ???: Gumshoe: Wh-What the heck's up with you, pal!? Yew: Mr. Badd, I advise you to place Detective Gumshoe under arrest. Gumshoe: Wh...WHAAAAAAAAAAAT!? Badd: ......What's the meaning of this? Yew: Hah! Looks like you're not man enough to discipline your own subordinates. Badd: ...Don't you dare...! Yew: That detective claims he was there, standing in front of the door the entire time... ...but I have it on good authority that it was all a giant lie! Badd: ......! Edgeworth: ...Ms. Yew! I ask that you please explain that last statement! Yew: I'll let His Honor explain it himself. Judge: I-I saw it with my own eyes, I tell you! During the recess, there was a period of time when there was no one in the hallway! Gumshoe: Whaaaaaaaaaaat!? Yew: See, Mr. Badd? So I ask you, why would a detective who was supposedly doing his job the whole time... ...want to fabricate such a lie? Badd: ...Gumshoe. Did you... Did you kill Faraday...!? Gumshoe: N-Noooooooooooooooooo! Of course not, sir! Franziska: It would appear that the one who set this whole crime scene up is that detective. ...Which basically renders his testimony a complete lie and wholly invalid. It looks like your \"perfect\" logic has just come tumbling down, Miles. Edgeworth: Nngh... Gumshoe: I was in the hallway the whole time, but I didn't hear a single peep of a struggle. Edgeworth: (Was that statement really a lie...?) Badd: ...Detective Gumshoe. You're now a suspect in the murder of two men. Now, spit out the truth, or so help me...! Gumshoe: I...I haven't lied to anyone, sir! Honest! I really was really there... I was in the hallway the whole time! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective Badd, I ask that you please do not act without my permission. After all, I am the one that is heading up this investigation, am I not? Badd: .........Don't talk like you know what's going on, boy... Edgeworth: All I want is for this investigation to run perfectly. Franziska: Perfection is the only wish of a disciple of Von Karma, after all. Edgeworth: Therefore, before you take Detective Gumshoe into custody... ...I'd like to set the record straight on something. Badd: ...And what's that...? Edgeworth: (Hmm, what should I ask Detective Gumshoe about...?) Edgeworth: I suppose the one thing I'd like (changed from [liked] in the original release, correcting the typo) clarified... ...is Detective Gumshoe's motive for committing this crime. Badd: Hmph... Motive, huh. Gumshoe... You got a grudge against Faraday or anything...? Gumshoe: N-No, sir! Not me! Not a single bad thing against Mr. Faraday, sir! Badd: ...Is that a fact...? Yew: Yew: ...You really have a problem with lying, don't you, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I'm telling you... I AM NOT LYING! Franziska: The more unnatural you act, the more suspicious you become, you know. Yew: If you want a motive, Edgeworth, I have one for you right here. Edgeworth: Could you please share it with us? However, be forewarned that I won't hesitate to object to flights of fancy... ...because all I'm interested in is the perfect explanation. Yew: Phwwh! Ahahahahahaha! You're serious, aren't you? ...Fine. You amuse me, so I'll humor you with a little courtroom practice. Yew: It was... about a week ago. I saw the detective get chewed out by a livid Faraday in front of the precinct. He stood there super pale, as Mr. Faraday yelled, \"That's a salary cut for you, you nitwit!\" A brand new detective suddenly getting his salary cut -- that's reason enough for a grudge. Well? How's that for the \"perfect explanation\"? Gumshoe: Y-You totally misunderstand me, pal! No matter how mad I get, I could never hold a grudge! Badd: .........Quiet. We can't trust anything you say...! Gumshoe: Sir... Edgeworth: (Hmm... There's nothing wrong with the motive she proposed, per se... ...but there are some gaps in her logic that need to be filled in. Ms. Yew's \"perfect explanation\"... ...may not be so \"perfect\" at all...!) Yew: It was... about a week ago. Yew: I saw the detective get chewed out by a livid Faraday in front of the precinct. Yew: He stood there super pale, as Mr. Faraday yelled, \"That's a salary cut for you, you nitwit!\" Yew: A brand new detective suddenly getting his salary cut -- that's reason enough for a grudge. Yew: Well? How's that for the \"perfect explanation\"? Edgeworth: (Detective Gumshoe certainly had a motive to kill Mr. Faraday. However, there is just one thing I can't wrap my head around in this explanation. I'll just have to force Ms. Yew to explain herself fully!) Edgeworth: Alright, if you could clear this one thing up for me...! Edgeworth: I understand Detective Gumshoe's potential motive for killing Mr. Faraday... ...however, what about his motive for killing Mr. Rell? Yew: His motive for killing Rell? Like I would know. Edgeworth: Hmph... If there was [sic] no clear motive for both of the murders... ...then I doubt this incident would've occurred. Wouldn't you agree? Yew: .................. Edgeworth: Is there anyone else who might have had a grudge against either of the two men? Or should we look into that ourselves? Yew: Oh... In that case... .........I have absolutely no idea. Edgeworth: .........! (What? But that's impossible! She must know SOMETHING!) Yew: Phwwh... Wait... Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Can you please not glare at me like that? ...It makes me laugh. Phwwwwwh! Edgeworth: (Grr...! I didn't even do anything, and you're already laughing away!) Yew: Well, anyway... the way I see it, as long as he had a motive to kill one of the two... ...this crime would've played out the way it did anyway. Edgeworth: ...Oh? Would you care to explain your logic? And this time, please try to provide a truly perfect explanation. Yew: Phwwwwh...! Perfect this, perfect that... Stop being so uptight, or is that a requisite trait for being a Von Karma? Ahahahaha! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! I demand that you shut this rude woman up! Edgeworth: (...I wish you'd BOTH be quiet for just one second...) Yew: Ahem... Oh well. I guess I'll just have to explain it to you kids. Yew: There's no one out there with a motive to kill both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell. All you really have to establish is that someone had a grudge against one of the two men. Mr. Rell, who happened to be there, became a witness to Mr. Faraday's murder. Therefore, he was killed out of necessity, and set up to look like they had killed each other. Edgeworth: (I wonder if that's really true... Is there no one out there with a grudge against both men? I should take another hard look at the evidence for this morning's case. The second KG-8 Incident, as people are calling it, involving an Embassy staff member... ...and the two men who both wound up as suspects in the case... Is there someone else I'm overlooking who is somehow related to them?) Yew: There's no one out there with a motive to kill both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell. Yew: All you really have to establish is that someone had a grudge against one of the two men. Yew: Mr. Rell, who happened to be there, became a witness to Mr. Faraday's murder. Yew: Therefore, he was killed out of necessity, and set up to look like they had killed each other. Edgeworth: (I have to admit, her explanation makes sense. However, there is also something she overlooked in her testimony. I should present that piece of evidence, and see if I can't make her see the truth!) Edgeworth: Ms. Yew. I believe there is someone you overlooked in making your statement. Or rather... is it because you'd rather not bring this person up...? Yew: .........What do you mean? Edgeworth: We are looking for someone with a reason to kill both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell... I can think of at least one person that fits the bill! He was the suspect in the original KG-8 Incident... ...and a member of the Cohdopian Embassy staff, Mr. Manny Coachen! Yew: ...! Edgeworth: That's right. The very man who came to visit you earlier out in the hallway. Yew: .................. Edgeworth: The man who killed a member of the Cohdopian Embassy staff, Mr. Rell... ...and the man who was the lead prosecutor of the KG-8 Incident, Mr. Faraday... Are you telling me that Mr. Coachen has no reason at all to kill both of these men? Yew: Well......... I suppose he might have a reason or two... Gumshoe: You! You covered for me, pal! ...Maybe you're not such a bad guy after all. Edgeworth: Don't get ahead of yourself. You're still a suspect, make no mistake about that! The perfect evidence, the perfect testimony... These are the only things I wish to hold. Gumshoe: B-But I didn't do it...! Edgeworth: Hmph... You will stay under my authority, and go investigate Mr. Manny Coachen for me. And remember, I will not be very forgiving should any of this leak out-- ???: Badd: You want to investigate Coachen...? You'd just be wasting your time... Edgeworth: And why is that? Badd: ...Coachen was up in the viewing gallery, watching the trial... or so I was told. Every cop in this place has been keeping an eye on the guy since he arrived... Franziska: Then the only real suspect we have is still Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: ...I suppose so. Gumshoe: No way... Come on, Detective Badd! You've gotta believe me, sir! I really was in that hallway the whole time, sir! I never took a single step into this room, sir! Badd: ...OK, then are you saying... there was someone else who passed through the hallway? Gumshoe: I-I... No... There was no one else, sir. Badd: .........Then why should I believe you didn't do it...!? Franziska: That is one incredibly foolish detective. Standing right in front of a crime scene all by himself... It's as good as a confession of guilt. Edgeworth: (I have to admit it's a bit strange. Most criminals will fabricate some sort of lie to escape their crimes. And if that detective really wanted to prove that he is innocent... ...you'd think he would at the very least offer up \"I spaced out while on duty\" or the like.) Badd: ...Come on, Gumshoe. Time for your interrogation... Gumshoe: .........Detective Badd... Franziska: Miles Edgeworth... I will go ahead and report this to Papa. Judge: And that, as they say is that! Right, everyone? Ho ho ho. Yew: Well, I suppose we should both be getting back to our real jobs now, huh? Edgeworth: Before we do, Ms. Yew, there is something I'd like to speak with you about. Yew: ...What is it? Edgeworth: Ms. Yew... I believe that I have proof of your connection to the KG-8 Incident. Yew: That file is your proof? Very well, then... Why don't you tell me exactly how I'm related to the KG-8 Incident? Edgeworth: Your connection to the KG-8 Incident... ...is through the victim! Yew: .........! Edgeworth: The victim's name is Cece Yew. You will note that she has the same last name as you. Can you really still tell me with a straight face that you are not related to this case? Yew: .........Phwwwwh. Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! ...Sorry, but we're not related. Edgeworth: Wh--!? Yew: .........Just kidding. You asked that question with such a serious look on your face... ...that I couldn't help but... Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Edgeworth: Mmmrrrrgh...! Ms. Yew, I ask that you please tell me the truth. Yew: ..................Ahem. Alright. I'll tell you everything I know. After clearing all Talk options with Calisto Yew: Yew: Well, this is about all I know. Haha... Sorry. Guess I wasn't much help, huh? Edgeworth: That's not true. I'm sorry I made you recall such a painful time in your life. Yew: Phwwh...... Ahahahahahahaha! Edgeworth, you really are too serious for your own good. You really need to learn to relax. We wouldn't want you to die of stress, would we? Edgeworth: ...Thank you for the advice, but there's no need to worry. I work in my own way, and I will catch this criminal in my own way as well. You'll see. Yew: Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Look at you with your game face on, ready to go! Edgeworth: I...! I'm making no such face! Yew: Did you know? Laughter is the best medicine, Edgeworth. Don't you get tired of making such a serious face all the time? Edgeworth: I'm charged with making sure that all the criminals of this world are found guilty. I... have no need for laughter. Yew: There you go, making that face again. Oh well. I've got to get going. I still have a few loose ends I need to tie up. Edgeworth: (.................. The KG-8 Incident and this murder investigation... It is my belief that these two cases are related to each other somehow. Plus, that detective... Detective Gumshoe...It's obvious he's lying, even though the lie is hurting his chances. ...Clearly, this case is far from over. But whether or not that detective is the murderer... ...can only be determined once I've completed my perfect investigation. Mr. von Karma... I swear to uphold your honorable name, or my name isn't Miles Edgeworth!) To be continued \nJudge: During the recess... I, um... I went to the restroom. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor... Why exactly did you pay a visit to the restroom, if I may ask? Judge: Oh! Well, isn't it obvious!? What else do you go to the restroom for!? Or, maybe... I-I-I-I-I knew it...! You suspect me of some sort of tomfoolery, don't you! Edgeworth: Please stay calm, Your Honor! (This is going to be much harder than I anticipated...) Judge: I-I'm sorry... You're right... I need to think things through with a level head. I'm just nervous because so much has happened today with this trial. Let's see... I announced a recess, and a time for us to reconvene... But having done all that, I still wasn't able to go the restroom right away. Edgeworth: And why couldn't you? Judge: Mr. Faraday had been accused, so I had paperwork to process regarding a new prosecutor. Once I had finished that, I was finally able to make a mad dash to the restroom. Edgeworth: (At least he stayed consistent on the \"going to the restroom\" part of his testimony...) Judge: There is a window on the hallway side. In other words, I could see into the hallway. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, did you really go to the men's restroom? Judge: Wh-Wh--!? What is the meaning of that statement!? Edgeworth: I simply meant... that perhaps you went to a restroom on a different floor. Judge: I had to go for such a long time... It was all I could do to dash to the closest one to the courtroom. Edgeworth: (Hmm... I suppose that's only natural, given his circumstances...) Judge: I ran from the courtroom, through this floor's main lobby and down the hallway. Once you enter, you can see there's a window just above the urinals. Edgeworth: And it was through that window that you witnessed Detective Gumshoe, Your Honor? Judge: Yes, exactlyyyyyyy! Edgeworth: Y-Your Honor! There is no need to yell! I can hear you just fine! Judge: Oh! I guess I put a little too much into that last answer. Now then, let's continue with the testimony. Judge: As I entered, I saw that detective buying something from the vending machines. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you sure that the person you witnessed was Detective Gumshoe, Your Honor? Judge: Yes, I'm absolutely sure. It's hard to miss someone of his stature, even from as far away as the restroom. Besides, I can't think of anyone else with that kind of hairstyle and big, beige coat. Edgeworth: Well, I was simply wondering if you were mistaken in what you saw... Judge: What!? Preposterous! My eyes are sharp as can be! Ready to see through lies to the truth! Although, recently, things do seem to be a bit fuzzier than they used to be... Edgeworth: (Clearly, his eyes are not the only things that have gone fuzzy!) Judge: But allow me to say with all the honor and dignity of a judge... ...I am not mistaken in what I saw! Judge: But when I was about to exit the restroom, he had completely disappeared! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: He disappeared? But Your Honor, didn't you just say... ...\"I saw that detective buying something from the vending machines\"? Judge: Why, yes! Yes, I did! The restroom window looks over the courtyard and right into the hallway. But! Just as I was about to exit, I took another look, and there was no one in sight! .................. That led me to the only solution to this mystery. That detective must've gone into the crime scene, Lobby No. 2 at that pooooooooooint! Edgeworth: (So he looked into the hallway from the restroom, and over the courtyard, did he...?) Present Det. Gumshoe's Fingerprints Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Wh-What was that finger wag for, Mr. Edgeworth!?\" Judge: A detective that goes missing while on duty... That sounds mighty suspicious to meeeee! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, I ask that you please remain calm. Judge: Nononononononononono! I-I-I-I'm cerfectly palm! Edgeworth: (You're being anything but \"perfectly calm\"!) Franziska: It appears that His Honor could not have been mistaken in what he saw. Edgeworth: Hmph, I suppose so, given his line of sight. However, Franziska, why do you suppose our lines of sight are so different? Franziska: ...If you're referring to my height... Edgeworth: C-Can't you hold that whip still for just a second!? Now, about His Honor's testimony... ...I believe his line of sight to be an important factor. Franziska: If it's that important, why don't you hurry up and tell him already? Edgeworth: (I will, but there is one more thing I need to do if I am to correct His Honor's testimony. I am going to need to retrace Detective Gumshoe's movements!) Judge: Wh-What was that finger wag for, Mr. Edgeworth!? And don't you know it's rude to shout \"Objection!\" while someone is giving testimony? Edgeworth: Hah. If you truly are a man of the law, then you must always be vigilant. For example, I (changed from [I, myself,] in the original release) never let an opportunity to shout \"Objection!\" pass me by! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth. It's one thing to be passionate about your job, but this is real life. Edgeworth: (This is what some people may say is the pot calling the kettle black...) Your Honor, I wonder if you might take a look at this for me? Judge: What is that filth!? How dare someone dirty the hallway bench like that!? Who is the culprit!? That party is hereby found GUILTY of uncleanliness!!! Edgeworth: If you must know, the uncouth bench sullier... ...has already been placed under arrest, thanks to your earlier testimony, Your Honor. Judge: Oh? ...Well that's good. But who was it? Edgeworth: We were able to discover something from the smudge on the bench. Namely, Detective Gumshoe's fingerprints. Judge: Not happy with committing just murder, he had to go and dirty the courthouse, too!? GUILTY! Edgeworth: Your Honor. Please calm down. While it's true that the detective is the one who made the mess on the bench... ...we have not yet established that this action is related to the double murder. Judge: What do you mean? Edgeworth: I believe that the Detective bought a pack of Swiss rolls from the vending machine... ...and then, promptly sat down on the bench to eat one. The cake crumbs and pieces of chocolate on the floor under the bench... ...and Detective Gumshoe's fingerprints prove my conclusions to be true. Judge: Oh... But I still don't understand. Is this whole thing related to how I couldn't see him as I was leaving the restroom? Edgeworth: Heh... It is indeed! The window in the hallway was built rather high up into the wall... ..at around a grown adult's chest height. As evidence, I submit that Franziska herself was unable to see out of that window. Franziska: ......... Edgeworth: Nnghooooh! (I knew I shouldn't have used her height as evidence!) ...B-Basically, what this means is that the area directly under the hallway window... ...is a blind spot when the hallway is being viewed from the men's restroom! Judge: Th-Then!? Edgeworth: Hmph... It seems that you have made the connection. If someone were to sit on the bench under the window... Yes, even someone as large as Detective Gumshoe... ...would effectively disappear from sight! Judge: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: Hmph. Do you finally see, Your Honor? Your testimony has just proven that Detective Gumshoe was in the hallway the entire time. Judge: Judge: ...Ah! Sorry! I didn't mean to say it with that much enthusiasm. All I wanted to do was try saying it once. Here, let me try that again... \"Hold it!\" Edgeworth: ...Is there something of value that you'd like to say? Judge: Yes, actually, there is! I remembered something else just now! Mr. Edgeworth! Please allow me to testify to the court one more time! Franziska: Even if we overruled him, he'd just keep on talking, wouldn't he? Edgeworth: That might not be a bad thing. The more info the better in a perfect investigation, right? Testimony -- What I Saw, Pt. 2 -- Judge: I suppose it's possible you can't see a seated person from the restroom window. However, that doesn't mean that the Detective was sitting there when I looked! Anyway! I forgot to testify earlier about probably the most important detail... As I was leaving the restroom, I heard the loud \"BANG!\" of a gunshot! Edgeworth: Gnnnnrrrrrk... Judge: How was that!? That is the testimony of one who judges the crimes of others! Edgeworth: Your Honor... Could you try to state the important facts first next time!? Franziska: I agree! Before you go around judging others, you should learn to judge your own words! Judge: Eeeek! ...I-I'm sorry! But honestly, I thought that sound was just a noise popper until just now! Edgeworth: (Now that he mentions it, right before we re-started the trial, he did talk about that...) Judge: Oh, by the way, was there someone celebrating a birthday during the recess? I could have sworn that I heard a popper going off... Come to think of it... The other day with my grandson... Edgeworth: (The most critical point in this argument is when did the Judge look into the hallway? And whether that lines up with when the gun was actually fired.) Your Honor, if I may... I'd like to clarify a few details in your testimony! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In that case, do you concede that you were overconfident in your last testimony? Judge: N-Now hold on there! I just said that it's possible you can't see a seated person from the restroom this time! But you know something? I don't think you know when the prints you referenced were left on that bench, do you!? Edgeworth: Nngh! Judge: While you have proven that it's possible the Detective was sitting... ...I still have a problem with just when those fingerprints were left. Edgeworth: (He's right. I have yet to prove when the fingerprints were left on that bench... While he feigns ignorance. His Honor has seen a lot of life... This Judge... I mustn't underestimate him!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: As we established, you went to the restroom during the recess. However, at what point in the recess did you look into that hallway? Judge: Hmm... After I called for a recess, I handled the change of prosecutor paperwork... Maybe about 20 minutes until we reconvened...? Yes, that sounds about right. Edgeworth: Hmph... Just as I expected. Judge: Wh-What were you expecting? And I demand to know what that all-knowing smile is for! Edgeworth: Your Honor... That statement you made just now is very important. I'd like for you to append it to your testimony. Judge: A-Alright. If you insist. Adds statement \"Let's see... I looked into that hallway about 20 minutes before we were to reconvene.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmm... Twenty minutes before we reconvened... Very well, what did you do after that? Judge: Let's see... I had to make some preparations, so I rushed straight back to the courtroom. I also had to track down a few pieces of paperwork for the various bailiffs. Edgeworth: So you rushed back to the courtroom, despite having just heard a gunshot? Judge: Well, at the time... I thought it was just the sound of a noise popper. I really couldn't think of any other explanation than someone having a birthday party. But now... Now that this has happened... Edgeworth: I see... (Thinking back, the Judge did mention something to that effect when we reconvened...) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If it's something that forgettable, I don't need to hear it! Judge: Eek! B-But! All I did was forget to mention it! Franziska: That sort of excuse may work on other people, but not on a Von Karma! Judge: Oh! But it's such an important piece of testimony! Please give me a chance to present it! Edgeworth: Hmm... I suppose I have no choice in the matter. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, about what you just said... Judge: I know! I couldn't believe it myself! But I heard it! \"BANG!\" went the gunshot! I heard it loud and clear! And then I had a knee-jerk reaction, \"Aah!\" and jumped into the air! Like this! Yes, just like this! With a quick, \"Aah!\" Edgeworth: ......Your Honor. Please remain calm when you're trying to explain yourself to me. Judge: Yes, sir! Sorry about that. Now then, I must gather myself, yes... When I heard the gunshot, there was no one in the hall! I should know! I looked! There was no one theeeeeeere! Edgeworth: (This judge's emotion circuits appear to be stuck on \"overreact\".) Franziska: At this point, nothing stands out to me as a contradiction in his testimony... Edgeworth: Hmph... Franziska. If I'm correct, this testimony is hardly precision quality. Franziska: ...I know that. And that's why I said, \"At this point.\" Edgeworth: Hmm... I think my first line of attack will be to draw more information from His Honor. Edgeworth: I believe... that we've finally found the flaw in His Honor's testimony. Franziska: Yet sadly, he's completely oblivious to it. But I guess I can't really expect him to be aware of it. Well!? What are you waiting for!? Hurry up and fill him in! ...At least that thing finally came in handy. Edgeworth: Indeed. Now let's see what happens... ...when I present it to His Honor!Judge: I suppose it's possible you can't see a seated person from the restroom window. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In that case, do you concede that you were overconfident in your last testimony? Judge: N-Now hold on there! I just said that it's possible you can't see a seated person from the restroom this time! But you know something? I don't think you know when the prints you referenced were left on that bench, do you!? Edgeworth: Nngh!

(Thinking back, the Judge did mention something to that effect when we reconvened...) Present Det. Badd's Testimony Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Your Hon--\" Judge: Anyway! I forgot to testify earlier about probably the most important detail... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If it's something that forgettable, I don't need to hear it! Judge: Eek! B-But! All I did was forget to mention it! Franziska: That sort of excuse may work on other people, but not on a Von Karma! Judge: Oh! But it's such an important piece of testimony!

Before pressing second statement Franziska: At this point, nothing stands out to me as a contradiction in his testimony... Edgeworth: Hmph... Franziska. If I'm correct, this testimony is hardly precision quality. Franziska: ...I know that. And that's why I said, \"At this point.\" Edgeworth: Hmm... I think my first line of attack will be to draw more information from His Honor. After pressing second statement Edgeworth: I believe... that we've finally found the flaw in His Honor's testimony.

Edgeworth: Your Hon-- Judge: I cannot allow you to make an objection. Edgeworth: What!? Your Honor... I'm really sorry, but... ...I cannot allow you to not allow me to make an objection! Judge: Egads! I've been overruled!? Edgeworth: Your Honor, there are simply too many holes in your testimony for my taste. Judge: Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you mean by that!? Edgeworth: You claim that you heard the gunshot during the recess, but that is simply not possible! Judge: ! Mr. New Prosecutor Recommended by Manfred von...ack...! Franziska: Instead of biting your tongue, why don't you bite your tongue on those preposterous names!? Judge: Eek! Edgeworth: I see you have no mercy for the elderly either, Franziska. Franziska: Hmph. Don't talk back to me, unless you want to be whipped in the back. Edgeworth: (With your height, you'd need a step-ladder or four to accomplish that.) Judge: Ahem! Mr. Edgeworth. My ears are not that far gone yet, I'll have you know! I can still hear just fine! And I heard the sound of a gunshot loud and clear with my own two ears! Edgeworth: Hah... Your Honor, I have here an interesting bit of testimony. It's from Detective Badd. And according to him, he heard the gunshot \"right before the trial was about to start again\". Judge: Wh-What did you just say!? Edgeworth: Your Honor, you just said... ...that you heard the gunshot \"about 20 minutes before we were to reconvene\". How do you explain this glaring contradiction!? Judge: Th-That can't beeeeeee! Edgeworth: Unfortunately... that is the truth. Judge: B-But! I heard it clear as day! \"BANG!\" The loud sound of a gunshot! Edgeworth: (The sound of the gunshot... We keep returning to this point of contention. And that piece of evidence... I always did wonder why I found it where I did. However, now I understand what that gunshot the Judge heard really was!) Unfortunately, Your Honor, this is what really produced the gunshot you heard! Present Balloon Piece Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I found this object in the hallway earlier.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Franziska: Miles Edgeworth... I have no idea what you are trying to say with that piece. Edgeworth: Franziska... You're just still too young to understand. Franziska: Stop trying to fool me, and start being mature enough to admit when you're wrong! Edgeworth: Gnnrrk! (Perhaps that was not the piece I needed to show...) Leads back to: \"Unfortunately, Your Honor, this is what really produced the gunshot you heard!\" Edgeworth: I found this object in the hallway earlier. Judge: Wh-What is that pink substance? Edgeworth: It may not look it, but this is actually a piece of a balloon. Judge: I see. And I suppose you would like me to accept that pink balloon into the court record? Edgeworth: Your Honor... I present this piece of evidence in order to overrule your testimony! Judge: Wh-What!? Edgeworth: Your Honor, your argument goes as follows: You saw no one in the hallway when you heard the gunshot. Now, there is no guarantee that the detective was sitting on the bench at that time... ...therefore, you believe he must have been at the crime scene, Defendant Lobby No. 2. ...Am I correct? Judge: Yes, that's exactly right. Edgeworth: Hmph... Let me ask you something. Do you think that the gunshot you heard was produced by a real gun? Judge: ! Edgeworth: I think I've said enough that even you can figure the rest out on your own. Your Honor. You were fooled by the popping of this balloon into thinking it was a gunshot! Judge: Wh-What manner of trickery is thiiiiiiiiiiiiis!? Franziska: That was a good effort you put forth, Miles Edgeworth. But if it was [sic] me, I'd have wrapped this thing up before the Judge even testified. Edgeworth: (Care to elaborate on how one ends something before it even begins...?) Judge: Hmm... Well, to be honest... I did think that the sound was a bit off from a real gunshot sound... But who could've guessed... that someone would pop a balloon in a place like this? Edgeworth: (That's true... One doesn't usually think \"balloons\" in conjunction with \"courthouse\".) ???: Umm... I want to trade these coins with you! Edgeworth: (That's it...! That balloon that girl was holding... it explains everything.) Your Honor, if it makes you feel any better, you didn't lie once in your testimony. However, I can't really vouch for its accuracy... Judge: Mmnngh... Who knew... that giving testimony could be such a difficult thing to do...? What have I done? I owe Detective Gumshoe a very, very big apology... I will see to it myself that he is released...! Edgeworth: Wait... There are still a few things I have yet to resolve about what happened in the hallway. Your Honor, I request your permission to further question Detective Gumshoe. Judge: B-But why!? I thought we just cleared his name!? Edgeworth: Whether we did just now or not... I still cannot say. The only thing I can do for now is to continue in my quest for the perfect explanation. And to that end... ...I must resolve the remaining issues pertaining to the events that occurred in the hallway! Judge: Very well. Bailiff! Please bring Detective Gumshoe into the courtroom! Edgeworth: (I must fulfill my mission, and find the perfect explanation to this case!) September 10 District Court - Courtroom No. 3 Gumshoe: Wh-What is it now!? Is it time for my trial already!? I've already told you a gazillion times, pal! I didn't do it! Edgeworth: I'll be the judge of that, Detective Gumshoe. Franziska: No, you won't! I'll be the judge of that! Judge: No, no, no, no, no! I'M the judge around here! And I'LL be the judge of that! Gumshoe: Why can't you guys be a little less judgmental...? Judge: Yes, well, speaking of hasty judgments, Detective Gumshoe... I'm afraid I must apologize for an error in judgment on my part. Edgeworth: Your Honor. I don't believe you should apologize just yet. We have yet to prove he is completely innocent of this crime. Judge: I-I guess so... Gumshoe: ? Um, what are you guys talking about? Edgeworth: ...In any case. I would like you to testify as to your actions while you were on guard duty. And please remember, you are not on trial. This is all just a part of the investigation. As such, you may still be found to be innocent... ...however, if you should give false testimony... Gumshoe: Yeeeeoooow! Franziska: My whip will object, loud and clear! Edgeworth: If you are found to be lying, you will be held indefinitely. Understood? Gumshoe: .........I gotcha, pal. Edgeworth: (Thinking back on the state of the crime scene and the Judge's testimony... ...it's obvious that Detective Gumshoe is lying. And if I can't break his lie, then we may never get a break in this case!) Testimony -- While I was on Duty -- Gumshoe: I came down here to this courthouse on Detective Badd's orders. As soon as I got here, he ordered me to stand guard in front of Lobby No. 2. From that time on, until I heard the gunshot, I was in that hallway the whole time! On my honor as a detective, I swear it wasn't me, pal! Franziska: He's still singing the same tired tune. Edgeworth: Hmph. In that case, I'll just have to change the melody. (I know he's lying, and it's time I pulled the information I need out of him!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, was it really Detective Badd who called you down here? Gumshoe: You bet it was, pal! I was left in charge of the precinct while everyone was out, and this call comes in... \"I want you down here in one minute flat!\" he said! Well, I thought this was my big chance, my first case, so I made a mad dash down here! Although, I couldn't exactly get here in a minute flat... Edgeworth: So how long did it take you? Gumshoe: Umm... About ten minutes, I guess. Edgeworth: And what was Detective Badd doing when you finally made it? Gumshoe: He was waiting for me down on the first floor in the entranceway, pal! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And by \"he\", you mean...? Gumshoe: Detective Badd, of course! And, this being my first time at this courthouse... ...he also walked with me up to the 3rd floor hallway in front of the defendant lobbies! Edgeworth: And did you meet anyone along the way? Gumshoe: Hmm... Well... Just as we entered the hallway, we ran into Ms. Yew. When he heard from Ms. Yew that Mr. Faraday was not to be interrupted... ...that's when Detective Badd told me to stand guard in the hallway, pal! Edgeworth: (So far, Detective Gumshoe's testimony is matching up with Detective Badd's...) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You claim to have been in that hallway the \"whole time\"... ...however, is it not a fact that you did something while you were in that hallway? Gumshoe: O-Of course I did something! I guarded the door to Lobby No. 2, pal! What else!? Edgeworth: Very well, then. And what exactly does guarding that door entail? Gumshoe: Umm... Well, to put it simply... Oh, I know! It was my job to stand in front of the door without moving an inch! Edgeworth: Oh? Detective Gumshoe, you mean to tell me... ...that you didn't take a single step away from the door to Lobby No. 2? Is that really what you wish to testify to the effect of? Gumshoe: You got it, pal! I didn't take a single step away from that door, just like I was ordered not to! Franziska: .................. Judge: .................. Edgeworth: .................. Gumshoe: Wh-Why is everyone so quiet all of a sudden? Edgeworth: Because we are all in shock... ...and in awe of your utter stupidity. Franziska: Scruffy! If you're going to lie, at least tell us a more believable one! Gumshoe: Yeeeeowch! B-But I... I'm not lying... Edgeworth: (I should hurry up and bring this insipid testimony to a close.) Changes statement from \"From that time on, until I heard the gunshot, I was in that hallway the whole time!\" to \"And until I heard the gunshot, I didn't take a single step away from the Lobby No. 2 door.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm only going to ask you one more time, Detective Gumshoe. Are you sure you stood in front of the door to Lobby No. 2 the entire time? Gumshoe: Yup! After I was told to by Detective Badd... ...I stood guard in front of that door without a single break! S-So believe me when I say that I was in that hallway the whole time already, pal! Franziska: .................. Judge: .................. Edgeworth: .................. Gumshoe: Wh-Why did everyone go quiet all of a sudden again...? Edgeworth: Apparently, someone has a bit of trouble reading between the lines. Gumshoe: Wh-What's that supposed to mean!? I don't...! Franziska: Be quiet! Gumshoe: Yeeeeowch! Edgeworth: (I should hurry up and bring this insipid testimony to a close.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Would you also be willing to swear that there was no one else in that hall besides you? Gumshoe: Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you talking about!? I just swore to you that I was doing my job, pal! Edgeworth: Oh? Then what are you acting so nervous for? Gumshoe: Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What!? I'm not nervous at all, pal! Anyway! Not a single person other than myself was in that hall the whole time! Edgeworth: (I should just let it go... Pursuing this train of thought at this time would just be a waste of time...) Franziska: He's still singing the same tired tune. Edgeworth: Hmph. In that case, I'll just have to change the melody. (I know he's lying, and it's time I pulled the information I need out of him!) Franziska: To have such a foolishly foolish contradiction... ... in such a foolishly foolish testimony is just plain old foolish. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. However, in the pursuit of the perfect investigation, I'm afraid we have to deal with it.

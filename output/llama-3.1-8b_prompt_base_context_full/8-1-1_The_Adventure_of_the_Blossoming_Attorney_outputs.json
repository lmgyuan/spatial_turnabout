But I do miss my time in England's vast capital... You know...he's flourished into a truly wonderful lawyer. I've no doubt that at this very moment, he's fighting some noble cause in court. Forgive me for taking so long to come to visit you. My life has been such a whirlwind since I returned. And no one could have predicted what has happened. Just two months after arriving home... ...I find myself faced with another awful crime. So I came here today to ask something of you. Tomorrow, I shall be standing in court. For the only time in my life... ...as a lawyer. So please...I ask for your guidance. ...Kazuma-sama.Episode I The Adventure of the Blossoming Attorney13th August, 8:26 a.m. Supreme Court of Judicature, Defendants' Antechamber 3Susato: (Here I am again after nine months... The Supreme Court of Judicature of Japan. I feel so nervous. But I must steel my nerves and find a way to compose myself.)Mikotoba: Ah good, you're here. It doesn't do for a lawyer to be late.Susato: Oh! Yes, um... Good morning, sir!Mikotoba: I hardly recognise you. You cut a fine figure, Counsel. But you look as white as a sheet. And those wide eyes aren't doing you any favours, either.Susato: Oh dear... The truth is...I'm so incredibly nervous, I feel utterly nauseated. I almost wish that I'd never been born.Mikotoba: Goodness. Not the sort of thing a father hopes to hear from his daughter, I must say.Susato: (...Yujin Mikotoba. Professor of Medicine at the Imperial Yumei University. A man who, earlier in his life, travelled to Great Britain to study the latest advances in forensic medical science. And of course...my brilliant father.)???: ...Um, excuse me... Would I be correct in thinking that you're to be my lawyer in court today?Susato: Hm... Oh! Um...yes. Yes, that's right...miss!???: Well...I, um... I want to thank you for agreeing to represent me! I swear... I swear on my life... ...it's a complete fabrication! This whole thing!Susato: (...Rei Membami. Born the same year as I, and my greatest friend. Though unusual for a woman in our time, she works at the university research laboratory, helping my father. And sadly...she's the defendant in today's trial. Accused of committing a truly awful murder.)Susato: Are you feeling alright? Since we started talking, you seem...well, to have become a little flushed.Rei: Oh my! Um...well...erm... It's just that... ...you look so gallant and dashing.Susato: Sorry?Rei: And when I fall under your intense gaze, it... Well, it makes me feel rather bashful.Susato: ......... (Goodness... I don't think she knows. She hasn't realised who I am.)Mikotoba: Wa ha ha ha ha! It would seem our little plan for this trial is going to work.Rei: Oh! What, what do you mean, Professor Mikotoba?Mikotoba: If even your best friend can't see through the disguise, I think we can relax.Rei: Disguise...?Susato: Yes... I've never tried dressing this way before, of course, so I wasn't sure how convincing it would be. But this does make me feel a little relieved, as you say, Father.Rei: F-Father? ......... WHAAAAAA?! Is, is that...? Is that you, Susato?Susato: I'm so sorry I didn't say something sooner, Rei. It's just that-Rei: NOOOOOOOOO! What are you doing? What's going on? What what what what what? That varsity uniform! That varsity cap! That varsity cape! That varsity badge! Look at you! You look for all the world just like a student of the Imperial Yumei University! A male student!Susato: ...I'm so glad you think so. It means all my preparations have been worthwhile. I woke at four this morning to make a start.Rei: But, but I don't understand. Why are you dressed like that?Susato: Well...you see...Mikotoba: It was the only way. The only way she would be permitted into the Supreme Court to take on your defence in this trial.Rei: My... My defence?Susato: ......... (Never before in my life have I felt so frustrated at having been born into this body. Courts in Japan are barred to women. We're not even allowed to set foot inside the courtroom. Despite the fact that the laws of the land apply to all people - male and female - alike...)Rei: But...women are forbidden...Susato: Just for today, I'll be leaving my true self at the courtroom door. So that I can act as your lawyer.Rei: Oh, Susato... You'd go to such lengths for me?Susato: Of course. You're my greatest friend. I just worry that I shan't be the lawyer you deserve.Rei: Oh no! I have complete faith in you!Susato: Rei...Rei: ......... It's so strange, though. I mean, you're such an accomplished judicial assistant already. And yet just because you're a woman... What a wretched reason! I mean, why shouldn't you be allowed in court?! ...You're so gallant and dashing!Susato: Um...Rei... ...please don't look at me like that, with those flushed cheeks and doting eyes.Rei: Oh! I'm, I'm sorry. It's just...you really do look so dashing...Susato: Y-Yes, you mentioned that once or twice.Mikotoba: Wa ha ha ha ha! You should be pleased. It means you look convincing as a man.Susato: I am pleased...I think. It's certainly helped to bolster my confidence today. (Rei... You're managing to put on a brave face in all this, but I can see through it. I've noticed how your shoulders are slumped and how you're trembling ever so slightly.)Rei: Susato... ...you...do believe me, don't you? I didn't do it. I, I couldn't have! I mean...murder...Susato: Of course. You have nothing to worry about. Your conscience is perfectly clean! ...Isn't that right?Rei: Yes...yes it is. Perfectly clean!Susato: I have absolutely no doubt in my mind about your innocence. Which is why I'll stand by you until the bitter end in this trial. Whatever happens...I'll always be on your side! (Because that's what it means to be a defence lawyer!)Rei: That means so much to me, Susato.Bailiff: Defendant! Counsel! Court is about to begin. Proceed to the courtroom at once!Mikotoba: You should go in at once, Rei. If you're late, the judge won't hesitate to pronounce you guilty.Rei: Oh... STAND ASIIIIIIDE!Susato: (I don't think I've ever seen her run so fast...)Mikotoba: ...Well, Susato, you've certainly surprised your father. Going to such lengths to be admitted into the courtroom, and with no prior experience of being a lawyer...Susato: There was simply no other way. That's all there is to it. But Father... ...you haven't told her, have you? I mean, I'm right in assuming that Rei doesn't know how it came to this?Mikotoba: Yes, quite right. I've kept that information from her. It would only worry her if she found out that no other lawyer would agree to take her case. I didn't want to burden her with that.Susato: And is it true? The reason why every other lawyer is refusing to take the case? Is it really because of who the victim was?Mikotoba: ......... We should be making a move now, too. As you know, law isn't my field, but I'll do what I can to support my student.Susato: Thank you, Father. (I'm Susato Mikotoba, a judicial assistant. Eight months ago, I accompanied a student of law on a study trip to Great Britain. But two months ago, due to unforeseen circumstances, I found myself back in Japan.)How many times have I wished that he were here, I wonder? Still...I have no choice now but to steel myself for the trial ahead. Wish me luck...Naruhodo-san.13th August, 9:00 a.m. Supreme Court of Judicature, Courtroom 1Judge: This court is now in session to hear the trial of Rei Membami.Auchi: The prosecution is fully ready to proceed, Your Excellency.???: .........Judge: Defence Counsel! Are you ready?Mikotoba: Yes, Your Excellency. We are ready.???: Ready!Judge: ......... Ah yes, Counsel... ...according to your registration details, your name is... erm... ...Ryutaro Naruhodo. Is that correct?Ryutaro: ......... Sorry?Mikotoba: Oh yes...I had to come up with a suitable male name for you for this little venture. So I'm afraid to say I simply put down the first name that sprung to mind.Judge: Well, Counsel?Ryutaro: Ah! Um, yes, that's right! That's me. I'm, erm... I mean... Yes! I am Ryutaro, he who has vowed to uphold the pride of the great Naruhodo clan!Judge: Ah...Mikotoba: It seems Ryutaro may need to consider how to better uphold his manly act first and not overdo it. And those wild, wide eyes aren't doing you any favours, either. Just relax, and listen...Rei: Naru...hodo...?Auchi: A fresh face in this courtroom, if I'm not mistaken. But the name 'Naruhodo'... Would that perchance be...?Mikotoba: You may be thinking of Ryunosuke Naruhodo, currently in Britain as part of a study programme. This is, um...Ryutaro: ...His cousin!Mikotoba: That's right. Ryutaro here has been studying in the provinces, but was called to the capital for this trial. I assure you, in matters of law, his knowledge rivals that of any of Tokyo's pre-eminent lawyers.Ryutaro: Any of them!Auchi: Tut tut tut. What a pitiful situation. Having been rejected by every lawyer in the capital, the accused has had to call in a country boy.Rei: How dare you?! Susato is every bit as gallant and dashing as any of your Tokyo attorneys! I won't have you making fun of her!Auchi: ...'Her'?Rei: Oh! Um, er...Ryutaro: (Please be careful, Rei...)Auchi: Tsh huh huh... What an unrefined tomboy we have here. But I wonder...is your 'gallant and dashing' lawyer up to the challenge of defending you? His wide, skittish eyes very much suggest that he is not.Ryutaro: (Ugh...I'm so nervous... Now that I'm standing in his shoes, I'm starting to understand what Naruhodo-san goes through. Like it or not, eyes are wont to flit!)Judge: The case to be heard on this day is a matter of great significance to our national interests. In fact, it would be reasonable to assume that the outcome of this trial may well affect the very future of our empire.Auchi: ...Just like the trial nine months ago. And yet for proceedings of such importance, we have this...unknown yokel by the dock? Dear me.Judge: Hmph. Perhaps this would be an appropriate moment for me to assess the defence. To determine whether you are sufficiently competent to practise in this courtroom.Mikotoba: Nine months ago, when a certain other Naruhodo stood where you're standing now... ...this same judge tested him as well. And even though he was just a student at the time - not even of law - he passed the test with flying colours. For a trained and experienced judicial assistant like you, this will be easy.Judge: So, Counsel...do you consent to answering some simple questions?Ryutaro: ......... (Alright, it's time to prove myself.) Yes, Your Excellency! (But please do make them simple!)Judge: Very well. To start with... ...you will state the name of the victim.Ryutaro: (Whew, that is simple. I couldn't forget that if I tried.) ......... Ah.Mikotoba: What's the matter?Ryutaro: (Now that I'm standing in his shoes, I'm starting to understand something else Naruhodo-san goes through. Like it or not, minds are wont to blank!)Mikotoba: It's not surprising, really. It's your first time in this position and...in that guise. Even a bright spark like you is bound to flicker and falter a little under the circumstances.Ryutaro: Oh dear...this is a dismal failure...Mikotoba: Don't fret. You need only use the knowledge you've gained as a judicial assistant to overcome the problem.Ryutaro: ...! (Of course! The Court Record!) Yes, the answer will be amongst all the key information about the case, in the Court Record.Mikotoba: That's right. Just use [R / R1 / E] to open the Court Record. Then you need to flip to the 'People' section with [R / R1 / E]. And don't take too long over it. His Excellency is watching you closely.Ryutaro: (Alright, check the Court Record with [R / R1 / E]... That's where the information I need will be!)Judge: I'm waiting, Counsel... What is the name of the victim in this case?Taketsuchi Auchi Ryutaro: The victim in this case is... Yes! Prosecutor Taketsuchi Auchi! Judge: What?! Auchi: Why the sudden triumphant cry of 'Yes!'? Are you threatening to kill me? Ryutaro: ...He seems angry. Mikotoba: And you're surprised? Did you consult the Court Record? You must look through it carefully. Ryutaro: Oh yes, I did, of course! I looked at everyone on file. And I chose the person whose features appeared to be the most deathly. Mikotoba: ...I must say...this most unusual methodology of yours leaves me almost speechless. It occurs to me with renewed certainty that reading the information carefully is vitally important. I strongly recommend it! Ryutaro: (Oh dear... I simply can't ignore that imploring look.) Your Excellency! Please allow me to amend my answer! Judge: ...Very well. I will excuse this incorrect response given your wide-eyed state of panic. Leads back to: \"What is the name of the victim in this case?\"Yujin Mikotoba Ryutaro: The victim in this case...is none other than Professor Yujin Mikotoba! Judge: What?! Mikotoba: Well... To be written off by one's own child... Ryutaro: Father, you, you seem suddenly so much older...and wearier than you were mere moments ago... Mikotoba: Because of you, clearly! The judge is asking for the victim's name. The person who was killed in this case. Look through the information in the Court Record again. Carefully. Before you kill me, for mercy's sake! Ryutaro: (Oh dear... I simply can't ignore that disapproving look.) Your Excellency! Please allow me to amend my answer! Judge: ...Very well. I will excuse this incorrect response given your wide-eyed state of panic. Leads back to: \"What is the name of the victim in this case?\"Jezaille Brett Ryutaro: Leads to: \"The name of the victim who lost her life in this case...is Miss Jezaille Brett!\"Ryutaro: The name of the victim who lost her life in this case...is Miss Jezaille Brett!Auchi: .........Rei: Jezaille Brett...Mikotoba: A name that will never be forgotten in the courtrooms of our country, I'm sure.Judge: Correct. And being a member of our empire's judiciary, you will be well aware of the significance of that name.Ryutaro: ...!Judge: So...let me pose another simple question. As you know, Miss Brett was a visiting student from the Empire of Great Britain. Why, then, is her name indelibly associated with our own empire's judicial history?Mikotoba: Obviously, you won't have forgotten that case from nine months ago. But if it's proving hard to recall the finer points, everything you need is included in the Court Record.Ryutaro: (Obviously, I still remember. That was the start of everything.) Jezaille Brett... Behind the woman's student persona was the face of...A victim Ryutaro: ...a victim, obviously! Judge: ......... Auchi: ......... Judge: The victim's role is already taken, Counsel! As you should know! Auchi: That answer came with such misguided confidence, I was almost taken in! Ryutaro: I thought it sounded a little odd! Mikotoba: ...Leave me out of this. Check the Court Record, and find the correct answer to the question of Miss Brett's true identity. You'll find it in the 'People' section. Judge: That won't do, Counsel. Amend your answer before we have any more victims to contend with. Ryutaro: Yes...of course! ...Your Excellency! Leads back to: \"Behind the woman's student persona was the face of...\"Queen Victoria Ryutaro: ...Queen Victoria, obviously! Judge: ......... Auchi: ......... Judge: Obviously not! Auchi: The Queen of England?! Studying overseas? Ryutaro: I thought it sounded a little odd! Mikotoba: ...Leave me out of this. I'm sure you know all the details of the case in question from nine months ago. Ryutaro: Oh yes! How could I forget? I know every last detail about it. Mikotoba: Then what on earth was that absurd answer you just gave? Judge: No more absurdity, please, Counsel. You will amend your answer. Ryutaro: Yes, of course, Your Excellency! (...Did they both have to call my answer absurd?) Leads back to: \"Behind the woman's student persona was the face of...\"A killer Ryutaro: Leads to: \"Nine months ago, a visiting professor of medicine at the Imperial Yumei University was killed.\"Ryutaro: Nine months ago, a visiting professor of medicine at the Imperial Yumei University was killed. And the culprit was...Jezaille Brett.Mikotoba: Yes... She was a killer...Judge: At the time, our country had just signed a new treaty with the Empire of Great Britain. And it was in the midst of this delicate diplomatic situation that the incident occurred. An Englishman, Dr John H. Wilson, was shot dead. I believe he was an associate of yours, Professor Mikotoba?Mikotoba: Yes, I was indebted to the man. He'd been my mentor when I went to London to study forensic medicine. Indeed, it was I who invited him here to Japan as a visiting professor at the university. Naturally, the murder of an Englishman on our soil was a matter the government wished to resolve rapidly.Judge: Indeed it was. Which is why a secret trial was conducted here at the Supreme Court. A student of the Imperial Yumei University was arrested on suspicion of murder. A second-year English language student by the name of... Ryunosuke Naruhodo. With the help of his best friend, a student lawyer, the accused conducted his own defence... ...and exposed the despicable crime committed by Miss Jezaille Brett. Miss Brett eventually admitted to her crime. However, when questioned about the motive that drove her to take Dr Wilson's life... ...she gave no satisfactory answer before the trial reached its conclusion.Auchi: Immediately after the trial, the British government brought its consular jurisdiction into play. We were unable to sentence Miss Brett according to our empire's laws. It was decided that she would be removed to Shanghai, China, instead.Ryutaro: Why Shanghai?Mikotoba: There's a British consular court there.Judge: Correct. I oversaw the negotiations personally. The date of her transfer to Shanghai was finally settled upon only last week. All that remained of our empire's obligations was to see the woman safely on board a steamship.Auchi: And yet, the very day before her departure... The Englishwoman was killed!Ryutaro: Only the day before?!Judge: That will do. I'm satisfied that the counsel for the defence is sufficiently capable of representing the defendant.Ryutaro: Oh! Thank you, Your Excellency! (Over the first hurdle...)Judge: Now, a summary of the incident, if you please. Prosecutor Auchi...Auchi: As is your wish...Your Excellency. The repugnant crime took place on the 11th August, in broad daylight. On the outskirts of the imperial capital, under a bright blue sky, at a secluded bathing spot by the sea... The incident occurred inside a small beach hut, erected for bathers to rest or change their clothes. The cause of death was a single stab wound to the posterior abdomen that pierced the victim's lung. An injury which proved fatal. There were two persons alone together in the beach hut at the time of the victim's death: Miss Brett, in her bathing attire, and the accused, Rei Membami! Accordingly, there can be no doubt of the accused's guilt! Especially when we consider she had a powerful motive! The police arrived rapidly at the scene and promptly arrested the young lady.Ryutaro: .........Judge: ......... Well... ...that extraordinary description of events leaves me somewhat lost for words, I must say.Ryutaro: (That's certainly true. The prosecution's summary... ...was full of words that raise an awful lot of questions. As a lawyer, I really ought to pick up the prosecution counsel on what he said about...)The bathing spot (before clearing all other options) Ryutaro: Um, if I may...Prosecutor Auchi... Auchi: What do you want? You fresh-faced, young yokel student! Ryutaro: I wonder... Could you explain, please? You mentioned a 'bathing spot'... Auchi: Hah! My apologies. Clearly my modernity has confused the poor country bumpkin's simple mind. 'Bathing spots' are the very latest trend in health practices from the West. We are told...that bathing in the water of the ocean is curative, therapeutic and excellent for the skin's- Ryutaro: No, that's not what I meant. I was referring to the fact that Miss Brett had, to all intents and purposes, been found guilty of murder. Why would a known criminal have been relaxing by the sea? Auchi: ......... For old times' sake, I believe. Ryutaro: Sorry? Auchi: Miss Brett was to depart for Shanghai the following day. Her 'final wish', as it were, was to enjoy a day at our country's wonderful coast. And the British embassy put extreme pressure on our government to comply. Ryutaro: But, but on what grounds would we agree to such a request? Mikotoba: Because, as usual, our government is unable to stand up to foreign powers. In matters of diplomacy, it seems we don't even have the courage to decline the whims of a known criminal. Auchi: D-Don't look at me, Professor! It was the government who granted permission, not I! In any case, it was decided that with a dedicated detective on duty, nothing could go wrong. Ryutaro: ...But in fact...a murder took place. Auchi: I, I said don't look at me! It was that young student girl who did it, not I! Ryutaro: No one has proved that yet! Mikotoba: ...I wouldn't provoke the man if you don't need to. Ryutaro: (Hm, at this stage, I need to gather more information, I think.) Leads back to: \"As a lawyer, I really ought to pick up the prosecution counsel on what he said about...\"The bathing spot (after clearing all other options) Ryutaro: Um, if I may...Prosecutor Auchi... Auchi: What do you want? You fresh-faced, young yokel student! Ryutaro: I wonder... Could you explain, please? You mentioned a 'bathing spot'... Auchi: Hah! My apologies.

Leads to: \"I believe we all have a clear picture of the incident now.\"Being alone together (before clearing all other options) Ryutaro: Um, Membami-san... Rei: Yes, what is it, Susa- I, I mean, um... Naruhodo-san! Ryutaro: (I'm really starting to wish we'd made my alias Ryutaro Susato...) Please tell the court why exactly you were present at the bathing spot with the victim in the first place. And why you were alone with her. Rei: Oh! Well! No! That's not true! It wasn't like that at all! There were other people present. A detective who was guarding Miss Brett for starters! I was just asked to accompany Miss Brett as a companion, that's all. Auchi: But let us be clear! At the moment of her death, you were alone together with the victim in the hut. You and no one else! Ryutaro: ...! Auchi: The truth is, there is only one reason why this young woman accompanied Miss Brett on her bathing sojourn: It was the accused's last chance to take the victim's life! Rei: No! Auchi: Because, as we know... ...the following day would see Miss Brett extradited to the British authorities in Shanghai. And the accused would never have an opportunity to dispatch her again. Ryutaro: Kindly refrain from conjecture, Counsel! Auchi: ...Tsh huh huh... Mikotoba: ...The prosecution counsel seems to enjoy using provocative tricks like that. But for now at least, we need to assemble more facts... Try not to let him goad you. Susato: (Oh dear... This is really terrifying. But Father's right. We need more information.) Leads back to: \"As a lawyer, I really ought to pick up the prosecution counsel on what he said about...\"Being alone together (after clearing all other options) Ryutaro: Um, Membami-san...

Ryutaro: Kindly refrain from conjecture, Counsel! Auchi: ...Tsh huh huh... Leads to: \"I believe we all have a clear picture of the incident now.\"A powerful motive (before clearing all other options) Ryutaro: You're clearly exaggerating! 'Powerful motive' is a blatant overstatement! Auchi: Tut tut tut. Is the yokel boy using long words he doesn't fully understand? Ryutaro: I beg your pardon? Auchi: ...No matter. Let us put this to the accused, shall we? Membami-san, you are a research assistant at the Imperial Yumei University, I believe? Rei: Yes! I am! I'm working with Professor Mikotoba in his laboratory at the moment! Mikotoba: I can confirm that. The defendant is an excellent assistant with a strong sense of responsibility. Auchi: Fascinating to hear. Now, another question... Prior to your work with Professor Mikotoba...whose research were you assisting then? Rei: Oh! Um...well...erm... I was studying under Dr John H. Wilson. Judge: Dr...Dr Wilson?! The visiting English professor who was murdered by Miss Brett nine months ago? Auchi: The accused had a deep-seated respect for her former mentor, Dr Wilson. ...Is that not true? Rei: ...Yes. Dr Wilson was a wonderful man. Auchi: Interesting. Then tell the court what deep-seated feelings you had towards the Englishwoman who killed him. Rei: Well, obviously I was filled with hatred for what she'd done! A powerful hatred! Ryutaro: Oh no! Rei! Be careful of what you're saying! Rei: Ah. Auchi: The motive...was revenge. ...Plain and simple, Your Excellency. Judge: Hmmm... Mikotoba: Well, it was clearly a trap all along. Ryutaro: How wicked of him to use Rei's undying respect for her former mentor against her like that. (I must find out more details, and something we can use to bolster our defence...) Leads back to: \"As a lawyer, I really ought to pick up the prosecution counsel on what he said about...\"A powerful motive (after clearing all other options) Ryutaro: You're clearly exaggerating!

Leads to: \"I believe we all have a clear picture of the incident now.\"Judge: I believe we all have a clear picture of the incident now.Mikotoba: Despite her guilt being determined nine months ago... ...Miss Brett managed to avoid incarceration, instead continuing her research work at the university. Obviously, over that period, she and Rei would have encountered each other on a number of occasions.Ryutaro: Seeing the murderer of the mentor for whom she had such great respect enjoying such undeserved liberty...Mikotoba: Yes, even if it was only temporary until Miss Brett's extradition to Shanghai... ...you can hardly blame Rei for her feelings of anger and resentment.Ryutaro: (Poor Rei...)Auchi: So, Your Excellency...if you'd be so kind as to peruse this exhibit. A photographic print that shows the scene of the crime immediately following the grim incident.Judge: Yes, thank you, Counsel. A tragic image.Auchi: As you can clearly see, there is nowhere within the hut that anyone else could have hidden.Judge: The court will accept this photographic print as evidence.The photograph of the crime scene has been entered into the Court Record.Judge: As I understand it then, the victim and the defendant were alone inside the beach hut at the time. This is deeply troubling, I must say. The finger of guilt points firmly at the defendant.Auchi: Well, Your Excellency...naturally the prosecution has much more to its case.Ryutaro: ...!Auchi: We intend to prove the accused's appalling actions beyond all possible contention. To that end, I can confirm that we have multiple witnesses to the crime, and damning evidence.Ryutaro: W-Witnesses? But, but who...?Rei: .........Auchi: One of whom, I might add, is a highly respected police detective. I assure you...the testimony of these witnesses will leave no room for doubt!Ryutaro: Ugh!Judge: Very well then, Counsel. Bring forth your witnesses.Auchi: ......... I, Taketsuchi Auchi, have been waiting for this moment.Ryutaro: Sorry?Auchi: Oh yes, I haven't forgotten. That trial nine months ago, here in this very courthouse... ...when that irreverent little student boy...utterly humiliated me!Auchi: ARRRRRRGH! Ryunosuke Naruhodo!Ryunosuke: Wha- Yes?Auchi: This insult to the Auchi family name... will NEVER be forgotten!Kazuma: You've become conceited with age, Counsel. But the old have to stand aside and make way for the new. It's the way of the world. ...May you never forget that!Auchi: 'Strike the head of a samurai whose topknot has been cut, and the bell of cultural enlightenment tolls.' Yes, on that fateful day...my former self died.Ryutaro: The start of your own mini Meiji Revolution! Are you modernising as well, Counsel?Auchi: Silence! Since I swore revenge back then, there has been a minor miracle atop my head. Observe, the Auchi growth! You see? You see this seed of hope sprouting forth from the barren expanse of my crown?Ryutaro: (I, I think that tiny growth is trying to tell me something!)Rei: Um... ...I'm afraid I can't really see. Where, where is the hope exactly?Auchi: I said silence! Today, I face another yokel student of the Naruhodo clan. Well...I will vanquish you! And my victory will be fertiliser for the seed of hope atop my head! ...You have been warned. With that...the prosecution calls the witnesses to the stand!Mikotoba: ...It looks like the stakes are high on both sides in this trial. The prosecution and defence each has much to lose.Ryutaro: A haircut is hardly comparable to Rei's life!Auchi: Witnesses, please state your names and occupations for the court.Hosonaga: Chief Inspector Satoru Hosonaga, Imperial Police Bureau. I'm in disguise, obviously, so I can go undetected.Soseki: And I am... Well, the next big thing in books. An author renowned throughout the capital, in fact. Yes... Soon to be sold out! The satirical 'I Am a Cat'! A sensational success! By Soseki Natsume!Ryutaro: Oh my goodness!Soseki: Struggling student from the provinces, please... You needn't be in awe of me.Ryutaro: I needn't?Soseki: It's only natural that you'd feel nervous in my presence. But all of you, please, relax. Call me Soseki, even.Ryutaro: Um...yes... (What on earth is Soseki-san doing here?)Mikotoba: Tread carefully, Susato. That author fellow knows you from your time in London, doesn't he? If he exposes you for who you really are, this will be over before it's begun.Ryutaro: Yes... Yes, of course. I know. (I presume Soseki-san won't have forgotten about me. I could certainly never forget him. Although he does seem to have changed somewhat in the six months or so that it's been since I last saw him. And as for Inspector Hosonaga... That amazing outfit is... hard to believe.)Hosonaga: ...Do I have something on my face?Ryutaro: (Well, your glasses for one. Although they don't seem to be helping you see... Thank goodness he hasn't recognised me either.)Hosonaga: Ah, I suppose it's this disguise, is it? I thought that appearing here in the clothes I was wearing at the time would make for a more faithful testimony. It is my guiding principle to carry out all testimonies flawlessly.Judge: Hm, well, I can appreciate why an Imperial Police Bureau detective might have been present... ...but what business did a writer such as yourself have being at the scene, Soseki-san?Soseki: Ah, well, you see... ...I had been asked that day to give a lecture. On the morning of the incident...in the Imperial Yumei University's Grand Lecture Hall no less.Ryutaro: At...Yumei University?Soseki: After the lecture, I had a very pleasant conversation with a researcher from the medical science department. The professor over there, in fact.Ryutaro: With my fath- With Professor Mikotoba?!Mikotoba: Yes, that's right. It was arranged by one of the newspapers. They wanted some story or other about two former students who'd studied in Great Britain.Soseki: Of course, being a renowned author, the press never leave me alone. They secretly spy! Snap shots! Scribble stories! And scupper my privacy!Ryutaro: Haah...Soseki: As you can see, the conversation was written up in this newspaper here. Read it at your leisure, my provincial, struggling student friend. I have plenty of copies.Ryutaro: Thank you very much! (He practically threw that paper at me.)The Soseki Natsume article has been entered into the Court Record.Soseki: Anyway, following my interview with the professor... ...the lady in question appeared and made a very unexpected announcement. 'I should like to go with everyone to see your country's coast!' Those were her words.Mikotoba: As I explained before, Miss Brett was never taken into custody. She continued to work in my laboratory, under strict surveillance, of course.Auchi: At which utterance, the university immediately contacted the government to seek guidance. And the response was, 'Permit Miss Brett to go as long as a detective accompanies her.'Hosonaga: That detective, I am at liberty to divulge, was me, Chief Inspector Satoru Hosonaga.Auchi: Thereby the entire party departed cordially for the seaside, it seems.Hosonaga: It was extremely challenging to clear all other members of the public from the vicinity of the beach. But fortunately, I am at peak physical fitness at the moment, so... ...I was able to carry out my duty flawlessly.Ryutaro: Oh my! Inspector, you... Well, you do have something on your face now.Hosonaga: Ah, how unsightly. I do apologise.Ryutaro: Does that mean that you went to the beach too, Father?Mikotoba: No no. Fortunately, I had work to finish off. But unfortunately, of course... ...it meant that, as my assistant, Rei was invited to take my place.Soseki: Of course, being a renowned author, I didn't like to decline the invitation. AGH, BUT IF ONLY I HAD! I'D NEVER HAVE SEEN THAT AWFUL SIGHT!Relentlessly Racked by Remorse and Regret!Judge: Very well. I must now ask you to present your formal testimony to the court. You will give an account of all that you witnessed on your impromptu excursion to the coast.Hosonaga: Of course, Your Excellency...Soseki: ...Relentlessly racked by remorse and regret, I am...Witness Testimony - The Witnessed Scene -Hosonaga: On the day of the incident, I was ordered on a special surveillance assignment in this disguise.Soseki: I'd just managed to catch that crab when I suddenly heard a caterwaul from behind me.Hosonaga: I ran into the beach hut at once, where I found the pair in question.Soseki: YES YES YES! That young girl was astride the Englishwoman, dagger in hand, as she stabbed wildly!Hosonaga: I saw blood on the blade. It proved to me that she'd stabbed the victim multiple times.Judge: Indeed... It does appear from this testimony that both witnesses here present saw it. The very moment...of this heinous crime!Ryutaro: What?!Auchi: Now...if you will recall, I promised evidence as well. What phrase did I use again? ...Ah yes, that was it: 'damning' evidence.Judge: Hm, what have you there, Counsel? A so-called 'fountain pen', is it?Hosonaga: Correct, Your Excellency. I found it at the scene whilst examining the body. It appears that in her dying moments, with her final ounce of strength... ...the victim clutched a piece of evidence that would positively identify her killer.Ryutaro: What?!Auchi: Your Excellency, if you would cast your eyes over the photographic print of the crime scene once more...Judge: ......... Ah! Goodness me! Yes, the victim is clearly grasping something quite deliberately there in her hand!Hosonaga: That's right. The fountain pen. And if you would kindly examine the pen, Your Excellency...Judge: ......... Ah! The owner's initials have been engraved into the ebonite barrel! 'R.M.'... Rei Membami... The initials of the defendant!Ryutaro: Ah... NOOOOOO!Judge: This fountain pen will be admitted immediately as critical evidence!The fountain pen has been entered into the Court Record.Auchi: So...have I omitted anything? Decisive testimony and damning evidence... There's a bright blue sky outside the courthouse today. Perfect weather to ascribe guilt, I feel.Ryutaro: (I, I don't understand. The Prosecutor Auchi of nine months ago... ...had none of this man's poise!)Judge: Counsel for the Defence...you may begin your cross-examination now.Ryutaro: .........Judge: Naruhodo-san!Ryutaro: Naruhodo... That...means... Oh! Yes! Me!Judge: Is there another Naruhodo in my courtroom?Ryutaro: (Actually, there isn't even a single Naruhodo in your courtroom...)Mikotoba: Cousin Ryutaro...pull yourself together, please.Ryutaro: (Alright, I've seen this countless times as a judicial assistant. Find inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies to prove that they're lying somehow. That's all there is to it. That's how a real lawyer would handle a cross-examination. So let's see what I can do!)Cross-Examination - The Witnessed Scene -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Yujin Mikotoba\nDescription: A medical professor at the Imperial Yumei University.

But I do miss my time in England's vast capital... You know...he's flourished into a truly wonderful lawyer. I've no doubt that at this very moment, he's fighting some noble cause in court. Forgive me for taking so long to come to visit you. My life has been such a whirlwind since I returned. And no one could have predicted what has happened. Just two months after arriving home... ...I find myself faced with another awful crime. So I came here today to ask something of you. Tomorrow, I shall be standing in court. For the only time in my life... ...as a lawyer. So please...I ask for your guidance. ...Kazuma-sama.Episode I The Adventure of the Blossoming Attorney13th August, 8:26 a.m. Supreme Court of Judicature, Defendants' Antechamber 3Susato: (Here I am again after nine months... The Supreme Court of Judicature of Japan. I feel so nervous. But I must steel my nerves and find a way to compose myself.)Mikotoba: Ah good, you're here. It doesn't do for a lawyer to be late.Susato: Oh! Yes, um... Good morning, sir!Mikotoba: I hardly recognise you. You cut a fine figure, Counsel. But you look as white as a sheet. And those wide eyes aren't doing you any favours, either.Susato: Oh dear... The truth is...I'm so incredibly nervous, I feel utterly nauseated. I almost wish that I'd never been born.Mikotoba: Goodness. Not the sort of thing a father hopes to hear from his daughter, I must say.Susato: (...Yujin Mikotoba. Professor of Medicine at the Imperial Yumei University. A man who, earlier in his life, travelled to Great Britain to study the latest advances in forensic medical science. And of course...my brilliant father.)???: ...Um, excuse me... Would I be correct in thinking that you're to be my lawyer in court today?Susato: Hm... Oh! Um...yes. Yes, that's right...miss!???: Well...I, um... I want to thank you for agreeing to represent me! I swear... I swear on my life... ...it's a complete fabrication! This whole thing!Susato: (...Rei Membami. Born the same year as I, and my greatest friend. Though unusual for a woman in our time, she works at the university research laboratory, helping my father. And sadly...she's the defendant in today's trial. Accused of committing a truly awful murder.)Susato: Are you feeling alright? Since we started talking, you seem...well, to have become a little flushed.Rei: Oh my! Um...well...erm... It's just that... ...you look so gallant and dashing.Susato: Sorry?Rei: And when I fall under your intense gaze, it... Well, it makes me feel rather bashful.Susato: ......... (Goodness... I don't think she knows. She hasn't realised who I am.)Mikotoba: Wa ha ha ha ha! It would seem our little plan for this trial is going to work.Rei: Oh! What, what do you mean, Professor Mikotoba?Mikotoba: If even your best friend can't see through the disguise, I think we can relax.Rei: Disguise...?Susato: Yes... I've never tried dressing this way before, of course, so I wasn't sure how convincing it would be. But this does make me feel a little relieved, as you say, Father.Rei: F-Father? ......... WHAAAAAA?! Is, is that...? Is that you, Susato?Susato: I'm so sorry I didn't say something sooner, Rei. It's just that-Rei: NOOOOOOOOO! What are you doing? What's going on? What what what what what? That varsity uniform! That varsity cap! That varsity cape! That varsity badge! Look at you! You look for all the world just like a student of the Imperial Yumei University! A male student!Susato: ...I'm so glad you think so. It means all my preparations have been worthwhile. I woke at four this morning to make a start.Rei: But, but I don't understand. Why are you dressed like that?Susato: Well...you see...Mikotoba: It was the only way. The only way she would be permitted into the Supreme Court to take on your defence in this trial.Rei: My... My defence?Susato: ......... (Never before in my life have I felt so frustrated at having been born into this body. Courts in Japan are barred to women. We're not even allowed to set foot inside the courtroom. Despite the fact that the laws of the land apply to all people - male and female - alike...)Rei: But...women are forbidden...Susato: Just for today, I'll be leaving my true self at the courtroom door. So that I can act as your lawyer.Rei: Oh, Susato... You'd go to such lengths for me?Susato: Of course. You're my greatest friend. I just worry that I shan't be the lawyer you deserve.Rei: Oh no! I have complete faith in you!Susato: Rei...Rei: ......... It's so strange, though. I mean, you're such an accomplished judicial assistant already. And yet just because you're a woman... What a wretched reason! I mean, why shouldn't you be allowed in court?! ...You're so gallant and dashing!Susato: Um...Rei... ...please don't look at me like that, with those flushed cheeks and doting eyes.Rei: Oh! I'm, I'm sorry. It's just...you really do look so dashing...Susato: Y-Yes, you mentioned that once or twice.Mikotoba: Wa ha ha ha ha! You should be pleased. It means you look convincing as a man.Susato: I am pleased...I think. It's certainly helped to bolster my confidence today. (Rei... You're managing to put on a brave face in all this, but I can see through it. I've noticed how your shoulders are slumped and how you're trembling ever so slightly.)Rei: Susato... ...you...do believe me, don't you? I didn't do it. I, I couldn't have! I mean...murder...Susato: Of course. You have nothing to worry about. Your conscience is perfectly clean! ...Isn't that right?Rei: Yes...yes it is. Perfectly clean!Susato: I have absolutely no doubt in my mind about your innocence. Which is why I'll stand by you until the bitter end in this trial. Whatever happens...I'll always be on your side! (Because that's what it means to be a defence lawyer!)Rei: That means so much to me, Susato.Bailiff: Defendant! Counsel! Court is about to begin. Proceed to the courtroom at once!Mikotoba: You should go in at once, Rei. If you're late, the judge won't hesitate to pronounce you guilty.Rei: Oh... STAND ASIIIIIIDE!Susato: (I don't think I've ever seen her run so fast...)Mikotoba: ...Well, Susato, you've certainly surprised your father. Going to such lengths to be admitted into the courtroom, and with no prior experience of being a lawyer...Susato: There was simply no other way. That's all there is to it. But Father... ...you haven't told her, have you? I mean, I'm right in assuming that Rei doesn't know how it came to this?Mikotoba: Yes, quite right. I've kept that information from her. It would only worry her if she found out that no other lawyer would agree to take her case. I didn't want to burden her with that.Susato: And is it true? The reason why every other lawyer is refusing to take the case? Is it really because of who the victim was?Mikotoba: ......... We should be making a move now, too. As you know, law isn't my field, but I'll do what I can to support my student.Susato: Thank you, Father. (I'm Susato Mikotoba, a judicial assistant. Eight months ago, I accompanied a student of law on a study trip to Great Britain. But two months ago, due to unforeseen circumstances, I found myself back in Japan.)How many times have I wished that he were here, I wonder? Still...I have no choice now but to steel myself for the trial ahead. Wish me luck...Naruhodo-san.13th August, 9:00 a.m. Supreme Court of Judicature, Courtroom 1Judge: This court is now in session to hear the trial of Rei Membami.Auchi: The prosecution is fully ready to proceed, Your Excellency.???: .........Judge: Defence Counsel! Are you ready?Mikotoba: Yes, Your Excellency. We are ready.???: Ready!Judge: ......... Ah yes, Counsel... ...according to your registration details, your name is... erm... ...Ryutaro Naruhodo. Is that correct?Ryutaro: ......... Sorry?Mikotoba: Oh yes...I had to come up with a suitable male name for you for this little venture. So I'm afraid to say I simply put down the first name that sprung to mind.Judge: Well, Counsel?Ryutaro: Ah! Um, yes, that's right! That's me. I'm, erm... I mean... Yes! I am Ryutaro, he who has vowed to uphold the pride of the great Naruhodo clan!Judge: Ah...Mikotoba: It seems Ryutaro may need to consider how to better uphold his manly act first and not overdo it. And those wild, wide eyes aren't doing you any favours, either. Just relax, and listen...Rei: Naru...hodo...?Auchi: A fresh face in this courtroom, if I'm not mistaken. But the name 'Naruhodo'... Would that perchance be...?Mikotoba: You may be thinking of Ryunosuke Naruhodo, currently in Britain as part of a study programme. This is, um...Ryutaro: ...His cousin!Mikotoba: That's right. Ryutaro here has been studying in the provinces, but was called to the capital for this trial. I assure you, in matters of law, his knowledge rivals that of any of Tokyo's pre-eminent lawyers.Ryutaro: Any of them!Auchi: Tut tut tut. What a pitiful situation. Having been rejected by every lawyer in the capital, the accused has had to call in a country boy.Rei: How dare you?! Susato is every bit as gallant and dashing as any of your Tokyo attorneys! I won't have you making fun of her!Auchi: ...'Her'?Rei: Oh! Um, er...Ryutaro: (Please be careful, Rei...)Auchi: Tsh huh huh... What an unrefined tomboy we have here. But I wonder...is your 'gallant and dashing' lawyer up to the challenge of defending you? His wide, skittish eyes very much suggest that he is not.Ryutaro: (Ugh...I'm so nervous... Now that I'm standing in his shoes, I'm starting to understand what Naruhodo-san goes through. Like it or not, eyes are wont to flit!)Judge: The case to be heard on this day is a matter of great significance to our national interests. In fact, it would be reasonable to assume that the outcome of this trial may well affect the very future of our empire.Auchi: ...Just like the trial nine months ago. And yet for proceedings of such importance, we have this...unknown yokel by the dock? Dear me.Judge: Hmph. Perhaps this would be an appropriate moment for me to assess the defence. To determine whether you are sufficiently competent to practise in this courtroom.Mikotoba: Nine months ago, when a certain other Naruhodo stood where you're standing now... ...this same judge tested him as well. And even though he was just a student at the time - not even of law - he passed the test with flying colours. For a trained and experienced judicial assistant like you, this will be easy.Judge: So, Counsel...do you consent to answering some simple questions?Ryutaro: ......... (Alright, it's time to prove myself.) Yes, Your Excellency! (But please do make them simple!)Judge: Very well. To start with... ...you will state the name of the victim.Ryutaro: (Whew, that is simple. I couldn't forget that if I tried.) ......... Ah.Mikotoba: What's the matter?Ryutaro: (Now that I'm standing in his shoes, I'm starting to understand something else Naruhodo-san goes through. Like it or not, minds are wont to blank!)Mikotoba: It's not surprising, really. It's your first time in this position and...in that guise. Even a bright spark like you is bound to flicker and falter a little under the circumstances.Ryutaro: Oh dear...this is a dismal failure...Mikotoba: Don't fret. You need only use the knowledge you've gained as a judicial assistant to overcome the problem.Ryutaro: ...! (Of course! The Court Record!) Yes, the answer will be amongst all the key information about the case, in the Court Record.Mikotoba: That's right. Just use [R / R1 / E] to open the Court Record. Then you need to flip to the 'People' section with [R / R1 / E]. And don't take too long over it. His Excellency is watching you closely.Ryutaro: (Alright, check the Court Record with [R / R1 / E]... That's where the information I need will be!)Judge: I'm waiting, Counsel... What is the name of the victim in this case?Taketsuchi Auchi Ryutaro: The victim in this case is... Yes! Prosecutor Taketsuchi Auchi! Judge: What?! Auchi: Why the sudden triumphant cry of 'Yes!'? Are you threatening to kill me? Ryutaro: ...He seems angry. Mikotoba: And you're surprised? Did you consult the Court Record? You must look through it carefully. Ryutaro: Oh yes, I did, of course! I looked at everyone on file. And I chose the person whose features appeared to be the most deathly. Mikotoba: ...I must say...this most unusual methodology of yours leaves me almost speechless. It occurs to me with renewed certainty that reading the information carefully is vitally important. I strongly recommend it! Ryutaro: (Oh dear... I simply can't ignore that imploring look.) Your Excellency! Please allow me to amend my answer! Judge: ...Very well. I will excuse this incorrect response given your wide-eyed state of panic. Leads back to: \"What is the name of the victim in this case?\"Yujin Mikotoba Ryutaro: The victim in this case...is none other than Professor Yujin Mikotoba! Judge: What?! Mikotoba: Well... To be written off by one's own child... Ryutaro: Father, you, you seem suddenly so much older...and wearier than you were mere moments ago... Mikotoba: Because of you, clearly! The judge is asking for the victim's name. The person who was killed in this case. Look through the information in the Court Record again. Carefully. Before you kill me, for mercy's sake! Ryutaro: (Oh dear... I simply can't ignore that disapproving look.) Your Excellency! Please allow me to amend my answer! Judge: ...Very well. I will excuse this incorrect response given your wide-eyed state of panic. Leads back to: \"What is the name of the victim in this case?\"Jezaille Brett Ryutaro: Leads to: \"The name of the victim who lost her life in this case...is Miss Jezaille Brett!\"Ryutaro: The name of the victim who lost her life in this case...is Miss Jezaille Brett!Auchi: .........Rei: Jezaille Brett...Mikotoba: A name that will never be forgotten in the courtrooms of our country, I'm sure.Judge: Correct. And being a member of our empire's judiciary, you will be well aware of the significance of that name.Ryutaro: ...!Judge: So...let me pose another simple question. As you know, Miss Brett was a visiting student from the Empire of Great Britain. Why, then, is her name indelibly associated with our own empire's judicial history?Mikotoba: Obviously, you won't have forgotten that case from nine months ago. But if it's proving hard to recall the finer points, everything you need is included in the Court Record.Ryutaro: (Obviously, I still remember. That was the start of everything.) Jezaille Brett... Behind the woman's student persona was the face of...A victim Ryutaro: ...a victim, obviously! Judge: ......... Auchi: ......... Judge: The victim's role is already taken, Counsel! As you should know! Auchi: That answer came with such misguided confidence, I was almost taken in! Ryutaro: I thought it sounded a little odd! Mikotoba: ...Leave me out of this. Check the Court Record, and find the correct answer to the question of Miss Brett's true identity. You'll find it in the 'People' section. Judge: That won't do, Counsel. Amend your answer before we have any more victims to contend with. Ryutaro: Yes...of course! ...Your Excellency! Leads back to: \"Behind the woman's student persona was the face of...\"Queen Victoria Ryutaro: ...Queen Victoria, obviously! Judge: ......... Auchi: ......... Judge: Obviously not! Auchi: The Queen of England?! Studying overseas? Ryutaro: I thought it sounded a little odd! Mikotoba: ...Leave me out of this. I'm sure you know all the details of the case in question from nine months ago. Ryutaro: Oh yes! How could I forget? I know every last detail about it. Mikotoba: Then what on earth was that absurd answer you just gave? Judge: No more absurdity, please, Counsel. You will amend your answer. Ryutaro: Yes, of course, Your Excellency! (...Did they both have to call my answer absurd?) Leads back to: \"Behind the woman's student persona was the face of...\"A killer Ryutaro: Leads to: \"Nine months ago, a visiting professor of medicine at the Imperial Yumei University was killed.\"Ryutaro: Nine months ago, a visiting professor of medicine at the Imperial Yumei University was killed. And the culprit was...Jezaille Brett.Mikotoba: Yes... She was a killer...Judge: At the time, our country had just signed a new treaty with the Empire of Great Britain. And it was in the midst of this delicate diplomatic situation that the incident occurred. An Englishman, Dr John H. Wilson, was shot dead. I believe he was an associate of yours, Professor Mikotoba?Mikotoba: Yes, I was indebted to the man. He'd been my mentor when I went to London to study forensic medicine. Indeed, it was I who invited him here to Japan as a visiting professor at the university. Naturally, the murder of an Englishman on our soil was a matter the government wished to resolve rapidly.Judge: Indeed it was. Which is why a secret trial was conducted here at the Supreme Court. A student of the Imperial Yumei University was arrested on suspicion of murder. A second-year English language student by the name of... Ryunosuke Naruhodo. With the help of his best friend, a student lawyer, the accused conducted his own defence... ...and exposed the despicable crime committed by Miss Jezaille Brett. Miss Brett eventually admitted to her crime. However, when questioned about the motive that drove her to take Dr Wilson's life... ...she gave no satisfactory answer before the trial reached its conclusion.Auchi: Immediately after the trial, the British government brought its consular jurisdiction into play. We were unable to sentence Miss Brett according to our empire's laws. It was decided that she would be removed to Shanghai, China, instead.Ryutaro: Why Shanghai?Mikotoba: There's a British consular court there.Judge: Correct. I oversaw the negotiations personally. The date of her transfer to Shanghai was finally settled upon only last week. All that remained of our empire's obligations was to see the woman safely on board a steamship.Auchi: And yet, the very day before her departure... The Englishwoman was killed!Ryutaro: Only the day before?!Judge: That will do. I'm satisfied that the counsel for the defence is sufficiently capable of representing the defendant.Ryutaro: Oh! Thank you, Your Excellency! (Over the first hurdle...)Judge: Now, a summary of the incident, if you please. Prosecutor Auchi...Auchi: As is your wish...Your Excellency. The repugnant crime took place on the 11th August, in broad daylight. On the outskirts of the imperial capital, under a bright blue sky, at a secluded bathing spot by the sea... The incident occurred inside a small beach hut, erected for bathers to rest or change their clothes. The cause of death was a single stab wound to the posterior abdomen that pierced the victim's lung. An injury which proved fatal. There were two persons alone together in the beach hut at the time of the victim's death: Miss Brett, in her bathing attire, and the accused, Rei Membami! Accordingly, there can be no doubt of the accused's guilt! Especially when we consider she had a powerful motive! The police arrived rapidly at the scene and promptly arrested the young lady.Ryutaro: .........Judge: ......... Well... ...that extraordinary description of events leaves me somewhat lost for words, I must say.Ryutaro: (That's certainly true. The prosecution's summary... ...was full of words that raise an awful lot of questions. As a lawyer, I really ought to pick up the prosecution counsel on what he said about...)The bathing spot (before clearing all other options) Ryutaro: Um, if I may...Prosecutor Auchi... Auchi: What do you want? You fresh-faced, young yokel student! Ryutaro: I wonder... Could you explain, please? You mentioned a 'bathing spot'... Auchi: Hah! My apologies. Clearly my modernity has confused the poor country bumpkin's simple mind. 'Bathing spots' are the very latest trend in health practices from the West. We are told...that bathing in the water of the ocean is curative, therapeutic and excellent for the skin's- Ryutaro: No, that's not what I meant. I was referring to the fact that Miss Brett had, to all intents and purposes, been found guilty of murder. Why would a known criminal have been relaxing by the sea? Auchi: ......... For old times' sake, I believe. Ryutaro: Sorry? Auchi: Miss Brett was to depart for Shanghai the following day. Her 'final wish', as it were, was to enjoy a day at our country's wonderful coast. And the British embassy put extreme pressure on our government to comply. Ryutaro: But, but on what grounds would we agree to such a request? Mikotoba: Because, as usual, our government is unable to stand up to foreign powers. In matters of diplomacy, it seems we don't even have the courage to decline the whims of a known criminal. Auchi: D-Don't look at me, Professor! It was the government who granted permission, not I! In any case, it was decided that with a dedicated detective on duty, nothing could go wrong. Ryutaro: ...But in fact...a murder took place. Auchi: I, I said don't look at me! It was that young student girl who did it, not I! Ryutaro: No one has proved that yet! Mikotoba: ...I wouldn't provoke the man if you don't need to. Ryutaro: (Hm, at this stage, I need to gather more information, I think.) Leads back to: \"As a lawyer, I really ought to pick up the prosecution counsel on what he said about...\"The bathing spot (after clearing all other options) Ryutaro: Um, if I may...Prosecutor Auchi... Auchi: What do you want? You fresh-faced, young yokel student! Ryutaro: I wonder... Could you explain, please? You mentioned a 'bathing spot'... Auchi: Hah! My apologies.

Mikotoba: ...I wouldn't provoke the man if you don't need to. Leads to: \"I believe we all have a clear picture of the incident now.\"Being alone together (before clearing all other options) Ryutaro: Um, Membami-san... Rei: Yes, what is it, Susa- I, I mean, um... Naruhodo-san! Ryutaro: (I'm really starting to wish we'd made my alias Ryutaro Susato...) Please tell the court why exactly you were present at the bathing spot with the victim in the first place. And why you were alone with her. Rei: Oh! Well! No! That's not true! It wasn't like that at all! There were other people present. A detective who was guarding Miss Brett for starters! I was just asked to accompany Miss Brett as a companion, that's all. Auchi: But let us be clear! At the moment of her death, you were alone together with the victim in the hut. You and no one else! Ryutaro: ...! Auchi: The truth is, there is only one reason why this young woman accompanied Miss Brett on her bathing sojourn: It was the accused's last chance to take the victim's life! Rei: No! Auchi: Because, as we know... ...the following day would see Miss Brett extradited to the British authorities in Shanghai. And the accused would never have an opportunity to dispatch her again. Ryutaro: Kindly refrain from conjecture, Counsel! Auchi: ...Tsh huh huh... Mikotoba: ...The prosecution counsel seems to enjoy using provocative tricks like that. But for now at least, we need to assemble more facts... Try not to let him goad you. Susato: (Oh dear... This is really terrifying. But Father's right. We need more information.) Leads back to: \"As a lawyer, I really ought to pick up the prosecution counsel on what he said about...\"Being alone together (after clearing all other options) Ryutaro: Um, Membami-san...

Ryutaro: Kindly refrain from conjecture, Counsel! Auchi: ...Tsh huh huh... Leads to: \"I believe we all have a clear picture of the incident now.\"A powerful motive (before clearing all other options) Ryutaro: You're clearly exaggerating! 'Powerful motive' is a blatant overstatement! Auchi: Tut tut tut. Is the yokel boy using long words he doesn't fully understand? Ryutaro: I beg your pardon? Auchi: ...No matter. Let us put this to the accused, shall we? Membami-san, you are a research assistant at the Imperial Yumei University, I believe? Rei: Yes! I am! I'm working with Professor Mikotoba in his laboratory at the moment! Mikotoba: I can confirm that. The defendant is an excellent assistant with a strong sense of responsibility. Auchi: Fascinating to hear. Now, another question... Prior to your work with Professor Mikotoba...whose research were you assisting then? Rei: Oh! Um...well...erm... I was studying under Dr John H. Wilson. Judge: Dr...Dr Wilson?! The visiting English professor who was murdered by Miss Brett nine months ago? Auchi: The accused had a deep-seated respect for her former mentor, Dr Wilson. ...Is that not true? Rei: ...Yes. Dr Wilson was a wonderful man. Auchi: Interesting. Then tell the court what deep-seated feelings you had towards the Englishwoman who killed him. Rei: Well, obviously I was filled with hatred for what she'd done! A powerful hatred! Ryutaro: Oh no! Rei! Be careful of what you're saying! Rei: Ah. Auchi: The motive...was revenge. ...Plain and simple, Your Excellency. Judge: Hmmm... Mikotoba: Well, it was clearly a trap all along. Ryutaro: How wicked of him to use Rei's undying respect for her former mentor against her like that. (I must find out more details, and something we can use to bolster our defence...) Leads back to: \"As a lawyer, I really ought to pick up the prosecution counsel on what he said about...\"A powerful motive (after clearing all other options) Ryutaro: You're clearly exaggerating!

Leads to: \"I believe we all have a clear picture of the incident now.\"Judge: I believe we all have a clear picture of the incident now.Mikotoba: Despite her guilt being determined nine months ago... ...Miss Brett managed to avoid incarceration, instead continuing her research work at the university. Obviously, over that period, she and Rei would have encountered each other on a number of occasions.Ryutaro: Seeing the murderer of the mentor for whom she had such great respect enjoying such undeserved liberty...Mikotoba: Yes, even if it was only temporary until Miss Brett's extradition to Shanghai... ...you can hardly blame Rei for her feelings of anger and resentment.Ryutaro: (Poor Rei...)Auchi: So, Your Excellency...if you'd be so kind as to peruse this exhibit. A photographic print that shows the scene of the crime immediately following the grim incident.Judge: Yes, thank you, Counsel. A tragic image.Auchi: As you can clearly see, there is nowhere within the hut that anyone else could have hidden.Judge: The court will accept this photographic print as evidence.The photograph of the crime scene has been entered into the Court Record.Judge: As I understand it then, the victim and the defendant were alone inside the beach hut at the time. This is deeply troubling, I must say. The finger of guilt points firmly at the defendant.Auchi: Well, Your Excellency...naturally the prosecution has much more to its case.Ryutaro: ...!Auchi: We intend to prove the accused's appalling actions beyond all possible contention. To that end, I can confirm that we have multiple witnesses to the crime, and damning evidence.Ryutaro: W-Witnesses? But, but who...?Rei: .........Auchi: One of whom, I might add, is a highly respected police detective. I assure you...the testimony of these witnesses will leave no room for doubt!Ryutaro: Ugh!Judge: Very well then, Counsel. Bring forth your witnesses.Auchi: ......... I, Taketsuchi Auchi, have been waiting for this moment.Ryutaro: Sorry?Auchi: Oh yes, I haven't forgotten. That trial nine months ago, here in this very courthouse... ...when that irreverent little student boy...utterly humiliated me!Auchi: ARRRRRRGH! Ryunosuke Naruhodo!Ryunosuke: Wha- Yes?Auchi: This insult to the Auchi family name... will NEVER be forgotten!Kazuma: You've become conceited with age, Counsel. But the old have to stand aside and make way for the new. It's the way of the world. ...May you never forget that!Auchi: 'Strike the head of a samurai whose topknot has been cut, and the bell of cultural enlightenment tolls.' Yes, on that fateful day...my former self died.Ryutaro: The start of your own mini Meiji Revolution! Are you modernising as well, Counsel?Auchi: Silence! Since I swore revenge back then, there has been a minor miracle atop my head. Observe, the Auchi growth! You see? You see this seed of hope sprouting forth from the barren expanse of my crown?Ryutaro: (I, I think that tiny growth is trying to tell me something!)Rei: Um... ...I'm afraid I can't really see. Where, where is the hope exactly?Auchi: I said silence! Today, I face another yokel student of the Naruhodo clan. Well...I will vanquish you! And my victory will be fertiliser for the seed of hope atop my head! ...You have been warned. With that...the prosecution calls the witnesses to the stand!Mikotoba: ...It looks like the stakes are high on both sides in this trial. The prosecution and defence each has much to lose.Ryutaro: A haircut is hardly comparable to Rei's life!Auchi: Witnesses, please state your names and occupations for the court.Hosonaga: Chief Inspector Satoru Hosonaga, Imperial Police Bureau. I'm in disguise, obviously, so I can go undetected.Soseki: And I am... Well, the next big thing in books. An author renowned throughout the capital, in fact. Yes... Soon to be sold out! The satirical 'I Am a Cat'! A sensational success! By Soseki Natsume!Ryutaro: Oh my goodness!Soseki: Struggling student from the provinces, please... You needn't be in awe of me.Ryutaro: I needn't?Soseki: It's only natural that you'd feel nervous in my presence. But all of you, please, relax. Call me Soseki, even.Ryutaro: Um...yes... (What on earth is Soseki-san doing here?)Mikotoba: Tread carefully, Susato. That author fellow knows you from your time in London, doesn't he? If he exposes you for who you really are, this will be over before it's begun.Ryutaro: Yes... Yes, of course. I know. (I presume Soseki-san won't have forgotten about me. I could certainly never forget him. Although he does seem to have changed somewhat in the six months or so that it's been since I last saw him. And as for Inspector Hosonaga... That amazing outfit is... hard to believe.)Hosonaga: ...Do I have something on my face?Ryutaro: (Well, your glasses for one. Although they don't seem to be helping you see... Thank goodness he hasn't recognised me either.)Hosonaga: Ah, I suppose it's this disguise, is it? I thought that appearing here in the clothes I was wearing at the time would make for a more faithful testimony. It is my guiding principle to carry out all testimonies flawlessly.Judge: Hm, well, I can appreciate why an Imperial Police Bureau detective might have been present... ...but what business did a writer such as yourself have being at the scene, Soseki-san?Soseki: Ah, well, you see... ...I had been asked that day to give a lecture. On the morning of the incident...in the Imperial Yumei University's Grand Lecture Hall no less.Ryutaro: At...Yumei University?Soseki: After the lecture, I had a very pleasant conversation with a researcher from the medical science department. The professor over there, in fact.Ryutaro: With my fath- With Professor Mikotoba?!Mikotoba: Yes, that's right. It was arranged by one of the newspapers. They wanted some story or other about two former students who'd studied in Great Britain.Soseki: Of course, being a renowned author, the press never leave me alone. They secretly spy! Snap shots! Scribble stories! And scupper my privacy!Ryutaro: Haah...Soseki: As you can see, the conversation was written up in this newspaper here. Read it at your leisure, my provincial, struggling student friend. I have plenty of copies.Ryutaro: Thank you very much! (He practically threw that paper at me.)The Soseki Natsume article has been entered into the Court Record.Soseki: Anyway, following my interview with the professor... ...the lady in question appeared and made a very unexpected announcement. 'I should like to go with everyone to see your country's coast!' Those were her words.Mikotoba: As I explained before, Miss Brett was never taken into custody. She continued to work in my laboratory, under strict surveillance, of course.Auchi: At which utterance, the university immediately contacted the government to seek guidance. And the response was, 'Permit Miss Brett to go as long as a detective accompanies her.'Hosonaga: That detective, I am at liberty to divulge, was me, Chief Inspector Satoru Hosonaga.Auchi: Thereby the entire party departed cordially for the seaside, it seems.Hosonaga: It was extremely challenging to clear all other members of the public from the vicinity of the beach. But fortunately, I am at peak physical fitness at the moment, so... ...I was able to carry out my duty flawlessly.Ryutaro: Oh my! Inspector, you... Well, you do have something on your face now.Hosonaga: Ah, how unsightly. I do apologise.Ryutaro: Does that mean that you went to the beach too, Father?Mikotoba: No no. Fortunately, I had work to finish off. But unfortunately, of course... ...it meant that, as my assistant, Rei was invited to take my place.Soseki: Of course, being a renowned author, I didn't like to decline the invitation. AGH, BUT IF ONLY I HAD! I'D NEVER HAVE SEEN THAT AWFUL SIGHT!Relentlessly Racked by Remorse and Regret!Judge: Very well. I must now ask you to present your formal testimony to the court. You will give an account of all that you witnessed on your impromptu excursion to the coast.Hosonaga: Of course, Your Excellency...Soseki: ...Relentlessly racked by remorse and regret, I am...Witness Testimony - The Witnessed Scene -Hosonaga: On the day of the incident, I was ordered on a special surveillance assignment in this disguise.Soseki: I'd just managed to catch that crab when I suddenly heard a caterwaul from behind me.Hosonaga: I ran into the beach hut at once, where I found the pair in question.Soseki: YES YES YES! That young girl was astride the Englishwoman, dagger in hand, as she stabbed wildly!Hosonaga: I saw blood on the blade. It proved to me that she'd stabbed the victim multiple times.Judge: Indeed... It does appear from this testimony that both witnesses here present saw it. The very moment...of this heinous crime!Ryutaro: What?!Auchi: Now...if you will recall, I promised evidence as well. What phrase did I use again? ...Ah yes, that was it: 'damning' evidence.Judge: Hm, what have you there, Counsel? A so-called 'fountain pen', is it?Hosonaga: Correct, Your Excellency. I found it at the scene whilst examining the body. It appears that in her dying moments, with her final ounce of strength... ...the victim clutched a piece of evidence that would positively identify her killer.Ryutaro: What?!Auchi: Your Excellency, if you would cast your eyes over the photographic print of the crime scene once more...Judge: ......... Ah! Goodness me! Yes, the victim is clearly grasping something quite deliberately there in her hand!Hosonaga: That's right. The fountain pen. And if you would kindly examine the pen, Your Excellency...Judge: ......... Ah! The owner's initials have been engraved into the ebonite barrel! 'R.M.'... Rei Membami... The initials of the defendant!Ryutaro: Ah... NOOOOOO!Judge: This fountain pen will be admitted immediately as critical evidence!The fountain pen has been entered into the Court Record.Auchi: So...have I omitted anything? Decisive testimony and damning evidence... There's a bright blue sky outside the courthouse today. Perfect weather to ascribe guilt, I feel.Ryutaro: (I, I don't understand. The Prosecutor Auchi of nine months ago... ...had none of this man's poise!)Judge: Counsel for the Defence...you may begin your cross-examination now.Ryutaro: .........Judge: Naruhodo-san!Ryutaro: Naruhodo... That...means... Oh! Yes! Me!Judge: Is there another Naruhodo in my courtroom?Ryutaro: (Actually, there isn't even a single Naruhodo in your courtroom...)Mikotoba: Cousin Ryutaro...pull yourself together, please.Ryutaro: (Alright, I've seen this countless times as a judicial assistant. Find inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies to prove that they're lying somehow. That's all there is to it. That's how a real lawyer would handle a cross-examination. So let's see what I can do!)Cross-Examination - The Witnessed Scene -Hosonaga: On the day of the incident, I was ordered on a special surveillance assignment in this disguise.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: In that...jaunty disguise? Hosonaga: Correct. ......... Wait! No! I mean, it wasn't the first time I've worn this swimsuit for a dip in the ocean. It's tried and tested. 'Do what must be done to keep the Englishwoman under surveillance.' Those were my orders that day. Ryutaro: And this tried and tested outfit was the answer? Hosonaga: Being able to blend flawlessly into a crowd is an important part of a detective's job. I submerged myself in the salty water leaving only Mr Turtle floating inconspicuously on the surface. Mr Turtle loves the water. Ryutaro: ......... But there was no need for you to blend into the background on this assignment really, was there? Mikotoba: If that made you late arriving on the scene, I think perhaps you had your priorities wrong. Hosonaga: ......... Ahem. ...Ahem. Ryutaro: (Perhaps I shouldn't pursue this line of questioning any further at the moment...)Soseki: I'd just managed to catch that crab when I suddenly heard a caterwaul from behind me.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: Ah, you're describing the victim's scream, presumably, Soseki-san? Soseki: In more literary terms, you might say it was a scream that could have pierced the heavens. 'KYAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!' ...Or the like. Of course, that's just a metaphor. We renowned authors are wont to describing things so. Ryutaro: (Soseki-san wasn't at all like this in England...) Soseki: Anyway, I spun around at the noise and the beach hut immediately fell under my gaze. Ryutaro: Yes, the beach hut... Hosonaga: The area is popular with government ministers. Many have seaside retreats there for rest and recuperation. Locals are prohibited from entering the area, so it's always very quiet. The beach hut is a simple structure, erected as a place for people to change or take refuge from the sun. Soseki: Although, the Englishwoman commandeered the hut for herself... ...which meant that I was forced to change into my swimwear on the sand. Ryutaro: Ah. I imagine that was rather embarrassing for you. Soseki: Well anyway, I tossed the crab aside and headed for the beach hut at a run. Or, in more literary terms... I decrabbed and beetled off hut-wise!Hosonaga: I ran into the beach hut at once, where I found the pair in question.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: Wait, by 'pair', you don't mean to say...? But how could that be? Hosonaga: No no, you misunderstand! Obviously, I mean the victim and the defendant, Rei Membami-san. Ryutaro: ...Oh. It would have been helpful if you could have just said that from the outset. Hosonaga: ...If you jump to conclusions, you have to expect to fall flat on your face sometimes. Auchi: Dear me, pinning your hopes on such an outside chance. Foolish. Very foolish. Ryutaro: (It really was an outside chance. I just wish I'd realised that before I said something silly.) Auchi: So, Inspector, why don't you tell the court how exactly you found the aforementioned pair in the hut. Hosonaga: Well, it was a sorry sight. A really grisly scene. I parted the noren curtain hanging in the doorway and stepped inside, only to see... ...the defendant leaning menacingly over the lifeless body of the victim sprawled on the sand! Ahem! Ahem, ahem, ahem! My glasses very nearly cracked at the ominous sight that met my eyes. Auchi: How thoroughly appalling. Ryutaro: Ugh... (He doesn't appear to be lying here...) Well, Soseki-san, can you confirm what Inspector Hosonaga is saying, I wonder? Soseki: Ah... You'd like a literary man's opinion?Soseki: YES YES YES! That young girl was astride the Englishwoman, dagger in hand, as she stabbed wildly!Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: 'Stabbed wildly'? You actually saw her do it? Soseki: Oh, indeed. The terrible spectre! The terrapin inspector! The bloody torrent! The author's torment! Ryutaro: EEEEEEEEEEEK!!! Soseki: Every sight and every sound is still carved in my melancholy memory! That was my impression, at least...as a future literary sensation. Auchi: Counsel! What on earth was that shrill, effeminate scream? Ryutaro: Oh! N-No! ...Ahem! No. What are you insinuating? I'm as manly a Japanese man as you! Mikotoba: I wonder if I might interject here, Soseki-san. Something you said is troubling me. 'That was my impression' were your words just now, I believe. Soseki: ......... Ryutaro: Ah! So...do you mean to say... ...you're not confident that you really did see what you've described? Soseki: ......... NO! I mean, YES! I mean, I KNOW WHAT I SAW! My ears didn't deceive me when I heard that scream. Hence my eyes didn't deceive me, either! I could describe everything I saw vividly! I could publish it all in tomorrow's newspaper serial! Auchi: It sounds as though the next instalment of 'I Am a Cat' may take a macabre turn. Mikotoba: I think this is a fool's errand. The more we press your author friend on what he saw, the more entrenched he's going to become. Ryutaro: Oh dear... How awkward.Hosonaga: I saw blood on the blade. It proved to me that she'd stabbed the victim multiple times.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: She was stabbed multiple times...? How can you be sure of that? Hosonaga: Very simply. From the blood on the blade. Ryutaro: The...blood? Hosonaga: When I entered the hut, I saw the defendant holding the blade raised up in the air. Soseki: YES! YES! That's right! I saw it too! Ryutaro: Oh... Hosonaga: And I noted that there was blood on the blade already at that point. In other words, the victim had already been stabbed at least once by the time I arrived on the scene. Soseki: YES! YES! That's right! I saw it too! Hosonaga: And the victim was already holding the defendant's fountain pen in her hand, too. All of which means I can be sure...the victim did not die instantly. Soseki: YES! YES! Right! Saw it too! Ryutaro: (Maybe a year in London was too much for him. He sounds like he's forgotten how to speak Japanese.) Mikotoba: The logic of your argument is sound at least. Hosonaga: Well, as I said, it is my guiding principle to carry out all testimonies flawlessly. Ryutaro: Perhaps it should have been your guiding principle to protect the victim flawlessly? That's just my personal opinion, of course. Hosonaga: ......... Ahem! Ahem! Ahem, ahem! Judge: Counsel! You will refrain from mocking the witness!Present Post-Mortem Report Ryutaro: Leads to: \".........\"Ryutaro: (Oh no... I just have so many thoughts whirling around in my head... It's all I can do to stand here, wide-eyed and mute...)Mikotoba: Goodness, my dear. You really must try to calm down.Ryutaro: But how am I supposed to find an inconsistency in what these two gentlemen are saying? I don't see why either of them would have any reason to lie.Mikotoba: What you must remember, I think, is that witnesses may inadvertently lie at times. For various reasons: a misunderstanding, a mistaken observation, a delusion, even...Ryutaro: Ah...a delusion...Mikotoba: What's important is that we determine the truth. And there's only one sure way to do that.Ryutaro: Yes...with evidence, of course.Mikotoba: Spoken like a true judicial assistant. During witness testimony, you can use [R / R1 / E] to pick a piece of evidence to 'Present' for consideration. So you need to listen carefully to each statement, and compare what's said to the details in the Court Record. If you find some conflicting information, that may be the inconsistency you're looking for.Ryutaro: (Yes, it's all about inconsistencies...)Mikotoba: Once you've identified a witness's statement that appears to conflict with a piece of evidence... Present the evidence to the witness with [X / \u25b3 / R], and the way ahead will present itself to you, I'm sure.Ryutaro: Yes! (Alright, then... I'll consider the details of all the evidence in the Court Record against each statement to find an inconsistency. I hope I'm up to the task...)Mikotoba: Don't forget that you can have the witnesses repeat their statements as many times as you like. Everyone has to start at the beginning, remember. So those wide eyes are quite forgivable. And besides...there's no one else to defend the poor girl.Ryutaro: You're right! (I need to listen to the testimony again from the start.)Ryutaro: ......... (With that accusatory cry that just welled up from deep inside me, I think I finally understand... Every time Kazuma-sama and Naruhodo-san have stood here at this bench... ...the stakes have been very, very high, indeed!)Auchi: Wh-What's the meaning of that menacing pose, Counsel?Ryutaro: I'd like the witness to clarify something for me.Soseki: Who? What? Where? When? Hooooooooooow?!Ryutaro: Not you, Soseki-san. This query is directed at Inspector Hosonaga.Hosonaga: ...! At me?Ryutaro: In your statement just now... ...you said that the victim was stabbed multiple times.Hosonaga: Yes, that's right. As I said, when I entered the hut... ...the defendant was already standing over the victim, bloody knife in hand, like a murderous demon.Ryutaro: And yet...that cannot be.Hosonaga: What?Judge: Get to the point please, Counsel.Ryutaro: In the post-mortem report, it clearly states... ...that the victim was stabbed one time only.Judge: Ah!Auchi: Nnnf!Ryutaro: In other words...Inspector Hosonaga's testimony... ...is clearly flawed!Hosonaga: Agh!Ryutaro: And Soseki-san!Soseki: M-M-Me?!Ryutaro: You claim to have seen Membami-san in the throes of stabbing the victim.Soseki: Y-Yes... Yes, I did... WILDLY!Ryutaro: But both you and the inspector confirmed the same point: That there was already blood on the knife that you saw the defendant holding.Hosonaga: Yes... And...?Ryutaro: It's quite simple. We know the murder weapon was used to stab the victim only once. Therefore... ...there is no way there could have been blood on the knife if that single stabbing hadn't already occurred.Soseki: ARGH! TRUE!Judge: Then what exactly is your contention, Counsel? Are you ever going to tell us?Ryutaro: Yes, Your Excellency. There's only one logical conclusion. What Soseki-san in fact saw was not the moment that the defendant stabbed the victim at all... ...but the moment that the defendant in fact...withdrew the blade from the victim's body!Soseki: That, that can't... ...BEEEEEEEEEEEE!Mikotoba: Excellent work, Susato! You exploded at them with that objection, and then proceeded to pull them apart systematically.Auchi:Auchi: Tsh huh huh... Well well, this takes me back.Ryutaro: ...!Auchi: Yes, I seem to remember your cousin staged a scene much like this in that trial nine months ago. A half-witted child with a half-baked objection attempting to steal the show.Mikotoba: You're right. There were certain similarities. Except that so-called 'half-witted child' managed to outwit the prosecution...who has only half a head of hair.Auchi: Slander! My head is quite adequately dressed! In any case, all this talk of stabbing and withdrawing and multiple wounds... ...it makes not a jot of difference!Ryutaro: What? Why not?Auchi: Engage your brain, young man! When the accused first plunged the deadly weapon into the victim, that was the fatal blow. And it was that moment, just as she had withdrawn the blade ready for her next strike, that the witnesses saw. The knife was already tainted with blood, because the accused had already stabbed the victim!Ryutaro: Ah!Auchi: All you have successfully shown with your little display... ...is that the moustached author is prone to moments of extravagance!Ryutaro: AAAAAAAAAGH!Judge: I am in agreement with the prosecution. If the defendant was seen wielding the blade at all... ...that is sufficient grounds for her actions to be viewed with suspicion.Ryutaro: But, but if she was withdrawing the blade...Auchi: ...Then we are back where we started!Ryutaro: Sorry?Auchi: Consider this, young yokel boy... If the student girl is innocent as you claim... ...then why would she have pulled the blade from the victim? And with a demon's cold-blooded composure, too. The prosecution demands an explanation! ...And it had better be good.Ryutaro: Why did Rei pull out the knife...?Mikotoba: Ah, yes... Going for the jugular.Ryutaro: Hm? (What does Father mean by that?)Judge: Let the court hear your answer then, Counsel.Ryutaro: (The truth is, I don't really know. But I have to come up with a plausible reason here, or we don't have a case.) The reason why the defendant pulled the knife blade out of the victim's body was surely so she could...Stab her again Ryutaro: Hm, well, this is only one possible answer, but... ...could it have been so she could stab the victim again? Judge: Pardon? Ryutaro: Isn't there a saying? If someone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the left also. Mikotoba: Susa- Ryutaro! What are you saying?! Or rather, what are you doing? Do you realise what a hole you're digging? Ryutaro: Ah! AAAAAAGH! (It must be the pressure of being here. I'm starting to say things I don't mean...) Auchi: Quite a slap in the face for the woman you represent. You yokels and your heavy-handed ways! Ryutaro: N-No, I didn't... That, that was just an example! A mere musing! I didn't mean that's what happened! Judge: I suggest you take a moment to consider your answer next time. ...Before you speak, Counsel. Ryutaro: Ugh... Yes, Your Excellency... Thank you for allowing me another chance. Leads back to: \"The reason why the defendant pulled the knife out of the victim's body was surely so she could...\"Save her life Leads to: \"According to the post-mortem report, the victim's death was not instant.\"Hide the knife Ryutaro: I think...it was possibly so that she could hide the murder weapon. Auchi: Auchi: And yet the murder weapon was left there, thrust into the sand at the scene. Ryutaro: ......... Having pulled the knife from the victim, she couldn't find a place to hide it, so that was her only option, perhaps? Judge: ......... I think, Counsel... ...that you were ill-advised with your answer initially. And you were further ill-advised to pursue it. Ryutaro: Oh dear! I'm terribly sorry! (...This job is not to be taken lightly. There's just so much pressure.) Mikotoba: Just because you're under pressure doesn't mean you can say the first thing that comes into your head. Ryutaro: I'd, I'd like to revise my answer, Your Excellency! Leads back to: \"The reason why the defendant pulled the knife out of the victim's body was surely so she could...\"Ryutaro: According to the post-mortem report, the victim's death was not instant.Hosonaga: That's correct. It's thought she would have remained conscious for a short while after sustaining the injury.Auchi: Indeed, giving her the time to take hold of this piece of evidence that clearly indicates her killer.Ryutaro: The, the point is... ...being a medical research assistant, Membami-san was compelled to act when faced with the wounded victim. Instinctively, she pulled the blade out in an attempt to save Miss Brett's life!Auchi: .........Judge: .........Mikotoba: .........Auchi: Tsh huh huh! Did you hear that, Your Excellency? It would seem this is the best we can expect of this young yokel.Judge: Hmmm... Indeed.Ryutaro: (Ugh... Is it just me, or does it suddenly feel much colder in here?)Hosonaga: ...Your Excellency, if I may?Judge: Speak, witness.Hosonaga: I would like another opportunity to testify. In respect to the slipshod assertion just put forward by the yokel defence counsel, I mean.Ryutaro: S-Slipshod?Auchi: Tsh...huh...huh... An excellent idea, Inspector. Our young yokel hopeful has a modicum of knowledge when it comes to the law, it seems... ...but in matters of medicine, he appears to possess not one iota of common sense!Judge: Very well, Inspector. I will permit your request. You will testify again before the court. On the subject of the defence counsel's assertion.Hosonaga: Yes, sir. I will do so flawlessly.Witness Testimony - Forensic Medicine Primer -Hosonaga: Pulling a blade from a wound without thinking could cause heavy bleeding. That's basic knowledge that any medical research assistant with an ounce of sense ought to know. In other words, there's no good reason why the defendant would have tried to pull the knife from the victim. Let's not forget that the young student did have a motive for killing the victim. The man the victim murdered nine months ago, Dr Wilson, was the defendant's highly respected mentor.Ryutaro: Is, is what you just said true, Inspector? Could pulling a knife from a wound really cause the wound to bleed heavily?Hosonaga: Yes. Think of the weapon itself as a stopper in the wound that prevents excessive blood loss. Until a doctor is ready to provide proper treatment, that stopper shouldn't be removed.Ryutaro: Oh, I... I see...Auchi: Hah! This is why yokels should stay on the farm. Even a quack from some obscure mountain village would have such basic knowledge. Anyone who's ever given someone a little poke with a knife and pulled it out again knows it!Ryutaro: Oh...well...I've never stabbed anyone, you see. Or pulled a blade out of a wound, so...Mikotoba: Of course you haven't. I didn't bring you up to behave like a bandit.Ryutaro: Father, is it true, what they're telling me?Mikotoba: Yes, it's basic remedial knowledge for medics. Rei would have been well aware of it. If she were to claim ignorance of such fundamentals, that would prove fatal in many ways.Ryutaro: But then...why would Rei have done it? Could she have pulled out that knife in full knowledge that it would be fatal for Miss Brett?Mikotoba: ...I don't know.Ryutaro: (Rei never once mentioned anything about the knife to me. It seems almost impossible to believe, but... ...could my friend actually have...?)Mikotoba: Susato!Ryutaro: Y-Yes?Mikotoba: Pull yourself together! We mustn't lose sight of why we're here.Ryutaro: (Ah!)Judge: Counsel, it's time for your cross-examination.Ryutaro: Oh...yes, Your Excellency!Judge: However... ...I must warn you that if your cross-examination fails to identify any issue with the established facts... ...I will be moving to my adjudication immediately afterwards.Ryutaro: ...I understand. (Believing in your clients and fighting for their cause until the bitter end... I knew it would be hard, but...I had no idea it would be this hard!)Cross-Examination - Forensic Medicine Primer -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Yujin Mikotoba\nDescription: A medical professor at the Imperial Yumei University.

But I do miss my time in England's vast capital... You know...he's flourished into a truly wonderful lawyer. I've no doubt that at this very moment, he's fighting some noble cause in court. Forgive me for taking so long to come to visit you. My life has been such a whirlwind since I returned. And no one could have predicted what has happened. Just two months after arriving home... ...I find myself faced with another awful crime. So I came here today to ask something of you. Tomorrow, I shall be standing in court. For the only time in my life... ...as a lawyer. So please...I ask for your guidance. ...Kazuma-sama.Episode I The Adventure of the Blossoming Attorney13th August, 8:26 a.m. Supreme Court of Judicature, Defendants' Antechamber 3Susato: (Here I am again after nine months... The Supreme Court of Judicature of Japan. I feel so nervous. But I must steel my nerves and find a way to compose myself.)Mikotoba: Ah good, you're here. It doesn't do for a lawyer to be late.Susato: Oh! Yes, um... Good morning, sir!Mikotoba: I hardly recognise you. You cut a fine figure, Counsel. But you look as white as a sheet. And those wide eyes aren't doing you any favours, either.Susato: Oh dear... The truth is...I'm so incredibly nervous, I feel utterly nauseated. I almost wish that I'd never been born.Mikotoba: Goodness. Not the sort of thing a father hopes to hear from his daughter, I must say.Susato: (...Yujin Mikotoba. Professor of Medicine at the Imperial Yumei University. A man who, earlier in his life, travelled to Great Britain to study the latest advances in forensic medical science. And of course...my brilliant father.)???: ...Um, excuse me... Would I be correct in thinking that you're to be my lawyer in court today?Susato: Hm... Oh! Um...yes. Yes, that's right...miss!???: Well...I, um... I want to thank you for agreeing to represent me! I swear... I swear on my life... ...it's a complete fabrication! This whole thing!Susato: (...Rei Membami. Born the same year as I, and my greatest friend. Though unusual for a woman in our time, she works at the university research laboratory, helping my father. And sadly...she's the defendant in today's trial. Accused of committing a truly awful murder.)Susato: Are you feeling alright? Since we started talking, you seem...well, to have become a little flushed.Rei: Oh my! Um...well...erm... It's just that... ...you look so gallant and dashing.Susato: Sorry?Rei: And when I fall under your intense gaze, it... Well, it makes me feel rather bashful.Susato: ......... (Goodness... I don't think she knows. She hasn't realised who I am.)Mikotoba: Wa ha ha ha ha! It would seem our little plan for this trial is going to work.Rei: Oh! What, what do you mean, Professor Mikotoba?Mikotoba: If even your best friend can't see through the disguise, I think we can relax.Rei: Disguise...?Susato: Yes... I've never tried dressing this way before, of course, so I wasn't sure how convincing it would be. But this does make me feel a little relieved, as you say, Father.Rei: F-Father? ......... WHAAAAAA?! Is, is that...? Is that you, Susato?Susato: I'm so sorry I didn't say something sooner, Rei. It's just that-Rei: NOOOOOOOOO! What are you doing? What's going on? What what what what what? That varsity uniform! That varsity cap! That varsity cape! That varsity badge! Look at you! You look for all the world just like a student of the Imperial Yumei University! A male student!Susato: ...I'm so glad you think so. It means all my preparations have been worthwhile. I woke at four this morning to make a start.Rei: But, but I don't understand. Why are you dressed like that?Susato: Well...you see...Mikotoba: It was the only way. The only way she would be permitted into the Supreme Court to take on your defence in this trial.Rei: My... My defence?Susato: ......... (Never before in my life have I felt so frustrated at having been born into this body. Courts in Japan are barred to women. We're not even allowed to set foot inside the courtroom. Despite the fact that the laws of the land apply to all people - male and female - alike...)Rei: But...women are forbidden...Susato: Just for today, I'll be leaving my true self at the courtroom door. So that I can act as your lawyer.Rei: Oh, Susato... You'd go to such lengths for me?Susato: Of course. You're my greatest friend. I just worry that I shan't be the lawyer you deserve.Rei: Oh no! I have complete faith in you!Susato: Rei...Rei: ......... It's so strange, though. I mean, you're such an accomplished judicial assistant already. And yet just because you're a woman... What a wretched reason! I mean, why shouldn't you be allowed in court?! ...You're so gallant and dashing!Susato: Um...Rei... ...please don't look at me like that, with those flushed cheeks and doting eyes.Rei: Oh! I'm, I'm sorry. It's just...you really do look so dashing...Susato: Y-Yes, you mentioned that once or twice.Mikotoba: Wa ha ha ha ha! You should be pleased. It means you look convincing as a man.Susato: I am pleased...I think. It's certainly helped to bolster my confidence today. (Rei... You're managing to put on a brave face in all this, but I can see through it. I've noticed how your shoulders are slumped and how you're trembling ever so slightly.)Rei: Susato... ...you...do believe me, don't you? I didn't do it. I, I couldn't have! I mean...murder...Susato: Of course. You have nothing to worry about. Your conscience is perfectly clean! ...Isn't that right?Rei: Yes...yes it is. Perfectly clean!Susato: I have absolutely no doubt in my mind about your innocence. Which is why I'll stand by you until the bitter end in this trial. Whatever happens...I'll always be on your side! (Because that's what it means to be a defence lawyer!)Rei: That means so much to me, Susato.Bailiff: Defendant! Counsel! Court is about to begin. Proceed to the courtroom at once!Mikotoba: You should go in at once, Rei. If you're late, the judge won't hesitate to pronounce you guilty.Rei: Oh... STAND ASIIIIIIDE!Susato: (I don't think I've ever seen her run so fast...)Mikotoba: ...Well, Susato, you've certainly surprised your father. Going to such lengths to be admitted into the courtroom, and with no prior experience of being a lawyer...Susato: There was simply no other way. That's all there is to it. But Father... ...you haven't told her, have you? I mean, I'm right in assuming that Rei doesn't know how it came to this?Mikotoba: Yes, quite right. I've kept that information from her. It would only worry her if she found out that no other lawyer would agree to take her case. I didn't want to burden her with that.Susato: And is it true? The reason why every other lawyer is refusing to take the case? Is it really because of who the victim was?Mikotoba: ......... We should be making a move now, too. As you know, law isn't my field, but I'll do what I can to support my student.Susato: Thank you, Father. (I'm Susato Mikotoba, a judicial assistant. Eight months ago, I accompanied a student of law on a study trip to Great Britain. But two months ago, due to unforeseen circumstances, I found myself back in Japan.)How many times have I wished that he were here, I wonder? Still...I have no choice now but to steel myself for the trial ahead. Wish me luck...Naruhodo-san.13th August, 9:00 a.m. Supreme Court of Judicature, Courtroom 1Judge: This court is now in session to hear the trial of Rei Membami.Auchi: The prosecution is fully ready to proceed, Your Excellency.???: .........Judge: Defence Counsel! Are you ready?Mikotoba: Yes, Your Excellency. We are ready.???: Ready!Judge: ......... Ah yes, Counsel... ...according to your registration details, your name is... erm... ...Ryutaro Naruhodo. Is that correct?Ryutaro: ......... Sorry?Mikotoba: Oh yes...I had to come up with a suitable male name for you for this little venture. So I'm afraid to say I simply put down the first name that sprung to mind.Judge: Well, Counsel?Ryutaro: Ah! Um, yes, that's right! That's me. I'm, erm... I mean... Yes! I am Ryutaro, he who has vowed to uphold the pride of the great Naruhodo clan!Judge: Ah...Mikotoba: It seems Ryutaro may need to consider how to better uphold his manly act first and not overdo it. And those wild, wide eyes aren't doing you any favours, either. Just relax, and listen...Rei: Naru...hodo...?Auchi: A fresh face in this courtroom, if I'm not mistaken. But the name 'Naruhodo'... Would that perchance be...?Mikotoba: You may be thinking of Ryunosuke Naruhodo, currently in Britain as part of a study programme. This is, um...Ryutaro: ...His cousin!Mikotoba: That's right. Ryutaro here has been studying in the provinces, but was called to the capital for this trial. I assure you, in matters of law, his knowledge rivals that of any of Tokyo's pre-eminent lawyers.Ryutaro: Any of them!Auchi: Tut tut tut. What a pitiful situation. Having been rejected by every lawyer in the capital, the accused has had to call in a country boy.Rei: How dare you?! Susato is every bit as gallant and dashing as any of your Tokyo attorneys! I won't have you making fun of her!Auchi: ...'Her'?Rei: Oh! Um, er...Ryutaro: (Please be careful, Rei...)Auchi: Tsh huh huh... What an unrefined tomboy we have here. But I wonder...is your 'gallant and dashing' lawyer up to the challenge of defending you? His wide, skittish eyes very much suggest that he is not.Ryutaro: (Ugh...I'm so nervous... Now that I'm standing in his shoes, I'm starting to understand what Naruhodo-san goes through. Like it or not, eyes are wont to flit!)Judge: The case to be heard on this day is a matter of great significance to our national interests. In fact, it would be reasonable to assume that the outcome of this trial may well affect the very future of our empire.Auchi: ...Just like the trial nine months ago. And yet for proceedings of such importance, we have this...unknown yokel by the dock? Dear me.Judge: Hmph. Perhaps this would be an appropriate moment for me to assess the defence. To determine whether you are sufficiently competent to practise in this courtroom.Mikotoba: Nine months ago, when a certain other Naruhodo stood where you're standing now... ...this same judge tested him as well. And even though he was just a student at the time - not even of law - he passed the test with flying colours. For a trained and experienced judicial assistant like you, this will be easy.Judge: So, Counsel...do you consent to answering some simple questions?Ryutaro: ......... (Alright, it's time to prove myself.) Yes, Your Excellency! (But please do make them simple!)Judge: Very well. To start with... ...you will state the name of the victim.Ryutaro: (Whew, that is simple. I couldn't forget that if I tried.) ......... Ah.Mikotoba: What's the matter?Ryutaro: (Now that I'm standing in his shoes, I'm starting to understand something else Naruhodo-san goes through. Like it or not, minds are wont to blank!)Mikotoba: It's not surprising, really. It's your first time in this position and...in that guise. Even a bright spark like you is bound to flicker and falter a little under the circumstances.Ryutaro: Oh dear...this is a dismal failure...Mikotoba: Don't fret. You need only use the knowledge you've gained as a judicial assistant to overcome the problem.Ryutaro: ...! (Of course! The Court Record!) Yes, the answer will be amongst all the key information about the case, in the Court Record.Mikotoba: That's right. Just use [R / R1 / E] to open the Court Record. Then you need to flip to the 'People' section with [R / R1 / E]. And don't take too long over it. His Excellency is watching you closely.Ryutaro: (Alright, check the Court Record with [R / R1 / E]... That's where the information I need will be!)Judge: I'm waiting, Counsel... What is the name of the victim in this case?Taketsuchi Auchi Ryutaro: The victim in this case is... Yes! Prosecutor Taketsuchi Auchi! Judge: What?! Auchi: Why the sudden triumphant cry of 'Yes!'? Are you threatening to kill me? Ryutaro: ...He seems angry. Mikotoba: And you're surprised? Did you consult the Court Record? You must look through it carefully. Ryutaro: Oh yes, I did, of course! I looked at everyone on file. And I chose the person whose features appeared to be the most deathly. Mikotoba: ...I must say...this most unusual methodology of yours leaves me almost speechless. It occurs to me with renewed certainty that reading the information carefully is vitally important. I strongly recommend it! Ryutaro: (Oh dear... I simply can't ignore that imploring look.) Your Excellency! Please allow me to amend my answer! Judge: ...Very well. I will excuse this incorrect response given your wide-eyed state of panic. Leads back to: \"What is the name of the victim in this case?\"Yujin Mikotoba Ryutaro: The victim in this case...is none other than Professor Yujin Mikotoba! Judge: What?! Mikotoba: Well... To be written off by one's own child... Ryutaro: Father, you, you seem suddenly so much older...and wearier than you were mere moments ago... Mikotoba: Because of you, clearly! The judge is asking for the victim's name. The person who was killed in this case. Look through the information in the Court Record again. Carefully. Before you kill me, for mercy's sake! Ryutaro: (Oh dear... I simply can't ignore that disapproving look.) Your Excellency! Please allow me to amend my answer! Judge: ...Very well. I will excuse this incorrect response given your wide-eyed state of panic. Leads back to: \"What is the name of the victim in this case?\"Jezaille Brett Ryutaro: Leads to: \"The name of the victim who lost her life in this case...is Miss Jezaille Brett!\"Ryutaro: The name of the victim who lost her life in this case...is Miss Jezaille Brett!Auchi: .........Rei: Jezaille Brett...Mikotoba: A name that will never be forgotten in the courtrooms of our country, I'm sure.Judge: Correct. And being a member of our empire's judiciary, you will be well aware of the significance of that name.Ryutaro: ...!Judge: So...let me pose another simple question. As you know, Miss Brett was a visiting student from the Empire of Great Britain. Why, then, is her name indelibly associated with our own empire's judicial history?Mikotoba: Obviously, you won't have forgotten that case from nine months ago. But if it's proving hard to recall the finer points, everything you need is included in the Court Record.Ryutaro: (Obviously, I still remember. That was the start of everything.) Jezaille Brett... Behind the woman's student persona was the face of...A victim Ryutaro: ...a victim, obviously! Judge: ......... Auchi: ......... Judge: The victim's role is already taken, Counsel! As you should know! Auchi: That answer came with such misguided confidence, I was almost taken in! Ryutaro: I thought it sounded a little odd! Mikotoba: ...Leave me out of this. Check the Court Record, and find the correct answer to the question of Miss Brett's true identity. You'll find it in the 'People' section. Judge: That won't do, Counsel. Amend your answer before we have any more victims to contend with. Ryutaro: Yes...of course! ...Your Excellency! Leads back to: \"Behind the woman's student persona was the face of...\"Queen Victoria Ryutaro: ...Queen Victoria, obviously! Judge: ......... Auchi: ......... Judge: Obviously not! Auchi: The Queen of England?! Studying overseas? Ryutaro: I thought it sounded a little odd! Mikotoba: ...Leave me out of this. I'm sure you know all the details of the case in question from nine months ago. Ryutaro: Oh yes! How could I forget? I know every last detail about it. Mikotoba: Then what on earth was that absurd answer you just gave? Judge: No more absurdity, please, Counsel. You will amend your answer. Ryutaro: Yes, of course, Your Excellency! (...Did they both have to call my answer absurd?) Leads back to: \"Behind the woman's student persona was the face of...\"A killer Ryutaro: Leads to: \"Nine months ago, a visiting professor of medicine at the Imperial Yumei University was killed.\"Ryutaro: Nine months ago, a visiting professor of medicine at the Imperial Yumei University was killed. And the culprit was...Jezaille Brett.Mikotoba: Yes... She was a killer...Judge: At the time, our country had just signed a new treaty with the Empire of Great Britain. And it was in the midst of this delicate diplomatic situation that the incident occurred. An Englishman, Dr John H. Wilson, was shot dead. I believe he was an associate of yours, Professor Mikotoba?Mikotoba: Yes, I was indebted to the man. He'd been my mentor when I went to London to study forensic medicine. Indeed, it was I who invited him here to Japan as a visiting professor at the university. Naturally, the murder of an Englishman on our soil was a matter the government wished to resolve rapidly.Judge: Indeed it was. Which is why a secret trial was conducted here at the Supreme Court. A student of the Imperial Yumei University was arrested on suspicion of murder. A second-year English language student by the name of... Ryunosuke Naruhodo. With the help of his best friend, a student lawyer, the accused conducted his own defence... ...and exposed the despicable crime committed by Miss Jezaille Brett. Miss Brett eventually admitted to her crime. However, when questioned about the motive that drove her to take Dr Wilson's life... ...she gave no satisfactory answer before the trial reached its conclusion.Auchi: Immediately after the trial, the British government brought its consular jurisdiction into play. We were unable to sentence Miss Brett according to our empire's laws. It was decided that she would be removed to Shanghai, China, instead.Ryutaro: Why Shanghai?Mikotoba: There's a British consular court there.Judge: Correct. I oversaw the negotiations personally. The date of her transfer to Shanghai was finally settled upon only last week. All that remained of our empire's obligations was to see the woman safely on board a steamship.Auchi: And yet, the very day before her departure... The Englishwoman was killed!Ryutaro: Only the day before?!Judge: That will do. I'm satisfied that the counsel for the defence is sufficiently capable of representing the defendant.Ryutaro: Oh! Thank you, Your Excellency! (Over the first hurdle...)Judge: Now, a summary of the incident, if you please. Prosecutor Auchi...Auchi: As is your wish...Your Excellency. The repugnant crime took place on the 11th August, in broad daylight. On the outskirts of the imperial capital, under a bright blue sky, at a secluded bathing spot by the sea... The incident occurred inside a small beach hut, erected for bathers to rest or change their clothes. The cause of death was a single stab wound to the posterior abdomen that pierced the victim's lung. An injury which proved fatal. There were two persons alone together in the beach hut at the time of the victim's death: Miss Brett, in her bathing attire, and the accused, Rei Membami! Accordingly, there can be no doubt of the accused's guilt! Especially when we consider she had a powerful motive! The police arrived rapidly at the scene and promptly arrested the young lady.Ryutaro: .........Judge: ......... Well... ...that extraordinary description of events leaves me somewhat lost for words, I must say.Ryutaro: (That's certainly true. The prosecution's summary... ...was full of words that raise an awful lot of questions. As a lawyer, I really ought to pick up the prosecution counsel on what he said about...)The bathing spot (before clearing all other options) Ryutaro: Um, if I may...Prosecutor Auchi... Auchi: What do you want? You fresh-faced, young yokel student! Ryutaro: I wonder... Could you explain, please? You mentioned a 'bathing spot'... Auchi: Hah! My apologies. Clearly my modernity has confused the poor country bumpkin's simple mind. 'Bathing spots' are the very latest trend in health practices from the West. We are told...that bathing in the water of the ocean is curative, therapeutic and excellent for the skin's- Ryutaro: No, that's not what I meant. I was referring to the fact that Miss Brett had, to all intents and purposes, been found guilty of murder. Why would a known criminal have been relaxing by the sea? Auchi: ......... For old times' sake, I believe. Ryutaro: Sorry? Auchi: Miss Brett was to depart for Shanghai the following day. Her 'final wish', as it were, was to enjoy a day at our country's wonderful coast. And the British embassy put extreme pressure on our government to comply. Ryutaro: But, but on what grounds would we agree to such a request? Mikotoba: Because, as usual, our government is unable to stand up to foreign powers. In matters of diplomacy, it seems we don't even have the courage to decline the whims of a known criminal. Auchi: D-Don't look at me, Professor! It was the government who granted permission, not I! In any case, it was decided that with a dedicated detective on duty, nothing could go wrong. Ryutaro: ...But in fact...a murder took place. Auchi: I, I said don't look at me! It was that young student girl who did it, not I! Ryutaro: No one has proved that yet! Mikotoba: ...I wouldn't provoke the man if you don't need to. Ryutaro: (Hm, at this stage, I need to gather more information, I think.) Leads back to: \"As a lawyer, I really ought to pick up the prosecution counsel on what he said about...\"The bathing spot (after clearing all other options) Ryutaro: Um, if I may...Prosecutor Auchi...

Leads to: \"I believe we all have a clear picture of the incident now.\"Being alone together (before clearing all other options) Ryutaro: Um, Membami-san... Rei: Yes, what is it, Susa- I, I mean, um... Naruhodo-san! Ryutaro: (I'm really starting to wish we'd made my alias Ryutaro Susato...) Please tell the court why exactly you were present at the bathing spot with the victim in the first place. And why you were alone with her. Rei: Oh! Well! No! That's not true! It wasn't like that at all! There were other people present. A detective who was guarding Miss Brett for starters! I was just asked to accompany Miss Brett as a companion, that's all. Auchi: But let us be clear! At the moment of her death, you were alone together with the victim in the hut. You and no one else! Ryutaro: ...! Auchi: The truth is, there is only one reason why this young woman accompanied Miss Brett on her bathing sojourn: It was the accused's last chance to take the victim's life! Rei: No! Auchi: Because, as we know... ...the following day would see Miss Brett extradited to the British authorities in Shanghai. And the accused would never have an opportunity to dispatch her again. Ryutaro: Kindly refrain from conjecture, Counsel! Auchi: ...Tsh huh huh... Mikotoba: ...The prosecution counsel seems to enjoy using provocative tricks like that. But for now at least, we need to assemble more facts... Try not to let him goad you. Susato: (Oh dear... This is really terrifying. But Father's right. We need more information.) Leads back to: \"As a lawyer, I really ought to pick up the prosecution counsel on what he said about...\"Being alone together (after clearing all other options) Ryutaro: Um, Membami-san...

Ryutaro: Kindly refrain from conjecture, Counsel! Auchi: ...Tsh huh huh... Leads to: \"I believe we all have a clear picture of the incident now.\"A powerful motive (before clearing all other options) Ryutaro: You're clearly exaggerating! 'Powerful motive' is a blatant overstatement! Auchi: Tut tut tut. Is the yokel boy using long words he doesn't fully understand? Ryutaro: I beg your pardon? Auchi: ...No matter. Let us put this to the accused, shall we? Membami-san, you are a research assistant at the Imperial Yumei University, I believe? Rei: Yes! I am! I'm working with Professor Mikotoba in his laboratory at the moment! Mikotoba: I can confirm that. The defendant is an excellent assistant with a strong sense of responsibility. Auchi: Fascinating to hear. Now, another question... Prior to your work with Professor Mikotoba...whose research were you assisting then? Rei: Oh! Um...well...erm... I was studying under Dr John H. Wilson. Judge: Dr...Dr Wilson?! The visiting English professor who was murdered by Miss Brett nine months ago? Auchi: The accused had a deep-seated respect for her former mentor, Dr Wilson. ...Is that not true? Rei: ...Yes. Dr Wilson was a wonderful man. Auchi: Interesting. Then tell the court what deep-seated feelings you had towards the Englishwoman who killed him. Rei: Well, obviously I was filled with hatred for what she'd done! A powerful hatred! Ryutaro: Oh no! Rei! Be careful of what you're saying! Rei: Ah. Auchi: The motive...was revenge. ...Plain and simple, Your Excellency. Judge: Hmmm... Mikotoba: Well, it was clearly a trap all along. Ryutaro: How wicked of him to use Rei's undying respect for her former mentor against her like that. (I must find out more details, and something we can use to bolster our defence...) Leads back to: \"As a lawyer, I really ought to pick up the prosecution counsel on what he said about...\"A powerful motive (after clearing all other options) Ryutaro: You're clearly exaggerating!

Leads to: \"I believe we all have a clear picture of the incident now.\"Judge: I believe we all have a clear picture of the incident now.Mikotoba: Despite her guilt being determined nine months ago... ...Miss Brett managed to avoid incarceration, instead continuing her research work at the university. Obviously, over that period, she and Rei would have encountered each other on a number of occasions.Ryutaro: Seeing the murderer of the mentor for whom she had such great respect enjoying such undeserved liberty...Mikotoba: Yes, even if it was only temporary until Miss Brett's extradition to Shanghai... ...you can hardly blame Rei for her feelings of anger and resentment.Ryutaro: (Poor Rei...)Auchi: So, Your Excellency...if you'd be so kind as to peruse this exhibit. A photographic print that shows the scene of the crime immediately following the grim incident.Judge: Yes, thank you, Counsel. A tragic image.Auchi: As you can clearly see, there is nowhere within the hut that anyone else could have hidden.Judge: The court will accept this photographic print as evidence.The photograph of the crime scene has been entered into the Court Record.Judge: As I understand it then, the victim and the defendant were alone inside the beach hut at the time. This is deeply troubling, I must say. The finger of guilt points firmly at the defendant.Auchi: Well, Your Excellency...naturally the prosecution has much more to its case.Ryutaro: ...!Auchi: We intend to prove the accused's appalling actions beyond all possible contention. To that end, I can confirm that we have multiple witnesses to the crime, and damning evidence.Ryutaro: W-Witnesses? But, but who...?Rei: .........Auchi: One of whom, I might add, is a highly respected police detective. I assure you...the testimony of these witnesses will leave no room for doubt!Ryutaro: Ugh!Judge: Very well then, Counsel. Bring forth your witnesses.Auchi: ......... I, Taketsuchi Auchi, have been waiting for this moment.Ryutaro: Sorry?Auchi: Oh yes, I haven't forgotten. That trial nine months ago, here in this very courthouse... ...when that irreverent little student boy...utterly humiliated me!Auchi: ARRRRRRGH! Ryunosuke Naruhodo!Ryunosuke: Wha- Yes?Auchi: This insult to the Auchi family name... will NEVER be forgotten!Kazuma: You've become conceited with age, Counsel. But the old have to stand aside and make way for the new. It's the way of the world. ...May you never forget that!Auchi: 'Strike the head of a samurai whose topknot has been cut, and the bell of cultural enlightenment tolls.' Yes, on that fateful day...my former self died.Ryutaro: The start of your own mini Meiji Revolution! Are you modernising as well, Counsel?Auchi: Silence! Since I swore revenge back then, there has been a minor miracle atop my head. Observe, the Auchi growth! You see? You see this seed of hope sprouting forth from the barren expanse of my crown?Ryutaro: (I, I think that tiny growth is trying to tell me something!)Rei: Um... ...I'm afraid I can't really see. Where, where is the hope exactly?Auchi: I said silence! Today, I face another yokel student of the Naruhodo clan. Well...I will vanquish you! And my victory will be fertiliser for the seed of hope atop my head! ...You have been warned. With that...the prosecution calls the witnesses to the stand!Mikotoba: ...It looks like the stakes are high on both sides in this trial. The prosecution and defence each has much to lose.Ryutaro: A haircut is hardly comparable to Rei's life!Auchi: Witnesses, please state your names and occupations for the court.Hosonaga: Chief Inspector Satoru Hosonaga, Imperial Police Bureau. I'm in disguise, obviously, so I can go undetected.Soseki: And I am... Well, the next big thing in books. An author renowned throughout the capital, in fact. Yes... Soon to be sold out! The satirical 'I Am a Cat'! A sensational success! By Soseki Natsume!Ryutaro: Oh my goodness!Soseki: Struggling student from the provinces, please... You needn't be in awe of me.Ryutaro: I needn't?Soseki: It's only natural that you'd feel nervous in my presence. But all of you, please, relax. Call me Soseki, even.Ryutaro: Um...yes... (What on earth is Soseki-san doing here?)Mikotoba: Tread carefully, Susato. That author fellow knows you from your time in London, doesn't he? If he exposes you for who you really are, this will be over before it's begun.Ryutaro: Yes... Yes, of course. I know. (I presume Soseki-san won't have forgotten about me. I could certainly never forget him. Although he does seem to have changed somewhat in the six months or so that it's been since I last saw him. And as for Inspector Hosonaga... That amazing outfit is... hard to believe.)Hosonaga: ...Do I have something on my face?Ryutaro: (Well, your glasses for one. Although they don't seem to be helping you see... Thank goodness he hasn't recognised me either.)Hosonaga: Ah, I suppose it's this disguise, is it? I thought that appearing here in the clothes I was wearing at the time would make for a more faithful testimony. It is my guiding principle to carry out all testimonies flawlessly.Judge: Hm, well, I can appreciate why an Imperial Police Bureau detective might have been present... ...but what business did a writer such as yourself have being at the scene, Soseki-san?Soseki: Ah, well, you see... ...I had been asked that day to give a lecture. On the morning of the incident...in the Imperial Yumei University's Grand Lecture Hall no less.Ryutaro: At...Yumei University?Soseki: After the lecture, I had a very pleasant conversation with a researcher from the medical science department. The professor over there, in fact.Ryutaro: With my fath- With Professor Mikotoba?!Mikotoba: Yes, that's right. It was arranged by one of the newspapers. They wanted some story or other about two former students who'd studied in Great Britain.Soseki: Of course, being a renowned author, the press never leave me alone. They secretly spy! Snap shots! Scribble stories! And scupper my privacy!Ryutaro: Haah...Soseki: As you can see, the conversation was written up in this newspaper here. Read it at your leisure, my provincial, struggling student friend. I have plenty of copies.Ryutaro: Thank you very much! (He practically threw that paper at me.)The Soseki Natsume article has been entered into the Court Record.Soseki: Anyway, following my interview with the professor... ...the lady in question appeared and made a very unexpected announcement. 'I should like to go with everyone to see your country's coast!' Those were her words.Mikotoba: As I explained before, Miss Brett was never taken into custody. She continued to work in my laboratory, under strict surveillance, of course.Auchi: At which utterance, the university immediately contacted the government to seek guidance. And the response was, 'Permit Miss Brett to go as long as a detective accompanies her.'Hosonaga: That detective, I am at liberty to divulge, was me, Chief Inspector Satoru Hosonaga.Auchi: Thereby the entire party departed cordially for the seaside, it seems.Hosonaga: It was extremely challenging to clear all other members of the public from the vicinity of the beach. But fortunately, I am at peak physical fitness at the moment, so... ...I was able to carry out my duty flawlessly.Ryutaro: Oh my! Inspector, you... Well, you do have something on your face now.Hosonaga: Ah, how unsightly. I do apologise.Ryutaro: Does that mean that you went to the beach too, Father?Mikotoba: No no. Fortunately, I had work to finish off. But unfortunately, of course... ...it meant that, as my assistant, Rei was invited to take my place.Soseki: Of course, being a renowned author, I didn't like to decline the invitation. AGH, BUT IF ONLY I HAD! I'D NEVER HAVE SEEN THAT AWFUL SIGHT!Relentlessly Racked by Remorse and Regret!Judge: Very well. I must now ask you to present your formal testimony to the court. You will give an account of all that you witnessed on your impromptu excursion to the coast.Hosonaga: Of course, Your Excellency...Soseki: ...Relentlessly racked by remorse and regret, I am...Witness Testimony - The Witnessed Scene -Hosonaga: On the day of the incident, I was ordered on a special surveillance assignment in this disguise.Soseki: I'd just managed to catch that crab when I suddenly heard a caterwaul from behind me.Hosonaga: I ran into the beach hut at once, where I found the pair in question.Soseki: YES YES YES! That young girl was astride the Englishwoman, dagger in hand, as she stabbed wildly!Hosonaga: I saw blood on the blade. It proved to me that she'd stabbed the victim multiple times.Judge: Indeed... It does appear from this testimony that both witnesses here present saw it. The very moment...of this heinous crime!Ryutaro: What?!Auchi: Now...if you will recall, I promised evidence as well. What phrase did I use again? ...Ah yes, that was it: 'damning' evidence.Judge: Hm, what have you there, Counsel? A so-called 'fountain pen', is it?Hosonaga: Correct, Your Excellency. I found it at the scene whilst examining the body. It appears that in her dying moments, with her final ounce of strength... ...the victim clutched a piece of evidence that would positively identify her killer.Ryutaro: What?!Auchi: Your Excellency, if you would cast your eyes over the photographic print of the crime scene once more...Judge: ......... Ah! Goodness me! Yes, the victim is clearly grasping something quite deliberately there in her hand!Hosonaga: That's right. The fountain pen. And if you would kindly examine the pen, Your Excellency...Judge: ......... Ah! The owner's initials have been engraved into the ebonite barrel! 'R.M.'... Rei Membami... The initials of the defendant!Ryutaro: Ah... NOOOOOO!Judge: This fountain pen will be admitted immediately as critical evidence!The fountain pen has been entered into the Court Record.Auchi: So...have I omitted anything? Decisive testimony and damning evidence... There's a bright blue sky outside the courthouse today. Perfect weather to ascribe guilt, I feel.Ryutaro: (I, I don't understand. The Prosecutor Auchi of nine months ago... ...had none of this man's poise!)Judge: Counsel for the Defence...you may begin your cross-examination now.Ryutaro: .........Judge: Naruhodo-san!Ryutaro: Naruhodo... That...means... Oh! Yes! Me!Judge: Is there another Naruhodo in my courtroom?Ryutaro: (Actually, there isn't even a single Naruhodo in your courtroom...)Mikotoba: Cousin Ryutaro...pull yourself together, please.Ryutaro: (Alright, I've seen this countless times as a judicial assistant. Find inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies to prove that they're lying somehow. That's all there is to it. That's how a real lawyer would handle a cross-examination. So let's see what I can do!)Cross-Examination - The Witnessed Scene -Hosonaga: On the day of the incident, I was ordered on a special surveillance assignment in this disguise.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: In that...jaunty disguise? Hosonaga: Correct. ......... Wait! No! I mean, it wasn't the first time I've worn this swimsuit for a dip in the ocean. It's tried and tested. 'Do what must be done to keep the Englishwoman under surveillance.' Those were my orders that day. Ryutaro: And this tried and tested outfit was the answer? Hosonaga: Being able to blend flawlessly into a crowd is an important part of a detective's job. I submerged myself in the salty water leaving only Mr Turtle floating inconspicuously on the surface. Mr Turtle loves the water. Ryutaro: ......... But there was no need for you to blend into the background on this assignment really, was there? Mikotoba: If that made you late arriving on the scene, I think perhaps you had your priorities wrong. Hosonaga: ......... Ahem. ...Ahem. Ryutaro: (Perhaps I shouldn't pursue this line of questioning any further at the moment...)Soseki: I'd just managed to catch that crab when I suddenly heard a caterwaul from behind me.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: Ah, you're describing the victim's scream, presumably, Soseki-san? Soseki: In more literary terms, you might say it was a scream that could have pierced the heavens. 'KYAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!' ...Or the like. Of course, that's just a metaphor. We renowned authors are wont to describing things so. Ryutaro: (Soseki-san wasn't at all like this in England...) Soseki: Anyway, I spun around at the noise and the beach hut immediately fell under my gaze. Ryutaro: Yes, the beach hut... Hosonaga: The area is popular with government ministers. Many have seaside retreats there for rest and recuperation. Locals are prohibited from entering the area, so it's always very quiet. The beach hut is a simple structure, erected as a place for people to change or take refuge from the sun. Soseki: Although, the Englishwoman commandeered the hut for herself... ...which meant that I was forced to change into my swimwear on the sand. Ryutaro: Ah. I imagine that was rather embarrassing for you. Soseki: Well anyway, I tossed the crab aside and headed for the beach hut at a run. Or, in more literary terms... I decrabbed and beetled off hut-wise!Hosonaga: I ran into the beach hut at once, where I found the pair in question.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: Wait, by 'pair', you don't mean to say...? But how could that be? Hosonaga: No no, you misunderstand! Obviously, I mean the victim and the defendant, Rei Membami-san. Ryutaro: ...Oh. It would have been helpful if you could have just said that from the outset. Hosonaga: ...If you jump to conclusions, you have to expect to fall flat on your face sometimes. Auchi: Dear me, pinning your hopes on such an outside chance. Foolish. Very foolish. Ryutaro: (It really was an outside chance. I just wish I'd realised that before I said something silly.) Auchi: So, Inspector, why don't you tell the court how exactly you found the aforementioned pair in the hut. Hosonaga: Well, it was a sorry sight. A really grisly scene. I parted the noren curtain hanging in the doorway and stepped inside, only to see... ...the defendant leaning menacingly over the lifeless body of the victim sprawled on the sand! Ahem! Ahem, ahem, ahem! My glasses very nearly cracked at the ominous sight that met my eyes. Auchi: How thoroughly appalling. Ryutaro: Ugh... (He doesn't appear to be lying here...) Well, Soseki-san, can you confirm what Inspector Hosonaga is saying, I wonder? Soseki: Ah... You'd like a literary man's opinion?Soseki: YES YES YES! That young girl was astride the Englishwoman, dagger in hand, as she stabbed wildly!Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: 'Stabbed wildly'? You actually saw her do it? Soseki: Oh, indeed. The terrible spectre! The terrapin inspector! The bloody torrent! The author's torment! Ryutaro: EEEEEEEEEEEK!!! Soseki: Every sight and every sound is still carved in my melancholy memory! That was my impression, at least...as a future literary sensation. Auchi: Counsel! What on earth was that shrill, effeminate scream? Ryutaro: Oh! N-No! ...Ahem! No. What are you insinuating? I'm as manly a Japanese man as you! Mikotoba: I wonder if I might interject here, Soseki-san. Something you said is troubling me. 'That was my impression' were your words just now, I believe. Soseki: ......... Ryutaro: Ah! So...do you mean to say... ...you're not confident that you really did see what you've described? Soseki: ......... NO! I mean, YES! I mean, I KNOW WHAT I SAW! My ears didn't deceive me when I heard that scream. Hence my eyes didn't deceive me, either! I could describe everything I saw vividly! I could publish it all in tomorrow's newspaper serial! Auchi: It sounds as though the next instalment of 'I Am a Cat' may take a macabre turn. Mikotoba: I think this is a fool's errand. The more we press your author friend on what he saw, the more entrenched he's going to become. Ryutaro: Oh dear... How awkward.Hosonaga: I saw blood on the blade. It proved to me that she'd stabbed the victim multiple times.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: She was stabbed multiple times...? How can you be sure of that? Hosonaga: Very simply. From the blood on the blade. Ryutaro: The...blood? Hosonaga: When I entered the hut, I saw the defendant holding the blade raised up in the air. Soseki: YES! YES! That's right! I saw it too! Ryutaro: Oh... Hosonaga: And I noted that there was blood on the blade already at that point. In other words, the victim had already been stabbed at least once by the time I arrived on the scene. Soseki: YES! YES! That's right! I saw it too! Hosonaga: And the victim was already holding the defendant's fountain pen in her hand, too. All of which means I can be sure...the victim did not die instantly. Soseki: YES! YES! Right! Saw it too! Ryutaro: (Maybe a year in London was too much for him. He sounds like he's forgotten how to speak Japanese.) Mikotoba: The logic of your argument is sound at least. Hosonaga: Well, as I said, it is my guiding principle to carry out all testimonies flawlessly. Ryutaro: Perhaps it should have been your guiding principle to protect the victim flawlessly? That's just my personal opinion, of course. Hosonaga: ......... Ahem! Ahem! Ahem, ahem! Judge: Counsel! You will refrain from mocking the witness!Present Post-Mortem Report Ryutaro: Leads to: \".........\"Ryutaro: (Oh no... I just have so many thoughts whirling around in my head... It's all I can do to stand here, wide-eyed and mute...)Mikotoba: Goodness, my dear. You really must try to calm down.Ryutaro: But how am I supposed to find an inconsistency in what these two gentlemen are saying? I don't see why either of them would have any reason to lie.Mikotoba: What you must remember, I think, is that witnesses may inadvertently lie at times. For various reasons: a misunderstanding, a mistaken observation, a delusion, even...Ryutaro: Ah...a delusion...Mikotoba: What's important is that we determine the truth. And there's only one sure way to do that.Ryutaro: Yes...with evidence, of course.Mikotoba: Spoken like a true judicial assistant. During witness testimony, you can use [R / R1 / E] to pick a piece of evidence to 'Present' for consideration. So you need to listen carefully to each statement, and compare what's said to the details in the Court Record. If you find some conflicting information, that may be the inconsistency you're looking for.Ryutaro: (Yes, it's all about inconsistencies...)Mikotoba: Once you've identified a witness's statement that appears to conflict with a piece of evidence... Present the evidence to the witness with [X / \u25b3 / R], and the way ahead will present itself to you, I'm sure.Ryutaro: Yes! (Alright, then... I'll consider the details of all the evidence in the Court Record against each statement to find an inconsistency. I hope I'm up to the task...)Mikotoba: Don't forget that you can have the witnesses repeat their statements as many times as you like. Everyone has to start at the beginning, remember. So those wide eyes are quite forgivable. And besides...there's no one else to defend the poor girl.Ryutaro: You're right! (I need to listen to the testimony again from the start.)Ryutaro: ......... (With that accusatory cry that just welled up from deep inside me, I think I finally understand... Every time Kazuma-sama and Naruhodo-san have stood here at this bench... ...the stakes have been very, very high, indeed!)Auchi: Wh-What's the meaning of that menacing pose, Counsel?Ryutaro: I'd like the witness to clarify something for me.Soseki: Who? What? Where? When? Hooooooooooow?!Ryutaro: Not you, Soseki-san. This query is directed at Inspector Hosonaga.Hosonaga: ...! At me?Ryutaro: In your statement just now... ...you said that the victim was stabbed multiple times.Hosonaga: Yes, that's right. As I said, when I entered the hut... ...the defendant was already standing over the victim, bloody knife in hand, like a murderous demon.Ryutaro: And yet...that cannot be.Hosonaga: What?Judge: Get to the point please, Counsel.Ryutaro: In the post-mortem report, it clearly states... ...that the victim was stabbed one time only.Judge: Ah!Auchi: Nnnf!Ryutaro: In other words...Inspector Hosonaga's testimony... ...is clearly flawed!Hosonaga: Agh!Ryutaro: And Soseki-san!Soseki: M-M-Me?!Ryutaro: You claim to have seen Membami-san in the throes of stabbing the victim.Soseki: Y-Yes... Yes, I did... WILDLY!Ryutaro: But both you and the inspector confirmed the same point: That there was already blood on the knife that you saw the defendant holding.Hosonaga: Yes... And...?Ryutaro: It's quite simple. We know the murder weapon was used to stab the victim only once. Therefore... ...there is no way there could have been blood on the knife if that single stabbing hadn't already occurred.Soseki: ARGH! TRUE!Judge: Then what exactly is your contention, Counsel? Are you ever going to tell us?Ryutaro: Yes, Your Excellency. There's only one logical conclusion. What Soseki-san in fact saw was not the moment that the defendant stabbed the victim at all... ...but the moment that the defendant in fact...withdrew the blade from the victim's body!Soseki: That, that can't... ...BEEEEEEEEEEEE!Mikotoba: Excellent work, Susato! You exploded at them with that objection, and then proceeded to pull them apart systematically.Auchi:Auchi: Tsh huh huh... Well well, this takes me back.Ryutaro: ...!Auchi: Yes, I seem to remember your cousin staged a scene much like this in that trial nine months ago. A half-witted child with a half-baked objection attempting to steal the show.Mikotoba: You're right. There were certain similarities. Except that so-called 'half-witted child' managed to outwit the prosecution...who has only half a head of hair.Auchi: Slander! My head is quite adequately dressed! In any case, all this talk of stabbing and withdrawing and multiple wounds... ...it makes not a jot of difference!Ryutaro: What? Why not?Auchi: Engage your brain, young man! When the accused first plunged the deadly weapon into the victim, that was the fatal blow. And it was that moment, just as she had withdrawn the blade ready for her next strike, that the witnesses saw. The knife was already tainted with blood, because the accused had already stabbed the victim!Ryutaro: Ah!Auchi: All you have successfully shown with your little display... ...is that the moustached author is prone to moments of extravagance!Ryutaro: AAAAAAAAAGH!Judge: I am in agreement with the prosecution. If the defendant was seen wielding the blade at all... ...that is sufficient grounds for her actions to be viewed with suspicion.Ryutaro: But, but if she was withdrawing the blade...Auchi: ...Then we are back where we started!Ryutaro: Sorry?Auchi: Consider this, young yokel boy... If the student girl is innocent as you claim... ...then why would she have pulled the blade from the victim? And with a demon's cold-blooded composure, too. The prosecution demands an explanation! ...And it had better be good.Ryutaro: Why did Rei pull out the knife...?Mikotoba: Ah, yes... Going for the jugular.Ryutaro: Hm? (What does Father mean by that?)Judge: Let the court hear your answer then, Counsel.Ryutaro: (The truth is, I don't really know. But I have to come up with a plausible reason here, or we don't have a case.) The reason why the defendant pulled the knife blade out of the victim's body was surely so she could...Stab her again Ryutaro: Hm, well, this is only one possible answer, but... ...could it have been so she could stab the victim again? Judge: Pardon? Ryutaro: Isn't there a saying? If someone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the left also. Mikotoba: Susa- Ryutaro! What are you saying?! Or rather, what are you doing? Do you realise what a hole you're digging? Ryutaro: Ah! AAAAAAGH! (It must be the pressure of being here. I'm starting to say things I don't mean...) Auchi: Quite a slap in the face for the woman you represent. You yokels and your heavy-handed ways! Ryutaro: N-No, I didn't... That, that was just an example! A mere musing! I didn't mean that's what happened! Judge: I suggest you take a moment to consider your answer next time. ...Before you speak, Counsel. Ryutaro: Ugh... Yes, Your Excellency... Thank you for allowing me another chance. Leads back to: \"The reason why the defendant pulled the knife out of the victim's body was surely so she could...\"Save her life Leads to: \"According to the post-mortem report, the victim's death was not instant.\"Hide the knife Ryutaro: I think...it was possibly so that she could hide the murder weapon. Auchi: Auchi: And yet the murder weapon was left there, thrust into the sand at the scene. Ryutaro: ......... Having pulled the knife from the victim, she couldn't find a place to hide it, so that was her only option, perhaps? Judge: ......... I think, Counsel... ...that you were ill-advised with your answer initially. And you were further ill-advised to pursue it. Ryutaro: Oh dear! I'm terribly sorry! (...This job is not to be taken lightly. There's just so much pressure.) Mikotoba: Just because you're under pressure doesn't mean you can say the first thing that comes into your head. Ryutaro: I'd, I'd like to revise my answer, Your Excellency! Leads back to: \"The reason why the defendant pulled the knife out of the victim's body was surely so she could...\"Ryutaro: According to the post-mortem report, the victim's death was not instant.Hosonaga: That's correct. It's thought she would have remained conscious for a short while after sustaining the injury.Auchi: Indeed, giving her the time to take hold of this piece of evidence that clearly indicates her killer.Ryutaro: The, the point is... ...being a medical research assistant, Membami-san was compelled to act when faced with the wounded victim. Instinctively, she pulled the blade out in an attempt to save Miss Brett's life!Auchi: .........Judge: .........Mikotoba: .........Auchi: Tsh huh huh! Did you hear that, Your Excellency? It would seem this is the best we can expect of this young yokel.Judge: Hmmm... Indeed.Ryutaro: (Ugh... Is it just me, or does it suddenly feel much colder in here?)Hosonaga: ...Your Excellency, if I may?Judge: Speak, witness.Hosonaga: I would like another opportunity to testify. In respect to the slipshod assertion just put forward by the yokel defence counsel, I mean.Ryutaro: S-Slipshod?Auchi: Tsh...huh...huh... An excellent idea, Inspector. Our young yokel hopeful has a modicum of knowledge when it comes to the law, it seems... ...but in matters of medicine, he appears to possess not one iota of common sense!Judge: Very well, Inspector. I will permit your request. You will testify again before the court. On the subject of the defence counsel's assertion.Hosonaga: Yes, sir. I will do so flawlessly.Witness Testimony - Forensic Medicine Primer -Hosonaga: Pulling a blade from a wound without thinking could cause heavy bleeding. That's basic knowledge that any medical research assistant with an ounce of sense ought to know. In other words, there's no good reason why the defendant would have tried to pull the knife from the victim. Let's not forget that the young student did have a motive for killing the victim. The man the victim murdered nine months ago, Dr Wilson, was the defendant's highly respected mentor.Ryutaro: Is, is what you just said true, Inspector? Could pulling a knife from a wound really cause the wound to bleed heavily?Hosonaga: Yes. Think of the weapon itself as a stopper in the wound that prevents excessive blood loss. Until a doctor is ready to provide proper treatment, that stopper shouldn't be removed.Ryutaro: Oh, I... I see...Auchi: Hah! This is why yokels should stay on the farm. Even a quack from some obscure mountain village would have such basic knowledge. Anyone who's ever given someone a little poke with a knife and pulled it out again knows it!Ryutaro: Oh...well...I've never stabbed anyone, you see. Or pulled a blade out of a wound, so...Mikotoba: Of course you haven't. I didn't bring you up to behave like a bandit.Ryutaro: Father, is it true, what they're telling me?Mikotoba: Yes, it's basic remedial knowledge for medics. Rei would have been well aware of it. If she were to claim ignorance of such fundamentals, that would prove fatal in many ways.Ryutaro: But then...why would Rei have done it? Could she have pulled out that knife in full knowledge that it would be fatal for Miss Brett?Mikotoba: ...I don't know.Ryutaro: (Rei never once mentioned anything about the knife to me. It seems almost impossible to believe, but... ...could my friend actually have...?)Mikotoba: Susato!Ryutaro: Y-Yes?Mikotoba: Pull yourself together! We mustn't lose sight of why we're here.Ryutaro: (Ah!)Judge: Counsel, it's time for your cross-examination.Ryutaro: Oh...yes, Your Excellency!Judge: However... ...I must warn you that if your cross-examination fails to identify any issue with the established facts... ...I will be moving to my adjudication immediately afterwards.Ryutaro: ...I understand. (Believing in your clients and fighting for their cause until the bitter end... I knew it would be hard, but...I had no idea it would be this hard!)Cross-Examination - Forensic Medicine Primer -Hosonaga: Pulling a blade from a wound without thinking could cause heavy bleeding.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: You say doing it without thinking could be a problem... Does that mean that if you used due care and attention it would be alright? Hosonaga: I wouldn't have thought this needed spelling out, really, but... ...the blade is like a stopper in the wound. Remove it, and a serious haemorrhage will occur. In other words, a medic would need to be present before any attempt was made to withdraw the blade. Doing it without thinking would be madness. You just can't do it. Ryutaro: Oh! Well...thank you for such a thorough explanation. Auchi: You see, Counsel? When you act without thinking, the result is a bloodbath. Ryutaro: Ugh... Judge: Back to the witness testimony, please.Hosonaga: That's basic knowledge that any medical research assistant with an ounce of sense ought to know.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: In that case, there's an obvious explanation here. Hosonaga: ...Which is? Ryutaro: Clearly...the defendant, Rei Membami-san, does not possess an ounce of sense! Hosonaga: ......... What do you think about that, Professor Mikotoba? Mikotoba: I'm not sure that you should be labelling your best friend as lacking in common sense. Ryutaro: Well, I thought it would be better than labelling her as a murderer. Auchi: I don't know, young people today... If that's friendship, I don't understand it. Judge: Careful, Counsel. A lack of common sense can be a very dangerous thing. Ryutaro: (Oh dear... That recoiled on me rather badly.) Mikotoba: That's life, I'm afraid. A lesson everyone must learn. Hosonaga: Hopefully you can see now that this is really basic medical knowledge. Being involved in medical research, Membami-san would certainly have been aware of it.Hosonaga: In other words, there's no good reason why the defendant would have tried to pull the knife from the victim.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: But the defendant had suddenly encountered somebody she knew lying on the ground, bleeding to death. The sight could have shocked her delicate sensibilities, causing her to remove the blade inadvertently. Hosonaga: I really don't think 'inadvertent' actions can explain this. The woman is a medical research assistant. I can't imagine she would behave so irrationally. Ryutaro: Oh, but irrational behaviour is a woman's prerogative, isn't it? Hosonaga: Oh dear...you have a lot to learn about women. Only a small-minded man could have such bigoted views. Ryutaro: (Oh dear...perhaps I'm letting my male persona take hold a little too much...) Hosonaga: Well...have I managed to convey the basics now? That should cover the medical side of the argument.Present Poison Article Ryutaro: Leads to: \"No. There is one possibility.\"Hosonaga: Let's not forget that the young student did have a motive for killing the victim.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: Whatever the motive, it just isn't in Membami-san's nature to do something so awful! Hosonaga: But she had both motive and opportunity. That's very hard to argue against. Ryutaro: But you don't know the defendant! Auchi: Auchi: And you, Counsel, do not appear to know the law! Ryutaro: ...! Hosonaga: Yes, evidence is the only way to convince the court of your argument. Not feelings. Auchi: With this...fledgling to defend her, I would almost say I pity the accused. Ryutaro: (So do I...) Judge: Inspector, you will reiterate your point about the defendant's motive, please. Hosonaga: Ah, yes. Miss Brett was in many ways the sworn enemy of Membami-san.Hosonaga: The man the victim murdered nine months ago, Dr Wilson, was the defendant's highly respected mentor.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: Well...yes, that's true. Dr Wilson recognised Membami-san's talent and offered her the position of assistant despite her being a woman. She was extremely grateful to him. Hosonaga: Yes, the Englishman appears to have been a very broad-minded individual. Mikotoba: Dr Wilson had no time for outdated traditions. He met with opposition of course, but he believed firmly in Membami-san's abilities. Hosonaga: Clearly the defendant was in the man's debt. Which only serves to prove my point.Ryutaro: (This is hopeless! I can't find a single crack in this testimony anywhere! If Rei knew that withdrawing the knife from the wound would threaten Miss Brett's life further... ...I just can't think of any way to explain why she did it.)Mikotoba: Susato. It's at times like these when it's especially important to remember the fundamentals.Ryutaro: The fundamentals?Mikotoba: Evidence is what counts in the courtroom, isn't it?Ryutaro: Of course! But I've been through the Court Record dozens of times already!Mikotoba: I think perhaps you're forgetting something, though. You needn't take the evidence at face value. You can and must examine it in greater detail, too.Ryutaro: Ah!Mikotoba: I realise this is your first time playing the role of lawyer in the courtroom. So if you need reminding of the rudiments, you need only ask. I'll do my very best to help.Ryutaro: (Examine the evidence in the Court Record...? It's an idea, certainly. What should I do?)Ask for a refresher Ryutaro: Yes, Father...Spartan guidance is what I need! Mikotoba: I, I think that might be overdoing it slightly, but... Very well. So, open the Court Record first of all with [R / R1 / E]. Now, let's take a look at the fountain pen which was submitted as evidence most recently. Simply press [A / X / space] to 'Examine' it further. That's all there is to it. Ryutaro: Yes, the initials 'R. M.'... There they are, clearly engraved on the barrel. Mikotoba: By using [right analog stick / arrow keys], you can look at a piece of evidence from all angles. You should have a good look at everything to make sure you haven't missed any clues. Ryutaro: Yes! I will! (I just need to rotate the pen with [right analog stick / arrow keys] and watch closely for anything out of the ordinary, then...) Examine emblem on finial Ryutaro: There's some sort of emblem here, look. But...it isn't a Yumei University one! Mikotoba: It must belong to some other organisation, I suppose. A business of some kind... But that would seem to imply that the pen doesn't in fact belong to Rei. The details of the fountain pen have been updated in the Court Record. Examine emblem on finial (subsequent times) Ryutaro: There's some sort of emblem here, look. But...it isn't a Yumei University one! Mikotoba: It must belong to some other organisation, I suppose. A business of some kind... But that would seem to imply that the pen doesn't in fact belong to Rei.I know what to do Ryutaro: (Come to think of it... ...Kazuma-sama and Naruhodo-san were always turning evidence over and over in their hands. Yes, I need to 'Examine' things in greater detail with [A / X / space]...) Mikotoba: Ah...by the look in your eyes, I see it's coming back to you. Go through the Court Record again and have a thorough look at everything. You may just find a clue. Ryutaro: Yes! I'll do it straight away!Examine evidence Soseki Natsume Article Front page Ryutaro: 'Raucous England Returnees Tell All'... This is the interview with you and Soseki-san, is it, Father? It looks as though it was quite an exchange. Mikotoba: Yes, he became a little over-animated when he was talking about his time in England. The photographer managed to capture the moment his hand karate-chopped me on the neck. Ryutaro: I do hope you weren't hurt. Back page Ryutaro: (This is the newspaper from Soseki-san. There seems to be an important article on the back page as well...) 'Exclusive! Deadly Poison Stolen from Yumei Medical Research Laboratory!' From Yumei's Medical Research... Father, isn't that your lab? Mikotoba: What the...? Let me see that! The, the poison's been stolen?! Ryutaro: It's this morning's paper that Soseki-san gave us. Are you saying...you didn't know? Mikotoba: ...As embarrassing as that is for the head of the laboratory, I didn't. I've not heard any such thing. Where on earth could the reporter have gleaned his information? Ryutaro: Come to think of it... ...there was no article mentioning this story in our paper this morning, was there? Mikotoba: It's a highly toxic poison we've been working on in the strictest confidence. I'd put Rei in charge of the project. Ryutaro: Rei! She was managing it? Mikotoba: If what's written here is true... ...it means that she tried to hide the theft from me. And moreover...the details were leaked somehow. Ryutaro: I, I don't believe it! Mikotoba: We need to read this article very carefully. The article about the poison has been entered into the Court Record. Back page (subsequent times) Ryutaro: 'Exclusive! Deadly Poison Stolen from Yumei Medical Research Laboratory!' I can't believe you knew nothing about this, Father. Mikotoba: Nothing was reported to me. It seems an attempted cover-up was at play. Ryutaro: This is extraordinary... Mikotoba: What I'd really like to know is...how a reporter found out about it. Well, however it happened... ...I have to take full responsibility. There'll be serious consequences for sure. Ryutaro: Oh, Father... Fountain Pen Lid Ryutaro: If we take off the pen's lid... Barrel Ryutaro: Now let's unscrew the barrel, shall we? Inkwell Ryutaro: This must be the little reservoir that holds the ink. Mikotoba: Yes, you fill it by drawing ink from a bottle up through the nib. ......... Ryutaro: Is something wrong, Father? Mikotoba: Just that there doesn't actually appear to be any ink in there, that's all. Ryutaro: Oh yes, you're right. It's pretty much empty. (Well, it could be on the verge of running out, I suppose...) The details of the fountain pen have been updated in the Court Record. Inkwell (subsequent times) Ryutaro: This must be the little reservoir that holds the ink. Mikotoba: Yes, you fill it by drawing ink from a bottle up through the nib. ......... Ryutaro: Is something wrong, Father? Mikotoba: Just that there doesn't actually appear to be any ink in there, that's all. Ryutaro: Oh yes, you're right. It's pretty much empty. (Well, it could be on the verge of running out, I suppose...) Emblem on finial (if not already examined yet) Ryutaro: There's some sort of emblem here, look. But...it isn't a Yumei University one! Mikotoba: It must belong to some other organisation, I suppose. A business of some kind... But that would seem to imply that the pen doesn't in fact belong to Rei. The details of the fountain pen have been updated in the Court Record. Emblem on finial (subsequent times) Ryutaro: Well, we know for certain that this emblem isn't that of Yumei University. Mikotoba: The police really ought to have spotted that. Ryutaro: They were obviously convinced of Rei's guilt from the outset. Initials Ryutaro: The 'R. M.' initials are very clearly engraved here. Mikotoba: And the fact that Miss Brett was clinging to this pen in her dying moments is very clearly a message, too. Ryutaro: To identify her killer, you mean? Mikotoba: I don't think there can be any doubt that this is a key piece of evidence in this case. Initials (subsequent times) Ryutaro: The 'R. M.' initials are very clearly engraved here.Ryutaro: No. There is one possibility. One very good reason why the defendant might have decided to withdraw the knife from the victim's wound!Hosonaga: What?!Auchi: Hah! The yokel not only has a poor grasp of the law, but is also a poor loser! Tell us, then! What 'possibility' do you think you've identified?Ryutaro: It's here...in this newspaper article. An article about a deadly poison having been stolen from a laboratory at the Imperial Yumei Uni-Auchi:Auchi: The victim perished from a stab wound. Poison has no relevance in this case!Ryutaro: But...Judge: Prosecutor Auchi. You will let the defence speak.Auchi: But, but a newspaper article! The court cannot rely on the kind of hearsay those wretched publications carry.Judge: Counsel for the Defence... ...I am going to need some tangible basis for your claim. You will indicate to the court precisely what part of the newspaper article mentioned affirms your assertion.Auchi: Your Excellency!Ryutaro: Yes, of course. ...Thank you! (Rei would never have done something to further endanger Miss Brett's life without just cause.) The reason why the defendant pulled the knife from the victim's body is explained in the article where it says...'Poison Stolen from Laboratory!' Ryutaro: The poison was apparently stolen from a medical research laboratory at Yumei University. Judge: Yes, it would seem so. Calling the department's security practices into question. Auchi: The very department of the professor standing so nonchalantly opposite me, I believe. Mikotoba: Agh! Susa- Ryutaro... Ryutaro: Oh! Yes, Father? Mikotoba: Was there some reason you felt it necessary to highlight the fact that the theft occurred in my department? Ryutaro: ......... How can I explain it...? It was the first detail I cast my eye over...I suppose... Mikotoba: I suggest you read the article again. Carefully! Ryutaro: I'm so sorry! (Oh dear. Father's fuming...) Leads back to: \"The reason why the defendant pulled the knife from the victim's body is explained in the article where it says...\"'Deadly in Tiny Quantities!' Leads to: \"The article reveals the following property about the poison in question:\"'Why is the Poison Being Developed?' Ryutaro: According to the article, the development of the poison was requested by the military. Judge: Hmmm... Yes, a troubling revelation indeed. Ryutaro: Oh, it's very worrying... Auchi: And yet, even more worrying... ...is how this yokel is trying to manipulate the court with nothing more than rumours! Ryutaro: AAAAAAGH! (But I feel sure Rei had a good reason for her actions. And I feel sure the explanation is somewhere in this newspaper article!) Mikotoba: Try reading the article again. Ryutaro: Yes! Leads back to: \"The reason why the defendant pulled the knife from the victim's body is explained in the article where it says...\"Ryutaro: The article reveals the following property about the poison in question: When the toxin enters the body on a knife laced with the poison, it's rapidly absorbed and causes death in minutes.Hosonaga: Are, are you suggesting...?Ryutaro: If the knife used to attack Miss Brett was laced with this very poison... ...it would explain why the defendant, Membami-san, would have withdrawn the blade as soon as possible. ...Yes, the truth is... ...it was an attempt to stop the poison from entering the victim's body!Hosonaga: WHAT?!Auchi:Auchi: This is complete and utter nonsense!Ryutaro: Not at all! The defendant withdrew the knife blade from the victim's body not to accelerate the woman's demise... ...but to save her life! And the prosecution cannot deny the possibility!Auchi: Have you not read the post-mortem report? The cause of death was haemorrhage! The word 'poison' appears nowhere in the document!Ryutaro: Well, well that's... That's because by acting quickly to remove the blade, the defendant prevented the poison from taking hol-Auchi:Auchi: Oh please! This is clearly desperation! The weasel's last breaking of wind! Poison has nothing whatsoever to do with this case, as I believe the defence is well aware! We have no proof that the information in this wretched newspaper article is at all reliable anyway.Hosonaga: In that situation, what the student should have done is wait for medical assistance to arrive. But instead, you claim she suspected poisoning and took the potentially lethal decision to remove the blade. She must have had a strong reason for her suspicions then, or the argument makes no sense.Auchi: Exactly! Well put, Inspector! On what grounds did she do it, hm, yokel?Ryutaro: (Why DID Rei suspect the stolen poison was involved...?) If you want grounds... I'll give you grounds.Hosonaga: What?Auchi: You...you can't possibly...Judge: From your expression, Counsel, it would appear those are not empty words.Ryutaro: .........Judge: But naturally, as you stand in this courtroom as a lawyer, you must be aware... ...that words alone, empty or not, are of no value in our modern justice system. The court demands evidence.Ryutaro: Yes, Your Excellency. (I'm well aware of that. I've seen it many times...from my place at his side in the Old Bailey.)Judge: In that case, Counsel, you will present the proof to the court now. What evidence demonstrates a clear link between this case and the poison in the newspaper article?Present Post-Mortem Report Ryutaro: Leads to: \"I would ask the court to refer to the 'Notes' section of the post-mortem report, which reads:\"Present anything else Ryutaro: Judge: ...How exactly would you explain this piece of evidence's connection to the newspaper article? Ryutaro: In truth...I'm not really sure. But my father always taught me to ask my elders whenever I was in trouble. So I thought I should ask your opinion, Your Excellency. Judge: If it is advice you seek, Counsel, then I suggest that before indiscriminately thrusting evidence under my nose... ...why not thrust it under the nose of the professor at your side? Ryutaro: ...I think he means you. Mikotoba: Good grief, thrusting that under MY nose isn't going to solve anything here! We must use our heads. The article in the paper had details of the toxin. Now, where have we seen similar details... Does nowhere come to mind? Ryutaro: Ah, you mean I ought to search through all the evidence looking for that? Judge: If I'm not mistaken, it appears the advice of your elders has given you an idea. Ryutaro: Yes! I'd like another chance to present evidence, if I may, Your Excellency. Leads back to: \"In that case, Counsel, you will present the proof to the court now.\"Ryutaro: I would ask the court to refer to the 'Notes' section of the post-mortem report, which reads: 'Extreme miosis - pupil constriction - was observed in the victim.'Hosonaga: ...Ah!Ryutaro: Clearly, being a yokel with no knowledge of forensic science, I have no idea, so please, do tell me... Presumably, the fact that this condition of the victim was noted in the post-mortem report... ...means that it's an unusual symptom of death?Auchi: ...Tsk! Well...Hosonaga: Under normal circumstances, the pupils dilate when someone dies. If there was extreme constriction instead...that's most certainly unusual, yes.Auchi: What are you doing, you yokel detective?!Ryutaro: In the newspaper article, there's the following information about the stolen poison: 'Onset of symptoms occurs in minutes...ending with acute contraction of the pupils prior to death.'Auchi: What?!Ryutaro: If the defendant, upon seeing the victim stabbed in the back... ...happened to notice that the pupils of Miss Brett's eyes had constricted severely...Mikotoba: ...Yes, as a medical research assistant, she would have suspected poison immediately. Without doubt.Auchi: Hnnn...grrr...Ryutaro: Prosecutor Auchi! I think you'll agree...this is very compelling evidence!Auchi: Tsk! You... You... Yokel student and yokel professoooooor!!!Judge: I believe the defence has expertly demonstrated a credible reason for the defendant's actions.Auchi: No...Judge: Yujin Mikotoba...Mikotoba: Yes, Your Excellency?Judge: I believe you are best placed here to confirm or deny the veracity of the defence counsel's argument. You will tell the court the truth about the details reported in this newspaper, please.Mikotoba: ......... It pains me to have to admit it... ...but I'm afraid I don't know.Judge: You don't know?Mikotoba: The toxin was kept under lock and key in my laboratory, certainly. But I was unaware of any theft.Judge: Do you mean to tell the court that the reports of this theft are unfounded?Mikotoba: No, Your Excellency. Without returning to the laboratory to investigate myself, I couldn't say.Auchi: Hah! Listen to the bumbling academic! Unaware of the theft of secret state research from his own workplace until he reads of it in the newspaper!Mikotoba: ...I take full responsibility for the incompetence of my supervision.Ryutaro: Father...Auchi: Tsk! A pitiful situation for a university professor. You should have more control over your students... rather than allowing them off on killing sprees!Ryutaro: That's, that's totally unfounded-???:Rei: None of this is Professor Mikotoba's fault! It's all... It's all MY fault!Ryutaro: Rei...Judge: Membami-san! You stand accused here! Outbursts like this will not be tolerated!Rei: ......... But...it was me. I was the one who noticed that the poison we were developing had been stolen that day.Judge: What?!Ryutaro: So you knew...Rei: I'd, I'd been placed in charge of overseeing the project. It was the day that the professor and Soseki-san were interviewed together for the newspaper. That's when I noticed that some of the poison was missing. Just a tiny amount, it was.Mikotoba: Why didn't you let me know immediately?Rei: ......... I...I was scared. The whole project was supposed to be confidential, but some of the toxin had somehow been taken... So...I decided I'd try to get it back before anyone else found out. Because I had a very good idea who the thief was!Ryutaro: The thief... You, you don't mean...?Rei: Yes, of course. It was that dainty Englishwoman!Judge: Miss Jezaille Brett?Rei: That's why I decided to join the little group of people going to the seaside. Inside the beach hut, I confronted Miss Brett. But she just sat on a stool at the back of the hut, smiling sweetly at me as if she knew she was untouchable.I know it was you who stole the poison!Well now... whatever do you mean?Rei: And then... ...she suddenly got to her feet... ...before falling to her knees in front of me and...then collapsing on the floor.Ryutaro: ...!Rei: That's when I saw the knife in her back. I couldn't understand what had just happened. And then...a moment later, I was seized with fear. The pupils of her eyes had... They'd shrunk to tiny pinpoints.Mikotoba: I don't believe it...Judge: In other words, you realised that the victim was suffering the effects of the stolen poison.Rei: My mind started racing... I hadn't seen anything pass Miss Brett's lips whilst I'd been with her. Which left only one possible way for the poison to have entered her body.Ryutaro: On the blade of the knife in her back...Judge: And that train of thought was what spurred you to withdraw the blade.Rei: Yes. If the amount that had entered her bloodstream was small enough, she might still have a chance... That's what I hoped. Really... I... I'm so sorry for staying silent all this time!Ryutaro: .........Auchi: .........Judge: ......... Your attempt to hide the truth of what happened is not something that can be overlooked. However, I have duly noted the courage with which you confessed in the end.Rei: ...Thank you, Your Excellency!Ryutaro: (It's barely perceptible, but I do think... ...the balance has shifted a little here in this courtroom now.)Auchi:Auchi: Your Excellency, do not be deceived! The victim just collapsed before your eyes, you say? Well, Membami-san, if that is the case, perhaps you could explain how Miss Brett came to be stabbed?Rei: Well, um...Auchi: You have no answer because the simple truth...is that YOU stabbed the victim motivated by revenge!Ryutaro:Ryutaro: But you have no conclusive evidence to prove that assertion, do you?Auchi: ......... Oh, I have evidence. And it is very much conclusive!Ryutaro: ...! (What's the prosecution counsel up to...? It was brief, but he hesitated for a moment there, I'm almost sure of it...)Judge: You will produce the aforementioned evidence at once, Prosecutor Auchi.Auchi: ......... Perhaps some praise is due, young yokel student.Ryutaro: What?Auchi: I had imagined there would be no need for me to submit this evidence. But you've brought this on yourself!What the...?Could a more damning shot exist?The cruelty in the air on that beach is almost palpable...Auchi: This evidence, more than any other, reveals the true extent of the accused's murderous nature. For it shows the precise moment that Membami-san plunged her dagger into the victim's back!Rei: No, that's not true! No!Ryutaro: I, I don't believe it... AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!Judge: Order! Order! Order! Counsel for the Defence, was it you who was responsible for that shrill scream that just pierced my courtroom?Auchi: Perhaps his voice has yet to break? These yokels are slow of mind and slow to mature.Ryutaro: (I'll show you who's slow to mature...)Mikotoba: Careful now. Susato is starting to show her face here.Judge: It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words. And here we have ample proof. The court will accept this extremely cogent photographic print as evidence.The incriminating photograph has been entered into the Court Record.Ryutaro: (I can't believe he's had a photograph like that up his sleeve the entire time. It's such a stark image, I'm genuinely lost for words...)Rei: Wait a minute! I, I don't understand. How did you...? I mean, who took that photograph?!Ryutaro: ...! (Rei...)Auchi:Auchi: That's of no importance here. Stop trying to divert attention!Rei: Oh...Ryutaro:Ryutaro: That's an absurd thing to say! It's crucially important! Whoever took this photographic print was a witness to Miss Brett's death! The court must be allowed to hear this person's testimony!Auchi: Argh!Judge: I will uphold the defence's demand. The prosecution will reveal the identity of the person responsible for taking this photograph at once!Auchi: ......... Well...I'm afraid I can't do that.Ryutaro: Pardon?Auchi: You see, this print arrived at the Imperial Police Bureau headquarters by express post yesterday. But there was nothing to indicate the sender's name or address. The provenance of the print is unknown.Judge: Goodness...Ryutaro: Are we to understand then, Counsel... ...that in full knowledge of the fact that this photograph has the murkiest of origins... ...you nevertheless believe it fit for submission as evidence in the Supreme Court?Mikotoba: When you first produced that print before, I noticed that you hesitated for a brief moment. Because you knew that it wasn't completely reliable evidence, didn't you?Auchi: Silence...you yokel student and blabbering professor! What matters is the blatant truth that this print so eloquently expresses.Ryutaro: But the defendant has already admitted to pulling the blade from the wound. Clearly this isn't the moment that the knife was plunged into the victim's back, but-Auchi: The moment it was withdrawn? Don't waste this court's time with your ramblings!Judge: Indeed. Without knowledge of who produced this print, we have no means of verifying the claim. And the scene it captures is without doubt the most compelling evidence presented to the court. If the defence is unable to shed any further light on the matter, I believe the conclusion is clear.Ryutaro: Oh no!Mikotoba: Susato... This is the time for you to fight. If what you've established so far is true, then there can be no doubt... ...this photograph shows the moment that Rei withdrew the blade from the victim.Ryutaro: ...! (Yes, we just need to prove that somehow...)Auchi: Tsh...huh...huh... You'll have plenty of time to rue your defeat on the slow train back to the provinces. And to rue the day you came up against Taketsuchi Auchi in a court of law!Ryutaro: (If I can't determine who took this photograph, then the trial is going to come to an end. There must be a clue somewhere. There must be some way of working out who took it!)Judge: Well, Counsel?Ryutaro: ......... Your Excellency... The burning question is who took that photograph. And the truth is...I don't know Ryutaro: ......... (No... If I give up now... ...I'll never be able to look Rei in the eye again!) Mikotoba: Susato, you need to steel yourself and summon your best argument. Ryutaro: I'll do my best! Leads to: \"This isn't about whether I can or can't come up with the answer now...\"I have the answer Leads to: \"This isn't about whether I can or can't come up with the answer now...\"Ryutaro: (This isn't about whether I can or can't come up with the answer now... I simply have to!) The identity of the person who took this dramatic photographic print... ...is, I assure you...something the defence can and will reveal!Auchi: Wha...? No... You can't possibly! But as you so boldly claim that you can...please, do enlighten us!Ryutaro: Unfortunately, I'm unable to present a name.Auchi: How utterly underwhelming. Did you really believe you could-Ryutaro: However! I am able to present evidence. The defence has a piece of evidence that reveals important details about the photographer's identity.Auchi: Wha...?Judge: Very well then, Counsel. Present your proof to the court. Which piece of evidence do you claim reveals something about the identity of the mystery photographer?Present Soseki Natsume Article Ryutaro: Leads to: \"What is that?\"Present anything else Ryutaro: Ryutaro: The piece of evidence in question...is this! Judge: ......... I'm afraid, Counsel, that when presenting evidence, you must learn to temper those wide, nervous eyes. Ryutaro: ......... Judge: I'm obliged to penalise you for the lack of focus in both your eyes and your answer. Auchi: Would you care to squeeze your head in your hands again, Counsel? To punish yourself for presenting such utterly irrelevant evidence. Ryutaro: Ugh! I'll squeeze my head as many times as it takes to win this trial! ...Your Excellency! May I? Judge: ...You may present another piece of evidence. But no more squeezing, Counsel. Leads back to: \"Which piece of evidence do you claim reveals something about the identity of the mystery photographer?\"Judge: What is that? The newspaper again? 'Raucous England Returnees Tell All'...Ryutaro: It's not the headline that's relevant here, Your Excellency. It's the photograph. If you look at it closely, you'll notice that there are some white lines on the right-hand side.Judge: Ah, yes, indeed. They had already caught my eye, as it happens.Auchi: Hah! What of it? A shadow of some kind, presumably. From the branches of a tree or the like.Mikotoba: There are no trees growing inside my laboratory at the university, I can assure you.Ryutaro: Now...if you look closely at this photograph...Judge: ......... ...Good gracious!Ryutaro: Yes, exactly the same pattern of lines is present on this photograph, too.Auchi:Auchi: Well... Well... That, that tells us nothing! H-Hah! Yes, it's a shadow of some kind, definitely! From the branches of a tree!Ryutaro: There wouldn't be any trees growing inside a hut at the beach, Counsel.Auchi: Nnnf!Judge: What's quite remarkable about it, is that the two patterns are absolutely identical. How could such an extraordinary similarity have transpired?Ryutaro: The curious matching pattern that appears on both photographic prints is a result of...The photographer's technique Ryutaro: I believe...the pattern may be the result of a particular quirk of the photographer when taking a picture. Auchi: You believe? Judge: What quirk could possibly produce such consistent markings? Ryutaro: Clearly, it must be a quirk that's quite unimaginable! Judge: I repeat, Counsel. What would be the nature of this quirk? Ryutaro: ......... Well, um...I... I can't really imagine, of course. Auchi: Because there is no such quirk! Mikotoba: It's time to consider another, more credible option, I think. Leads back to: \"The curious matching pattern that appears on both photographic prints is a result of...\"A camera defect Leads to: \"Obviously, it must be due to a problem with the camera used to take the photographs.\"Some tree branches Ryutaro: Clearly, the branches of a tree have caused this pattern! Auchi: Auchi: An argument I put forward myself only moments ago, to much ridicule! Judge: Indeed. ...There was considerable ridicule involved. Ryutaro: Well... It's hard to think of another explanation. Auchi: Well then...'hard' luck! Mikotoba: You pointed out yourself that no trees would be growing inside a beach hut. Ryutaro: Oh dear... Sorry... (What was I thinking?) Mikotoba: It's time to consider another, more credible option, I think. Leads back to: \"The curious matching pattern that appears on both photographic prints is a result of...\"Ryutaro: Obviously, it must be due to a problem with the camera used to take the photographs.Auchi: With, with the photographic device...?Mikotoba: Yes, we can confidently say that the camera's lens must be scratched. And that the scratched lens causes unwanted lines to appear on every print taken with the device.Ryutaro: In short... The two photographs under consideration here... ...were taken with the same camera!Auchi: Hnnngh... Hnnnnnngh... B-But... ...there must be hundreds of such camera devices here in the capital! It would be utterly impossible to identify the owner of this particular one!Ryutaro:Ryutaro: I think you're forgetting, Prosecutor Auchi... ...that one of the photographs featured in a newspaper article.Auchi: A newspaper... Ah!Ryutaro: That's right. The author of that article is the mystery witness to this crime!Auchi: Wha... WAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!...Menimemooooooh!Judge: I, I see why you were called a 'raucous England returnee'...Auchi: What are you yelling about? You've already testified!Soseki: It's Menimemo, I tell you! MENIMEMO!ME...NI...ME...MO!Ryutaro: Um...Soseki-san...what was that? Did you say 'Menimemo'?Soseki: ...Ever since I returned to Japan... ...a reporter from the Shoyu News has been hounding me, following my every move! A reporter by the name of Raiten Menimemo. Yes, hounding me from dawn till dusk!Ryutaro: Ah! (Now that he mentions it...)Soseki: They secretly spy! Snap shots! Scribble stories! And scupper my privacy!Ryutaro: (Could that same reporter be...?)Soseki: A camera to the left of him! A notebook to the right! There I am, stuck in the middle with... Raiten Menimemo!Judge: So you're saying that this picture was taken by-Soseki: By MENIMEMO! YES! ...My Lord, Your Excellency, Esquire!Judge: Officer! Find this newspaper reporter at once and bring him to my courtroom! We will adjourn for a short recess in the meantime.Ryutaro: Oh... Yes, Your Excellency!Auchi: As, as you say, Your Excellency...Judge: And one more thing... I want this knife - the murder weapon - examined for traces of poison! You will solicit the assistance of the imperial university's medical department for the task. ...Understood?Auchi: ......... Meh... Menimemooooooh!!!To be continued...13th August, 10:41 a.m. Supreme Court of Judicature, Defendants' Antechamber 3Rei: ...I'm so sorry, Susato. I should have told you about the toxin.Susato: Rei...Rei: .........Mikotoba: You have a strong sense of responsibility, I know. That's why you decided to shoulder the burden alone.Rei: No! That's not it at all! I... I was just... I was scared of my failure coming to light, that's all. So I hoped to retrieve the substance from the Englishwoman before anyone found out.Mikotoba: .........Rei: Before the trial started, do you remember what you said, Susato? That you had no doubt in your mind about my innocence. That you'd stand by me to the last.Susato: ...I remember.Rei: And yet I... I didn't deserve your trust in me. I hid important details from you, Susato. I completely betrayed your faith in me. Hit me, Susato! I deserve it! No, in fact, throw me to the floor! No, that's too good for me as well! Drag me through the city streets!Susato: ...I'm no better, you know.Rei: Oh!Susato: Even though in my heart I knew that you'd pulled the knife blade from Miss Brett's back... ...there was just a brief moment when, in my mind... I doubted you.Rei: Susato!Susato: I'm sorry. After I stood here and promised you that I'd stand by you and always be on your side... I betrayed your faith in me, too. And as such, I've failed you as a lawyer.Rei: Oh no no...Mikotoba: I think this situation has taught both of you a valuable lesson. Placing your unbridled faith in another is no easy task.Susato: ...Yes, Father. That fact has certainly struck home. Which is why I can see more clearly now. So...Rei...Rei: Yes?Susato: Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?Rei: ......... Oh, Susato... ...you know you'll always be a gallant, dashing lawyer in my eyes now!Susato: (Oh, Rei...)Rei: ......... I was so scared, you know, when it happened. I didn't know what was going on. The Englishwoman was sitting at the back of the hut, listening to what I was saying.I know it was you who stole the poison!Well now...whatever do you mean?Rei: And then a moment later... ...she suddenly got to her feet... ...before collapsing on the floor in front of me...with a knife in her back.Rei: It all happened right before my eyes.Susato: And...you were the only people in the hut at the time?Rei: That's right. Just Miss Brett and myself. There was no one else. So I just don't understand how she could possibly have been stabbed like that.Mikotoba: Hm... A great mystery indeed.Rei: I still can't believe it happened. That's why I just couldn't bring myself to speak up.Susato: ......... It will be alright. However it happened, and whatever really went on by the sea that day... ...I promise you that I'm going to prove everything you've said you saw is true!Mikotoba: Spoken like a true Mikotoba. Now, I think we should discuss what's coming up in the trial, don't you? We don't have much time. We must make sure we have our facts in order.Susato: Yes! I expect the poison is going to come under close scrutiny in the upcoming proceedings. The police should hopefully have identified it on the blade by now.Rei: The trouble is, it's a completely new laboratory-synthesised blend of alkaloids. The police won't have any way of testing for it.Susato: Oh...I see...Mikotoba: Yes, without this chemical reagent, it's impossible to detect the toxin.Susato: 'Chemical reagent'?Mikotoba: I sent a colleague of mine off with some earlier to deliver to police headquarters. I think perhaps you should have some as well, though, just in case.The chemical reagent has been entered into the Court Record.Susato: .........Examine evidence Chemical Reagent Label Ryutaro: The label appears to be written in a foreign language that I don't know. Mikotoba: It's German, so your knowledge of English is going to be of little help here, I'm afraid. Ryutaro: Couldn't you just have written 'Medicine' on it in Japanese? Then we'd all be able to read it. Mikotoba: German is the international language of medicine, my dear. But yes, I can certainly see the merit in labelling the bottle in Japanese. ...Though I'm not sure 'Medicine' would be entirely appropriate...Mikotoba: What's the matter, Susato? You're suddenly very quiet.Susato: It's this newspaper article. 'Exclusive! Deadly Poison Stolen from Yumei Medical Research Laboratory!' I'm wondering how the information got out, given that it was a government secret.Rei: It was all the Englishwoman's doing!Susato: Wha...?Rei: It was when the professor and Soseki-san were being interviewed at the laboratory. That so-called English lady swanned in, and without any compunction said to Professor Mikotoba:Oh Professor, surely your guest would love to hear about your work on that substance there?Mikotoba: It put me in a very awkward position, to be frank. But Soseki-san's curiosity had been piqued, so I had little choice but to give him a cursory introduction.Susato: So then...Soseki-san knew about the poison...Mikotoba: Yes. And it's highly likely... that the reporter who was writing up the story about us would have caught a glimpse of the toxin, too.Susato: (This..Menimemo-san...) By the way, did that reporter join you all when you went to the beach?Rei: Oh... No, I don't remember the reporter being there...Mikotoba: Indeed, he shouldn't have been. I very much doubt anyone would have wanted him there.Susato: Oh?Mikotoba: A known criminal had been given permission by the authorities to bathe by the seaside. Soseki-san pointed out that inviting a reporter might be problematic, so the man was sent back to his office.Susato: Yet he obviously didn't go back. He secretly followed the party to the beach and took this very candid photograph. And then presumably he posted it, anonymously, to the police.Rei: Ah!Mikotoba: ......... Yes, that must be what happened.Susato: .........Bailiff: Counsel! We've just heard that the new witness is now ready to testify. The trial is about to resume. Please proceed into the courtroom at once!Mikotoba: It's time to steel ourselves once again, then... ...Defence Attorney Ryutaro Naruhodo.Susato: Yes! (Rei has put her faith in me now and told me everything. So I can't let her down. I have to prove that what she's telling the court is true. I have to prove what really happened that day!)13th August, 11:30 a.m. Supreme Court of Judicature, Courtroom 1Judge: I hereby call this court to order, as we reconvene to continue the trial of Rei Membami. Prosecutor Auchi, have you summoned the new witness?Auchi: ......... Before I address that question, Your Excellency... ...I have some very important news to share!Judge: Oh?Ryutaro: (What news? And why does he look so happy about it?)Auchi: During the recess, with the collaboration of Professor Mikotoba's laboratory at Yumei University... ...the police re-examined the knife that was used to end Miss Jezaille Brett's life.Judge: Excellent. I admire your rapid handling of the matter.Auchi: Oh, too kind, Your Excellency, too kind! I was merely carrying out your instructions, of course.Mikotoba: I had the reagent delivered to police headquarters by rickshaw so it would be there in good time. But judging by the man's swagger, I fear we might need to brace ourselves for the inevitable...Ryutaro: And, Counsel? What were the results?Auchi: ......... This dagger, which was so cruelly used to end the life of the victim... ...has no trace of poison anywhere along its blade!Ryutaro: Wh-What? Are you sure about that?Auchi: I would stake the reputation of the police on it.Mikotoba: Armed with the reagent, the test is extremely simple. They couldn't have made a mistake.The murder weapon has been entered into the Court Record.Auchi: In short...the accused's feeble excuse earlier... ...has been utterly destroyed!Examine evidence Murder Weapon Blood Mikotoba: Ah yes, this must be the victim's blood. Ryutaro: Oh dear... Blood is never a pretty sight, is it? I'm having to fight the urge to run it under a hot tap and get it clean. Mikotoba: You've always been fastidious about cleanliness, haven't you? Ryutaro: ...I think this is something else, Father.Ryutaro: AAAAAAAAAGH!Auchi: Now, the prosecution is ready to call the new witness.Judge: Ah, the newspaper reporter who managed to capture a photograph of the crucial moment. Good. Very well. Officer, bring in the witness!Ryutaro: (No trace of poison on the knife... But if that's really the case... ...how could the toxin have entered the victim's body?)Auchi: Witness, please state your name and occupation for the court.Menimemo: Raiten Menimemo of the Shoyu News. I'm what people like to call a journo!Ryutaro: What's a 'journo', Father? Do you know?Mikotoba: It's simply a contraction of 'journalist'.Menimemo: I'm there where the news breaks, putting pen to paper to catch those scoops so they're in print the next morning! They don't call me the hero of the herald for nothing! The nice guy of news!Ryutaro: Oh! So, um...it was you who took this photograph, was it?Menimemo: ......... Well well, what have we here?Ryutaro: I'm, I'm sorry?Menimemo: Ooh, brace yourselves, people! Menimemo senses a scoop in the offing! 'Female student up to foul play defended by curiously handsome young lawyer in Supreme Court...' The readers will lap this up! We'll set it above the fold at 72 point in a five-leg format for the morning edition!Ryutaro: Huh?Menimemo: Right then...let's start with your name!Ryutaro: Oh, um... It's Ryutaro Naruhodo.Menimemo: Next! What made you want to become a lawyer?Ryutaro: Erm...well, um... I...wanted to reform our country's legal system, I suppose.Mikotoba: Ryutaro has suddenly become very ambitious, I see.Ryutaro: ...I just borrowed Kazuma-sama's dream for a while.Auchi: By the way, my name is Taketsuchi Auchi. That's 'Ta-ke-tsu-chi A-u-chi'... The so-called dark horse of the Supreme Court, my objections strike fear into every defence lawyer's heart!Menimemo: ......... No, the readers won't buy that.Auchi: Wha...?Judge: Witness...Menimemo: Um...yes?Judge: What this court demands to know is whether or not you were responsible for the taking of this picture? It was delivered anonymously to the Imperial Police Bureau only yesterday.Menimemo: ...Yeah, I wouldn't be a journo if I didn't click quick when presented with a scoop like that now, would I? Sometimes stories call out to me, sometimes I have to chase them down, but either way you've got to be fast! Fast legs to run with, and a fast hand to write with! It's no good if you don't note it down, I always say! That's what I call...my Menimemoism!Ryutaro: Menimemoism?Mikotoba: Ah yes...I remember your face. We met that day when you were interviewing myself and Soseki-san.Menimemo: Yes, right... That was me, Menimemo again!Mikotoba: But you were supposed to be going back to the Shoyu News offices after our meeting.Menimemo: But the scoop is, I didn't! Because that Englishwoman's words had piqued my journalistic interest.Ryutaro: Miss Brett's words?Menimemo: A criminal, left to do as she pleases, just because she happens to be a British citizen? It's horse dung! This country's judiciary is rotten to the core! The Supreme Court's rulings aren't worth the paper they're written on! The police are just imperial pawns!Auchi: Stay your tongue, young man! There are complex political issues at play!Menimemo: Hmph! Well anyway, I quickly jotted down those words she said in my Menimemo memo pad. Are you ready? I'll read it out. It's all here. Right, here goes... 'I should like to go with everyone to see your country's coast!' A serious criminal going on some junket! ...The people need to know about this! That's why I decided to sneak after them. To get the woman's story so I could hammer her in the press!Judge: Do you mean to say that you did indeed witness it firsthand? The grim scene portrayed in this photograph?Menimemo: Oh yes! I saw it with my very own journo eyes! From start to finish, through the viewfinder of my trusty camera!Judge: Thank you, Menimemo-san. You will now give a formal testimony before the court. You will state exactly what it is that you witnessed of the events surrounding Miss Brett's death.Witness Testimony - The Camera Never Lies -Menimemo: The beach hut was made of shoddy old reed screens, so there were plenty of gaps I could see inside through. The Englishwoman was sitting on a stool when the student girl came in and started arguing with her. Seconds later, the girl pulled out a knife, throwing the Englishwoman to the floor as she stabbed her in the back! My smouldering journo spirit burst into flames! Quick as a flash, I whipped out my camera ready to click! I pulled apart the rough weave of one of the screens and poked the lens through for the perfect shot.Ryutaro: Reed screens, you say?Menimemo: Right! You can see them clearly enough in that great shot I snapped. The hut walls were just screens made of coarsely woven reeds.Judge: ...Yes, it allows the breeze to pass through and bring some relief from the summer heat.Menimemo: And it was a breeze for me to poke my camera through and see the whole thing hotting up!Ryutaro: ...Ignoring for the time being the appalling invasion of privacy involved... ...did you witness everything that happened from the moment the defendant entered the hut?Menimemo: Oh yes. I saw it. I saw the whole thing from start to finish!Ryutaro: And you say that you took the photograph through a gap in one of the screens?Menimemo: Luckily for me, they were pretty shoddily woven. I pulled the reeds apart and thrust the lens of my camera through the gap! Would I get away with it? Or would I be seen? It was the gamble of a lifetime!Auchi: A tenacity of purpose that's considered admirable in a journalist, I suppose.Menimemo: 'Run a risk one day, run a scoop the next!' That's Menimemoism in a nutshell!Judge: At last... ...it would appear we have a genuine witness to this wicked crime. The evidence and testimony are extremely compelling. I believe we may be close to a verdict.Ryutaro: No!Auchi: Wonderful news, Your Excellency! Wonderful!Mikotoba: Nevertheless, it cannot be denied... ...that this testimony begs one very large question.Auchi: What question?Mikotoba: Exclusive news...a startling photograph... All the makings of an exceptional story for the reporter. Why then, was the story never published?Ryutaro: Oh! (That's right!)Menimemo: .........Mikotoba: It seems clear to me that there are circumstances at play here that are yet to be understood.Auchi: Hah! More pathetic excuses!Judge: Very well then, Counsel. Proceed with your cross-examination.Ryutaro: Yes, Your Excellency! (There's more to this reporter than meets the eye. He's keeping something about this case very close to his chest...)Cross-Examination - The Camera Never Lies -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Yujin Mikotoba\nDescription: A medical professor at the Imperial Yumei University.

But I do miss my time in England's vast capital... You know...he's flourished into a truly wonderful lawyer. I've no doubt that at this very moment, he's fighting some noble cause in court. Forgive me for taking so long to come to visit you. My life has been such a whirlwind since I returned. And no one could have predicted what has happened. Just two months after arriving home... ...I find myself faced with another awful crime. So I came here today to ask something of you. Tomorrow, I shall be standing in court. For the only time in my life... ...as a lawyer. So please...I ask for your guidance. ...Kazuma-sama.Episode I The Adventure of the Blossoming Attorney13th August, 8:26 a.m. Supreme Court of Judicature, Defendants' Antechamber 3Susato: (Here I am again after nine months... The Supreme Court of Judicature of Japan. I feel so nervous. But I must steel my nerves and find a way to compose myself.)Mikotoba: Ah good, you're here. It doesn't do for a lawyer to be late.Susato: Oh! Yes, um... Good morning, sir!Mikotoba: I hardly recognise you. You cut a fine figure, Counsel. But you look as white as a sheet. And those wide eyes aren't doing you any favours, either.Susato: Oh dear... The truth is...I'm so incredibly nervous, I feel utterly nauseated. I almost wish that I'd never been born.Mikotoba: Goodness. Not the sort of thing a father hopes to hear from his daughter, I must say.Susato: (...Yujin Mikotoba. Professor of Medicine at the Imperial Yumei University. A man who, earlier in his life, travelled to Great Britain to study the latest advances in forensic medical science. And of course...my brilliant father.)???: ...Um, excuse me... Would I be correct in thinking that you're to be my lawyer in court today?Susato: Hm... Oh! Um...yes. Yes, that's right...miss!???: Well...I, um... I want to thank you for agreeing to represent me! I swear... I swear on my life... ...it's a complete fabrication! This whole thing!Susato: (...Rei Membami. Born the same year as I, and my greatest friend. Though unusual for a woman in our time, she works at the university research laboratory, helping my father. And sadly...she's the defendant in today's trial. Accused of committing a truly awful murder.)Susato: Are you feeling alright? Since we started talking, you seem...well, to have become a little flushed.Rei: Oh my! Um...well...erm... It's just that... ...you look so gallant and dashing.Susato: Sorry?Rei: And when I fall under your intense gaze, it... Well, it makes me feel rather bashful.Susato: ......... (Goodness... I don't think she knows. She hasn't realised who I am.)Mikotoba: Wa ha ha ha ha! It would seem our little plan for this trial is going to work.Rei: Oh! What, what do you mean, Professor Mikotoba?Mikotoba: If even your best friend can't see through the disguise, I think we can relax.Rei: Disguise...?Susato: Yes... I've never tried dressing this way before, of course, so I wasn't sure how convincing it would be. But this does make me feel a little relieved, as you say, Father.Rei: F-Father? ......... WHAAAAAA?! Is, is that...? Is that you, Susato?Susato: I'm so sorry I didn't say something sooner, Rei. It's just that-Rei: NOOOOOOOOO! What are you doing? What's going on? What what what what what? That varsity uniform! That varsity cap! That varsity cape! That varsity badge! Look at you! You look for all the world just like a student of the Imperial Yumei University! A male student!Susato: ...I'm so glad you think so. It means all my preparations have been worthwhile. I woke at four this morning to make a start.Rei: But, but I don't understand. Why are you dressed like that?Susato: Well...you see...Mikotoba: It was the only way. The only way she would be permitted into the Supreme Court to take on your defence in this trial.Rei: My... My defence?Susato: ......... (Never before in my life have I felt so frustrated at having been born into this body. Courts in Japan are barred to women. We're not even allowed to set foot inside the courtroom. Despite the fact that the laws of the land apply to all people - male and female - alike...)Rei: But...women are forbidden...Susato: Just for today, I'll be leaving my true self at the courtroom door. So that I can act as your lawyer.Rei: Oh, Susato... You'd go to such lengths for me?Susato: Of course. You're my greatest friend. I just worry that I shan't be the lawyer you deserve.Rei: Oh no! I have complete faith in you!Susato: Rei...Rei: ......... It's so strange, though. I mean, you're such an accomplished judicial assistant already. And yet just because you're a woman... What a wretched reason! I mean, why shouldn't you be allowed in court?! ...You're so gallant and dashing!Susato: Um...Rei... ...please don't look at me like that, with those flushed cheeks and doting eyes.Rei: Oh! I'm, I'm sorry. It's just...you really do look so dashing...Susato: Y-Yes, you mentioned that once or twice.Mikotoba: Wa ha ha ha ha! You should be pleased. It means you look convincing as a man.Susato: I am pleased...I think. It's certainly helped to bolster my confidence today. (Rei... You're managing to put on a brave face in all this, but I can see through it. I've noticed how your shoulders are slumped and how you're trembling ever so slightly.)Rei: Susato... ...you...do believe me, don't you? I didn't do it. I, I couldn't have! I mean...murder...Susato: Of course. You have nothing to worry about. Your conscience is perfectly clean! ...Isn't that right?Rei: Yes...yes it is. Perfectly clean!Susato: I have absolutely no doubt in my mind about your innocence. Which is why I'll stand by you until the bitter end in this trial. Whatever happens...I'll always be on your side! (Because that's what it means to be a defence lawyer!)Rei: That means so much to me, Susato.Bailiff: Defendant! Counsel! Court is about to begin. Proceed to the courtroom at once!Mikotoba: You should go in at once, Rei. If you're late, the judge won't hesitate to pronounce you guilty.Rei: Oh... STAND ASIIIIIIDE!Susato: (I don't think I've ever seen her run so fast...)Mikotoba: ...Well, Susato, you've certainly surprised your father. Going to such lengths to be admitted into the courtroom, and with no prior experience of being a lawyer...Susato: There was simply no other way. That's all there is to it. But Father... ...you haven't told her, have you? I mean, I'm right in assuming that Rei doesn't know how it came to this?Mikotoba: Yes, quite right. I've kept that information from her. It would only worry her if she found out that no other lawyer would agree to take her case. I didn't want to burden her with that.Susato: And is it true? The reason why every other lawyer is refusing to take the case? Is it really because of who the victim was?Mikotoba: ......... We should be making a move now, too. As you know, law isn't my field, but I'll do what I can to support my student.Susato: Thank you, Father. (I'm Susato Mikotoba, a judicial assistant. Eight months ago, I accompanied a student of law on a study trip to Great Britain. But two months ago, due to unforeseen circumstances, I found myself back in Japan.)How many times have I wished that he were here, I wonder? Still...I have no choice now but to steel myself for the trial ahead. Wish me luck...Naruhodo-san.13th August, 9:00 a.m. Supreme Court of Judicature, Courtroom 1Judge: This court is now in session to hear the trial of Rei Membami.Auchi: The prosecution is fully ready to proceed, Your Excellency.???: .........Judge: Defence Counsel! Are you ready?Mikotoba: Yes, Your Excellency. We are ready.???: Ready!Judge: ......... Ah yes, Counsel... ...according to your registration details, your name is... erm... ...Ryutaro Naruhodo. Is that correct?Ryutaro: ......... Sorry?Mikotoba: Oh yes...I had to come up with a suitable male name for you for this little venture. So I'm afraid to say I simply put down the first name that sprung to mind.Judge: Well, Counsel?Ryutaro: Ah! Um, yes, that's right! That's me. I'm, erm... I mean... Yes! I am Ryutaro, he who has vowed to uphold the pride of the great Naruhodo clan!Judge: Ah...Mikotoba: It seems Ryutaro may need to consider how to better uphold his manly act first and not overdo it. And those wild, wide eyes aren't doing you any favours, either. Just relax, and listen...Rei: Naru...hodo...?Auchi: A fresh face in this courtroom, if I'm not mistaken. But the name 'Naruhodo'... Would that perchance be...?Mikotoba: You may be thinking of Ryunosuke Naruhodo, currently in Britain as part of a study programme. This is, um...Ryutaro: ...His cousin!Mikotoba: That's right. Ryutaro here has been studying in the provinces, but was called to the capital for this trial. I assure you, in matters of law, his knowledge rivals that of any of Tokyo's pre-eminent lawyers.Ryutaro: Any of them!Auchi: Tut tut tut. What a pitiful situation. Having been rejected by every lawyer in the capital, the accused has had to call in a country boy.Rei: How dare you?! Susato is every bit as gallant and dashing as any of your Tokyo attorneys! I won't have you making fun of her!Auchi: ...'Her'?Rei: Oh! Um, er...Ryutaro: (Please be careful, Rei...)Auchi: Tsh huh huh... What an unrefined tomboy we have here. But I wonder...is your 'gallant and dashing' lawyer up to the challenge of defending you? His wide, skittish eyes very much suggest that he is not.Ryutaro: (Ugh...I'm so nervous... Now that I'm standing in his shoes, I'm starting to understand what Naruhodo-san goes through. Like it or not, eyes are wont to flit!)Judge: The case to be heard on this day is a matter of great significance to our national interests. In fact, it would be reasonable to assume that the outcome of this trial may well affect the very future of our empire.Auchi: ...Just like the trial nine months ago. And yet for proceedings of such importance, we have this...unknown yokel by the dock? Dear me.Judge: Hmph. Perhaps this would be an appropriate moment for me to assess the defence. To determine whether you are sufficiently competent to practise in this courtroom.Mikotoba: Nine months ago, when a certain other Naruhodo stood where you're standing now... ...this same judge tested him as well. And even though he was just a student at the time - not even of law - he passed the test with flying colours. For a trained and experienced judicial assistant like you, this will be easy.Judge: So, Counsel...do you consent to answering some simple questions?Ryutaro: ......... (Alright, it's time to prove myself.) Yes, Your Excellency! (But please do make them simple!)Judge: Very well. To start with... ...you will state the name of the victim.Ryutaro: (Whew, that is simple. I couldn't forget that if I tried.) ......... Ah.Mikotoba: What's the matter?Ryutaro: (Now that I'm standing in his shoes, I'm starting to understand something else Naruhodo-san goes through. Like it or not, minds are wont to blank!)Mikotoba: It's not surprising, really. It's your first time in this position and...in that guise. Even a bright spark like you is bound to flicker and falter a little under the circumstances.Ryutaro: Oh dear...this is a dismal failure...Mikotoba: Don't fret. You need only use the knowledge you've gained as a judicial assistant to overcome the problem.Ryutaro: ...! (Of course! The Court Record!) Yes, the answer will be amongst all the key information about the case, in the Court Record.Mikotoba: That's right. Just use [R / R1 / E] to open the Court Record. Then you need to flip to the 'People' section with [R / R1 / E]. And don't take too long over it. His Excellency is watching you closely.Ryutaro: (Alright, check the Court Record with [R / R1 / E]... That's where the information I need will be!)Judge: I'm waiting, Counsel... What is the name of the victim in this case?Taketsuchi Auchi Ryutaro: The victim in this case is... Yes! Prosecutor Taketsuchi Auchi! Judge: What?! Auchi: Why the sudden triumphant cry of 'Yes!'? Are you threatening to kill me? Ryutaro: ...He seems angry. Mikotoba: And you're surprised? Did you consult the Court Record? You must look through it carefully. Ryutaro: Oh yes, I did, of course! I looked at everyone on file. And I chose the person whose features appeared to be the most deathly. Mikotoba: ...I must say...this most unusual methodology of yours leaves me almost speechless. It occurs to me with renewed certainty that reading the information carefully is vitally important. I strongly recommend it! Ryutaro: (Oh dear... I simply can't ignore that imploring look.) Your Excellency! Please allow me to amend my answer! Judge: ...Very well. I will excuse this incorrect response given your wide-eyed state of panic. Leads back to: \"What is the name of the victim in this case?\"Yujin Mikotoba Ryutaro: The victim in this case...is none other than Professor Yujin Mikotoba! Judge: What?! Mikotoba: Well... To be written off by one's own child... Ryutaro: Father, you, you seem suddenly so much older...and wearier than you were mere moments ago... Mikotoba: Because of you, clearly! The judge is asking for the victim's name. The person who was killed in this case. Look through the information in the Court Record again. Carefully. Before you kill me, for mercy's sake! Ryutaro: (Oh dear... I simply can't ignore that disapproving look.) Your Excellency! Please allow me to amend my answer! Judge: ...Very well. I will excuse this incorrect response given your wide-eyed state of panic. Leads back to: \"What is the name of the victim in this case?\"Jezaille Brett Ryutaro: Leads to: \"The name of the victim who lost her life in this case...is Miss Jezaille Brett!\"Ryutaro: The name of the victim who lost her life in this case...is Miss Jezaille Brett!Auchi: .........Rei: Jezaille Brett...Mikotoba: A name that will never be forgotten in the courtrooms of our country, I'm sure.Judge: Correct. And being a member of our empire's judiciary, you will be well aware of the significance of that name.Ryutaro: ...!Judge: So...let me pose another simple question. As you know, Miss Brett was a visiting student from the Empire of Great Britain. Why, then, is her name indelibly associated with our own empire's judicial history?Mikotoba: Obviously, you won't have forgotten that case from nine months ago. But if it's proving hard to recall the finer points, everything you need is included in the Court Record.Ryutaro: (Obviously, I still remember. That was the start of everything.) Jezaille Brett... Behind the woman's student persona was the face of...A victim Ryutaro: ...a victim, obviously! Judge: ......... Auchi: ......... Judge: The victim's role is already taken, Counsel! As you should know! Auchi: That answer came with such misguided confidence, I was almost taken in! Ryutaro: I thought it sounded a little odd! Mikotoba: ...Leave me out of this. Check the Court Record, and find the correct answer to the question of Miss Brett's true identity. You'll find it in the 'People' section. Judge: That won't do, Counsel. Amend your answer before we have any more victims to contend with. Ryutaro: Yes...of course! ...Your Excellency! Leads back to: \"Behind the woman's student persona was the face of...\"Queen Victoria Ryutaro: ...Queen Victoria, obviously! Judge: ......... Auchi: ......... Judge: Obviously not! Auchi: The Queen of England?! Studying overseas? Ryutaro: I thought it sounded a little odd! Mikotoba: ...Leave me out of this. I'm sure you know all the details of the case in question from nine months ago. Ryutaro: Oh yes! How could I forget? I know every last detail about it. Mikotoba: Then what on earth was that absurd answer you just gave? Judge: No more absurdity, please, Counsel. You will amend your answer. Ryutaro: Yes, of course, Your Excellency! (...Did they both have to call my answer absurd?) Leads back to: \"Behind the woman's student persona was the face of...\"A killer Ryutaro: Leads to: \"Nine months ago, a visiting professor of medicine at the Imperial Yumei University was killed.\"Ryutaro: Nine months ago, a visiting professor of medicine at the Imperial Yumei University was killed. And the culprit was...Jezaille Brett.Mikotoba: Yes... She was a killer...Judge: At the time, our country had just signed a new treaty with the Empire of Great Britain. And it was in the midst of this delicate diplomatic situation that the incident occurred. An Englishman, Dr John H. Wilson, was shot dead. I believe he was an associate of yours, Professor Mikotoba?Mikotoba: Yes, I was indebted to the man. He'd been my mentor when I went to London to study forensic medicine. Indeed, it was I who invited him here to Japan as a visiting professor at the university. Naturally, the murder of an Englishman on our soil was a matter the government wished to resolve rapidly.Judge: Indeed it was. Which is why a secret trial was conducted here at the Supreme Court. A student of the Imperial Yumei University was arrested on suspicion of murder. A second-year English language student by the name of... Ryunosuke Naruhodo. With the help of his best friend, a student lawyer, the accused conducted his own defence... ...and exposed the despicable crime committed by Miss Jezaille Brett. Miss Brett eventually admitted to her crime. However, when questioned about the motive that drove her to take Dr Wilson's life... ...she gave no satisfactory answer before the trial reached its conclusion.Auchi: Immediately after the trial, the British government brought its consular jurisdiction into play. We were unable to sentence Miss Brett according to our empire's laws. It was decided that she would be removed to Shanghai, China, instead.Ryutaro: Why Shanghai?Mikotoba: There's a British consular court there.Judge: Correct. I oversaw the negotiations personally. The date of her transfer to Shanghai was finally settled upon only last week. All that remained of our empire's obligations was to see the woman safely on board a steamship.Auchi: And yet, the very day before her departure... The Englishwoman was killed!Ryutaro: Only the day before?!Judge: That will do. I'm satisfied that the counsel for the defence is sufficiently capable of representing the defendant.Ryutaro: Oh! Thank you, Your Excellency! (Over the first hurdle...)Judge: Now, a summary of the incident, if you please. Prosecutor Auchi...Auchi: As is your wish...Your Excellency. The repugnant crime took place on the 11th August, in broad daylight. On the outskirts of the imperial capital, under a bright blue sky, at a secluded bathing spot by the sea... The incident occurred inside a small beach hut, erected for bathers to rest or change their clothes. The cause of death was a single stab wound to the posterior abdomen that pierced the victim's lung. An injury which proved fatal. There were two persons alone together in the beach hut at the time of the victim's death: Miss Brett, in her bathing attire, and the accused, Rei Membami! Accordingly, there can be no doubt of the accused's guilt! Especially when we consider she had a powerful motive! The police arrived rapidly at the scene and promptly arrested the young lady.Ryutaro: .........Judge: ......... Well... ...that extraordinary description of events leaves me somewhat lost for words, I must say.Ryutaro: (That's certainly true. The prosecution's summary... ...was full of words that raise an awful lot of questions. As a lawyer, I really ought to pick up the prosecution counsel on what he said about...)The bathing spot (before clearing all other options) Ryutaro: Um, if I may...Prosecutor Auchi... Auchi: What do you want? You fresh-faced, young yokel student! Ryutaro: I wonder... Could you explain, please? You mentioned a 'bathing spot'... Auchi: Hah! My apologies. Clearly my modernity has confused the poor country bumpkin's simple mind. 'Bathing spots' are the very latest trend in health practices from the West. We are told...that bathing in the water of the ocean is curative, therapeutic and excellent for the skin's- Ryutaro: No, that's not what I meant. I was referring to the fact that Miss Brett had, to all intents and purposes, been found guilty of murder. Why would a known criminal have been relaxing by the sea? Auchi: ......... For old times' sake, I believe. Ryutaro: Sorry? Auchi: Miss Brett was to depart for Shanghai the following day. Her 'final wish', as it were, was to enjoy a day at our country's wonderful coast. And the British embassy put extreme pressure on our government to comply. Ryutaro: But, but on what grounds would we agree to such a request? Mikotoba: Because, as usual, our government is unable to stand up to foreign powers. In matters of diplomacy, it seems we don't even have the courage to decline the whims of a known criminal. Auchi: D-Don't look at me, Professor! It was the government who granted permission, not I! In any case, it was decided that with a dedicated detective on duty, nothing could go wrong. Ryutaro: ...But in fact...a murder took place. Auchi: I, I said don't look at me! It was that young student girl who did it, not I! Ryutaro: No one has proved that yet! Mikotoba: ...I wouldn't provoke the man if you don't need to. Ryutaro: (Hm, at this stage, I need to gather more information, I think.) Leads back to: \"As a lawyer, I really ought to pick up the prosecution counsel on what he said about...\"The bathing spot (after clearing all other options) Ryutaro: Um, if I may...Prosecutor Auchi...

Rei: Yes, what is it, Susa- I, I mean, um... Naruhodo-san! Ryutaro: (I'm really starting to wish we'd made my alias Ryutaro Susato...) Please tell the court why exactly you were present at the bathing spot with the victim in the first place. And why you were alone with her. Rei: Oh! Well! No! That's not true! It wasn't like that at all! There were other people present. A detective who was guarding Miss Brett for starters! I was just asked to accompany Miss Brett as a companion, that's all. Auchi: But let us be clear! At the moment of her death, you were alone together with the victim in the hut. You and no one else! Ryutaro: ...! Auchi: The truth is, there is only one reason why this young woman accompanied Miss Brett on her bathing sojourn: It was the accused's last chance to take the victim's life! Rei: No! Auchi: Because, as we know... ...the following day would see Miss Brett extradited to the British authorities in Shanghai. And the accused would never have an opportunity to dispatch her again. Ryutaro: Kindly refrain from conjecture, Counsel! Auchi: ...Tsh huh huh... Mikotoba: ...The prosecution counsel seems to enjoy using provocative tricks like that. But for now at least, we need to assemble more facts... Try not to let him goad you. Susato: (Oh dear... This is really terrifying. But Father's right. We need more information.) Leads back to: \"As a lawyer, I really ought to pick up the prosecution counsel on what he said about...\"Being alone together (after clearing all other options) Ryutaro: Um, Membami-san...

'Powerful motive' is a blatant overstatement! Auchi: Tut tut tut. Is the yokel boy using long words he doesn't fully understand? Ryutaro: I beg your pardon? Auchi: ...No matter. Let us put this to the accused, shall we? Membami-san, you are a research assistant at the Imperial Yumei University, I believe? Rei: Yes! I am! I'm working with Professor Mikotoba in his laboratory at the moment! Mikotoba: I can confirm that. The defendant is an excellent assistant with a strong sense of responsibility. Auchi: Fascinating to hear. Now, another question... Prior to your work with Professor Mikotoba...whose research were you assisting then? Rei: Oh! Um...well...erm... I was studying under Dr John H. Wilson. Judge: Dr...Dr Wilson?! The visiting English professor who was murdered by Miss Brett nine months ago? Auchi: The accused had a deep-seated respect for her former mentor, Dr Wilson. ...Is that not true? Rei: ...Yes. Dr Wilson was a wonderful man. Auchi: Interesting. Then tell the court what deep-seated feelings you had towards the Englishwoman who killed him. Rei: Well, obviously I was filled with hatred for what she'd done! A powerful hatred! Ryutaro: Oh no! Rei! Be careful of what you're saying! Rei: Ah. Auchi: The motive...was revenge. ...Plain and simple, Your Excellency. Judge: Hmmm... Mikotoba: Well, it was clearly a trap all along. Ryutaro: How wicked of him to use Rei's undying respect for her former mentor against her like that. (I must find out more details, and something we can use to bolster our defence...) Leads back to: \"As a lawyer, I really ought to pick up the prosecution counsel on what he said about...\"A powerful motive (after clearing all other options) Ryutaro: You're clearly exaggerating!

Leads to: \"I believe we all have a clear picture of the incident now.\"Judge: I believe we all have a clear picture of the incident now.Mikotoba: Despite her guilt being determined nine months ago... ...Miss Brett managed to avoid incarceration, instead continuing her research work at the university. Obviously, over that period, she and Rei would have encountered each other on a number of occasions.Ryutaro: Seeing the murderer of the mentor for whom she had such great respect enjoying such undeserved liberty...Mikotoba: Yes, even if it was only temporary until Miss Brett's extradition to Shanghai... ...you can hardly blame Rei for her feelings of anger and resentment.Ryutaro: (Poor Rei...)Auchi: So, Your Excellency...if you'd be so kind as to peruse this exhibit. A photographic print that shows the scene of the crime immediately following the grim incident.Judge: Yes, thank you, Counsel. A tragic image.Auchi: As you can clearly see, there is nowhere within the hut that anyone else could have hidden.Judge: The court will accept this photographic print as evidence.The photograph of the crime scene has been entered into the Court Record.Judge: As I understand it then, the victim and the defendant were alone inside the beach hut at the time. This is deeply troubling, I must say. The finger of guilt points firmly at the defendant.Auchi: Well, Your Excellency...naturally the prosecution has much more to its case.Ryutaro: ...!Auchi: We intend to prove the accused's appalling actions beyond all possible contention. To that end, I can confirm that we have multiple witnesses to the crime, and damning evidence.Ryutaro: W-Witnesses? But, but who...?Rei: .........Auchi: One of whom, I might add, is a highly respected police detective. I assure you...the testimony of these witnesses will leave no room for doubt!Ryutaro: Ugh!Judge: Very well then, Counsel. Bring forth your witnesses.Auchi: ......... I, Taketsuchi Auchi, have been waiting for this moment.Ryutaro: Sorry?Auchi: Oh yes, I haven't forgotten. That trial nine months ago, here in this very courthouse... ...when that irreverent little student boy...utterly humiliated me!Auchi: ARRRRRRGH! Ryunosuke Naruhodo!Ryunosuke: Wha- Yes?Auchi: This insult to the Auchi family name... will NEVER be forgotten!Kazuma: You've become conceited with age, Counsel. But the old have to stand aside and make way for the new. It's the way of the world. ...May you never forget that!Auchi: 'Strike the head of a samurai whose topknot has been cut, and the bell of cultural enlightenment tolls.' Yes, on that fateful day...my former self died.Ryutaro: The start of your own mini Meiji Revolution! Are you modernising as well, Counsel?Auchi: Silence! Since I swore revenge back then, there has been a minor miracle atop my head. Observe, the Auchi growth! You see? You see this seed of hope sprouting forth from the barren expanse of my crown?Ryutaro: (I, I think that tiny growth is trying to tell me something!)Rei: Um... ...I'm afraid I can't really see. Where, where is the hope exactly?Auchi: I said silence! Today, I face another yokel student of the Naruhodo clan. Well...I will vanquish you! And my victory will be fertiliser for the seed of hope atop my head! ...You have been warned. With that...the prosecution calls the witnesses to the stand!Mikotoba: ...It looks like the stakes are high on both sides in this trial. The prosecution and defence each has much to lose.Ryutaro: A haircut is hardly comparable to Rei's life!Auchi: Witnesses, please state your names and occupations for the court.Hosonaga: Chief Inspector Satoru Hosonaga, Imperial Police Bureau. I'm in disguise, obviously, so I can go undetected.Soseki: And I am... Well, the next big thing in books. An author renowned throughout the capital, in fact. Yes... Soon to be sold out! The satirical 'I Am a Cat'! A sensational success! By Soseki Natsume!Ryutaro: Oh my goodness!Soseki: Struggling student from the provinces, please... You needn't be in awe of me.Ryutaro: I needn't?Soseki: It's only natural that you'd feel nervous in my presence. But all of you, please, relax. Call me Soseki, even.Ryutaro: Um...yes... (What on earth is Soseki-san doing here?)Mikotoba: Tread carefully, Susato. That author fellow knows you from your time in London, doesn't he? If he exposes you for who you really are, this will be over before it's begun.Ryutaro: Yes... Yes, of course. I know. (I presume Soseki-san won't have forgotten about me. I could certainly never forget him. Although he does seem to have changed somewhat in the six months or so that it's been since I last saw him. And as for Inspector Hosonaga... That amazing outfit is... hard to believe.)Hosonaga: ...Do I have something on my face?Ryutaro: (Well, your glasses for one. Although they don't seem to be helping you see... Thank goodness he hasn't recognised me either.)Hosonaga: Ah, I suppose it's this disguise, is it? I thought that appearing here in the clothes I was wearing at the time would make for a more faithful testimony. It is my guiding principle to carry out all testimonies flawlessly.Judge: Hm, well, I can appreciate why an Imperial Police Bureau detective might have been present... ...but what business did a writer such as yourself have being at the scene, Soseki-san?Soseki: Ah, well, you see... ...I had been asked that day to give a lecture. On the morning of the incident...in the Imperial Yumei University's Grand Lecture Hall no less.Ryutaro: At...Yumei University?Soseki: After the lecture, I had a very pleasant conversation with a researcher from the medical science department. The professor over there, in fact.Ryutaro: With my fath- With Professor Mikotoba?!Mikotoba: Yes, that's right. It was arranged by one of the newspapers. They wanted some story or other about two former students who'd studied in Great Britain.Soseki: Of course, being a renowned author, the press never leave me alone. They secretly spy! Snap shots! Scribble stories! And scupper my privacy!Ryutaro: Haah...Soseki: As you can see, the conversation was written up in this newspaper here. Read it at your leisure, my provincial, struggling student friend. I have plenty of copies.Ryutaro: Thank you very much! (He practically threw that paper at me.)The Soseki Natsume article has been entered into the Court Record.Soseki: Anyway, following my interview with the professor... ...the lady in question appeared and made a very unexpected announcement. 'I should like to go with everyone to see your country's coast!' Those were her words.Mikotoba: As I explained before, Miss Brett was never taken into custody. She continued to work in my laboratory, under strict surveillance, of course.Auchi: At which utterance, the university immediately contacted the government to seek guidance. And the response was, 'Permit Miss Brett to go as long as a detective accompanies her.'Hosonaga: That detective, I am at liberty to divulge, was me, Chief Inspector Satoru Hosonaga.Auchi: Thereby the entire party departed cordially for the seaside, it seems.Hosonaga: It was extremely challenging to clear all other members of the public from the vicinity of the beach. But fortunately, I am at peak physical fitness at the moment, so... ...I was able to carry out my duty flawlessly.Ryutaro: Oh my! Inspector, you... Well, you do have something on your face now.Hosonaga: Ah, how unsightly. I do apologise.Ryutaro: Does that mean that you went to the beach too, Father?Mikotoba: No no. Fortunately, I had work to finish off. But unfortunately, of course... ...it meant that, as my assistant, Rei was invited to take my place.Soseki: Of course, being a renowned author, I didn't like to decline the invitation. AGH, BUT IF ONLY I HAD! I'D NEVER HAVE SEEN THAT AWFUL SIGHT!Relentlessly Racked by Remorse and Regret!Judge: Very well. I must now ask you to present your formal testimony to the court. You will give an account of all that you witnessed on your impromptu excursion to the coast.Hosonaga: Of course, Your Excellency...Soseki: ...Relentlessly racked by remorse and regret, I am...Witness Testimony - The Witnessed Scene -Hosonaga: On the day of the incident, I was ordered on a special surveillance assignment in this disguise.Soseki: I'd just managed to catch that crab when I suddenly heard a caterwaul from behind me.Hosonaga: I ran into the beach hut at once, where I found the pair in question.Soseki: YES YES YES! That young girl was astride the Englishwoman, dagger in hand, as she stabbed wildly!Hosonaga: I saw blood on the blade. It proved to me that she'd stabbed the victim multiple times.Judge: Indeed... It does appear from this testimony that both witnesses here present saw it. The very moment...of this heinous crime!Ryutaro: What?!Auchi: Now...if you will recall, I promised evidence as well. What phrase did I use again? ...Ah yes, that was it: 'damning' evidence.Judge: Hm, what have you there, Counsel? A so-called 'fountain pen', is it?Hosonaga: Correct, Your Excellency. I found it at the scene whilst examining the body. It appears that in her dying moments, with her final ounce of strength... ...the victim clutched a piece of evidence that would positively identify her killer.Ryutaro: What?!Auchi: Your Excellency, if you would cast your eyes over the photographic print of the crime scene once more...Judge: ......... Ah! Goodness me! Yes, the victim is clearly grasping something quite deliberately there in her hand!Hosonaga: That's right. The fountain pen. And if you would kindly examine the pen, Your Excellency...Judge: ......... Ah! The owner's initials have been engraved into the ebonite barrel! 'R.M.'... Rei Membami... The initials of the defendant!Ryutaro: Ah... NOOOOOO!Judge: This fountain pen will be admitted immediately as critical evidence!The fountain pen has been entered into the Court Record.Auchi: So...have I omitted anything? Decisive testimony and damning evidence... There's a bright blue sky outside the courthouse today. Perfect weather to ascribe guilt, I feel.Ryutaro: (I, I don't understand. The Prosecutor Auchi of nine months ago... ...had none of this man's poise!)Judge: Counsel for the Defence...you may begin your cross-examination now.Ryutaro: .........Judge: Naruhodo-san!Ryutaro: Naruhodo... That...means... Oh! Yes! Me!Judge: Is there another Naruhodo in my courtroom?Ryutaro: (Actually, there isn't even a single Naruhodo in your courtroom...)Mikotoba: Cousin Ryutaro...pull yourself together, please.Ryutaro: (Alright, I've seen this countless times as a judicial assistant. Find inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies to prove that they're lying somehow. That's all there is to it. That's how a real lawyer would handle a cross-examination. So let's see what I can do!)Cross-Examination - The Witnessed Scene -Hosonaga: On the day of the incident, I was ordered on a special surveillance assignment in this disguise.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: In that...jaunty disguise? Hosonaga: Correct. ......... Wait! No! I mean, it wasn't the first time I've worn this swimsuit for a dip in the ocean. It's tried and tested. 'Do what must be done to keep the Englishwoman under surveillance.' Those were my orders that day. Ryutaro: And this tried and tested outfit was the answer? Hosonaga: Being able to blend flawlessly into a crowd is an important part of a detective's job. I submerged myself in the salty water leaving only Mr Turtle floating inconspicuously on the surface. Mr Turtle loves the water. Ryutaro: ......... But there was no need for you to blend into the background on this assignment really, was there? Mikotoba: If that made you late arriving on the scene, I think perhaps you had your priorities wrong. Hosonaga: ......... Ahem. ...Ahem. Ryutaro: (Perhaps I shouldn't pursue this line of questioning any further at the moment...)Soseki: I'd just managed to catch that crab when I suddenly heard a caterwaul from behind me.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: Ah, you're describing the victim's scream, presumably, Soseki-san? Soseki: In more literary terms, you might say it was a scream that could have pierced the heavens. 'KYAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!' ...Or the like. Of course, that's just a metaphor. We renowned authors are wont to describing things so. Ryutaro: (Soseki-san wasn't at all like this in England...) Soseki: Anyway, I spun around at the noise and the beach hut immediately fell under my gaze. Ryutaro: Yes, the beach hut... Hosonaga: The area is popular with government ministers. Many have seaside retreats there for rest and recuperation. Locals are prohibited from entering the area, so it's always very quiet. The beach hut is a simple structure, erected as a place for people to change or take refuge from the sun. Soseki: Although, the Englishwoman commandeered the hut for herself... ...which meant that I was forced to change into my swimwear on the sand. Ryutaro: Ah. I imagine that was rather embarrassing for you. Soseki: Well anyway, I tossed the crab aside and headed for the beach hut at a run. Or, in more literary terms... I decrabbed and beetled off hut-wise!Hosonaga: I ran into the beach hut at once, where I found the pair in question.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: Wait, by 'pair', you don't mean to say...? But how could that be? Hosonaga: No no, you misunderstand! Obviously, I mean the victim and the defendant, Rei Membami-san. Ryutaro: ...Oh. It would have been helpful if you could have just said that from the outset. Hosonaga: ...If you jump to conclusions, you have to expect to fall flat on your face sometimes. Auchi: Dear me, pinning your hopes on such an outside chance. Foolish. Very foolish. Ryutaro: (It really was an outside chance. I just wish I'd realised that before I said something silly.) Auchi: So, Inspector, why don't you tell the court how exactly you found the aforementioned pair in the hut. Hosonaga: Well, it was a sorry sight. A really grisly scene. I parted the noren curtain hanging in the doorway and stepped inside, only to see... ...the defendant leaning menacingly over the lifeless body of the victim sprawled on the sand! Ahem! Ahem, ahem, ahem! My glasses very nearly cracked at the ominous sight that met my eyes. Auchi: How thoroughly appalling. Ryutaro: Ugh... (He doesn't appear to be lying here...) Well, Soseki-san, can you confirm what Inspector Hosonaga is saying, I wonder? Soseki: Ah... You'd like a literary man's opinion?Soseki: YES YES YES! That young girl was astride the Englishwoman, dagger in hand, as she stabbed wildly!Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: 'Stabbed wildly'? You actually saw her do it? Soseki: Oh, indeed. The terrible spectre! The terrapin inspector! The bloody torrent! The author's torment! Ryutaro: EEEEEEEEEEEK!!! Soseki: Every sight and every sound is still carved in my melancholy memory! That was my impression, at least...as a future literary sensation. Auchi: Counsel! What on earth was that shrill, effeminate scream? Ryutaro: Oh! N-No! ...Ahem! No. What are you insinuating? I'm as manly a Japanese man as you! Mikotoba: I wonder if I might interject here, Soseki-san. Something you said is troubling me. 'That was my impression' were your words just now, I believe. Soseki: ......... Ryutaro: Ah! So...do you mean to say... ...you're not confident that you really did see what you've described? Soseki: ......... NO! I mean, YES! I mean, I KNOW WHAT I SAW! My ears didn't deceive me when I heard that scream. Hence my eyes didn't deceive me, either! I could describe everything I saw vividly! I could publish it all in tomorrow's newspaper serial! Auchi: It sounds as though the next instalment of 'I Am a Cat' may take a macabre turn. Mikotoba: I think this is a fool's errand. The more we press your author friend on what he saw, the more entrenched he's going to become. Ryutaro: Oh dear... How awkward.Hosonaga: I saw blood on the blade. It proved to me that she'd stabbed the victim multiple times.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: She was stabbed multiple times...? How can you be sure of that? Hosonaga: Very simply. From the blood on the blade. Ryutaro: The...blood? Hosonaga: When I entered the hut, I saw the defendant holding the blade raised up in the air. Soseki: YES! YES! That's right! I saw it too! Ryutaro: Oh... Hosonaga: And I noted that there was blood on the blade already at that point. In other words, the victim had already been stabbed at least once by the time I arrived on the scene. Soseki: YES! YES! That's right! I saw it too! Hosonaga: And the victim was already holding the defendant's fountain pen in her hand, too. All of which means I can be sure...the victim did not die instantly. Soseki: YES! YES! Right! Saw it too! Ryutaro: (Maybe a year in London was too much for him. He sounds like he's forgotten how to speak Japanese.) Mikotoba: The logic of your argument is sound at least. Hosonaga: Well, as I said, it is my guiding principle to carry out all testimonies flawlessly. Ryutaro: Perhaps it should have been your guiding principle to protect the victim flawlessly? That's just my personal opinion, of course. Hosonaga: ......... Ahem! Ahem! Ahem, ahem! Judge: Counsel! You will refrain from mocking the witness!Present Post-Mortem Report Ryutaro: Leads to: \".........\"Ryutaro: (Oh no... I just have so many thoughts whirling around in my head... It's all I can do to stand here, wide-eyed and mute...)Mikotoba: Goodness, my dear. You really must try to calm down.Ryutaro: But how am I supposed to find an inconsistency in what these two gentlemen are saying? I don't see why either of them would have any reason to lie.Mikotoba: What you must remember, I think, is that witnesses may inadvertently lie at times. For various reasons: a misunderstanding, a mistaken observation, a delusion, even...Ryutaro: Ah...a delusion...Mikotoba: What's important is that we determine the truth. And there's only one sure way to do that.Ryutaro: Yes...with evidence, of course.Mikotoba: Spoken like a true judicial assistant. During witness testimony, you can use [R / R1 / E] to pick a piece of evidence to 'Present' for consideration. So you need to listen carefully to each statement, and compare what's said to the details in the Court Record. If you find some conflicting information, that may be the inconsistency you're looking for.Ryutaro: (Yes, it's all about inconsistencies...)Mikotoba: Once you've identified a witness's statement that appears to conflict with a piece of evidence... Present the evidence to the witness with [X / \u25b3 / R], and the way ahead will present itself to you, I'm sure.Ryutaro: Yes! (Alright, then... I'll consider the details of all the evidence in the Court Record against each statement to find an inconsistency. I hope I'm up to the task...)Mikotoba: Don't forget that you can have the witnesses repeat their statements as many times as you like. Everyone has to start at the beginning, remember. So those wide eyes are quite forgivable. And besides...there's no one else to defend the poor girl.Ryutaro: You're right! (I need to listen to the testimony again from the start.)Ryutaro: ......... (With that accusatory cry that just welled up from deep inside me, I think I finally understand... Every time Kazuma-sama and Naruhodo-san have stood here at this bench... ...the stakes have been very, very high, indeed!)Auchi: Wh-What's the meaning of that menacing pose, Counsel?Ryutaro: I'd like the witness to clarify something for me.Soseki: Who? What? Where? When? Hooooooooooow?!Ryutaro: Not you, Soseki-san. This query is directed at Inspector Hosonaga.Hosonaga: ...! At me?Ryutaro: In your statement just now... ...you said that the victim was stabbed multiple times.Hosonaga: Yes, that's right. As I said, when I entered the hut... ...the defendant was already standing over the victim, bloody knife in hand, like a murderous demon.Ryutaro: And yet...that cannot be.Hosonaga: What?Judge: Get to the point please, Counsel.Ryutaro: In the post-mortem report, it clearly states... ...that the victim was stabbed one time only.Judge: Ah!Auchi: Nnnf!Ryutaro: In other words...Inspector Hosonaga's testimony... ...is clearly flawed!Hosonaga: Agh!Ryutaro: And Soseki-san!Soseki: M-M-Me?!Ryutaro: You claim to have seen Membami-san in the throes of stabbing the victim.Soseki: Y-Yes... Yes, I did... WILDLY!Ryutaro: But both you and the inspector confirmed the same point: That there was already blood on the knife that you saw the defendant holding.Hosonaga: Yes... And...?Ryutaro: It's quite simple. We know the murder weapon was used to stab the victim only once. Therefore... ...there is no way there could have been blood on the knife if that single stabbing hadn't already occurred.Soseki: ARGH! TRUE!Judge: Then what exactly is your contention, Counsel? Are you ever going to tell us?Ryutaro: Yes, Your Excellency. There's only one logical conclusion. What Soseki-san in fact saw was not the moment that the defendant stabbed the victim at all... ...but the moment that the defendant in fact...withdrew the blade from the victim's body!Soseki: That, that can't... ...BEEEEEEEEEEEE!Mikotoba: Excellent work, Susato! You exploded at them with that objection, and then proceeded to pull them apart systematically.Auchi:Auchi: Tsh huh huh... Well well, this takes me back.Ryutaro: ...!Auchi: Yes, I seem to remember your cousin staged a scene much like this in that trial nine months ago. A half-witted child with a half-baked objection attempting to steal the show.Mikotoba: You're right. There were certain similarities. Except that so-called 'half-witted child' managed to outwit the prosecution...who has only half a head of hair.Auchi: Slander! My head is quite adequately dressed! In any case, all this talk of stabbing and withdrawing and multiple wounds... ...it makes not a jot of difference!Ryutaro: What? Why not?Auchi: Engage your brain, young man! When the accused first plunged the deadly weapon into the victim, that was the fatal blow. And it was that moment, just as she had withdrawn the blade ready for her next strike, that the witnesses saw. The knife was already tainted with blood, because the accused had already stabbed the victim!Ryutaro: Ah!Auchi: All you have successfully shown with your little display... ...is that the moustached author is prone to moments of extravagance!Ryutaro: AAAAAAAAAGH!Judge: I am in agreement with the prosecution. If the defendant was seen wielding the blade at all... ...that is sufficient grounds for her actions to be viewed with suspicion.Ryutaro: But, but if she was withdrawing the blade...Auchi: ...Then we are back where we started!Ryutaro: Sorry?Auchi: Consider this, young yokel boy... If the student girl is innocent as you claim... ...then why would she have pulled the blade from the victim? And with a demon's cold-blooded composure, too. The prosecution demands an explanation! ...And it had better be good.Ryutaro: Why did Rei pull out the knife...?Mikotoba: Ah, yes... Going for the jugular.Ryutaro: Hm? (What does Father mean by that?)Judge: Let the court hear your answer then, Counsel.Ryutaro: (The truth is, I don't really know. But I have to come up with a plausible reason here, or we don't have a case.) The reason why the defendant pulled the knife blade out of the victim's body was surely so she could...Stab her again Ryutaro: Hm, well, this is only one possible answer, but... ...could it have been so she could stab the victim again? Judge: Pardon? Ryutaro: Isn't there a saying? If someone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the left also. Mikotoba: Susa- Ryutaro! What are you saying?! Or rather, what are you doing? Do you realise what a hole you're digging? Ryutaro: Ah! AAAAAAGH! (It must be the pressure of being here. I'm starting to say things I don't mean...) Auchi: Quite a slap in the face for the woman you represent. You yokels and your heavy-handed ways! Ryutaro: N-No, I didn't... That, that was just an example! A mere musing! I didn't mean that's what happened! Judge: I suggest you take a moment to consider your answer next time. ...Before you speak, Counsel. Ryutaro: Ugh... Yes, Your Excellency... Thank you for allowing me another chance. Leads back to: \"The reason why the defendant pulled the knife out of the victim's body was surely so she could...\"Save her life Leads to: \"According to the post-mortem report, the victim's death was not instant.\"Hide the knife Ryutaro: I think...it was possibly so that she could hide the murder weapon. Auchi: Auchi: And yet the murder weapon was left there, thrust into the sand at the scene. Ryutaro: ......... Having pulled the knife from the victim, she couldn't find a place to hide it, so that was her only option, perhaps? Judge: ......... I think, Counsel... ...that you were ill-advised with your answer initially. And you were further ill-advised to pursue it. Ryutaro: Oh dear! I'm terribly sorry! (...This job is not to be taken lightly. There's just so much pressure.) Mikotoba: Just because you're under pressure doesn't mean you can say the first thing that comes into your head. Ryutaro: I'd, I'd like to revise my answer, Your Excellency! Leads back to: \"The reason why the defendant pulled the knife out of the victim's body was surely so she could...\"Ryutaro: According to the post-mortem report, the victim's death was not instant.Hosonaga: That's correct. It's thought she would have remained conscious for a short while after sustaining the injury.Auchi: Indeed, giving her the time to take hold of this piece of evidence that clearly indicates her killer.Ryutaro: The, the point is... ...being a medical research assistant, Membami-san was compelled to act when faced with the wounded victim. Instinctively, she pulled the blade out in an attempt to save Miss Brett's life!Auchi: .........Judge: .........Mikotoba: .........Auchi: Tsh huh huh! Did you hear that, Your Excellency? It would seem this is the best we can expect of this young yokel.Judge: Hmmm... Indeed.Ryutaro: (Ugh... Is it just me, or does it suddenly feel much colder in here?)Hosonaga: ...Your Excellency, if I may?Judge: Speak, witness.Hosonaga: I would like another opportunity to testify. In respect to the slipshod assertion just put forward by the yokel defence counsel, I mean.Ryutaro: S-Slipshod?Auchi: Tsh...huh...huh... An excellent idea, Inspector. Our young yokel hopeful has a modicum of knowledge when it comes to the law, it seems... ...but in matters of medicine, he appears to possess not one iota of common sense!Judge: Very well, Inspector. I will permit your request. You will testify again before the court. On the subject of the defence counsel's assertion.Hosonaga: Yes, sir. I will do so flawlessly.Witness Testimony - Forensic Medicine Primer -Hosonaga: Pulling a blade from a wound without thinking could cause heavy bleeding. That's basic knowledge that any medical research assistant with an ounce of sense ought to know. In other words, there's no good reason why the defendant would have tried to pull the knife from the victim. Let's not forget that the young student did have a motive for killing the victim. The man the victim murdered nine months ago, Dr Wilson, was the defendant's highly respected mentor.Ryutaro: Is, is what you just said true, Inspector? Could pulling a knife from a wound really cause the wound to bleed heavily?Hosonaga: Yes. Think of the weapon itself as a stopper in the wound that prevents excessive blood loss. Until a doctor is ready to provide proper treatment, that stopper shouldn't be removed.Ryutaro: Oh, I... I see...Auchi: Hah! This is why yokels should stay on the farm. Even a quack from some obscure mountain village would have such basic knowledge. Anyone who's ever given someone a little poke with a knife and pulled it out again knows it!Ryutaro: Oh...well...I've never stabbed anyone, you see. Or pulled a blade out of a wound, so...Mikotoba: Of course you haven't. I didn't bring you up to behave like a bandit.Ryutaro: Father, is it true, what they're telling me?Mikotoba: Yes, it's basic remedial knowledge for medics. Rei would have been well aware of it. If she were to claim ignorance of such fundamentals, that would prove fatal in many ways.Ryutaro: But then...why would Rei have done it? Could she have pulled out that knife in full knowledge that it would be fatal for Miss Brett?Mikotoba: ...I don't know.Ryutaro: (Rei never once mentioned anything about the knife to me. It seems almost impossible to believe, but... ...could my friend actually have...?)Mikotoba: Susato!Ryutaro: Y-Yes?Mikotoba: Pull yourself together! We mustn't lose sight of why we're here.Ryutaro: (Ah!)Judge: Counsel, it's time for your cross-examination.Ryutaro: Oh...yes, Your Excellency!Judge: However... ...I must warn you that if your cross-examination fails to identify any issue with the established facts... ...I will be moving to my adjudication immediately afterwards.Ryutaro: ...I understand. (Believing in your clients and fighting for their cause until the bitter end... I knew it would be hard, but...I had no idea it would be this hard!)Cross-Examination - Forensic Medicine Primer -Hosonaga: Pulling a blade from a wound without thinking could cause heavy bleeding.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: You say doing it without thinking could be a problem... Does that mean that if you used due care and attention it would be alright? Hosonaga: I wouldn't have thought this needed spelling out, really, but... ...the blade is like a stopper in the wound. Remove it, and a serious haemorrhage will occur. In other words, a medic would need to be present before any attempt was made to withdraw the blade. Doing it without thinking would be madness. You just can't do it. Ryutaro: Oh! Well...thank you for such a thorough explanation. Auchi: You see, Counsel? When you act without thinking, the result is a bloodbath. Ryutaro: Ugh... Judge: Back to the witness testimony, please.Hosonaga: That's basic knowledge that any medical research assistant with an ounce of sense ought to know.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: In that case, there's an obvious explanation here. Hosonaga: ...Which is? Ryutaro: Clearly...the defendant, Rei Membami-san, does not possess an ounce of sense! Hosonaga: ......... What do you think about that, Professor Mikotoba? Mikotoba: I'm not sure that you should be labelling your best friend as lacking in common sense. Ryutaro: Well, I thought it would be better than labelling her as a murderer. Auchi: I don't know, young people today... If that's friendship, I don't understand it. Judge: Careful, Counsel. A lack of common sense can be a very dangerous thing. Ryutaro: (Oh dear... That recoiled on me rather badly.) Mikotoba: That's life, I'm afraid. A lesson everyone must learn. Hosonaga: Hopefully you can see now that this is really basic medical knowledge. Being involved in medical research, Membami-san would certainly have been aware of it.Hosonaga: In other words, there's no good reason why the defendant would have tried to pull the knife from the victim.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: But the defendant had suddenly encountered somebody she knew lying on the ground, bleeding to death. The sight could have shocked her delicate sensibilities, causing her to remove the blade inadvertently. Hosonaga: I really don't think 'inadvertent' actions can explain this. The woman is a medical research assistant. I can't imagine she would behave so irrationally. Ryutaro: Oh, but irrational behaviour is a woman's prerogative, isn't it? Hosonaga: Oh dear...you have a lot to learn about women. Only a small-minded man could have such bigoted views. Ryutaro: (Oh dear...perhaps I'm letting my male persona take hold a little too much...) Hosonaga: Well...have I managed to convey the basics now? That should cover the medical side of the argument.Present Poison Article Ryutaro: Leads to: \"No. There is one possibility.\"Hosonaga: Let's not forget that the young student did have a motive for killing the victim.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: Whatever the motive, it just isn't in Membami-san's nature to do something so awful! Hosonaga: But she had both motive and opportunity. That's very hard to argue against. Ryutaro: But you don't know the defendant! Auchi: Auchi: And you, Counsel, do not appear to know the law! Ryutaro: ...! Hosonaga: Yes, evidence is the only way to convince the court of your argument. Not feelings. Auchi: With this...fledgling to defend her, I would almost say I pity the accused. Ryutaro: (So do I...) Judge: Inspector, you will reiterate your point about the defendant's motive, please. Hosonaga: Ah, yes. Miss Brett was in many ways the sworn enemy of Membami-san.Hosonaga: The man the victim murdered nine months ago, Dr Wilson, was the defendant's highly respected mentor.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: Well...yes, that's true. Dr Wilson recognised Membami-san's talent and offered her the position of assistant despite her being a woman. She was extremely grateful to him. Hosonaga: Yes, the Englishman appears to have been a very broad-minded individual. Mikotoba: Dr Wilson had no time for outdated traditions. He met with opposition of course, but he believed firmly in Membami-san's abilities. Hosonaga: Clearly the defendant was in the man's debt. Which only serves to prove my point.Ryutaro: (This is hopeless! I can't find a single crack in this testimony anywhere! If Rei knew that withdrawing the knife from the wound would threaten Miss Brett's life further... ...I just can't think of any way to explain why she did it.)Mikotoba: Susato. It's at times like these when it's especially important to remember the fundamentals.Ryutaro: The fundamentals?Mikotoba: Evidence is what counts in the courtroom, isn't it?Ryutaro: Of course! But I've been through the Court Record dozens of times already!Mikotoba: I think perhaps you're forgetting something, though. You needn't take the evidence at face value. You can and must examine it in greater detail, too.Ryutaro: Ah!Mikotoba: I realise this is your first time playing the role of lawyer in the courtroom. So if you need reminding of the rudiments, you need only ask. I'll do my very best to help.Ryutaro: (Examine the evidence in the Court Record...? It's an idea, certainly. What should I do?)Ask for a refresher Ryutaro: Yes, Father...Spartan guidance is what I need! Mikotoba: I, I think that might be overdoing it slightly, but... Very well. So, open the Court Record first of all with [R / R1 / E]. Now, let's take a look at the fountain pen which was submitted as evidence most recently. Simply press [A / X / space] to 'Examine' it further. That's all there is to it. Ryutaro: Yes, the initials 'R. M.'... There they are, clearly engraved on the barrel. Mikotoba: By using [right analog stick / arrow keys], you can look at a piece of evidence from all angles. You should have a good look at everything to make sure you haven't missed any clues. Ryutaro: Yes! I will! (I just need to rotate the pen with [right analog stick / arrow keys] and watch closely for anything out of the ordinary, then...) Examine emblem on finial Ryutaro: There's some sort of emblem here, look. But...it isn't a Yumei University one! Mikotoba: It must belong to some other organisation, I suppose. A business of some kind... But that would seem to imply that the pen doesn't in fact belong to Rei. The details of the fountain pen have been updated in the Court Record. Examine emblem on finial (subsequent times) Ryutaro: There's some sort of emblem here, look. But...it isn't a Yumei University one! Mikotoba: It must belong to some other organisation, I suppose. A business of some kind... But that would seem to imply that the pen doesn't in fact belong to Rei.I know what to do Ryutaro: (Come to think of it... ...Kazuma-sama and Naruhodo-san were always turning evidence over and over in their hands. Yes, I need to 'Examine' things in greater detail with [A / X / space]...) Mikotoba: Ah...by the look in your eyes, I see it's coming back to you. Go through the Court Record again and have a thorough look at everything. You may just find a clue. Ryutaro: Yes! I'll do it straight away!Examine evidence Soseki Natsume Article Front page Ryutaro: 'Raucous England Returnees Tell All'... This is the interview with you and Soseki-san, is it, Father? It looks as though it was quite an exchange. Mikotoba: Yes, he became a little over-animated when he was talking about his time in England. The photographer managed to capture the moment his hand karate-chopped me on the neck. Ryutaro: I do hope you weren't hurt. Back page Ryutaro: (This is the newspaper from Soseki-san. There seems to be an important article on the back page as well...) 'Exclusive! Deadly Poison Stolen from Yumei Medical Research Laboratory!' From Yumei's Medical Research... Father, isn't that your lab? Mikotoba: What the...? Let me see that! The, the poison's been stolen?! Ryutaro: It's this morning's paper that Soseki-san gave us. Are you saying...you didn't know? Mikotoba: ...As embarrassing as that is for the head of the laboratory, I didn't. I've not heard any such thing. Where on earth could the reporter have gleaned his information? Ryutaro: Come to think of it... ...there was no article mentioning this story in our paper this morning, was there? Mikotoba: It's a highly toxic poison we've been working on in the strictest confidence. I'd put Rei in charge of the project. Ryutaro: Rei! She was managing it? Mikotoba: If what's written here is true... ...it means that she tried to hide the theft from me. And moreover...the details were leaked somehow. Ryutaro: I, I don't believe it! Mikotoba: We need to read this article very carefully. The article about the poison has been entered into the Court Record. Back page (subsequent times) Ryutaro: 'Exclusive! Deadly Poison Stolen from Yumei Medical Research Laboratory!' I can't believe you knew nothing about this, Father. Mikotoba: Nothing was reported to me. It seems an attempted cover-up was at play. Ryutaro: This is extraordinary... Mikotoba: What I'd really like to know is...how a reporter found out about it. Well, however it happened... ...I have to take full responsibility. There'll be serious consequences for sure. Ryutaro: Oh, Father... Fountain Pen Lid Ryutaro: If we take off the pen's lid... Barrel Ryutaro: Now let's unscrew the barrel, shall we? Inkwell Ryutaro: This must be the little reservoir that holds the ink. Mikotoba: Yes, you fill it by drawing ink from a bottle up through the nib. ......... Ryutaro: Is something wrong, Father? Mikotoba: Just that there doesn't actually appear to be any ink in there, that's all. Ryutaro: Oh yes, you're right. It's pretty much empty. (Well, it could be on the verge of running out, I suppose...) The details of the fountain pen have been updated in the Court Record. Inkwell (subsequent times) Ryutaro: This must be the little reservoir that holds the ink. Mikotoba: Yes, you fill it by drawing ink from a bottle up through the nib. ......... Ryutaro: Is something wrong, Father? Mikotoba: Just that there doesn't actually appear to be any ink in there, that's all. Ryutaro: Oh yes, you're right. It's pretty much empty. (Well, it could be on the verge of running out, I suppose...) Emblem on finial (if not already examined yet) Ryutaro: There's some sort of emblem here, look. But...it isn't a Yumei University one! Mikotoba: It must belong to some other organisation, I suppose. A business of some kind... But that would seem to imply that the pen doesn't in fact belong to Rei. The details of the fountain pen have been updated in the Court Record. Emblem on finial (subsequent times) Ryutaro: Well, we know for certain that this emblem isn't that of Yumei University. Mikotoba: The police really ought to have spotted that. Ryutaro: They were obviously convinced of Rei's guilt from the outset. Initials Ryutaro: The 'R. M.' initials are very clearly engraved here. Mikotoba: And the fact that Miss Brett was clinging to this pen in her dying moments is very clearly a message, too. Ryutaro: To identify her killer, you mean? Mikotoba: I don't think there can be any doubt that this is a key piece of evidence in this case. Initials (subsequent times) Ryutaro: The 'R. M.' initials are very clearly engraved here.Ryutaro: No. There is one possibility. One very good reason why the defendant might have decided to withdraw the knife from the victim's wound!Hosonaga: What?!Auchi: Hah! The yokel not only has a poor grasp of the law, but is also a poor loser! Tell us, then! What 'possibility' do you think you've identified?Ryutaro: It's here...in this newspaper article. An article about a deadly poison having been stolen from a laboratory at the Imperial Yumei Uni-Auchi:Auchi: The victim perished from a stab wound. Poison has no relevance in this case!Ryutaro: But...Judge: Prosecutor Auchi. You will let the defence speak.Auchi: But, but a newspaper article! The court cannot rely on the kind of hearsay those wretched publications carry.Judge: Counsel for the Defence... ...I am going to need some tangible basis for your claim. You will indicate to the court precisely what part of the newspaper article mentioned affirms your assertion.Auchi: Your Excellency!Ryutaro: Yes, of course. ...Thank you! (Rei would never have done something to further endanger Miss Brett's life without just cause.) The reason why the defendant pulled the knife from the victim's body is explained in the article where it says...'Poison Stolen from Laboratory!' Ryutaro: The poison was apparently stolen from a medical research laboratory at Yumei University. Judge: Yes, it would seem so. Calling the department's security practices into question. Auchi: The very department of the professor standing so nonchalantly opposite me, I believe. Mikotoba: Agh! Susa- Ryutaro... Ryutaro: Oh! Yes, Father? Mikotoba: Was there some reason you felt it necessary to highlight the fact that the theft occurred in my department? Ryutaro: ......... How can I explain it...? It was the first detail I cast my eye over...I suppose... Mikotoba: I suggest you read the article again. Carefully! Ryutaro: I'm so sorry! (Oh dear. Father's fuming...) Leads back to: \"The reason why the defendant pulled the knife from the victim's body is explained in the article where it says...\"'Deadly in Tiny Quantities!' Leads to: \"The article reveals the following property about the poison in question:\"'Why is the Poison Being Developed?' Ryutaro: According to the article, the development of the poison was requested by the military. Judge: Hmmm... Yes, a troubling revelation indeed. Ryutaro: Oh, it's very worrying... Auchi: And yet, even more worrying... ...is how this yokel is trying to manipulate the court with nothing more than rumours! Ryutaro: AAAAAAGH! (But I feel sure Rei had a good reason for her actions. And I feel sure the explanation is somewhere in this newspaper article!) Mikotoba: Try reading the article again. Ryutaro: Yes! Leads back to: \"The reason why the defendant pulled the knife from the victim's body is explained in the article where it says...\"Ryutaro: The article reveals the following property about the poison in question: When the toxin enters the body on a knife laced with the poison, it's rapidly absorbed and causes death in minutes.Hosonaga: Are, are you suggesting...?Ryutaro: If the knife used to attack Miss Brett was laced with this very poison... ...it would explain why the defendant, Membami-san, would have withdrawn the blade as soon as possible. ...Yes, the truth is... ...it was an attempt to stop the poison from entering the victim's body!Hosonaga: WHAT?!Auchi:Auchi: This is complete and utter nonsense!Ryutaro: Not at all! The defendant withdrew the knife blade from the victim's body not to accelerate the woman's demise... ...but to save her life! And the prosecution cannot deny the possibility!Auchi: Have you not read the post-mortem report? The cause of death was haemorrhage! The word 'poison' appears nowhere in the document!Ryutaro: Well, well that's... That's because by acting quickly to remove the blade, the defendant prevented the poison from taking hol-Auchi:Auchi: Oh please! This is clearly desperation! The weasel's last breaking of wind! Poison has nothing whatsoever to do with this case, as I believe the defence is well aware! We have no proof that the information in this wretched newspaper article is at all reliable anyway.Hosonaga: In that situation, what the student should have done is wait for medical assistance to arrive. But instead, you claim she suspected poisoning and took the potentially lethal decision to remove the blade. She must have had a strong reason for her suspicions then, or the argument makes no sense.Auchi: Exactly! Well put, Inspector! On what grounds did she do it, hm, yokel?Ryutaro: (Why DID Rei suspect the stolen poison was involved...?) If you want grounds... I'll give you grounds.Hosonaga: What?Auchi: You...you can't possibly...Judge: From your expression, Counsel, it would appear those are not empty words.Ryutaro: .........Judge: But naturally, as you stand in this courtroom as a lawyer, you must be aware... ...that words alone, empty or not, are of no value in our modern justice system. The court demands evidence.Ryutaro: Yes, Your Excellency. (I'm well aware of that. I've seen it many times...from my place at his side in the Old Bailey.)Judge: In that case, Counsel, you will present the proof to the court now. What evidence demonstrates a clear link between this case and the poison in the newspaper article?Present Post-Mortem Report Ryutaro: Leads to: \"I would ask the court to refer to the 'Notes' section of the post-mortem report, which reads:\"Present anything else Ryutaro: Judge: ...How exactly would you explain this piece of evidence's connection to the newspaper article? Ryutaro: In truth...I'm not really sure. But my father always taught me to ask my elders whenever I was in trouble. So I thought I should ask your opinion, Your Excellency. Judge: If it is advice you seek, Counsel, then I suggest that before indiscriminately thrusting evidence under my nose... ...why not thrust it under the nose of the professor at your side? Ryutaro: ...I think he means you. Mikotoba: Good grief, thrusting that under MY nose isn't going to solve anything here! We must use our heads. The article in the paper had details of the toxin. Now, where have we seen similar details... Does nowhere come to mind? Ryutaro: Ah, you mean I ought to search through all the evidence looking for that? Judge: If I'm not mistaken, it appears the advice of your elders has given you an idea. Ryutaro: Yes! I'd like another chance to present evidence, if I may, Your Excellency. Leads back to: \"In that case, Counsel, you will present the proof to the court now.\"Ryutaro: I would ask the court to refer to the 'Notes' section of the post-mortem report, which reads: 'Extreme miosis - pupil constriction - was observed in the victim.'Hosonaga: ...Ah!Ryutaro: Clearly, being a yokel with no knowledge of forensic science, I have no idea, so please, do tell me... Presumably, the fact that this condition of the victim was noted in the post-mortem report... ...means that it's an unusual symptom of death?Auchi: ...Tsk! Well...Hosonaga: Under normal circumstances, the pupils dilate when someone dies. If there was extreme constriction instead...that's most certainly unusual, yes.Auchi: What are you doing, you yokel detective?!Ryutaro: In the newspaper article, there's the following information about the stolen poison: 'Onset of symptoms occurs in minutes...ending with acute contraction of the pupils prior to death.'Auchi: What?!Ryutaro: If the defendant, upon seeing the victim stabbed in the back... ...happened to notice that the pupils of Miss Brett's eyes had constricted severely...Mikotoba: ...Yes, as a medical research assistant, she would have suspected poison immediately. Without doubt.Auchi: Hnnn...grrr...Ryutaro: Prosecutor Auchi! I think you'll agree...this is very compelling evidence!Auchi: Tsk! You... You... Yokel student and yokel professoooooor!!!Judge: I believe the defence has expertly demonstrated a credible reason for the defendant's actions.Auchi: No...Judge: Yujin Mikotoba...Mikotoba: Yes, Your Excellency?Judge: I believe you are best placed here to confirm or deny the veracity of the defence counsel's argument. You will tell the court the truth about the details reported in this newspaper, please.Mikotoba: ......... It pains me to have to admit it... ...but I'm afraid I don't know.Judge: You don't know?Mikotoba: The toxin was kept under lock and key in my laboratory, certainly. But I was unaware of any theft.Judge: Do you mean to tell the court that the reports of this theft are unfounded?Mikotoba: No, Your Excellency. Without returning to the laboratory to investigate myself, I couldn't say.Auchi: Hah! Listen to the bumbling academic! Unaware of the theft of secret state research from his own workplace until he reads of it in the newspaper!Mikotoba: ...I take full responsibility for the incompetence of my supervision.Ryutaro: Father...Auchi: Tsk! A pitiful situation for a university professor. You should have more control over your students... rather than allowing them off on killing sprees!Ryutaro: That's, that's totally unfounded-???:Rei: None of this is Professor Mikotoba's fault! It's all... It's all MY fault!Ryutaro: Rei...Judge: Membami-san! You stand accused here! Outbursts like this will not be tolerated!Rei: ......... But...it was me. I was the one who noticed that the poison we were developing had been stolen that day.Judge: What?!Ryutaro: So you knew...Rei: I'd, I'd been placed in charge of overseeing the project. It was the day that the professor and Soseki-san were interviewed together for the newspaper. That's when I noticed that some of the poison was missing. Just a tiny amount, it was.Mikotoba: Why didn't you let me know immediately?Rei: ......... I...I was scared. The whole project was supposed to be confidential, but some of the toxin had somehow been taken... So...I decided I'd try to get it back before anyone else found out. Because I had a very good idea who the thief was!Ryutaro: The thief... You, you don't mean...?Rei: Yes, of course. It was that dainty Englishwoman!Judge: Miss Jezaille Brett?Rei: That's why I decided to join the little group of people going to the seaside. Inside the beach hut, I confronted Miss Brett. But she just sat on a stool at the back of the hut, smiling sweetly at me as if she knew she was untouchable.I know it was you who stole the poison!Well now... whatever do you mean?Rei: And then... ...she suddenly got to her feet... ...before falling to her knees in front of me and...then collapsing on the floor.Ryutaro: ...!Rei: That's when I saw the knife in her back. I couldn't understand what had just happened. And then...a moment later, I was seized with fear. The pupils of her eyes had... They'd shrunk to tiny pinpoints.Mikotoba: I don't believe it...Judge: In other words, you realised that the victim was suffering the effects of the stolen poison.Rei: My mind started racing... I hadn't seen anything pass Miss Brett's lips whilst I'd been with her. Which left only one possible way for the poison to have entered her body.Ryutaro: On the blade of the knife in her back...Judge: And that train of thought was what spurred you to withdraw the blade.Rei: Yes. If the amount that had entered her bloodstream was small enough, she might still have a chance... That's what I hoped. Really... I... I'm so sorry for staying silent all this time!Ryutaro: .........Auchi: .........Judge: ......... Your attempt to hide the truth of what happened is not something that can be overlooked. However, I have duly noted the courage with which you confessed in the end.Rei: ...Thank you, Your Excellency!Ryutaro: (It's barely perceptible, but I do think... ...the balance has shifted a little here in this courtroom now.)Auchi:Auchi: Your Excellency, do not be deceived! The victim just collapsed before your eyes, you say? Well, Membami-san, if that is the case, perhaps you could explain how Miss Brett came to be stabbed?Rei: Well, um...Auchi: You have no answer because the simple truth...is that YOU stabbed the victim motivated by revenge!Ryutaro:Ryutaro: But you have no conclusive evidence to prove that assertion, do you?Auchi: ......... Oh, I have evidence. And it is very much conclusive!Ryutaro: ...! (What's the prosecution counsel up to...? It was brief, but he hesitated for a moment there, I'm almost sure of it...)Judge: You will produce the aforementioned evidence at once, Prosecutor Auchi.Auchi: ......... Perhaps some praise is due, young yokel student.Ryutaro: What?Auchi: I had imagined there would be no need for me to submit this evidence. But you've brought this on yourself!What the...?Could a more damning shot exist?The cruelty in the air on that beach is almost palpable...Auchi: This evidence, more than any other, reveals the true extent of the accused's murderous nature. For it shows the precise moment that Membami-san plunged her dagger into the victim's back!Rei: No, that's not true! No!Ryutaro: I, I don't believe it... AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!Judge: Order! Order! Order! Counsel for the Defence, was it you who was responsible for that shrill scream that just pierced my courtroom?Auchi: Perhaps his voice has yet to break? These yokels are slow of mind and slow to mature.Ryutaro: (I'll show you who's slow to mature...)Mikotoba: Careful now. Susato is starting to show her face here.Judge: It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words. And here we have ample proof. The court will accept this extremely cogent photographic print as evidence.The incriminating photograph has been entered into the Court Record.Ryutaro: (I can't believe he's had a photograph like that up his sleeve the entire time. It's such a stark image, I'm genuinely lost for words...)Rei: Wait a minute! I, I don't understand. How did you...? I mean, who took that photograph?!Ryutaro: ...! (Rei...)Auchi:Auchi: That's of no importance here. Stop trying to divert attention!Rei: Oh...Ryutaro:Ryutaro: That's an absurd thing to say! It's crucially important! Whoever took this photographic print was a witness to Miss Brett's death! The court must be allowed to hear this person's testimony!Auchi: Argh!Judge: I will uphold the defence's demand. The prosecution will reveal the identity of the person responsible for taking this photograph at once!Auchi: ......... Well...I'm afraid I can't do that.Ryutaro: Pardon?Auchi: You see, this print arrived at the Imperial Police Bureau headquarters by express post yesterday. But there was nothing to indicate the sender's name or address. The provenance of the print is unknown.Judge: Goodness...Ryutaro: Are we to understand then, Counsel... ...that in full knowledge of the fact that this photograph has the murkiest of origins... ...you nevertheless believe it fit for submission as evidence in the Supreme Court?Mikotoba: When you first produced that print before, I noticed that you hesitated for a brief moment. Because you knew that it wasn't completely reliable evidence, didn't you?Auchi: Silence...you yokel student and blabbering professor! What matters is the blatant truth that this print so eloquently expresses.Ryutaro: But the defendant has already admitted to pulling the blade from the wound. Clearly this isn't the moment that the knife was plunged into the victim's back, but-Auchi: The moment it was withdrawn? Don't waste this court's time with your ramblings!Judge: Indeed. Without knowledge of who produced this print, we have no means of verifying the claim. And the scene it captures is without doubt the most compelling evidence presented to the court. If the defence is unable to shed any further light on the matter, I believe the conclusion is clear.Ryutaro: Oh no!Mikotoba: Susato... This is the time for you to fight. If what you've established so far is true, then there can be no doubt... ...this photograph shows the moment that Rei withdrew the blade from the victim.Ryutaro: ...! (Yes, we just need to prove that somehow...)Auchi: Tsh...huh...huh... You'll have plenty of time to rue your defeat on the slow train back to the provinces. And to rue the day you came up against Taketsuchi Auchi in a court of law!Ryutaro: (If I can't determine who took this photograph, then the trial is going to come to an end. There must be a clue somewhere. There must be some way of working out who took it!)Judge: Well, Counsel?Ryutaro: ......... Your Excellency... The burning question is who took that photograph. And the truth is...I don't know Ryutaro: ......... (No... If I give up now... ...I'll never be able to look Rei in the eye again!) Mikotoba: Susato, you need to steel yourself and summon your best argument. Ryutaro: I'll do my best! Leads to: \"This isn't about whether I can or can't come up with the answer now...\"I have the answer Leads to: \"This isn't about whether I can or can't come up with the answer now...\"Ryutaro: (This isn't about whether I can or can't come up with the answer now... I simply have to!) The identity of the person who took this dramatic photographic print... ...is, I assure you...something the defence can and will reveal!Auchi: Wha...? No... You can't possibly! But as you so boldly claim that you can...please, do enlighten us!Ryutaro: Unfortunately, I'm unable to present a name.Auchi: How utterly underwhelming. Did you really believe you could-Ryutaro: However! I am able to present evidence. The defence has a piece of evidence that reveals important details about the photographer's identity.Auchi: Wha...?Judge: Very well then, Counsel. Present your proof to the court. Which piece of evidence do you claim reveals something about the identity of the mystery photographer?Present Soseki Natsume Article Ryutaro: Leads to: \"What is that?\"Present anything else Ryutaro: Ryutaro: The piece of evidence in question...is this! Judge: ......... I'm afraid, Counsel, that when presenting evidence, you must learn to temper those wide, nervous eyes. Ryutaro: ......... Judge: I'm obliged to penalise you for the lack of focus in both your eyes and your answer. Auchi: Would you care to squeeze your head in your hands again, Counsel? To punish yourself for presenting such utterly irrelevant evidence. Ryutaro: Ugh! I'll squeeze my head as many times as it takes to win this trial! ...Your Excellency! May I? Judge: ...You may present another piece of evidence. But no more squeezing, Counsel. Leads back to: \"Which piece of evidence do you claim reveals something about the identity of the mystery photographer?\"Judge: What is that? The newspaper again? 'Raucous England Returnees Tell All'...Ryutaro: It's not the headline that's relevant here, Your Excellency. It's the photograph. If you look at it closely, you'll notice that there are some white lines on the right-hand side.Judge: Ah, yes, indeed. They had already caught my eye, as it happens.Auchi: Hah! What of it? A shadow of some kind, presumably. From the branches of a tree or the like.Mikotoba: There are no trees growing inside my laboratory at the university, I can assure you.Ryutaro: Now...if you look closely at this photograph...Judge: ......... ...Good gracious!Ryutaro: Yes, exactly the same pattern of lines is present on this photograph, too.Auchi:Auchi: Well... Well... That, that tells us nothing! H-Hah! Yes, it's a shadow of some kind, definitely! From the branches of a tree!Ryutaro: There wouldn't be any trees growing inside a hut at the beach, Counsel.Auchi: Nnnf!Judge: What's quite remarkable about it, is that the two patterns are absolutely identical. How could such an extraordinary similarity have transpired?Ryutaro: The curious matching pattern that appears on both photographic prints is a result of...The photographer's technique Ryutaro: I believe...the pattern may be the result of a particular quirk of the photographer when taking a picture. Auchi: You believe? Judge: What quirk could possibly produce such consistent markings? Ryutaro: Clearly, it must be a quirk that's quite unimaginable! Judge: I repeat, Counsel. What would be the nature of this quirk? Ryutaro: ......... Well, um...I... I can't really imagine, of course. Auchi: Because there is no such quirk! Mikotoba: It's time to consider another, more credible option, I think. Leads back to: \"The curious matching pattern that appears on both photographic prints is a result of...\"A camera defect Leads to: \"Obviously, it must be due to a problem with the camera used to take the photographs.\"Some tree branches Ryutaro: Clearly, the branches of a tree have caused this pattern! Auchi: Auchi: An argument I put forward myself only moments ago, to much ridicule! Judge: Indeed. ...There was considerable ridicule involved. Ryutaro: Well... It's hard to think of another explanation. Auchi: Well then...'hard' luck! Mikotoba: You pointed out yourself that no trees would be growing inside a beach hut. Ryutaro: Oh dear... Sorry... (What was I thinking?) Mikotoba: It's time to consider another, more credible option, I think. Leads back to: \"The curious matching pattern that appears on both photographic prints is a result of...\"Ryutaro: Obviously, it must be due to a problem with the camera used to take the photographs.Auchi: With, with the photographic device...?Mikotoba: Yes, we can confidently say that the camera's lens must be scratched. And that the scratched lens causes unwanted lines to appear on every print taken with the device.Ryutaro: In short... The two photographs under consideration here... ...were taken with the same camera!Auchi: Hnnngh... Hnnnnnngh... B-But... ...there must be hundreds of such camera devices here in the capital! It would be utterly impossible to identify the owner of this particular one!Ryutaro:Ryutaro: I think you're forgetting, Prosecutor Auchi... ...that one of the photographs featured in a newspaper article.Auchi: A newspaper... Ah!Ryutaro: That's right. The author of that article is the mystery witness to this crime!Auchi: Wha... WAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!...Menimemooooooh!Judge: I, I see why you were called a 'raucous England returnee'...Auchi: What are you yelling about? You've already testified!Soseki: It's Menimemo, I tell you! MENIMEMO!ME...NI...ME...MO!Ryutaro: Um...Soseki-san...what was that? Did you say 'Menimemo'?Soseki: ...Ever since I returned to Japan... ...a reporter from the Shoyu News has been hounding me, following my every move! A reporter by the name of Raiten Menimemo. Yes, hounding me from dawn till dusk!Ryutaro: Ah! (Now that he mentions it...)Soseki: They secretly spy! Snap shots! Scribble stories! And scupper my privacy!Ryutaro: (Could that same reporter be...?)Soseki: A camera to the left of him! A notebook to the right! There I am, stuck in the middle with... Raiten Menimemo!Judge: So you're saying that this picture was taken by-Soseki: By MENIMEMO! YES! ...My Lord, Your Excellency, Esquire!Judge: Officer! Find this newspaper reporter at once and bring him to my courtroom! We will adjourn for a short recess in the meantime.Ryutaro: Oh... Yes, Your Excellency!Auchi: As, as you say, Your Excellency...Judge: And one more thing... I want this knife - the murder weapon - examined for traces of poison! You will solicit the assistance of the imperial university's medical department for the task. ...Understood?Auchi: ......... Meh... Menimemooooooh!!!To be continued...13th August, 10:41 a.m. Supreme Court of Judicature, Defendants' Antechamber 3Rei: ...I'm so sorry, Susato. I should have told you about the toxin.Susato: Rei...Rei: .........Mikotoba: You have a strong sense of responsibility, I know. That's why you decided to shoulder the burden alone.Rei: No! That's not it at all! I... I was just... I was scared of my failure coming to light, that's all. So I hoped to retrieve the substance from the Englishwoman before anyone found out.Mikotoba: .........Rei: Before the trial started, do you remember what you said, Susato? That you had no doubt in your mind about my innocence. That you'd stand by me to the last.Susato: ...I remember.Rei: And yet I... I didn't deserve your trust in me. I hid important details from you, Susato. I completely betrayed your faith in me. Hit me, Susato! I deserve it! No, in fact, throw me to the floor! No, that's too good for me as well! Drag me through the city streets!Susato: ...I'm no better, you know.Rei: Oh!Susato: Even though in my heart I knew that you'd pulled the knife blade from Miss Brett's back... ...there was just a brief moment when, in my mind... I doubted you.Rei: Susato!Susato: I'm sorry. After I stood here and promised you that I'd stand by you and always be on your side... I betrayed your faith in me, too. And as such, I've failed you as a lawyer.Rei: Oh no no...Mikotoba: I think this situation has taught both of you a valuable lesson. Placing your unbridled faith in another is no easy task.Susato: ...Yes, Father. That fact has certainly struck home. Which is why I can see more clearly now. So...Rei...Rei: Yes?Susato: Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?Rei: ......... Oh, Susato... ...you know you'll always be a gallant, dashing lawyer in my eyes now!Susato: (Oh, Rei...)Rei: ......... I was so scared, you know, when it happened. I didn't know what was going on. The Englishwoman was sitting at the back of the hut, listening to what I was saying.I know it was you who stole the poison!Well now...whatever do you mean?Rei: And then a moment later... ...she suddenly got to her feet... ...before collapsing on the floor in front of me...with a knife in her back.Rei: It all happened right before my eyes.Susato: And...you were the only people in the hut at the time?Rei: That's right. Just Miss Brett and myself. There was no one else. So I just don't understand how she could possibly have been stabbed like that.Mikotoba: Hm... A great mystery indeed.Rei: I still can't believe it happened. That's why I just couldn't bring myself to speak up.Susato: ......... It will be alright. However it happened, and whatever really went on by the sea that day... ...I promise you that I'm going to prove everything you've said you saw is true!Mikotoba: Spoken like a true Mikotoba. Now, I think we should discuss what's coming up in the trial, don't you? We don't have much time. We must make sure we have our facts in order.Susato: Yes! I expect the poison is going to come under close scrutiny in the upcoming proceedings. The police should hopefully have identified it on the blade by now.Rei: The trouble is, it's a completely new laboratory-synthesised blend of alkaloids. The police won't have any way of testing for it.Susato: Oh...I see...Mikotoba: Yes, without this chemical reagent, it's impossible to detect the toxin.Susato: 'Chemical reagent'?Mikotoba: I sent a colleague of mine off with some earlier to deliver to police headquarters. I think perhaps you should have some as well, though, just in case.The chemical reagent has been entered into the Court Record.Susato: .........Examine evidence Chemical Reagent Label Ryutaro: The label appears to be written in a foreign language that I don't know. Mikotoba: It's German, so your knowledge of English is going to be of little help here, I'm afraid. Ryutaro: Couldn't you just have written 'Medicine' on it in Japanese? Then we'd all be able to read it. Mikotoba: German is the international language of medicine, my dear. But yes, I can certainly see the merit in labelling the bottle in Japanese. ...Though I'm not sure 'Medicine' would be entirely appropriate...Mikotoba: What's the matter, Susato? You're suddenly very quiet.Susato: It's this newspaper article. 'Exclusive! Deadly Poison Stolen from Yumei Medical Research Laboratory!' I'm wondering how the information got out, given that it was a government secret.Rei: It was all the Englishwoman's doing!Susato: Wha...?Rei: It was when the professor and Soseki-san were being interviewed at the laboratory. That so-called English lady swanned in, and without any compunction said to Professor Mikotoba:Oh Professor, surely your guest would love to hear about your work on that substance there?Mikotoba: It put me in a very awkward position, to be frank. But Soseki-san's curiosity had been piqued, so I had little choice but to give him a cursory introduction.Susato: So then...Soseki-san knew about the poison...Mikotoba: Yes. And it's highly likely... that the reporter who was writing up the story about us would have caught a glimpse of the toxin, too.Susato: (This..Menimemo-san...) By the way, did that reporter join you all when you went to the beach?Rei: Oh... No, I don't remember the reporter being there...Mikotoba: Indeed, he shouldn't have been. I very much doubt anyone would have wanted him there.Susato: Oh?Mikotoba: A known criminal had been given permission by the authorities to bathe by the seaside. Soseki-san pointed out that inviting a reporter might be problematic, so the man was sent back to his office.Susato: Yet he obviously didn't go back. He secretly followed the party to the beach and took this very candid photograph. And then presumably he posted it, anonymously, to the police.Rei: Ah!Mikotoba: ......... Yes, that must be what happened.Susato: .........Bailiff: Counsel! We've just heard that the new witness is now ready to testify. The trial is about to resume. Please proceed into the courtroom at once!Mikotoba: It's time to steel ourselves once again, then... ...Defence Attorney Ryutaro Naruhodo.Susato: Yes! (Rei has put her faith in me now and told me everything. So I can't let her down. I have to prove that what she's telling the court is true. I have to prove what really happened that day!)13th August, 11:30 a.m. Supreme Court of Judicature, Courtroom 1Judge: I hereby call this court to order, as we reconvene to continue the trial of Rei Membami. Prosecutor Auchi, have you summoned the new witness?Auchi: ......... Before I address that question, Your Excellency... ...I have some very important news to share!Judge: Oh?Ryutaro: (What news? And why does he look so happy about it?)Auchi: During the recess, with the collaboration of Professor Mikotoba's laboratory at Yumei University... ...the police re-examined the knife that was used to end Miss Jezaille Brett's life.Judge: Excellent. I admire your rapid handling of the matter.Auchi: Oh, too kind, Your Excellency, too kind! I was merely carrying out your instructions, of course.Mikotoba: I had the reagent delivered to police headquarters by rickshaw so it would be there in good time. But judging by the man's swagger, I fear we might need to brace ourselves for the inevitable...Ryutaro: And, Counsel? What were the results?Auchi: ......... This dagger, which was so cruelly used to end the life of the victim... ...has no trace of poison anywhere along its blade!Ryutaro: Wh-What? Are you sure about that?Auchi: I would stake the reputation of the police on it.Mikotoba: Armed with the reagent, the test is extremely simple. They couldn't have made a mistake.The murder weapon has been entered into the Court Record.Auchi: In short...the accused's feeble excuse earlier... ...has been utterly destroyed!Examine evidence Murder Weapon Blood Mikotoba: Ah yes, this must be the victim's blood. Ryutaro: Oh dear... Blood is never a pretty sight, is it? I'm having to fight the urge to run it under a hot tap and get it clean. Mikotoba: You've always been fastidious about cleanliness, haven't you? Ryutaro: ...I think this is something else, Father.Ryutaro: AAAAAAAAAGH!Auchi: Now, the prosecution is ready to call the new witness.Judge: Ah, the newspaper reporter who managed to capture a photograph of the crucial moment. Good. Very well. Officer, bring in the witness!Ryutaro: (No trace of poison on the knife... But if that's really the case... ...how could the toxin have entered the victim's body?)Auchi: Witness, please state your name and occupation for the court.Menimemo: Raiten Menimemo of the Shoyu News. I'm what people like to call a journo!Ryutaro: What's a 'journo', Father? Do you know?Mikotoba: It's simply a contraction of 'journalist'.Menimemo: I'm there where the news breaks, putting pen to paper to catch those scoops so they're in print the next morning! They don't call me the hero of the herald for nothing! The nice guy of news!Ryutaro: Oh! So, um...it was you who took this photograph, was it?Menimemo: ......... Well well, what have we here?Ryutaro: I'm, I'm sorry?Menimemo: Ooh, brace yourselves, people! Menimemo senses a scoop in the offing! 'Female student up to foul play defended by curiously handsome young lawyer in Supreme Court...' The readers will lap this up! We'll set it above the fold at 72 point in a five-leg format for the morning edition!Ryutaro: Huh?Menimemo: Right then...let's start with your name!Ryutaro: Oh, um... It's Ryutaro Naruhodo.Menimemo: Next! What made you want to become a lawyer?Ryutaro: Erm...well, um... I...wanted to reform our country's legal system, I suppose.Mikotoba: Ryutaro has suddenly become very ambitious, I see.Ryutaro: ...I just borrowed Kazuma-sama's dream for a while.Auchi: By the way, my name is Taketsuchi Auchi. That's 'Ta-ke-tsu-chi A-u-chi'... The so-called dark horse of the Supreme Court, my objections strike fear into every defence lawyer's heart!Menimemo: ......... No, the readers won't buy that.Auchi: Wha...?Judge: Witness...Menimemo: Um...yes?Judge: What this court demands to know is whether or not you were responsible for the taking of this picture? It was delivered anonymously to the Imperial Police Bureau only yesterday.Menimemo: ...Yeah, I wouldn't be a journo if I didn't click quick when presented with a scoop like that now, would I? Sometimes stories call out to me, sometimes I have to chase them down, but either way you've got to be fast! Fast legs to run with, and a fast hand to write with! It's no good if you don't note it down, I always say! That's what I call...my Menimemoism!Ryutaro: Menimemoism?Mikotoba: Ah yes...I remember your face. We met that day when you were interviewing myself and Soseki-san.Menimemo: Yes, right... That was me, Menimemo again!Mikotoba: But you were supposed to be going back to the Shoyu News offices after our meeting.Menimemo: But the scoop is, I didn't! Because that Englishwoman's words had piqued my journalistic interest.Ryutaro: Miss Brett's words?Menimemo: A criminal, left to do as she pleases, just because she happens to be a British citizen? It's horse dung! This country's judiciary is rotten to the core! The Supreme Court's rulings aren't worth the paper they're written on! The police are just imperial pawns!Auchi: Stay your tongue, young man! There are complex political issues at play!Menimemo: Hmph! Well anyway, I quickly jotted down those words she said in my Menimemo memo pad. Are you ready? I'll read it out. It's all here. Right, here goes... 'I should like to go with everyone to see your country's coast!' A serious criminal going on some junket! ...The people need to know about this! That's why I decided to sneak after them. To get the woman's story so I could hammer her in the press!Judge: Do you mean to say that you did indeed witness it firsthand? The grim scene portrayed in this photograph?Menimemo: Oh yes! I saw it with my very own journo eyes! From start to finish, through the viewfinder of my trusty camera!Judge: Thank you, Menimemo-san. You will now give a formal testimony before the court. You will state exactly what it is that you witnessed of the events surrounding Miss Brett's death.Witness Testimony - The Camera Never Lies -Menimemo: The beach hut was made of shoddy old reed screens, so there were plenty of gaps I could see inside through. The Englishwoman was sitting on a stool when the student girl came in and started arguing with her. Seconds later, the girl pulled out a knife, throwing the Englishwoman to the floor as she stabbed her in the back! My smouldering journo spirit burst into flames! Quick as a flash, I whipped out my camera ready to click! I pulled apart the rough weave of one of the screens and poked the lens through for the perfect shot.Ryutaro: Reed screens, you say?Menimemo: Right! You can see them clearly enough in that great shot I snapped. The hut walls were just screens made of coarsely woven reeds.Judge: ...Yes, it allows the breeze to pass through and bring some relief from the summer heat.Menimemo: And it was a breeze for me to poke my camera through and see the whole thing hotting up!Ryutaro: ...Ignoring for the time being the appalling invasion of privacy involved... ...did you witness everything that happened from the moment the defendant entered the hut?Menimemo: Oh yes. I saw it. I saw the whole thing from start to finish!Ryutaro: And you say that you took the photograph through a gap in one of the screens?Menimemo: Luckily for me, they were pretty shoddily woven. I pulled the reeds apart and thrust the lens of my camera through the gap! Would I get away with it? Or would I be seen? It was the gamble of a lifetime!Auchi: A tenacity of purpose that's considered admirable in a journalist, I suppose.Menimemo: 'Run a risk one day, run a scoop the next!' That's Menimemoism in a nutshell!Judge: At last... ...it would appear we have a genuine witness to this wicked crime. The evidence and testimony are extremely compelling. I believe we may be close to a verdict.Ryutaro: No!Auchi: Wonderful news, Your Excellency! Wonderful!Mikotoba: Nevertheless, it cannot be denied... ...that this testimony begs one very large question.Auchi: What question?Mikotoba: Exclusive news...a startling photograph... All the makings of an exceptional story for the reporter. Why then, was the story never published?Ryutaro: Oh! (That's right!)Menimemo: .........Mikotoba: It seems clear to me that there are circumstances at play here that are yet to be understood.Auchi: Hah! More pathetic excuses!Judge: Very well then, Counsel. Proceed with your cross-examination.Ryutaro: Yes, Your Excellency! (There's more to this reporter than meets the eye. He's keeping something about this case very close to his chest...)Cross-Examination - The Camera Never Lies -Menimemo: I asked the Englishwoman for an interview, but she declined. So I left the hut without making a fuss.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: You asked her for an interview, you say? Menimemo: Well, of course I did! I wanted to ask her about the incident she was involved in at the end of last year. Ryutaro: About the case in which Dr John H. Wilson lost his life? Menimemo: That's not the way I phrased it. Menimemoism calls for straight talking. 'Why did you murder Dr Wilson?' is how I put it to her. Ryutaro: ...Yes, that sort of talking is as straight as a ruler. Menimemo: Ask every question as if you're asking for a menu in a restaurant, I say. It's the best way. A veteran at the paper taught me that. Ryutaro: And how did Miss Brett answer? Menimemo: With one simple phrase: 'Mystery is a woman's charm.' ...Whew! That told me! So I waltzed right out of there. Ryutaro: (Really? Something about that doesn't quite seem to fit together...) Menimemo: Leave every room as if you're waltzing in a dance hall, I say. It's the best way. A veteran at the paper taught me that..Menimemo: Then, watching secretly from outside, I saw the woman being stabbed and the other witnesses come running.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: That was very persistent of you, considering that Miss Brett had just turned you away. Menimemo: Persistence wins the prize! Any Menimemoist will tell you that. Let them think you've left, then just when they lower their guard, that's when you swoop in for the scoop! Auchi: And the fruits of your labour are all too apparent in this telling photograph. Though I'm sure the young yokel student would rather not be reminded of this damning evidence. Ryutaro: Actually, it's thanks to that photograph that we managed to identify this witness. Menimemo: And now that you've found me, I'll tell you whatever you want to know. I've got nothing to hide! Ryutaro: ...I'm sure. Auchi: Please, do go ahead, witness. The court is eager to hear what you have to say. Menimemo: Try to stop me! There's a story to tell here, and I'm going to tell it!Menimemo: The detective realised that the victim still had a pulse, so he ran off to fetch help.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: And Soseki-san remained behind in the hut? Menimemo: That's right, yup. Our author friend here... ...was a blabbering wreck! Shaking all over, from his head to his toes. Moustache twitching! Eyes bulging! Soseki: WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?! You, you don't know the t-t-terrifying troubles that taunted me whilst travelling abroad! Back Behind Baleful Bars! ...They'll be coming for me, surely! That's all I could think. I felt as though I were gasping for air, drowning in a sea of cold sweat! Ryutaro: (Poor Soseki-san. His experiences in London have scarred him deeply.) Soseki: As the world seemed to close in around me, I quietly recited a prayer to Amida Buddha: Eternal Emptiness, Empty Eternity! ...The end is coming for me, surely! Judge: No sutras are to resound in my courtroom, please. Menimemo: And now...we come to the crucial part! That's when it happened!Menimemo: That's when this writer man here asked the woman a very significant question.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: What question? What exactly did he say? Menimemo: Well now...you should hear that from the horse's mouth, I think. Don't you, Mr Writer-Man? Soseki: AAARGH! Auchi: Out with it, you yokel hack! What did you say to her? What did you say to the dying Englishwoman? Soseki: ......... Well, in truth... ...I'd been catching crabs at the water's edge and building castles in the sand, you see. Judge: ...Well, the seaside is a place to be at leisure, I suppose... even for a grown man. Soseki: But then all of a sudden, from that little beach hut...a young girl's panic-stricken cries for help pierced the air! Ryutaro: Rei...! Soseki: I ran up the beach to see what was happening...to find the defendant leaning over the collapsed victim! As soon as Inspector Hosonaga saw Miss Brett on the ground, he sprinted off to get help. And then, just a moment later, I heard a faint moan! A moan from the dead Englishwoman... I NEARLY JUMPED OUT OF MY SKIN! Ryutaro: But what did you ask her, Soseki-san?! Soseki: ......... I asked her, 'Who did this to you?' Ryutaro: ...! Auchi: ...! Judge: Don't protract this any longer! How did the woman respond? Soseki: SHE DIDN'T! SHE SAID NOTHING IN RESPONSE! ...B-But... ......... Judge: When in the stand, you will answer the questions asked of you unambiguously! Now, without evasion or reticence, I demand that you amend your testimony! Soseki: ......... I WIIIIIIIIILL! Changes statement \"That's when this writer man here asked the woman a very significant question.\" to \"I asked her, 'Who did this to you?' ...But she never replied.\" Changes statement \"But he didn't say anything about that in his testimony! Which is why Menimemoism demands I reveal it now!\" to \"She just lifted a trembling finger...and pointed in the direction of the defendant.\"Soseki: I asked her, 'Who did this to you?' ...But she never replied.Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: So you tried to find out who the culprit was! Soseki: 'He who asks a question is a fool for a minute; he who does not remains a fool forever.' And having been labelled a criminal twice during my time in Great Britain, I was quick to make up my mind... BETTER TO BE A FOOL FOR A MINUTE THAN REMAIN A FOOL IN PRISON FOREVER! Auchi: However...you've indicated that the victim failed to respond. Is that correct? Soseki: I know why. I know why the Englishwoman said nothing. SHE WAS IGNORING ME! BECAUSE OF MY STOOP AND MOUSTACHE! BECAUSE I'M JAPANESE! Ryutaro: (Oh dear... Soseki-san has really developed a dislike for the English, it seems.) Mikotoba: Having read the report on his time in Great Britain, I can't say I'm surprised at his xenophobia. Menimemo: But the Englishwoman didn't ignore you at all. ...Did she, Mr Writer-Man? Soseki: Hm? Well, yes, alright...she did respond in a manner of speaking, I suppose.Menimemo: But he didn't say anything about that in his testimony! Which is why Menimemoism demands I reveal it now!Press Ryutaro: Ryutaro: Soseki-san...are you trying to hide something? Soseki: Don't...DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT! Ryutaro: Soseki-san! You MUST tell the court everything that happened! Soseki: ......... Well, in truth... ...I'd been catching crabs at the water's edge and building castles in the sand, you see. Judge: ...Well, the seaside is a place to be at leisure, I suppose... even for a grown man. Soseki: But then all of a sudden, from that little beach hut...a young girl's panic-stricken cries for help pierced the air! Ryutaro: Rei...! Soseki: I ran up the beach to see what was happening...to find the defendant leaning over the collapsed victim! As soon as Inspector Hosonaga saw Miss Brett on the ground, he sprinted off to get help. And then, just a moment later, I heard a faint moan! A moan from the dead Englishwoman... I NEARLY JUMPED OUT OF MY SKIN! Ryutaro: But what did you ask her, Soseki-san?! Soseki: ......... I asked her, 'Who did this to you?' Ryutaro: ...! Auchi: ...! Judge: Don't protract this any longer! How did the woman respond? Soseki: SHE DIDN'T! SHE SAID NOTHING IN RESPONSE! ...B-But... ......... Judge: When in the stand, you will answer the questions asked of you unambiguously! Now, without evasion or reticence, I demand that you amend your testimony! Soseki: ......... I WIIIIIIIIILL! Changes statement \"That's when this writer man here asked the woman a very significant question.\" to \"I asked her, 'Who did this to you?' ...But she never replied.\" Changes statement \"But he didn't say anything about that in his testimony! Which is why Menimemoism demands I reveal it now!\" to \"She just lifted a trembling finger...and pointed in the direction of the defendant.\"Soseki: She just lifted a trembling finger...and pointed in the direction of the defendant.Press Ryutaro: Leads to: \"Miss Brett pointed a finger at the defendant...?\"Ryutaro: Poor Soseki-san has been fidgeting constantly in the stand next to Menimemo-san.Mikotoba: Yes, like a naughty child who's waiting for punishment from his parents. It rather reminds me of you when you were younger.Ryutaro: I, I was like that?!Mikotoba: ...Never mind that now. The question is, how far can we trust this reporter's account of events? We must focus our energies on gathering information and establishing facts.Ryutaro: Yes!Ryutaro: Miss Brett pointed a finger at the defendant...? Soseki-san! Is that really true?Soseki: ......... It's not easy to stand here and say this, but... ...when we first entered the beach hut... ...the Englishwoman was sprawled on the floor before us, with the student girl standing on the far side of her. And when I asked 'Who did this to you?'... ...the Englishwoman summoned her last ounce of strength to point a trembling finger at the back of the hut. Which was, it can't be denied, in the direction of the student girl who stands accused today.Ryutaro: No...Judge: Soseki-san! Why on earth did you neglect to mention this in your original testimony?Soseki: B-B-But... 'FIDDLESTICKS,' I say!Judge: This is not a British court of law. You will respond in Japanese.Soseki: Yes, of course! The Englishwoman did point her finger towards the back of the hut, but! ...But I was trembling...and she was trembling...and everything was a blur. And thinking about it, I feel as though perhaps she was pointing in a slightly different direction. Actually, NO! Not SLIGHTLY! In a VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION to where the student girl was standing! To somewhere at the back of the hut...where nobody was standing at all!Ryutaro: You mean that your memory of events, and the direction in which the victim was pointing are both unclear?Soseki: Yes! That's it! Unclear! I'm very, very unclear!Auchi:Auchi: Your Excellency! Surely this proves the matter beyond all reasonable doubt! Yes, the woman may barely have been conscious, and yes, perhaps her finger wavered slightly... ...but there can be no doubt that this was an attempt by the victim to confirm the identity of her assailant! ...Why? Because as the court can see...there was no one other than the accused in the direction the victim was pointing! It is now abundantly clear that no one besides the accused could possibly have committed this crime!Judge: ...I am inclined to agree. And in the absence of any credible argument to the contrary, I believe we can now conclude this trial.Ryutaro: No... NOOOOOOOOO!Menimemo: Heh heh heh... The headline's writing itself! 'Dashing Lawyer's Hopes Dashed!' 92 point across the whole page. We'll do an extra edition!Mikotoba: This is a serious blow, Susato. Unless we're able to identify the true culprit, and substantiate our claim with evidence... ...the judge will give his ruling and the trial will be over!Ryutaro: But, but that's impossible, Father! We don't even know how the crime was committed yet!Mikotoba: Impossible though the task may seem, we have no choice. We must think back over everything we've learnt thus far. Somewhere in all those details, I'm confident we'll find the clue we need.Ryutaro: (Rei gave us her account of how events unfolded in the defendants' antechamber before the trial resumed. She told us what happened at the precise moment Miss Brett was killed.)Rei: The Englishwoman was sitting at the back of the hut, listening to what I was saying. And then a moment later... ...she suddenly got to her feet... ...before collapsing on the floor in front of me...with a knife in her back.Ryutaro: (How could Miss Brett have been stabbed in the back in a beach hut that was empty but for herself and Rei? Somewhere amid all the information we've gathered so far, there must be an answer to that question!)Judge: I take it then, that the defence has nothing further to add.Auchi: So, the gallant yokel student's luck finally runs out. I can't say I'm surprised.Judge: In that case, I am ready to deliver my final verdict on this matter.Ryutaro: (This is a crucial turning point now. If I can't establish what really happened, it's over. Where was the real culprit hiding? And how did he or she stab the victim?)I know how! Ryutaro: Leads to: \"Your Excellency! I respectfully ask you to postpone your adjudication for the time being.\"I don't know Ryutaro: (I'm just not in a position to establish what actually happened at this point in time. But if I fail to come up with something...) Mikotoba: If we fail to present a credible alternative to the judge, this trial will reach a very unfavourable conclusion. There's no time to hesitate here, Susato! Ryutaro: ......... I understand. I'll worry about whether or not I can establish an alternative theory after I've established it! Mikotoba: ......... Whatever you really mean by that...it's worth a shot! Ryutaro: Leads to: \"Your Excellency! I respectfully ask you to postpone your adjudication for the time being.\"Ryutaro: Your Excellency! I respectfully ask you to postpone your adjudication for the time being.Judge: Oh? ...To what end, Counsel?Ryutaro: The defence would like to present the court with an alternative theory. An alternative theory that can explain... ...who the victim was actually trying to implicate with her dying gesture!Auchi:Auchi: An alternative theory? Hah! None exists!Ryutaro:Ryutaro: There was someone else present at the scene...who could have committed this crime!Auchi: Whaaat?Ryutaro: And the victim, Miss Brett, tried to reveal who it was to those around her at the time... ...by mustering all her remaining strength...and pointing a trembling finger in the killer's direction!Auchi: This, this is fiction! Fantasy!Judge: Very well. As you seem so sure of yourself, Counsel, I am prepared to hear your 'alternative theory'. So, young Ryutaro Naruhodo...Ryutaro: Yes, Your Excellency!Judge: You will present your latest theory to the court by means of this plan. At the moment the victim was stabbed, where exactly are you proposing the culprit was concealed?Present area outside hut, west of stool Ryutaro: Leads to: \"Naruhodo-san would never give up. And I'm a Naruhodo now...\"Present anywhere else Ryutaro: Ryutaro: The true culprit...was in this area here! Judge: There, Counsel? Ryutaro: That's right, Your Excellency. I believe that the culprit was hiding in the location I've indicated. Judge: ...Why? Ryutaro: Oh! Well, um...that's rather hard to say, um... Judge: Hmph. Clearly this particular theory needs no further consideration, given your wide-eyed look of alarm. Ryutaro: (Oh dear... I chose poorly.) Mikotoba: I suggest you begin by considering where the victim was in the moments leading up to her death. Ryutaro: Yes...of course! Judge: Perhaps you'd care to identify a more credible location, Counsel? Leads back to: \"You will present your latest theory to the court by means of this plan.\"Ryutaro: (Naruhodo-san would never give up. And I'm a Naruhodo now...) The true culprit who fatally stabbed Miss Brett...was concealed in this location here!Judge: Are you mad, Counsel? You're suggesting that the culprit was outside the hut!Menimemo: ...!Auchi: WHAAAT?!Judge: Order! Order! Order!Soseki: But student lawyer Naruhodo-san Esquire! That makes no sense at all!Menimemo: You've, you've just pointed out the exact spot where I was hiding to get my scoop snap! But I didn't see any suspicious individuals loitering about. I can swear to that!Auchi: Obviously! If the culprit had been outside the hut... ...there is no way that he or she could have stabbed the victim who was inside the hut!Ryutaro: Actually, Prosecutor Auchi...there is a way.Menimemo: Ah!Ryutaro: And...in point of fact... ...the defence can provide evidence strongly suggesting that is precisely the way Miss Brett was killed!Auchi: You're bluffing! You're, you're bluffing, you yokel-Judge: The defence's assertion is clearly too fantastical for the court to comprehend. You will need to give us more guidance, Counsel. What piece of evidence corroborates your theory that the victim was stabbed from outside the hut?Present Crime Scene Photograph Ryutaro: Leads to: \"The, the original photographic print of the crime scene?\"Present anything else Ryutaro: Ryutaro: ......... (Well, I've presented it now... ...but I haven't the first idea why I chose this piece of evidence!) Judge: Counsel. You're suggesting that this piece of evidence bears out your theory as to how the victim was stabbed? Ryutaro: It's...something of a windfall...Your Excellency. Auchi: I think the word you were looking for, Counsel, was 'downfall'! Mikotoba: If your theory is correct, and the knife was thrust into Miss Brett's back from outside the hut... ...there should be a visible trace somewhere. Ryutaro: A trace? Yes...on the hut itself... (Armed with that idea, I must look through the Court Record again.) Your Excellency! The defence would like to present a different piece of evidence! Judge: ...Go ahead. Leads back to: \"What piece of evidence corroborates your theory that the victim was stabbed from outside the hut?\"Judge: The, the original photographic print of the crime scene?Ryutaro: Yes. It's clearly visible in this print: The trace of the fatal thrust that was delivered from outside the beach hut.Auchi:Auchi: D-Do you take us for fools?! There's no hint of any such thing!Ryutaro: I'm not sure that everyone present would agree. Someone, at least, appears to have noticed what it is that I'm referring to.Judge: Counsel! Once again, I must call on you to be explicit for the court. Where on this photograph is the trace of the stabbing, which you claim took place from outside the hut?Present slit on back wall Ryutaro: Leads to: \"Look closely just here...\"Present anywhere else Ryutaro: Ryutaro: Well! It's right here! Judge: This is some remnant of the attack that took place? Ryutaro: Well! I think it might be! Auchi: Preceding your remarks with a spirited 'Well!' wont' give them any more credence. Ryutaro: ......... Well... Judge: No, Counsel, I'm afraid a spirited penalty is in order for that dismal display. Mikotoba: If the blade penetrated the victim's back from the far side of the reed screens... ...where would you expect to see some trace of it remaining? Ryutaro: Ah... Yes! Leads back to: \"Counsel! Once again, I must call on you to be explicit for the court.\"Ryutaro: Look closely just here... In the screen at the back of the hut, you can see the effects of a blade having been forced through the reeds.Auchi: N-No, I can't! I, I can't see any such thing!Ryutaro: It's true that the hut in question had four walls as you'd expect. However... ...by parting the reeds, a knife blade could easily penetrate them.Judge: This is extraordinary!Ryutaro: Yes... ...the true culprit actually stabbed the victim from outside the beach hut!Soseki: Ah...Ryutaro: And of everyone present at the scene, there is only one person who could have done that. Only one person who was directly outside the hut when Miss Brett was killed. Raiten Menimemo-san! It could only have been you!Menimemo: Hnnn...nnngh... NAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOO!Auchi:Auchi: This preposterous idea leaves me almost speechless! Just look at the photograph again! The victim lies almost exactly in the centre of the beach hut, does she not? Are we to assume, as part of this farcical scenario, that the assailant was a knife-thrower?Ryutaro:Ryutaro: No, of course not.Auchi: We're not?Ryutaro: If you recall the testimony of the defendant about the events just before the victim's death...Rei: Inside the beach hut, I confronted Miss Brett. But she just sat on a stool at the back of the hut, smiling sweetly at me as if she knew she was untouchable.Auchi: A, a stool...Ryutaro: Have another look at the photograph. The slit in the reed screen... ...would align perfectly with the back of a person who was sitting on that stool.Judge: My word... So...in fact, the victim was...Ryutaro: ...Killed whilst sitting on that stool...by a stab wound to her back delivered through the reed screen!Auchi: Ah!Ryutaro: Having been attacked, Miss Brett rose to her feet instinctively. But then, unable to speak, she collapsed on the floor in the middle of the hut... ...before the defendant, Membami-san's appalled eyes. And that, Your Excellency...is the truth of what happened on the beach that day!Menimemo: .........Ryutaro: By your silence, Menimemo-san... ...I take it that you don't deny the charge.Menimemo: .........Auchi: This... This is... ...ABSUUUUUUUUURD!Judge: That will do! It would appear that we have a tacit admission of guilt from the witness. Accordingly, this court has successfully established the truth of this matter. Which means that the defendant, Membami-san, is innocent of the crime.Ryutaro: (Oh, thank goodness! I finally made him cave.)Mikotoba: I must say...I've never been more proud.Auchi: No... This can't be... The Auchi clan can't... What of my growth? My growth of hope! It, it wasn't all an apparition! I can't accept this! I won't!Judge: I see no reason for the continuance of this trial. I will therefore move to conclude proceedings by delivering my final verdict and-???:Menimemo: Hah...hah...hah... Well, this is all very convenient. This is how the highest court in our mighty empire delivers justice, is it? Suppressing well-meaning citizens' freedom to speak and branding them as criminals...Ryutaro: But... ...we've established that the victim was stabbed from outside the hut, through the reed screen walls!Mikotoba: And no one but you was in place at the time to have his hand on the hilt of the blade. ...It's a perfectly logical deduction.Menimemo: So...your argument hinges on the location of whoever stabbed the Englishwoman, does it? Well...it seems a little irrelevant now.Ryutaro: Irrelevant?Menimemo: Where she was stabbed, how she was stabbed... ...it doesn't matter. I mean, whether she was stabbed at all makes no difference, if you think about it. After all... ...this trial's already shown the whole thing hinges on something else!Ryutaro: What...what are you talking about?Menimemo: Brace yourself...little man. I'm talking about the fact that everything's changed... ...because of the dirt YOU dug up!Ryutaro: What?!Judge: Enough obscurity! Explain yourself, witness!Menimemo: What's to explain? I'm talking about the poison, of course.Auchi: The...poison...?Menimemo: Let's ask the professor for a comment on the situation, shall we? I understand that a deadly poison you were developing was stolen from your laboratory. Correct? And it's been shown that this poison was administered to the victim, Miss Brett. Is that right?Mikotoba: ...That is correct. The unusual constriction of the victim's pupils are a sure sign that this particular poison was used.Menimemo: I see, I see. So...presumably that means... ...that the victim already had the poison in her body...before she was stabbed?Ryutaro: Ah!Mikotoba: Given that her pupils were clearly constricted...it seems highly likely, yes. If she had been dead already, the poison could not have circulated in her blood.Auchi: ......... Tsh huh huh... Ah, how refreshing to hear the argument of a metropolitan mind. Precisely! It matters not a jot who stabbed whom in whose back and with whose blade! Because, quite simply...the Englishwoman's life was taken not by the knife...but by the poison!Ryutaro:Ryutaro: But...that can be explained by the poison being on the blade, as I already-Auchi:Auchi: Ta ha ha ha ha! Forgotten already, have we, yokel? During these very proceedings, the laboratory of the professor at your side assisted in proving... ...that the blade of the weapon used to attack the victim had no trace of poison on it whatsoever!Ryutaro: Ugh...Menimemo: So let me get this down: the 'facts', as skilfully established by the defence in this trial... ...turn out to be a headline-making red herring! ...Is that about right?Ryutaro: Ugh...um...well... AAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!Judge: Order! Order! Order! But...where does this leave us? How, in that case, did the poison enter the victim's body?Mikotoba: There is an undeniably obvious answer to that. The lady most likely imbibed it.Ryutaro: You mean she drank it?Mikotoba: Have another look at the photograph here. As you can see... ...a bottle of carbonated water and a glass had been knocked onto the sandy floor of the beach hut. The poison could have been slipped into either.Ryutaro: ...! (So somebody made Miss Brett drink it...)Menimemo: Well, what do you know? Look at those dashing eyes! This will make a great front-page shot! Hey! Why the bewitching stare? After all, I'm the last person you should be looking at. It would make no sense at all that I poisoned the woman, would it? I mean...that's been established already!Ryutaro:Ryutaro: Established? What are you talking about?Menimemo: Hm? Don't tell me you've forgotten? That's a little hard to believe, given that the person who established it... ...was you!Ryutaro: Me?! (What on earth does he mean?)Menimemo: Ooh! Let me capture those wide eyes! This is prime press fodder, this is!Judge: It would seem that this trial is not destined to end yet after all. I hereby call upon the witness to give further testimony.Menimemo: That's great, that is! Let me get a shot of that magnificent beard, Your Excellency!Judge: You claim it to be impossible that you were the one responsible for administering the poison to the victim. You will explain to the court in your testimony the basis upon which you make such a claim!Menimemo: I'm a journo and I'm a man... I've never tried to run or hide from anything in my life. And I'm not about to start now! Because that's...Menimemoism!Ryutaro: (For a brief moment, I thought I'd illuminated the truth. But it's slipped right back into obscurity again... Just where is this trial going to take us...?)Witness Testimony - Complete Innocence -Menimemo: Oh yes, I stabbed the Englishwoman. And it's that very fact that proves I'm innocent! Because why would I have bothered to stab the woman if I'd already poisoned her? When I heard the student girl and that pompous English murderer arguing...it got my goat. If the courts weren't going to punish Brett for what she did, someone else would have to see justice done!Ryutaro: So...you admit it then? That everything happened as I described... That you are the one who stabbed Miss Brett in the back through the reed screen!Menimemo: ......... You can blame this miserable country of ours.Ryutaro: ...!Menimemo: A country that bows to the pressure of foreign powers and lets murderers walk free! What kind of future can a country like that have? That's why I did it! I did what our pathetic leaders didn't have the guts to do! Slap bang in the middle of that charming lady's back! I plunged the blade of sweet justice right in there! As someone who spends his life seeing that the truth is told... ...I feel really, really awful about giving false information in my testimony before. But as it turns out... ...there was somebody else who had it in for the victim and got to her before me!Ryutaro: ...!Menimemo: That's right...you guessed it! That pretty little student girl. Now there's a woman after my own heart!Ryutaro: You're implicating Rei again...Menimemo: She's the one who gave the poison to the Englishwoman and ended her pitiful existence! And suddenly, snap! This journo here is off the hook!Judge: Hmmm...the argument is sound, certainly. If the witness had administered the poison himself, he need only have waited for it to take effect. Subsequently stabbing the victim in the back would have been entirely nonsensical.Auchi: And therefore, this reporter had nothing to do with the poisoning. ...Yes, it's all quite logical.Menimemo: That's right, it is! Logical and true. I'm glad you've all seen the light. Justice at last!Ryutaro: (This is unbelievable. And after I'd made so much progress in proving his guilt. ...Is he going to get away with it now?) ......... (Think of Kazuma-sama and Naruhodo-san... They never stopped looking for a way forward until the judge's final gavel!)Judge: Very well then, Counsel.

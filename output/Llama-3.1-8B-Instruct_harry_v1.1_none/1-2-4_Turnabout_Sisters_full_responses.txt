Testimony 4 states that White saw a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair, which implies that the victim was attacked by someone other than Maya, who has short hair. However, Testimony 7 and Testimony 8 describe the victim running away and Maya giving chase, suggesting that Maya is the one who attacked the victim.

{"evidence": 1, "testimony": 4}
Testimony 3 states that the victim ran to the right with the last of her strength, and Testimony 4 states that the killer chased her and delivered the final blow, implying that the victim was hit while running to the right. However, Testimony 1 states that the victim first ran to the left, which contradicts the implication that the victim was hit while running to the right.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
Testimony 2 states that Mia ran to the left, but Testimony 3 states that the victim (Mia) dodged the attack and then ran for the door, which implies that the victim was not hit. This contradicts the implication that Mia was killed with a single blow in Testimony 5.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 5}
Testimony 1 states that White entered the Fey & Co. Law Offices, but Testimony 3 states that White saw a glass light stand, which is not consistent with the fact that White was placing a wiretap, as mentioned in Testimony 2.

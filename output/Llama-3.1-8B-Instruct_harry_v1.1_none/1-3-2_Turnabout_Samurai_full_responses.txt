Testimony 7 states that Oldbag saw Powers walking towards the studio at 2:00 PM, but Testimony 5 states that the murder happened at 2:30 PM, which means that Powers could not have been walking towards the studio at the time of the murder.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 7}
Testimony 2 states that no one else went to the studio before the time of the murder, but Testimony 1 states that Will Powers was the only person Oldbag saw go to the studio before then. However, Evidence 5 shows a photo of the Steel Samurai (Will Powers) walking towards the studio at 2:00 PM, which is before the time of the murder.

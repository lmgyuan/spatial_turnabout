Testimony 3 states that Butz heard a single gunshot, but Testimony 1 states that Butz was looking for something and found it, which implies that he was on the lake and might have seen or heard something related to the murder, but Testimony 4 states that he didn't notice the boat, which contradicts the implication that he was on the lake and might have seen the boat.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
Testimony 5 states that Butz heard the gunshot just when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!", which implies that the gunshot happened at 12:00 AM on December 25th. However, Evidence 3 states that the victim's time of death was sometime on the 24th or 25th, which contradicts the implication that the gunshot happened at 12:00 AM on December 25th.

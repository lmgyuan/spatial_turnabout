{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
Testimony 2 states that the time on the TV was three hours off, which would mean it was 4PM instead of 1PM. However, Testimony 4 states that Sahwit thought it was 1PM because of this. This is a contradiction because if the time on the TV was three hours off, then it would have been 4PM, not 1PM.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
Testimony 0 states that Sahwit saw the time, not heard it. This contradicts Testimony 1 which states that Sahwit saw a table clock, implying that he saw the time on the clock, but this is actually Testimony 3, Testimony 3 is actually a statement that matches the clock.

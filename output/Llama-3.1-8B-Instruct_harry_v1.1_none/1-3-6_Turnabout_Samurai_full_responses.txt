Testimony 4 states that Vasquez and Manella took a 15-minute break at 2:30 PM, but Testimony 5 states that they ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer, which implies that they were in the trailer at 2:30 PM. However, Evidence 3 states that the time of death was 2:30 PM, which suggests that Vasquez and Manella were not in the trailer at the time of the murder.

Testimony 7 states that Vasquez left the action scenes behind because Hammer was injured, but this contradicts the implication that Vasquez was present when the body was found, as stated in Testimony 0.

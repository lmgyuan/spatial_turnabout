Testimony 4 states that there was blood found on the victim's finger, but Testimony 5 states that the victim wrote the killer's name with blood, implying that the blood was used for writing, not found on the finger. This contradicts the implication that the blood on the finger is the same blood used for writing.
Testimony 3 states that April saw Maya hit the victim with "that weapon", which April later identifies as "The Thinker" in Testimony 4. However, Testimony 1 and Testimony 2 describe the victim dodging an attack and running off to the right, suggesting that the attacker did not hit the victim. This contradicts the implication that Maya hit the victim with "The Thinker".

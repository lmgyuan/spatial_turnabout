Testimony 3 states that the police showed up within 10 minutes, but Evidence 2 states that the time of death was 6:28 PM, which means that the police would have had to arrive before 6:38 PM to meet the 10-minute time frame. However, Testimony 2 states that Wellington made the call at 6:45 PM, which contradicts the implication that the police arrived within 10 minutes.

Testimony 2 states that Cody went through the woods, off the path, to avoid being caught by Oldbag, but Testimony 3 states that Cody was going for the studio, implying that he took the main path. However, Evidence 11 states that Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, which suggests that Cody would not have been able to reach the studio by taking the main path.

Testimony 2 states that Cody held up his camera to take a picture of the Steel Samurai escaping from the villain, but Testimony 3 states that the lens wouldn't open in time, so he missed it. However, Testimony 5 states that Cody took a few shots, but then erased them, which contradicts the implication that he missed the shot.

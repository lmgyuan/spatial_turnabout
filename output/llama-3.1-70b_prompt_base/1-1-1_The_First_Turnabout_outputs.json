    "cot": "Evidence 2 (Statue) and Testimony 3 seem to contradict each other. The statue is described as being heavy, suggesting that it could have been used as a blunt object to cause the loss of blood due to blunt trauma as stated in Evidence 1 (Cindy's Autopsy Report). However, Testimony 3 describes the discovery of the body without mentioning any signs of struggle or a heavy object nearby.\n\nHowever, the more apparent contradiction is between Evidence 4 (Blackout Record) and Testimony 8 (Sahwit's testimony about the time he called the police). According to Evidence 4, the electricity in the building was out from noon to 6 PM, which means the phone in the apartment wouldn't have been working during this time. However, Testimony 8 states that Sahwit called the police at 1:00 PM, which is within the blackout period. This suggests that Sahwit's testimony about the time he called the police may be incorrect or that he didn't try to call from the apartment phone.\n"

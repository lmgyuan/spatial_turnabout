    "cot": "The Samurai Sword (Evidence 12) and Testimony 2 (Lang) seem to contradict each other. The Samurai Sword evidence states that it is a weapon used on stage, but it is not mentioned that it was covered in blood. However, Testimony 2 by Lang states that the Samurai Sword was found beside the victim, covered in the victim's blood, which implies that the sword was used to kill the victim. This contradicts the fact that the sword is used on stage, suggesting that it was not used to kill the victim.\n"

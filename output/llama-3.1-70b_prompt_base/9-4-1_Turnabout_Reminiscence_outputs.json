The Knife evidence states that it was used to kill Faraday and has the secret ability to change into a key, which suggests that the knife was used by the Yatagarasu. However, Testimony 2 by Franziska states that Rell, while on the brink of death, stole Faraday's knife and stabbed him, which implies that Rell was the one who used the knife to kill Faraday. This contradicts the fact that the knife was used by the Yatagarasu, suggesting that Franziska's testimony is not accurate.\n"

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Lotta (Testimony 0) that says she saw the man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth. This implies that Lotta has a clear view of the man on the boat.

However, we have Evidence 2, which is "Lotta's Camera". This evidence could potentially show that Lotta's camera was not functioning properly, or that she was not in a position to take a clear photo of the man on the boat.

But what if Lotta's camera was actually functioning properly, and she did take a clear photo of the man on the boat? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Lotta's camera was not functioning properly, or if she was not in a position to take a clear photo of the man on the boat, it's unlikely that she would be able to clearly identify the man on the boat.

We have Evidence 4, which is "Lake Photo". This evidence could potentially show that the photo taken by Lotta is not clear enough to identify the man on the boat.

So, what evidence contradicts Lotta's testimony? We have Evidence 4, which is "Lake Photo". This evidence implies that the photo taken by Lotta is not clear enough to identify the man on the boat, which would contradict her testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Lotta (Testimony 3) that says the camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower. This implies that Lotta's camera was set up for a specific purpose, which was to take pictures of a meteor shower.

However, we have Evidence 2, which is "Lotta's Camera". This evidence could potentially show that Lotta's camera was not set up to take pictures of a meteor shower, but was actually set up to take pictures of something else.

But what if Lotta's camera was actually set up to take pictures of a meteor shower? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Lotta's camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower, it's unlikely that she would have been able to take a clear photo of the man on the boat, as mentioned in Testimony 0.

We have Testimony 4, which says that Lotta looked with her binoculars when she heard a noise out on the lake. This implies that Lotta was not using her camera to observe the lake.

So, what evidence contradicts Lotta's testimony? We have Evidence 2, which is "Lotta's Camera". This evidence implies that Lotta's camera was not set up to take pictures of a meteor shower, but was actually set up to take pictures of the man on the boat, which would contradict her testimony.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Lotta (Testimony 5) that says when she heard the "bang" she looked right straight out at that lake. This implies that Lotta was looking directly at the lake when she heard the gunshot.

However, we have Evidence 4, which is "Lake Photo". This evidence could potentially show that the photo taken by Lotta does not match the description of the scene she provided.

But what if Lotta's photo does not show the entire lake, or does not show the boat clearly? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Lotta was looking directly at the lake when she heard the gunshot, it's unlikely that she would have been able to take a clear photo of the entire lake, including the boat.

We have Testimony 6, which says that there wasn't much else to look at, so Lotta just watched that boat the whole time. This implies that Lotta was focused on the boat.

So, what evidence contradicts Lotta's testimony? We have Evidence 4, which is "Lake Photo". This evidence implies that Lotta's photo does not show the entire lake, or does not show the boat clearly, which would contradict her testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Edgeworth (Testimony 4) that says he picked up something heavy and threw it at Mr. Yogi. This implies that Edgeworth was the one who picked up the object.

However, we have Evidence 1, which is "Popper". This evidence could potentially show that the object that was picked up was actually a popper, and that it was not thrown at Mr. Yogi by Edgeworth.

But what if the popper was actually thrown at Mr. Yogi by Edgeworth? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the popper was actually thrown at Mr. Yogi by Edgeworth, it's unlikely that he would have been able to throw it with enough force to cause harm.

We have Testimony 5, which says that there was a single gunshot, then a scream. This implies that the scream was caused by the gunshot.

However, we can infer that if the popper was thrown at Mr. Yogi, it's possible that the scream was caused by the popper, not the gunshot.

So, what evidence contradicts Edgeworth's testimony? We have Evidence 1, which is "Popper". This evidence implies that the object that was picked up was actually a popper, which would contradict Edgeworth's testimony.

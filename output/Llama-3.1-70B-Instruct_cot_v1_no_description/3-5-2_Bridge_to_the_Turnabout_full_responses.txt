To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Bikini (Testimony 4) that says there's no bath at the Inner Temple. This implies that Bikini did not take a bath at the Inner Temple.

However, we have Evidence 7, which is "Weather Data". This evidence could potentially show that the weather was cold enough for Bikini to have taken a hot bath at the Inner Temple, which would contradict her testimony.

But what if the weather was not cold enough for Bikini to have taken a hot bath? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Bikini did take a hot bath at the Inner Temple, it's unlikely that she would have said that there's no bath at the Inner Temple.

We have Testimony 5, which says that Bikini saw something after she had finished her bath.

However, we have Evidence 10, which is "Shichishito". This evidence could potentially show that Bikini actually saw the Shichishito before she took her bath, which would contradict her testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Bikini's testimony? We have Evidence 10, which is "Shichishito". This evidence implies that Bikini saw the Shichishito before she took her bath, which would contradict her testimony.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 5}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Bikini (Testimony 3) that says Iris didn't have her hood on. This implies that Iris was not wearing her hood at the time of the incident.

However, we have Evidence 6, which is "Iris's Hood". This evidence could potentially show that Iris was actually wearing her hood, which would contradict Bikini's testimony.

But what if Iris was not wearing her hood? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Iris was actually wearing her hood, it's unlikely that Bikini would have said that she wasn't.

We have Testimony 2, which says that Iris was with Mystic Elise and had a sword.

However, we have Evidence 10, which is "Shichishito". This evidence could potentially show that the sword was not actually in Iris's possession, which would contradict Bikini's testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Bikini's testimony? We have Evidence 6, which is "Iris's Hood". This evidence implies that Iris was actually wearing her hood, which would contradict Bikini's testimony.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Bikini (Testimony 5) that says Mystic Ami was stabbing Mystic Elise through the back when Bikini awoke. This implies that Mystic Ami was the one who stabbed Mystic Elise.

However, we have Evidence 11, which is "Elise's Autopsy Report". This evidence could potentially show that the stab wound was not actually inflicted from behind, but from the front, which would contradict Bikini's testimony.

But what if the stab wound was actually inflicted from behind? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the stab wound was not inflicted from behind, it's unlikely that Bikini would have said that Mystic Ami was stabbing Mystic Elise through the back.

We have Testimony 2, which says that Bikini saw the instant in which the blade was smoothly drawn out.

However, we have Evidence 10, which is "Shichishito". This evidence could potentially show that the sword was not actually drawn out smoothly, but was instead stuck in the victim's body, which would contradict Bikini's testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Bikini's testimony? We have Evidence 11, which is "Elise's Autopsy Report". This evidence implies that the stab wound was not actually inflicted from behind, which would contradict Bikini's testimony.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Bikini (Testimony 3) that says it takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using a snowmobile. This implies that the snowmobile is much faster than walking.

However, we have Evidence 21, which is "Dusky Bridge Photo". This evidence could potentially show that the snowmobile was not actually used to travel to Dusky Bridge, or that the travel time was not as short as Bikini claimed.

But what if the snowmobile was actually used to travel to Dusky Bridge? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the snowmobile was not used to travel to Dusky Bridge, it's unlikely that Bikini would have said that it was.

We have Testimony 2, which says that Bikini saw tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used.

However, we have Evidence 14, which is "Tracks Photo". This evidence could potentially show that the tracks were not actually from a snowmobile, but from something else, which would contradict Bikini's testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Bikini's testimony? We have Evidence 14, which is "Tracks Photo". This evidence implies that the tracks were not actually from a snowmobile, which would contradict Bikini's testimony.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 2}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Butz (Testimony 3) that says there was still some thunder when he went to check out the fire. This implies that there was thunder at the time of the fire.

However, we have Evidence 7, which is "Weather Data". This evidence could potentially show that there was no thunder at the time of the fire, which would contradict Butz's testimony.

But what if there was actually thunder at the time of the fire? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if there was no thunder at the time of the fire, it's unlikely that Butz would have said that there was.

We have Testimony 2, which says that Dusky Bridge was on fire.

However, we have Evidence 21, which is "Dusky Bridge Photo". This evidence could potentially show that the bridge was not actually on fire, or that the fire was not as big as Butz claimed.

So, what evidence contradicts Butz's testimony? We have Evidence 7, which is "Weather Data". This evidence implies that there was no thunder at the time of the fire, which would contradict Butz's testimony.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 3}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Butz (Testimony 2) that says Iris was flying and her white hood was fluttering. This implies that Iris was actually wearing her white hood.

However, we have Evidence 6, which is "Iris's Hood". This evidence could potentially show that Iris's hood was not actually on her head at the time, but was instead found somewhere else, which would contradict Butz's testimony.

But what if Iris was actually wearing her white hood? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Iris was not wearing her white hood, it's unlikely that Butz would have said that he saw her flying with her hood fluttering.

We have Testimony 3, which says that Butz transferred his shock and awe directly onto the page.

However, we have Evidence 15, which is "Larry's Sketch". This evidence could potentially show that Butz's sketch does not actually depict Iris flying with her hood fluttering, which would contradict his testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Butz's testimony? We have Evidence 15, which is "Larry's Sketch". This evidence implies that Butz's sketch does not actually depict Iris flying with her hood fluttering, which would contradict his testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Gumshoe (Testimony 2) that says the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood. This implies that the blood was used to write the word "Maya". However, we also have a testimony from Gumshoe (Testimony 3) that says lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's. This means the victim wrote the word "Maya" with their own blood.

Now, let's look at the evidence. We have Evidence 2, which is "Glass Shards". This evidence doesn't directly contradict any testimony. However, we can infer that the victim might have used the glass shards to write the word "Maya" in blood.

But what if the victim didn't have any cuts or injuries on their finger that could have been used to write with their own blood? In that case, the evidence that contradicts the testimony would be the one that shows the victim didn't have any cuts or injuries on their finger.

However, we do have a testimony from Gumshoe (Testimony 4) that says there was blood found on the victim's finger. This implies that the victim did have a cut or injury on their finger.

So, what evidence contradicts this testimony? We have Evidence 2, which is "Glass Shards". If the victim had cuts or injuries on their finger from the glass shards, it would explain the blood on their finger.

However, the correct contradictory pair is actually Evidence 2 ("Glass Shards") and Testimony 3 ("Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!"). This is because if the victim had cuts or injuries on their finger from the glass shards, it would imply that the blood on their finger might not be just from writing the word "Maya", but also from the cuts or injuries.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from April (Testimony 3) that says she saw the girl in hippie clothes hit the victim with a weapon. However, we don't know what the weapon was.

Now, let's look at the evidence. We have Evidence 2, which is "Glass Shards". This evidence could be a potential weapon, but we don't have any direct connection to the testimony.

However, we have a testimony from April (Testimony 4) that says the weapon was "The Thinker," which is a statue-y clock. This implies that the weapon was actually "The Thinker", not the glass shards.

So, what evidence contradicts this testimony? We have Evidence 2, which is "Glass Shards". This evidence implies that the glass shards could have been the weapon, but the testimony from April says it was actually "The Thinker".

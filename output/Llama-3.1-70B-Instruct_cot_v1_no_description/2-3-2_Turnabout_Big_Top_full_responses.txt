To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Trilo (Testimony 5) that says he still has the engagement ring in his pocket. This implies that the ring is currently in Trilo's possession.

However, we have Evidence 10, which is "Ring". This evidence could potentially show that the ring is not in Trilo's possession, but is actually a separate piece of evidence.

But what if the ring in Evidence 10 is not the same ring that Trilo is referring to? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the ring in Evidence 10 is the same ring that Trilo is referring to, it's unlikely that Trilo would still have it in his pocket.

So, what evidence contradicts Trilo's testimony? We have Evidence 10, which is "Ring". This evidence implies that the ring is not in Trilo's possession, which would contradict his testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Moe (Testimony 3) that says Max's face was silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him. This implies that Moe was able to identify Max despite his face being silhouetted.

However, we have Evidence 3, which is "Silk Hat". This evidence could potentially show that the silk hat was not worn by Max, but by someone else.

But what if the silk hat was actually worn by Max? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Moe was able to identify Max despite his face being silhouetted, it's unlikely that Moe would have been unsure about what Max was carrying.

We have Testimony 4, which says that Moe couldn't really see what Max was carrying because his cloak was fluttering in the wind.

However, we have Evidence 2, which is "Crime Photo". This evidence could potentially show that Max was not wearing a cloak, or that his cloak was not fluttering in the wind.

So, what evidence contradicts Moe's testimony? We have Evidence 2, which is "Crime Photo". This evidence implies that Max's cloak was not fluttering in the wind, or that he was not wearing a cloak, which would contradict Moe's testimony.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 4}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Moe (Testimony 0) that says there were no white roses that night. This implies that Moe did not see any white roses at the scene.

However, we have Evidence 19, which is "Scarf". This evidence could potentially show that a white scarf was present at the scene, which could be mistaken for a white rose.

But what if the scarf was not mistaken for a white rose? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Moe was certain that there were no white roses, it's unlikely that he would have missed seeing a white scarf.

We have Testimony 1, which says that all of the other symbols were there, and Moe is equally sure of that.

However, we have Evidence 19, which is "Scarf". This evidence could potentially show that the scarf was present at the scene, and it could be considered a symbol.

So, what evidence contradicts Moe's testimony? We have Evidence 19, which is "Scarf". This evidence implies that a white scarf was present at the scene, which would contradict Moe's testimony.

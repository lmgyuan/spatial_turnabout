To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Gumshoe (Testimony 3) that says the Jammin' Ninja's button was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's "hakama". This implies that the button was found in Mr. Engarde's clothing.

However, we have Evidence 16, which is "Jammin' Ninja's Button". This evidence could potentially show that the button was not found in Mr. Engarde's clothing, but was actually found at a different location.

But what if the button was actually found in Mr. Engarde's clothing? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the button was not found in Mr. Engarde's clothing, it's unlikely that Gumshoe would have said that it was found there.

We have Evidence 17, which is "Lotta's Photo". This evidence could potentially show that the button was actually found at a different location, which would contradict Gumshoe's testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Gumshoe's testimony? We have Evidence 17, which is "Lotta's Photo". This evidence implies that the button was not found in Mr. Engarde's clothing, which would contradict Gumshoe's testimony.

{"evidence": 17, "testimony": 3}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Oldbag (Testimony 5) that says Matt Engarde was wearing his flashy racing jacket. This implies that Matt Engarde was wearing a specific type of jacket.

However, we have Evidence 30, which is "Bellboy's Uniform". This evidence could potentially show that Matt Engarde was actually wearing a bellboy's uniform, not a racing jacket.

But what if Matt Engarde was wearing a bellboy's uniform as a disguise? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Oldbag was certain that Matt Engarde was wearing a racing jacket, it's unlikely that he would have been wearing a bellboy's uniform.

So, what evidence contradicts Oldbag's testimony? We have Evidence 30, which is "Bellboy's Uniform". This evidence implies that Matt Engarde was actually wearing a bellboy's uniform, which would contradict Oldbag's testimony.

{"evidence": 30, "testimony": 5}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Oldbag (Testimony 4) that says Matt Engarde must've worn the Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan. This implies that Matt Engarde was wearing the Nickel Samurai costume during the crime.

However, we have Evidence 2, which is "The Nickel Samurai". This evidence could potentially show that the Nickel Samurai costume was not worn by Matt Engarde during the crime.

But what if the Nickel Samurai costume was actually worn by Matt Engarde during the crime? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Matt Engarde was not wearing the Nickel Samurai costume during the crime, it's unlikely that Oldbag would have said that he was.

We have Evidence 7, which is "Guitar Case". This evidence could potentially show that Matt Engarde was actually carrying a guitar case, not wearing the Nickel Samurai costume.

However, we have another evidence that directly contradicts Oldbag's testimony. We have Evidence 30, which is "Bellboy's Uniform". This evidence implies that Matt Engarde was actually wearing a bellboy's uniform, not the Nickel Samurai costume.

So, what evidence contradicts Oldbag's testimony? We have Evidence 30, which is "Bellboy's Uniform". This evidence implies that Matt Engarde was actually wearing a bellboy's uniform, which would contradict Oldbag's testimony.

{"evidence": 30, "testimony": 4}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Andrews (Testimony 3) that says what she saw was the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo. This implies that the crime scene was not disturbed or altered in any way.

However, we have Evidence 7, which is "Guitar Case". This evidence could potentially show that the guitar case was actually knocked over by Andrews, which would mean that the crime scene was altered.

But what if the guitar case was not knocked over by Andrews? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Andrews did knock over the guitar case, it's unlikely that she would have said that the crime scene was not disturbed.

We have Testimony 5, which says that Andrews was the one who knocked the flower vase over, where it fell onto the guitar case.

So, what evidence contradicts Andrews' testimony? We have Evidence 9, which is "Crime Photo". This evidence implies that the crime scene was actually altered, which would contradict Andrews' testimony.

However, we have another evidence that directly contradicts Andrews' testimony. We have Evidence 7, which is "Guitar Case". This evidence implies that the guitar case was actually knocked over, which would contradict Andrews' testimony.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 3}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Andrews (Testimony 2) that says the guitar case was empty. This implies that the guitar case did not contain anything.

However, we have Evidence 7, which is "Guitar Case". This evidence could potentially show that the guitar case actually contained something.

But what if the guitar case was actually empty? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the guitar case was actually empty, it's unlikely that Andrews would have opened it for no reason.

We have Testimony 3, which says that Andrews doesn't know why she opened the case.

However, we have Evidence 8, which is "Wine Glass". This evidence could potentially show that the wine glass was actually inside the guitar case, which would mean that the case was not empty.

So, what evidence contradicts Andrews' testimony? We have Evidence 8, which is "Wine Glass". This evidence implies that the guitar case was not empty, which would contradict Andrews' testimony.

{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 2}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Andrews (Testimony 3) that says Matt didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder. This implies that Matt was not accounted for during the time of the murder.

However, we have Evidence 20, which is "Matt's Note". This evidence could potentially show that Matt did have an alibi, which would contradict Andrews' testimony.

But what if Matt's note does not actually provide an alibi? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Matt's note does provide an alibi, it's unlikely that Andrews would have said that Matt didn't have an alibi.

So, what evidence contradicts Andrews' testimony? We have Evidence 20, which is "Matt's Note". This evidence implies that Matt did have an alibi, which would contradict Andrews' testimony.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 3}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Andrews (Testimony 3) that says the thought that Juan was dead didn't cross her mind. This implies that Andrews didn't suspect that Juan was dead when she first saw him.

However, we have Evidence 14, which is "Juan's Autopsy Report". This evidence could potentially show that Juan's body showed signs of being dead for some time, which would contradict Andrews' testimony.

But what if Juan's body didn't show signs of being dead for some time? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Juan's body did show signs of being dead for some time, it's unlikely that Andrews would have thought that he had just fainted.

We have Testimony 4, which says that Andrews thought Juan had just fainted or something.

However, we have Evidence 9, which is "Crime Photo". This evidence could potentially show that Juan's body was in a state that would have suggested to Andrews that he was dead, not just fainted.

So, what evidence contradicts Andrews' testimony? We have Evidence 9, which is "Crime Photo". This evidence implies that Juan's body was in a state that would have suggested to Andrews that he was dead, which would contradict Andrews' testimony.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 3}

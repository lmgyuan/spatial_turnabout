To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Powers (Testimony 5) that says the bellboy had to be the assassin. This implies that Powers is certain that the bellboy was the one who committed the crime.

However, we have Evidence 30, which is "Bellboy's Uniform". This evidence could potentially show that the bellboy was not the assassin, but was actually just a bellboy doing his job.

But what if the bellboy was actually the assassin? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the bellboy was not the assassin, it's unlikely that Powers would have said that he was.

We have Testimony 4, which says that Powers thought it was strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed.

However, we have Evidence 7, which is "Guitar Case". This evidence could potentially show that the bellboy was actually carrying something, which would contradict Powers' testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Powers' testimony? We have Evidence 7, which is "Guitar Case". This evidence implies that the bellboy was actually carrying something, which would contradict Powers' testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from de Killer (Testimony 5) that says the creation and planting of the "knife" and "button" was an act that broke the rules. This implies that the knife and button were planted as part of a setup.

However, we have Evidence 15, which is "Knife". This evidence could potentially show that the knife was actually used in the crime, not planted as part of a setup.

But what if the knife was actually used in the crime? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the knife was planted as part of a setup, it's unlikely that de Killer would have said that it was an act that broke the rules.

We have Testimony 6, which says that de Killer was referring to the act of planting the knife and button when he said that his client had "broken the rules".

However, we have Evidence 16, which is "Jammin' Ninja's Button". This evidence could potentially show that the button was actually torn off of Juan Corrida's costume during the crime, not planted as part of a setup.

So, what evidence contradicts de Killer's testimony? We have Evidence 16, which is "Jammin' Ninja's Button". This evidence implies that the button was actually torn off of Juan Corrida's costume during the crime, which would contradict de Killer's testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from de Killer (Testimony 3) that says one of the tasks was to find the bear figurine and to give it to Adrian Andrews. This implies that the bear figurine was actually given to Adrian Andrews.

However, we have Evidence 23, which is "Stuffed Bear". This evidence could potentially show that the bear figurine was not given to Adrian Andrews, but was actually found in a different location.

But what if the bear figurine was actually given to Adrian Andrews? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the bear figurine was not given to Adrian Andrews, it's unlikely that de Killer would have said that it was.

We have Testimony 4, which says that de Killer thought his client to be a man.

However, we have Evidence 25, which is "Figurine". This evidence could potentially show that the bear figurine was actually found in a location that would suggest it was given to a woman, not a man.

So, what evidence contradicts de Killer's testimony? We have Evidence 25, which is "Figurine". This evidence implies that the bear figurine was not given to Adrian Andrews, which would contradict de Killer's testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Armstrong (Testimony 3) that says she moved the mirror so it was not in the way after the incident occurred. This implies that the mirror was actually moved.

However, we have Evidence 11, which is "Tres Bien Floor Plans". This evidence could potentially show that the mirror was not actually moved, but was instead in its original position.

But what if the mirror was actually moved? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the mirror was not actually moved, it's unlikely that Armstrong would have said that she moved it.

We have Testimony 4, which says that Armstrong did not touch anything else.

However, we have Evidence 11, which is "Tres Bien Floor Plans". This evidence could potentially show that the mirror was actually moved, which would contradict Armstrong's testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Armstrong's testimony? We have Evidence 11, which is "Tres Bien Floor Plans". This evidence implies that the mirror was not actually moved, which would contradict Armstrong's testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Armstrong (Testimony 3) that says there were no other customers. This implies that the restaurant was empty except for Monsieur Elg and the old man.

However, we have Evidence 7, which is "Scooter". This evidence could potentially show that there was another person in the restaurant, which would contradict Armstrong's testimony.

But what if the scooter did not belong to another customer? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the scooter did belong to another customer, it's unlikely that Armstrong would have said that there were no other customers.

We have Testimony 6, which says that there was no time for a phony to do the acting.

However, we have Evidence 23, which is "MC Bomber". This evidence could potentially show that there was a phony or an actor involved, which would contradict Armstrong's testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Armstrong's testimony? We have Evidence 23, which is "MC Bomber". This evidence implies that there was a phony or an actor involved, which would contradict Armstrong's testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Tigre (Testimony 3) that says he has whales lined up to borrow cash from Tender Lender every single day. This implies that Tigre is a successful businessman with many clients.

However, we have Evidence 8, which is "Jean's Loan Contract". This evidence could potentially show that Tigre's business is not as successful as he claims, or that he is having financial difficulties.

But what if Tigre's business is actually successful? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Tigre's business is not as successful as he claims, it's unlikely that he would have said that he has whales lined up to borrow cash from Tender Lender every single day.

We have Testimony 4, which says that Tigre's alibi can be confirmed by Violetta.

However, we have Evidence 27, which is "Viola's Medical Papers". This evidence could potentially show that Violetta is not a reliable witness, or that she has a motive to lie about Tigre's alibi.

So, what evidence contradicts Tigre's testimony? We have Evidence 27, which is "Viola's Medical Papers". This evidence implies that Violetta is not a reliable witness, which would contradict Tigre's testimony.

{"evidence": 27, "testimony": 4}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Tigre (Testimony 4) that says he has never been to Tres Bien. This implies that Tigre has no connection to Tres Bien.

However, we have Evidence 24, which is "Tres Bien Matches". This evidence could potentially show that Tigre has a connection to Tres Bien, which would contradict his testimony.

But what if Tigre is telling the truth and has never been to Tres Bien? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Tigre does have a connection to Tres Bien, it's unlikely that he would have said that he has never been there.

We have Testimony 2, which says that Tigre set up a meeting with Glen Elg at his office, Tender Lender.

However, we have Evidence 11, which is "Tres Bien Floor Plans". This evidence could potentially show that Tigre actually met with Glen Elg at Tres Bien, not at his office, which would contradict his testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Tigre's testimony? We have Evidence 24, which is "Tres Bien Matches". This evidence implies that Tigre has a connection to Tres Bien, which would contradict his testimony.

{"evidence": 24, "testimony": 4}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Tigre (Testimony 3) that says he figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so he split. This implies that Tigre left the scene quickly.

However, we have Evidence 25, which is "Repair Bill". This evidence could potentially show that Tigre actually stayed at the scene long enough to notice some damage, which would contradict his testimony.

But what if Tigre is telling the truth and did leave the scene quickly? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Tigre did stay at the scene long enough to notice some damage, it's unlikely that he would have said that he split right away.

We have Testimony 4, which says that Tigre heard the cop's sirens on his way out and went straight back to his office.

However, we have Evidence 22, which is "Gumshoe's Lunchbox". This evidence could potentially show that Tigre actually encountered Gumshoe at the scene, which would contradict his testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Tigre's testimony? We have Evidence 25, which is "Repair Bill". This evidence implies that Tigre stayed at the scene long enough to notice some damage, which would contradict his testimony.

{"evidence": 25, "testimony": 3}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Tigre (Testimony 7) that says he was after the $100,000 and didn't have any other reason to kill the guy. This implies that Tigre's motive for the crime was solely financial.

However, we have Evidence 21, which is "Losing Horse Racing Tickets". This evidence could potentially show that Tigre had a personal stake in the outcome of the lottery, which would contradict his testimony.

But what if Tigre is telling the truth and his motive was solely financial? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Tigre did have a personal stake in the outcome of the lottery, it's unlikely that he would have said that he didn't have any other reason to kill the guy.

We have Testimony 4, which says that Elg got lucky and won half a million bucks.

However, we have Evidence 14, which is "Victim's Lottery Ticket". This evidence could potentially show that Elg's lottery ticket was not a winning ticket, which would contradict Tigre's testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Tigre's testimony? We have Evidence 21, which is "Losing Horse Racing Tickets". This evidence implies that Tigre had a personal stake in the outcome of the lottery, which would contradict his testimony.

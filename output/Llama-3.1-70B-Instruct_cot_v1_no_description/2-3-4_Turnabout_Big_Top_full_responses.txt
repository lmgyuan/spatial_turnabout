To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Acro (Testimony 2) that says lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible. This implies that Acro was not able to lift the bust and look out of the window.

However, we have Evidence 15, which is "Max G. Bust". This evidence could potentially show that the bust was actually moved or lifted, which would contradict Acro's testimony.

But what if the bust was not moved or lifted by Acro? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if Acro was not able to lift the bust and look out of the window, it's unlikely that the bust would be found in a location that suggests it was moved or lifted.

We have Testimony 5, which says that it would be unrealistic to drop the bust on the Ringmaster's head.

However, we have Evidence 11, which is "Russell's Autopsy Report". This evidence could potentially show that the Ringmaster's head was actually injured by the bust, which would contradict Acro's testimony.

So, what evidence contradicts Acro's testimony? We have Evidence 11, which is "Russell's Autopsy Report". This evidence implies that the Ringmaster's head was actually injured by the bust, which would contradict Acro's testimony.

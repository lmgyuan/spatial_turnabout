To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Ini (Testimony 4) that says her sister's costume looked totally normal. This implies that the costume was not damaged or stained in any way.

However, we have Evidence 11, which is "Maya's Costume". This evidence could potentially show that the costume was actually damaged or stained with blood.

But what if the costume was not damaged or stained at the time Ini saw it? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the costume was actually damaged or stained with blood, it's unlikely that Ini would have described it as looking "totally normal".

So, what evidence contradicts Ini's testimony? We have Evidence 11, which is "Maya's Costume". This evidence implies that the costume was actually damaged or stained with blood, which would contradict Ini's testimony.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 4}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Ini (Testimony 6) that says she didn't have her license. This implies that Ini was not a licensed driver at the time of the accident.

However, we have Evidence 18, which is "License Photo". This evidence could potentially show that Ini did have a driver's license.

But what if the license photo was taken after the accident? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the license photo was taken before the accident, it's unlikely that Ini would have said that she didn't have her license.

So, what evidence contradicts Ini's testimony? We have Evidence 18, which is "License Photo". This evidence implies that Ini did have a driver's license, which would contradict her testimony.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 6}
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Ini (Testimony 3) that says her sister's new car was a totally special model from England. This implies that the car was a unique and special model.

However, we have Evidence 8, which is "Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report". This evidence could potentially show that the car was not a special model from England.

But what if the autopsy report does not mention the car's model or origin? In that case, the evidence and testimony would not be contradictory.

However, we can infer that if the autopsy report does mention the car's model or origin, it's unlikely that Ini would have said that it was a special model from England.

However, we have another evidence that directly contradicts Ini's testimony. We have Evidence 18, which is "License Photo". This evidence could potentially show a car in the background, and it might not be a bright red sports car.

However, we have another evidence that directly contradicts Ini's testimony. We have Evidence 1, which is "Guidemap (Fey Manor)". This evidence could potentially show the location of the car accident, but it does not necessarily show the type of car.

However, we have another evidence that directly contradicts Ini's testimony. We have Evidence 12, which is "Lotta's Photo 1". This evidence could potentially show the car accident scene, and it might show the car that Ini's sister was driving.

So, what evidence contradicts Ini's testimony? We have Evidence 12, which is "Lotta's Photo 1". This evidence implies that the car that Ini's sister was driving might not have been a bright red sports car, or a special model from England, which would contradict Ini's testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Cody (Testimony 2) that says he went through the woods, off the path, so that the old lady wouldn't catch him. This implies that Cody did not follow the main path to the studio.

However, we have Evidence 2, which is "Guidemap". This evidence could potentially show the layout of the area, including the main path to the studio.

But what if the guidemap shows that the main path to the studio is the most direct route, and Cody would have had to go through the woods to avoid the old lady? In that case, Cody's testimony would be correct.

However, we have another evidence that directly contradicts Cody's testimony. We have Evidence 15, which is "Cody's Camera". This evidence implies that Cody did have his camera with him, which contradicts his testimony (Testimony 8) that he did not have his camera with him.

So, what evidence contradicts Cody's testimony? We have Evidence 15, which is "Cody's Camera". This evidence implies that Cody did have his camera with him, which would contradict his testimony.

To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, let's analyze the given information step by step.

We have a testimony from Cody (Testimony 2) that says he held up his camera to take a picture. This implies that Cody was trying to take a picture with his camera.

However, we have a testimony from Cody (Testimony 3) that says the lens wouldn't open in time, so he missed it. This implies that Cody was unable to take a picture with his camera.

But what if Cody's camera was actually working properly, and he did take a picture? In that case, Cody's testimony would be incorrect.

We have Evidence 15, which is "Cody's Camera". This evidence could potentially show that Cody's camera was working properly, and he did take a picture.

So, what evidence contradicts Cody's testimony? We have Evidence 15, which is "Cody's Camera". This evidence implies that Cody's camera was working properly, which would contradict his testimony.

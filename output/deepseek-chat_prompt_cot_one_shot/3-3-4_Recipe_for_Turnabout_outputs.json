However, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) indicates that the victim had a note saying \"Meet with The Tiger\" on the day of the incident. This suggests that Tigre and the victim had a planned meeting, which aligns with Tigre's testimony. \n\nTestimony 1 describes Tigre opening the door to the restaurant and seeing an \"ugly scene,\" and Testimony 2 describes the victim laid out on the table. These testimonies are consistent with the crime scene described in Evidence 12 (Crime Photo), which shows the victim collapsed on the table. \n\nTestimony 3 and Testimony 4 describe Tigre leaving the scene and hearing sirens on his way out. These do not directly contradict any evidence. \n\nHowever, Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) states that the victim's ear medicine was found covered in Furio Tigre's fingerprints, which contradicts Tigre's claim in Testimony 3 that he \"split\" immediately and did not interact with anything at the scene. The presence of his fingerprints on the victim's ear medicine suggests he had closer contact with the victim or the scene than he admitted. \n\nThus, the contradiction is between Tigre's testimony (Testimony 3) and Evidence 6. \n"

    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.\n\nTestimony 4 states that the victim won half a million dollars, which aligns with Evidence 14 (Victim's Lottery Ticket). However, Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) contains a doodle by the victim that says 'MC Bomber' with an arrow pointing to '100,000' that was crossed out, implying the victim was involved in a deal or owed 100,000 dollars. This contradicts Tigre's testimony in Testimony 0 where he claims to have loaned Elg 100,000 dollars, as the doodle suggests the victim was aware of the 100,000 amount but it was crossed out, possibly indicating it was no longer relevant or paid.\n"

    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.\nTestimony 0 states that Dahlia first met Phoenix Wright eight months ago in the courthouse's basement reading room. However, Evidence 10, the \"Police Report,\" indicates that eight months ago, Dahlia was involved in an incident at the District Courthouse where a lawyer was poisoned. The report suggests that Dahlia was the suspect in that incident, which contradicts her testimony about meeting Phoenix Wright under innocent circumstances."

    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.\nTestimony 2 states that \"The defendant did what was asked of him, and shot the old man in the forehead!\" However, Evidence 19, which is \"Magnifi's Letter,\" is a letter asking Zak to shoot him. This implies that the defendant was following the victim's request, which contradicts the tone of Testimony 2, where the testimony makes it sound like a malicious act rather than a requested one."

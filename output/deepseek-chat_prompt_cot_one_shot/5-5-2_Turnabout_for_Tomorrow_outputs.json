    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.\nTestimony 3 states that Fulbright is afraid of the moon rock and uses this as proof that he is not the phantom. However, Evidence 12, the \"Moon Rock Earring,\" is described as an earring given to Athena by Dr. Cykes, cut from a real moon rock used for research. This suggests that the moon rock has significant personal and emotional value, which could be a reason for the phantom to fear it, contradicting Fulbright's claim that the phantom would have no reason to fear the moon rock. Therefore, the testimony and evidence contradict each other."

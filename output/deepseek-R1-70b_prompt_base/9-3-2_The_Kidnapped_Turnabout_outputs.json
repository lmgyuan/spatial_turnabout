Let's start by looking at the evidence and testimonies provided.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the evidence list to understand what each piece indicates. Evidence 5 mentions that the kidnappers stole three costumes: Blue Badger, Proto Badger, and Bad Badger, with each assigned to specific individuals. This suggests that the costumes were used in the kidnapping and possibly in the murder.\n\nNow, looking at the testimonies, testimony 3 states that the two individuals involved planned the kidnapping. This implies a level of coordination and prior knowledge between them.\n\nI need to find a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony. If testimony 3 suggests that the two knew each other and planned the kidnapping, but evidence 5 shows that they used stolen costumes, maybe the contradiction lies in the planning aspect versus the actual evidence of costume theft. However, I'm not sure if that's a direct contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps testimony 3 implies that the kidnapping was well-planned, while evidence 5 shows that the costumes were stolen, indicating a more spontaneous act. This could be a point of contradiction.\n\nI'm not entirely certain, but I'll go with this pairing for now.\n</think>\n"

The evidence 12 is the broken prop sword, which was used to jam the door from the inside and also hit me on the temple. Lance's testimony says he was kidnapped, kept in a room, and escaped when the kidnappers left during the rain. \n\nHmm, if the sword was used to jam the door from the inside, that means someone inside was trying to keep people out. But Lance says he was alone in the room and managed to escape, which suggests the door wasn't jammed from the inside by someone else. That seems contradictory because if the door was jammed, he shouldn't have been able to escape easily.

Evidence 5 is about stolen costumes: a Blue, Proto, and Bad Badger. It lists who wore each: Blue Badger is Lauren Paups, Proto Badger is Lance Amano, and Bad Badger is Oliver Deacon. So, according to this, Lauren was wearing the Blue Badger costume.\n\nNow, looking at the testimonies. Testimony 3 says that Lauren used the gun she got from Lance. But according to evidence 5, Lauren was wearing the Blue Badger costume, which is a stolen costume used by the kidnappers. If she was wearing the Blue Badger, she might have been involved in the kidnapping or the crime, which would mean she had access to the gun. However, testimony 3 suggests she used a gun obtained from Lance, implying she wasn't necessarily wearing the costume when she got the gun.\n\nWait, but evidence 5 clearly states that the Blue Badger costume was stolen and assigned to Lauren Paups. If she was wearing it during the crime, she might not have needed to get the gun from Lance. This could mean that testimony 3 is contradicting evidence 5 because if she was wearing the Blue Badger, she might have already had the gun as part of the costume, making her statement about getting it from Lance inconsistent.\n\nSo, the contradiction is between evidence 5, which assigns the Blue Badger to Lauren, implying she was involved and had the gun, and testimony 3, where she claims she got the gun from Lance, suggesting she wasn't wearing the costume when she got it.\n</think>\n"

    "cot": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nFirst, I see that Oliver Deacon was shot dead, and the evidence suggests he was wearing a Bad Badger costume. The gun used was a revolver, and there's a mention of a gunpowder burn, indicating he was shot at close range. Now, looking at the testimonies, Lance Amano claims that Lolli acted in self-defense because Oliver was after her.\n\nBut wait, if Oliver was shot at close range, that would mean the killer was right next to him. However, Lance's testimony suggests that Lolli was acting in self-defense, implying that Oliver might have been the aggressor. This could contradict the evidence if the forensic findings don't support a self-defense scenario.\n\nLooking at the evidence list, there's a mention of a gunpowder burn on the victim's costume, which supports the close-range shot. If Lolli were acting in self-defense, there might be other signs like struggle marks or defensive wounds on Oliver, but I don't see that mentioned. The evidence seems to focus on the shooting and the costume, not on a struggle.\n\nSo, if Lance is saying Lolli acted in self-defense, but the evidence shows a point-blank shot without clear signs of a struggle, that could be contradictory. The testimony implies a different scenario than what the physical evidence suggests.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction lies between the testimony about self-defense and the evidence indicating a close-range, possibly premeditated shot without clear struggle signs.\n</think>\n"

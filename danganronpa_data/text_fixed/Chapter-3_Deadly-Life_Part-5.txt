4-Makoto2.png
: Kyoko! And...!
6-MrMonokumaAfterClass.png
7-Hiro17.png
: Phew! Man, I have have had the WORST day!
4-Makoto2.png
: ... Hiro...?
3-Kyoko2.png
: I found Hiro. He was jammed into the pool room locker. It looked like he was fast asleep, so I kicked him and woke him up.
7-Hiro17.png
: I still can't believe you kicked me! You coulda been a little more gentle about it. Like, I dunno, caress my face or somethin'!
9-Kyoko7.png
: ...That's creepy.
4-Makoto2.png
: Anyway... Kyoko, where have you been all this time? You just disappeared all of a sudden, without a trace...
3-Kyoko2.png
: There was something I had to check up on.
4-Makoto2.png
: What do you mean...?
3-Kyoko2.png
: Never mind.
4-Makoto2.png
: I *can't* never mind...!
11-Kyoko14.png
: Never. Mind. More importantly...
She says that, but...does she have any idea? Does she know people think she might be spying for the mastermind?
12-Kyoko12.png
: First of all...Hiro, you need to explain to us why you're dressed like that.
7-Hiro17.png
: Oh, uh, well...I mean... I have no idea. One second I was asleep, don't even know how that happened, then I woke up, and then I was here...
13-Byakuya2.png
: I don't care. Do something about that costume. It pains me just to look at you.
7-Hiro17.png
: Well, um... I dunno what's up with this thing, but I can't actually get it off...! A little help?
14-Celeste9.png
: Why would you make something that you can't take off by yourself?
7-Hiro17.png
: I didn't make the stupid friggin' thing!
15-Kyoko.png
: There's a clasp on the back that's keeping you from getting it off.
15-Kyoko.png
: It looks pretty sturdy. I don't think you can get it off on your own. We don't really have a choice. Let's help him.
it took everyone's help, but slowly we were able to get Hiro out of the suit. It took a few minutes, but eventually we got all the pieces off.
18-BOX15.png
19-Hiro3.png
: Whew! Free at last!
20-Hina20.png
: Isn't it kinda weird how perfectly the suit fits Hiro...?
21-Celeste2.png
: More to the point, nobody but Hiro would be able to wear that costume.
22-Hiro5.png
: Wait, what? H-Hold on a sec!
23-Celeste7.png
: Don't bother trying to act innocent. The blueprints were in your room, as well.
24-Celeste16.png
: In other words, it is obvious to everyone that you made this costume.
26-Byakuya.png
: That's true. I saw the blueprints myself.
4-Makoto2.png
: Yeah...me too...
27-Hina12.png
: Then it's obvious... The one who put this costume on and went around attacking everyone was Hiro!
14-Celeste9.png
: Shall we tie him up and gag him?
28-Hina16.png
: Good idea! We wouldn't want him killing anyone else...
30-Hiro8.png
: T-Tie me up!?
4-Makoto2.png
: H-Hold on, guys. I think that's going a little far...
31-Kyoko3.png
: He may be a suspect, but he deserves fair treatment.
22-Hiro5.png
: Yeah! I mean...attacking? Blueprints? I have no idea what you guys are talking about!
28-Hina16.png
: You can't talk your way out of this. It's been decided... You killed them!
33-Hiro10.png
: What? Killed who!? I have no idea what you're talking about! There must be a fake Hiro running around!
34-Hina15.png
: You're the only one who can wear this costume. So who else could possibly be the costumed attacker!?
35-Hiro16.png
: How do you know I'm the only one!? Maybe you should try it on yourself before you convict me!
36-Hina22.png
: Fine! If you're gonna be a jerk about it, I will!
Without missing a beat, Hina started putting on the Robo Justice costume.
38-TryingontheCostume.png
39-Hina27.png
: Ahh! See, look! See how loose it is? I mean, come on... I'm blind as a bat in here! Can't see my feet at all. I'm surprised you got anywhere in this thing!
40-Hiro19.png
: I'm telling you, it wasn't me!
39-Hina27.png
: And not to mention--! You totally can't bend at the waist! Seems like a pretty obvious oversight...
40-Hiro19.png
: That's not a very nice thing to say!
41-Celeste18.png
: ...Hmm?
40-Hiro19.png
: Er, I mean--it's not like I made it! I just got caught up in the moment...
39-Hina27.png
: Well, either way...now we know for sure, right? I mean, it seems pretty clear that nobody but Hiro coulda fit into this dumb costume!
In a huff, Hina took the suit back off again.
18-BOX15.png
43-Hina23.png
: Well? Now you're all out of excuses.
22-Hiro5.png
: N-No, see...it's cuz you're a girl! If it was another guy, then...
44-Byakuya7.png
: Makoto, go ahead.
4-Makoto2.png
: O-Okay...
Against my will, I picked up the pieces off the floor and tried putting them on.
4-Makoto2.png
: It's no good... The arms are too long. There's no way I can wear this...
36-Hina22.png
: See!? I told you it was impossible!
46-Celeste.png
: You are absolutely right. It seems this costume was made to fit Hiro's body exactly.
22-Hiro5.png
: Th-Then...there's another costume! They must have one that looks the same, but...but fits them!
47-Celeste15.png
: If you insist on this line of defense, then show us some evidence.
22-Hiro5.png
: Evidence...?
14-Celeste9.png
: You claim there is another suit, yes? Then you must find it and show it to us.
49-Hiro6.png
: Wh-What the heck!?
28-Hina16.png
: Who cares!? Hiro's the only one without an alibi during this whole thing anyway! Which is how we know it was him!
50-Hiro9.png
: I mean...is that really true? I have no idea what's been happening... Could someone, like...tell me?
22-Hiro5.png
: U-Umm...if you don't tell me what's going on, how am I supposed to understand? I think I've figured out that...someone's been killed, right? Hey, Makoto...who was it?
4-Makoto2.png
: W-Well... Two people were killed. Taka and Hifumi...
30-Hiro8.png
: What!? TWO people!?
28-Hina16.png
: Why are you freaking out? You did it.
33-Hiro10.png
: I did not!
54-Hiro12.png
: Wait, hold on... If those two are the ones that were killed...
55-Hiro15.png
: That's it! I know who did it!
15-Kyoko.png
: You may as well tell us, then.
56-Hiro2.png
: Taka and Hifumi were fighting over Alter Ego, right?
55-Hiro15.png
: Which means! Alter Ego and/or Chihiro must have done it!
57-Narration.png
: I love Hiro's accusation right there because the voice clip that plays during it says "I'm at least 30% right!" Oh, Hiro...
3-Kyoko2.png
: I see... That's unfortunate.
30-Hiro8.png
: Huh? Unfortunate...?
28-Hina16.png
: Stop trying to trick us! Just admit that you did it, okay!?
22-Hiro5.png
: I-I'm telling you, you got it all wrong!
59-Hiro7.png
: Ah, I know! That note!
4-Makoto2.png
: Note...?
22-Hiro5.png
: Last night, someone slipped a
weird note
under my door. And here's what it said... "I found a hole maybe we can use to escape. Monokuma can't find out, so don't tell anyone else for now. Let's meet in the
rec room at 1 a.m.
"
60-Hiro13.png
: But the last thing I remember is going to the rec room, then for some reason I fell asleep... The real killer probably drugged me or something!
28-Hina16.png
: ...Not a chance.
61-Kyoko11.png
: No, hold on. He could be onto something. The nurse's office did have chemicals that could do that...
62-Hina9.png
: Wh...Really?
60-Hiro13.png
: I told you. Someone's trying to set me up... A secret passage--a chance to escape... Someone wrote all that to trick me!
43-Hina23.png
: Even if that's true, you must be one dumb fish to bit every piece of bait that floats in front of you.
22-Hiro5.png
: Well after being trapped here so long, even if you know it's a lie, you gotta check, right?
33-Hiro10.png
: Gyaho! They preyed on my desire to get out of here! They deceived me!
43-Hina23.png
: I still don't buy it...
35-Hiro16.png
: Well you SHOULD buy it!
28-Hina16.png
: Okay...then show us that note!
56-Hiro2.png
: With pleasure! I have it right here in my..um, pocket... ...
65-Hiro4.png
: Looks like I lost it...
43-Hina23.png
: Yeah, sure...
33-Hiro10.png
: P-P-Please, ya gotta believe me! I wouldn't hurt a fly!
66-Celeste4.png
: As I said before, if you want us to believe you, you must produce evidence. Can you show us the note? I have no particular issue with what you claim, but if you want us to believe you, give us a reason.
49-Hiro6.png
: Wh-What the heck!? For serious!
26-Byakuya.png
: Now then, shall we resume our investigation? There's no time to waste before the class trial begins.
28-Hina16.png
: Why do we need to keep investigating? We already know who did it...
69-Hina17.png
: Why...? Why did you kill them? Tell us, Hiro...!
49-Hiro6.png
: No... It's like I said...!
69-Hina17.png
: Was it really to get the money Monokuma offered us? Yeah, that must be it... You must be totally broke and that's why...!
33-Hiro10.png
: W-Wait! That's a false accusation! Someone, help me!
34-Hina15.png
: Just be thankful we haven't bound and gagged you!
71-Byakuya3.png
: If you have time to yell and carry on, you have time to search for your evidence. Right?
59-Hiro7.png
: Ah! You're right! I need to look for the second suit and that note! Feet don't fail me now! *leaves, running*
73-Hina2.png
: I guess I'd better get back to guard duty... I was gonna ask Toko--er, Genocide Jack to switch with me... But if she and Sakura got into a fight, we'd have a catastrophe on our hands. Well, bye... *leaves*
One by one, everyone peeled away.
15-Kyoko.png
: Makoto, do you have a second?
4-Makoto2.png
: Huh?
15-Kyoko.png
: I want you to help me with the investigation.
61-Kyoko11.png
: It looks like I got a late start on this one, so I need to make up some ground.
4-Makoto2.png
: ...Sure, I don't mind helping. But can you promise me something? Later, when we have time...will you tell me
why you disappeared
?
76-Kyoko13.png
: No.
To reject me so simply...
15-Kyoko.png
: Anyway, I need your help. You don't mind, do you?
4-Makoto2.png
: ...O-Okay.
78-Kyoko19.png
: Thanks. Now then, shall we...?

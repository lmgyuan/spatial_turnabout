: The final Hangman's Gambit introduces dark green letters that take five hits to break.
4-Narration.png
: The letters are also moving at max speed and aren't on screen for very long so for the first time in the whole game, this minigame actually poses some challenge. Too bad it only happens on the final instance of the game on the hardest difficulty.

23-Makoto22.png
: Give and take!? You're so full of...shit!
22-Junko15.png
: And there's a reason I chose you guys to survive, when all the other students were dropping like flies... I mean, we built up two years of memories together. You were all my treasured classmates...
25-Junko16.png
: Sorry, that's a lie. I just figured you'd despair even more when you found out a friend had betrayed you.
12-Junko11.png
: And that's the truth! Which is what you wanted, right? So? Does it make you feel utterly lost and hopeless? You solved the mystery but despair at the truth, right!?
27-Kyoko10.png
: Don't tell me... Did you seriously count on the possibility that we would solve your mystery?
12-Junko11.png
: And if we did? Then what? Our final desire for creating this world of despair was so we could experience one last class trial. If you were bold enough to solve the mystery, only to discover that the truth was utterly hopeless...how would you react? What would you do?

: A peasant begging for his life? How delightful! We've never witnessed such a travesty firsthand...
14-Junko17.png
: But I'm sorry to say, begging doesn't work on me. All I want is despair. And there's no reason for it. And since there's no reason, there's no argument against it. There's just no understanding it. No argument, no understanding... What better definition of

He admits it!\n24-Kyoko2.png\n: I figured as much.\n25-Makoto20.png\n: But...why would you write something like that?\n22-Hiro13.png\n: B-Because...\n27-DespairSyndrome2.png\n19-Hiro6.png\n: Because\n**\nI killed her\n!\nYou're...admitting to killing her?\n22-Hiro13.png\n: Please, just let me explain what happened... I got Ogre's note, and so I headed to the rec room right before noon, just like it said...\n28-Byakuya15.png\n: You just did exactly as the note asked? What a fool...\n22-Hiro13.png\n: And when I got there...\n29-Flashback.png\n31-Sakura4.png\n: Sorry, but do you mind waiting? I asked a couple of other people to meet, as well.\n32-Hiro5.png\n: O-Okay...\n33-Sakura3.png\n: Would you like a piece of candy? It might help give you some energy.\n32-Hiro5.png\n: O-Oh, sure... Thanks.\n22-Hiro13.png\n:\nAnd that's all she said. After that, we just stood around in awkward silence... Suddenly, I heard her mutter something...\n31-Sakura4.png\n: This is it... I'm going to end it today... I'm going to end...everything.\n22-Hiro13.png\n:\nAs soon as I heard that, I just knew... I knew she was gonna try and kill me! She was gonna kill me and make her escape! So of course I freaked out, and then...\n*SMASH!*\n22-Hiro13.png\n: I saw my only chance. I grabbed a Monokuma Bottle from the shelf, and smashed it across her head! I...I hit her from behind,\n**\nbefore she had any idea\nwhat was happening!\n29-Flashback.png\n22-Hiro13.png\n: Then she just...went limp. I didn't see her move again after that. Once it was over, I pulled myself together. I realized if I didn't do something, I'd be caught and executed. So I wrote\n**\nToko's name\nin blood across a magazine on the table, and...I ran away.\n37-Toko13.png\n: I-I can't believe you! You're the worst! I hope you d-die!\n22-Hiro13.png\n: Well, that's what happened. Go ahead, roast me, boil me, do whatever you want...\n39-BoysLifeofDespair.png\n16-Hina16.png\n: You're not gonna get off that easy. It's death...death for the one that killed Sakura!\n40-Hina15.png\n: We're ready to vote now, right!? We know who did it!\n42-Kyoko11.png\n: No, I think there's more to Hiro's story...\n43-Hina9.png\n: What are you talking about? What else could there be!?\n42-Kyoko11.png\n: There's one thing that Hiro's story just now doesn't explain. And until we figure that part out, we can't consider the case closed.\nSo what is it that Hiro did that doesn't make sense...?\n> Why the magazine was hidden\n46-Makoto25.png\n: That's true. Everything you just said...it doesn't explain why\n**\nthe magazine was hidden\n, does it?\n47-Hiro7.png\n: Huh...?\n48-Makoto2.png\n: By the time the body was discovered, the magazine had been picked up and put on the shelf... Why would you take the time to write that message, then stick it somewhere we might not find it?\n32-Hiro5.png\n: Oh. Well, uh... I didn't hide it. I'm sure I just left it sitting there on the table.\n50-Makoto33.png\n: ...Really?\n37-Toko13.png\n: H-He's lying! He's g-gotta be lying!\n52-Kyoko17.png\n: I don't see any reason he would lie now, after already confessing to the crime...\n16-Hina16.png\n: Then...he's *not* lying?\n53-Byakuya.png\n: Assuming he's telling the truth, someone else must have put the magazine back on the shelf.\n55-Byakuya2.png\n: In other words, at least one other person was in the rec room both before and after the incident.\n56-Kyoko.png\n: I don't think there's any question about that.\n57-Hina22.png\n: Th-Then...who was it?\n52-Kyoko17.png\n: If they went to the trouble of hiding the magazine, they\n**\nmust not have liked\nwhat was written on it.\nSomeone who wouldn't like what had been written. There's only one choice...\n> Toko\n48-Makoto2.png\n: It had to be\n**\nToko\n, right?\n60-ClassTrialChaos.png\n61-Toko5.png\n: Wh--?\n25-Makoto20.png\n: Who else would want to hide the magazine other than the person whose name was written on it?\n16-Hina16.png\n: Is he right, Toko? Did you really go to the rec room...?\n61-Toko5.png\n: Wh-Why would I have...? Wait, b-but more important...!\n63-Toko12.png\n: That doesn't even m-matter! We already know who d-did it, right!? Hiro just a-admitted it!\n22-Hiro13.png\n: That's right. I killed her.\n25-Makoto20.png\n: No, you didn't.\n63-Toko12.png\n: Wh-Who asked you!?\n46-Makoto25.png\n: I don't doubt Hiro attacked Sakura with the bottle. But that's not where this case ends.\n43-Hina9.png\n: What do you mean...?\n52-Kyoko17.png\n: What he means is that Hiro isn't the killer.\n37-Toko13.png\n: You can't be s-serious! That's just... I don't b-believe it!\n66-Kyoko13.png\n: Hiro, tell us what happened one more time. If we go through it once more, it should become clear he's not Sakura's killer.\n32-Hiro5.png\n: Um, so...what do you want me to do?\n56-Kyoko.png\n: Just tell us what happened one more time, when you\n**\nattacked Sakura\n.\n67-Hiro4.png\n: I don't really see why, but...okay!\nWe haven't reached the end of the case just yet. Hiro isn't the real killer... And I have to prove that!\n",

A piece of glass...?\n5-Kyoko11.png\n: It had sunk to the bottom of the bottle.

So I think that must be it.\n28-Kyoko13.png\n: You're right, it must be. Of course, that leads to another question... How did a shard of glass from the window get inside this bottle of poison?\n45-Jill2.png\n: What's so strange about that!?\n21-Makoto30.png\n: What's strange is that...according to\n**\nwhat Hina told us\n...\nWhere was it the bottle of poison should have been when I broke the rec room window? According to what Hina told us...\n> Section A of the shelf\n13-Makoto31.png\n: The bottle of poison was left\n**\non the shelf in the chem lab\n. That is what you said, right Hina?\n48-Hina3.png\n: Uh...umm...\n13-Makoto31.png\n: And yet, somehow a piece of glass from the rec room window made its way into the bottle...\n50-Hiro8.png\n: Then everything Hina told us was\n**\na lie\n!?\n13-Makoto31.png\n: In reality, that bottle of poison most definitely found its way to the\n**\nrec room\n. It was there at least until the window got broken. In other words, when the locked room was unlocked. There's no other way to explain the presence of that glass in that bottle.\n28-Kyoko13.png\n: And then, once the room was opened, the bottle somehow got moved back to the shelf in the chem lab. Meanwhile, the protein can we found at the crime scene was planted there.\n34-Kyoko14.png\n: That had to be after the locked room was opened. In other words, after Sakura died.\n31-Byakuya11.png\n: Wait, hold on... You're moving too fast!\n26-Byakuya6.png\n: I'll grant you, the bottle of poison may well have been in the rec room when it was locked, but how can you say the protein can was put there after the room was unlocked!? We already know she was given the protein can with the poison inside, right? If that can wasn't there when she died, how did she get poisoned!?\n39-Kyoko17.png\n: You're right. We do need to explain that. But before we do, there's something I'd like to confirm with everyone here.\n52-Hiro7.png\n: Huh...?\n5-Kyoko11.png\n: It has to do with the protein can. After Sakura's body was discovered, did anyone move it or trip over it or anything like that?\n26-Byakuya6.png\n: What are you talking about? Is this some kind of loaded question?\n39-Kyoko17.png\n: Not at all. Just answer to the best of your ability.\n26-Byakuya6.png\n: ...Well, no. Not that I remember.\n55-Makoto20.png\n: Yeah, me either.\n20-Hiro5.png\n: Not me.\n56-Jill9.png\n: Same here!\n14-Hina9.png\n: Y-Yeah, me either...\n32-Kyoko15.png\n: Okay then, that settles it. That proves that the protein can found its way to the murder scene *after* the room was opened.\n31-Byakuya11.png\n: Oh, come on! How can you say that!?\n26-Byakuya6.png\n: How can you know what I don't know!?\nThe reason she can say that is because there's evidence... There's proof that someone brought the protein can to the rec room *after* it was opened!\n",

7-Byakuya6.png
: Hina...why did you try to cover up what happened? If the truth hadn't come to light, you would have died along with the rest of us. And yet you...! Why did you do that!?
8-Hiro16.png

wanted

13-Makoto2.png

9-Hina17.png

12-Hina18.png
: ...I couldn't let her be the only one that died!
15-Jill5.png
: You d-don't mean... You were gonna

t-take us all with you

9-Hina17.png
: We have to atone for our sins. Because everyone...even me...we all killed her. We all have to

pay for our crimes

9-Hina17.png
: You still don't understand? Then let me explain... Do you realize just how much

despair
Sakura was carrying with her when she died!? Look at this...
Such brutality has made me desperate. So instead of just waiting to be killed, I'll do it by my own hand.
13-Makoto2.png
: Th-That's...!
9-Hina17.png

suicide note

13-Makoto2.png
: Suicide note...?
9-Hina17.png
: Thinking back, I should have seen it coming...
9-Hina17.png
:
It was right after Genocide Jack had attacked me. Sakura got mad and stormed out of the nurse's office... I ran out after her, and...
19-Flashback.png
21-Hina2.png
: Sakura, calm down! You don't have to worry about me, I'm fine!
22-Sakura5.png
: I...can't calm down... I don't care if I suffer for this. It's my fault, after all. But now *you're* suffering because of me...
23-Sakura11.png
: You tried to protect me, but because of me...
24-Sakura9.png
: ...my closest friend got hurt!
25-Hina9.png
: S-Sakura...
23-Sakura11.png
: Because of me...my friends are all going to kill each other. This is all...
**
my responsibility
.
19-Flashback.png
9-Hina17.png
: Sakura...thought she was responsible. She thought everything was her fault. Which is why...she wanted to find some way to get everyone to forgive her. So she asked to meet with...them.
19-Flashback.png
29-Hina10.png
: You asked to meet with those three? You can't! Don't you see how dangerous that is!?
30-Sakura4.png
: Don't worry. I just want to talk to them.
25-Hina9.png
: Talk about...what?
30-Sakura4.png
: ...
25-Hina9.png
: Listen, don't do it. If they all gang up on you at once, even you...
31-Sakura3.png
: Hina... Please, don't think of things like that. They're not my enemy.
33-Sakura8.png
: They're...
**
friends
.
25-Hina9.png
: S-Sakura...
9-Hina17.png
:
She clearly believed... She...completely believed...in all of us. If you'd just talked to her, you would've understood. She was a friend to all of us... And yet... And yet...!

40-Hiro5.png
: N-No, that was just a...a misunderstanding!
12-Hina18.png
: Don't stand there and call it a misunderstanding!
9-Hina17.png
: She believed in you...and you wouldn't even listen to what she had to say. Without a single question, you tried to kill her...
12-Hina18.png
: Do you have any idea how desperate she was, seeing you act like that!?
9-Hina17.png
: That's what her suicide note means... "So instead of just waiting to be killed, I'll do it by my own hand." That's how far you'd pushed her...
19-Flashback.png
42-Hina13.png
: Sakura! What happened to you!?
44-Sakura10.png
: H-Hina...you came...
42-Hina13.png
: Wait right here! I'll help you out!
44-Sakura10.png
: H-Hina...
42-Hina13.png
: Huh...?
44-Sakura10.png
: I...I'm so glad I got to meet you...
42-Hina13.png
: Wh-What's wrong, Sakura? Why are you talking like that...?
44-Sakura10.png
: I...have a favor to ask.
29-Hina10.png
: A favor...?
44-Sakura10.png
: I'd like...some protein. Could I ask you to...?
29-Hina10.png
: Y-Yeah, you got it! Just hang on, I'll be right back!
46-Hina4.png
:
That was...the last conversation I had with her.
19-Flashback.png
46-Hina4.png
: I went to the chem lab to get the protein she'd asked for. When I got there, I saw the powder. And that's when I realized... I saw that someone had taken something from the poison shelf. Sakura... So I ran back to the rec room as fast as I could. But by the time I got there, it was already too late...
34-FlashT.png
36-FlashB.png
29-Hina10.png
: Sakura! Let me in! Please, open the door!
42-Hina13.png
: ...Why...?
46-Hina4.png
: Why!? Why did she have to die!
19-Flashback.png
46-Hina4.png
: She had weaknesses, just like any other person. If she got cut, she bled. If someone hurt her, she felt it. That's weakness... That's normal...! And yet...
9-Hina17.png
: You all blamed her... I tried to protect her, and I suffered for it. And that just added to the weight she had to carry...! And I didn't even realize it...
13-Makoto2.png
: Hina...
9-Hina17.png
: We killed her... All of us. We pushed her into a corner...and we murdered her.
12-Hina18.png
: People like us shouldn't be allowed to live!
7-Byakuya6.png
: And that's why you tried to lead us astray. You did your best to make us arrive at the wrong conclusion during the class trial.
46-Hina4.png
: Sakura died hating all of us. I wanted to free her of her regrets. But even that got found out. In the end, I wasn't able to do anything for her... I could never face her after this...

11-DeathWish.png
71-Sakura14.png
: My good friend Hina. There's something I have to tell you. I hate to do it like this, but you need to know. This is...my final wish.
71-Sakura14.png
: As you know, I've been giving information to the one who's imprisoned you here. It was our first night in this strange school that the mastermind came to see me... You see, the mastermind took control of
**
my family's dojo
, and demanded I become their tool. You might not see the importance of a dojo, but my family has watched over it for over 300 years. I couldn't let it be destroyed under my watch. So even if it meant my own life, I had to protect it. That's how I saw things...
71-Sakura14.png
: However, that was my
**
greatest weakness
. And because of that, I made the mistake of giving in to the mastermind. And what the mastermind wanted from me was nothing less...than
**
murder
. They were probably worried that until the first murder had happened, nothing would move forward. But what neither the mastermind nor I expected...was the incident involving Sayaka. At that point, the plan changed. The mastermind told me to hold off--to wait until we reached another stalemate.
71-Sakura14.png
: However, as I lived here with all of you... As I lived here with Hina...my resolve began to weaken. Watching everyone fight with such despair, trying so desperately to stay alive...I saw the weakness in my own heart, the mistake of succumbing to the mastermind. And more than anything...I cannot betray those who would call me
**
their friend
. That's how I came to feel.
13-Makoto2.png
: So that's why Sakura...
34-FlashT.png
36-FlashB.png
74-Sakura13.png
: I've made a decision... I will no longer retreat, no longer compromise, no longer regret... I've made my decision! I'm going... to resist you!
54-Monokuma4.png
: Of course, because of that I decided to reveal her secret, which made everyone else hate her. Her decision to stay true to all of you led directly to all of you hating her for it...
76-Monokuma5.png
: Ironic, isn't it!? Or maybe oxymoronic? Or just moronic...?
71-Sakura14.png
: Of course, I understand if you all hate me. All of this is because of my own weakness... I'm perfectly willing to accept whatever attack you may want to make on me. So this is my atonement for betraying you. That's what I had in mind... But unfortunately, that's not enough. This won't end with just me accepting your hatred.
34-FlashT.png
36-FlashB.png
71-Sakura14.png
: My own situation has started having an effect on more people than just me... Which is exactly what the mastermind wanted when they revealed my betrayal.
34-FlashT.png
36-FlashB.png
71-Sakura14.png
: My betrayal brought suspicion, disharmony... The mastermind knew that eventually it would escalate into someone murdering someone else.
71-Sakura14.png
: Of course, I'm still responsible for that, as well. I have an obligation to get this situation under control. And to fulfill that obligation, I've decided to do as the mastermind has commanded. I will do as I was told, and
**
commit murder
. But I've decided... The one I'm going to kill is...
**
myself
.
71-Sakura14.png
: If the mastermind demands that I kill someone, then that someone will be me. Then my dojo will be safe, and above all else, none of you will have to kill anyone. When I die, the source of conflict among you all died with me. For that, I'm willing to give up my life.
71-Sakura14.png
: If it can save you, then sacrificing my own life could have no greater meaning. Whatever you think of me, please know that you all are my most treasured friends... I've never had people like you in my life...
42-Hina13.png
: Then...Sakura...didn't feel cornered. She didn't die hating us. She wanted to...stop us from fighting? To
**
protect us
?
81-Kyoko17.png
: She didn't end her own life because she was weak. Quite the opposite, in fact...
67-Kyoko7.png
: She was
**
strong
. *Too* strong. That's why she killed herself. She chose death for herself in order to protect the rest of us. To sacrifice so much... No normal person could do that.
82-Kyoko13.png
: It was only her limitless strength that made it possible.
42-Hina13.png
: ...
71-Sakura14.png
: Finally...Hina, I want to apologize to you especially. The reason I didn't tell you any of this is because I knew you would try to stop me. I'm really, truly sorry. But please don't be sad. If I can thwart the mastermind's plans, if I can keep you from killing each other...that's enough for me.
71-Sakura14.png
: This is the path that I have chosen. This is the only way I have left to distinguish myself. And you can use this note to bring the class trial to a quick end. I'm sorry to ask you to do something to unpleasant, but I have to leave the rest to you. Please talk to Byakuya, Toko, and Hiro on my behalf. I can't tell anyone about my plan while I'm alive, but I wanted you to understand why I'm doing this. In the end, though, I hope to show myself through actions and not words. Hopefully then they'll see...
71-Sakura14.png

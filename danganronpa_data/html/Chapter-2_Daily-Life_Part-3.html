   "Throughout the years, we have been committed to shaping the youth who will one day shape the world. We have a long, proud history as an institution of higher learning with full government support. Out graduates enter society ready to take on active leadership roles in every major job field. However, Hope's Peak Academy must now lower the curtain on its glorious history, for the time being. This decision was not an easy one to make, but
   <b>
    serious issues
   </b>
   beyond our control have made it necessary. But make no mistake--this is not the end for Hope's Peak Academy. We intend to reopen out doors as soon as the issues forcing our closure have been resolved. That being said, this is the end for now, and I would like to personally and sincerely thank everyone for your help and support over the years. For now, we are awaiting official governmental authorization to formally cease operations."

   : It would seem Hope's Peak had
   <b>
    stopped functioning as a school
   </b>
   . And judging by the amount of dust the letter had collected, it doesn't seem to have happened recently. If I had to guess, I'd say this letter could be

    at least a year old

   .
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Byakuya.png"/>
   : Most likely, the mastermind took over the abandoned school in order to put on this little performance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Makoto.png"/>
   : B-But that would mean it was closed when I got here just a few days ago.

   : But I didn't get that sense at all. Plus, if the school *had* shut down, don't you think it would've been in all the newspapers and stuff? I mean, you're saying it could've happened over a year ago, right? But before I got here, I looked stuff up online about the school, and never saw anything about this.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : That must have all been part of the mastermind's plan. They lured us all in here. Someone who could create a place to judge and execute people could potentially be capable of anything.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : Of course, that's all assuming that

    this letter is real

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : If it *is* real, though, that does solve one mystery surrounding the school... The reason there are no other students here could be because the school had already closed down.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : That would be a nice, simple solution, it's true.

My reflexes are okay. Not great, not awful. I could get into a decent college, where I'd make a few friends. Maybe even find a normal girlfriend... Which is exactly why I don't like who I am! I understand that now! My life is just one giant copy-paste! I don't have any imagination! I'm a perfectly average cardboard cutout! You see what I mean, right Mr. Monokuma!?

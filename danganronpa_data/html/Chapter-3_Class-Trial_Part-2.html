   : As we know, Taka was killed in the
   <b>
    equipment room
   </b>
   . And from there, the body was moved to the repository, correct?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Hina20.png"/>
   : Yeah, the culprit wrapped the body in the
   <b>
    tarp
   </b>
   ...then
   <b>
    loaded it onto the dolly
   </b>
   and wheeled it off, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : Now, keep in mind that the dolly
   <b>
    doesn't have a handle
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Hina.png"/>
   : Well, yeah, but even without a handle all you'd have to do is
   <b>
    bend over
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Hina22.png"/>
   : Then you could push the dolly no problem!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Jill9.png"/>
   : So the killer just crouched down and carted the body off to the
   <b>
    repository
   </b>
   !
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : If you accept everything we just said then you must realize that whoever was in the suit couldn't possibly be the culprit.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Hiro5.png"/>
   : Uh...sorry, I don't think I realize anything...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The dolly was used to move Taka's body, that much I'm sure of. But...would the person inside the suit have been able to push the dolly?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Narration.png"/>
   : Lots of weak points here but no need to panic. We learned during the investigation that you can't bend at the waist while in the suit.
   <br/>

   : You're absolutely right that you could push a dolly without a handle if you stoop down low.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Makoto23.png"/>
   : But if you were wearing
   <b>
    that suit
   </b>
   , do you think you could actually get into a position like that?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Hina2.png"/>
   : Wh-What do you mean...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Makoto28.png"/>
   : Think back to what you said when we were all checking out the suit together. Remember?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-113.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Hina27.png"/>
   : Ahh! See, look! See how loose it is? I mean, come on... I'm blind as a bat in here! Can't see my feet at all. I'm surprised you got anywhere in this thing!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Hiro19.png"/>
   : I'm telling you, it wasn't me!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Hina27.png"/>
   : And not to mention--! You totally can't bend at the waist! Seems like a pretty obvious oversight...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-114.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto25.png"/>
   : When you're in that suit, not only can you
   <b>
    not see your feet
   </b>
   , but you
   <b>
    can't even bend
   </b>
   at the waist.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Makoto28.png"/>
   : Am I right about that?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Hina14.png"/>
   : Now that you mention it...yeah...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Sakura3.png"/>
   : It seems like it'd be awfully hard to push that dolly if you couldn't bend over...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Celeste7.png"/>
   : Well, what's to stop you from simply pushing the dolly with your feet?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto25.png"/>
   : When you can't even see your feet? You really think someone could kick the dolly all that way?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Jill2.png"/>
   : Yeah, it'd be totally impossible! Not that I can say for sure myself!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-121.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : On top of that, if you were wearing such a rigid, cumbersome suit it's very unlikely you would have the dexterity to go about wrapping the body in a tarp.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Jill10.png"/>
   : Well I mean, isn't that just a matter of taking off the suit when you're ready to move the body?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    There's absolutely no chance that the costume was taken off just to move the body. Because...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-123.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    &gt; You can't take it off by yourself
   </b>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-124.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I don't think taking off the suit was an option. If you remember...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-125.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Hiro17.png"/>
   : I dunno what's up with this thing, but I can't actually get it off...! A little help?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Celeste9.png"/>
   : Why would you make something that you can't take off by yourself?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Hiro17.png"/>
   : I didn't make the stupid friggin' thing!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Kyoko.png"/>
   : There's a clasp on the back that's keeping you from getting it off. It looks pretty sturdy. I don't think you can get it off on your own. We don't really have a choice. Let's help him.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-126.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Sakura5.png"/>
   : That's true. It seems impossible to
   <b>
    put the suit on or take it off without help
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Hina2.png"/>
   : Then...you really can't take it off by yourself? Hiro wasn't just making it up?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Hiro16.png"/>
   : O-Of course I wasn't making it up!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Makoto20.png"/>
   : If he could have gotten it off by himself, I don't think he would have let us see him wearing it. Showing up in the suit was basically an invitation for everyone to suspect him.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Hiro16.png"/>
   : Y-Yeah, that's right!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Hina20.png"/>
   : So...it's really *really* true that Robo Justice couldn't have moved the dolly...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Sakura5.png"/>
   : To be clear, whoever did move the body, it couldn't have been Hiro in the robot suit, correct?

   : You all got a good look at it, did you not? The image of Hifumi being dragged away by Robo Justice? If whoever was in that suit is not the culprit, how do you explain that? Besides, so you remember what the now deceased Hifumi said...?
   <br/>

   : What guy?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Hifumi16.png"/>
   :
   <b>
    Robo Justice
   </b>
   . Er, that's what I decided to call him, just now...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-137.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Celeste4.png"/>
   : So long as those faces exist, the proper conclusion is beyond question.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Celeste16.png"/>
   : The individual inside the suit and the culprit are one and the same. It was Hiro, without a doubt.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Hina22.png"/>
   : Yeah...! Yeah, that's gotta be right!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Hiro10.png"/>
   : H-Hold on a second!
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Kyoko14.png"/>
   : It's still far too early to reach that conclusion. Besides, there's no hurry to decide who did it. Before we rush to a verdict, shouldn't we explore every single possibility? Instead of seizing on one viewpoint, the truth is uncovered by analyzing things from every angle.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Sakura3.png"/>
   : Perhaps, but where do we go from here?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-144.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : Let's review this series of unfortunate events from the beginning. Maybe we'll uncover something new...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Jill5.png"/>
   : Pfhah! What a pain in the ass!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Sakura4.png"/>
   : I don't disagree, but our lives are on the lines. If this is what it takes, we have to do it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Hina.png"/>
   : Plus, maybe we'll get to find out where the heck Kyoko was when everything went down...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Sakura3.png"/>
   : Alright then, let's take another look back at what happened. I suppose we could start with this morning...

   : Four of us gathered together in the dining hall--Makoto, Hina, Kyoko, and myself. We waited there for quite a while, but nobody else showed up. So we went to look for everyone. That was around
   <b>
    8 a.m.
   </b>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Hina2.png"/>
   : And as soon as we split up, Kyoko went missing.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Sakura7.png"/>
   : Soon after that, Hina found Celeste in the rec room, and quickly came to get Makoto and me.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Celeste5.png"/>
   : It seems I was unconscious for about an hour after I was attacked by my mystery assailant. I know it was an hour because I remember being attacked
   <b>
    a little after 7

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Sakura7.png"/>
   : We were soon joined in our search by Byakuya and Toko, and then went on to find Hifumi in the library. He was injured, so we took him to the nurse's office and resumed our search for the suspect. But not long after leaving the nurse's office...

   : What's wrong...?

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Celeste8.png"/>
   : I saw someone moving around on the 3rd floor, and I yelled out to everyone as soon as I did.

   <br/>

   : I saw him! The strange costumed man...! He ran off as soon as I screamed... I was blocking the stairs, so he headed

   : At that point we decided to divide up into two groups. Celeste, Hina, and I went back to the nurse's office while Sakura, Byakuya, and Toko chased after the suspect.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Makoto24.png"/>
   : I left Celeste and Hina there and headed back to the 3rd floor, to let the others know what had happened.

   : Meanwhile, we had just discovered Taka's body, in the equipment room. We must have found both bodies at almost exactly the same time because we heard the same announcement not long after we'd discovered his body.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-163.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Makoto24.png"/>
   : And that's when I told you guys about Hifumi. Then the three of us headed for the nurse's office.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Makoto26.png"/>
   : But right after we left the physics lab we ran into Celeste, who'd arrived after us, and she told us something very surprising.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Makoto26.png"/>
   : We rushed back to the nurse's office and saw that she was right.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Sakura3.png"/>
   : Then we remembered we'd left Toko passed out in the equipment room, so we hurried back again.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Sakura5.png"/>
   : But when we got there, we discovered that now Taka's body had *also* gone missing. Next thing we knew, we were searching the school for two missing dead bodies. And after some time...
   <br/>

   : I think that about covers it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : I see... The whole thing sounds exceptionally complicated.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Kyoko.png"/>
   : It certainly seems to me that these are not a simple series of connected events.
   <br/>

   : Rather than a single series of events, I think we have to consider each murder a
   <b>
    separate situation
   </b>
   . And from there, we can uncover the
   <b>
    contradictions
   </b>
   surrounding all of them. Now then, let's get started, beginning with what happened to Taka...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The contradictions hidden in what happened to Taka... In order to uncover the truth of this case, I have to find them, no matter what!

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : So, regarding Taka's death... I wonder if he died before Hifumi... Or perhaps it was after?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Hina2.png"/>
   : We already know
   <b>
    what order
   </b>
   they were killed in! Taka came last!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-Sakura.png"/>
   : What makes you say that?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Hina22.png"/>
   : Because of
   <b>
    the numbering
   </b>
   of the Justice Hammers!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : It's true that hifumi was killed with Justice Hammer 3 while Taka's death came from a swing of Justice Hammer 4.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Hina22.png"/>
   : See? So it's obvious Taka came after!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The order that the Justice Hammers were used in to commit the murders... Something about that is bothering me.

   : This one might throw off a new player. The wristwatch seems like the obvious choice but is actually wrong. It's definitely related to the topic but doesn't fit the weak points close enough. However, don't forget we can memorize someone else's weak point to create a temporary Truth Bullet.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Narration.png"/>
   : We need to use Hina's statement about supposedly knowing the order of the incidents from the numbering on the hammers and turn it against her. It can be difficult to figure out when to use a memorized statement so make sure you pay close attention to the details of your Truth Bullets.
   <br/>
   <br/>

   : Hold on, there's no reason to assume that
   <b>
    the hammers were used in the same order as their numbers
   </b>
   ! If anything, that's just another way the killer tried to disguise their actions.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-Byakuya.png"/>
   : So you're saying the culprit wanted us to *think* the hammers were used in order but in reality Taka was killed *before* Hifumi?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Byakuya2.png"/>
   : Okay then, let's see the proof.

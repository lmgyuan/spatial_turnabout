    "You must kill someone if you want to leave." My mind froze and my breath caught in my throat as I thought about that... I could feel a paralyzing fear slowly making its way through my body, dominating every last nerve. The air hung heavy on me, pressing down like a weight around my neck. It took everything I had just to endure that weight...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But for as heavy as the air felt... all it took to pierce it was her sharp words.

    After turning on my e-Handbook, the first thing that appeared was my name. So just like Monokuma said, the owner's name showed up front and center. Then, from the Main Menu that popped up, I selected the
    <b>
     School Regulations
    </b>
    icon.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    An itemized list appears on-screen. It was the
    <b>
     school regulations
    </b>
    . In other words, the rules being imposed on us all.

   1. Students may reside only within the school. Leaving campus is an unacceptable use of time.
   <br/>
   2. "
   <b>
    Nighttime
   </b>
   " is from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. Some areas are off-limits at night, so please exercise caution.
   <br/>
   3. Sleeping anywhere other than the dormitory will be seen as sleeping in class and punished accordingly.
   <br/>
   4. With minimal restrictions, you are free to explore Hope's Peak Academy at your discretion.
   <br/>
   5. Violence against Headmaster Monokuma is strictly prohibited, as is destruction of surveillance cameras.
   <br/>
   6. Anyone who kills a fellow student and becomes "blackened" will
   <b>
    graduate
   </b>
   , unless they are discovered.
   <br/>
   7. Additional school regulations may be added as necessary.

    He punched me...and I flew back in a heap. It was like something straight out of a comic book. I didn't even see the punch coming. It was just suddenly right there in my face. One second I was standing there, the next I was soaring through the air. Now that I think about it, maybe I'd kinda forgotten...the kind of people I'd been trapped here with. My common sense had just...stopped functioning. Being around all these "ultimates" had blown my fuses. So I guess I shouldn't be surprised it led to something as absurd as this. But I'd just...lost track of that sense of reality. That was my last thought as my consciousness started to fade...before it finally cut out completely.

   : System includes the Saving and Loading features, as well as the Options menu, a Return to Main Menu option and the Transcript. The Transcript is very useful if you forgot what someone said 5 seconds ago because it records every single piece of text that the game displays, be it spoken word, thoughts, tutorials or sound effects, and keeps a backlog of at least 100 lines, probably more. It's a very handy feature.

   "Announcement from Headmaster Monokuma: Each room's lock has been designed to completely protect against tampering or lock-picking. Remaking an individual room key is quite troublesome, so please make sure not to lose yours. Your room comes furnished with a shower, but please note that
   <b>
    the water is turned off at nighttime
   </b>
   . Also, the bathrooms in the girls' rooms include a lock of their own.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Finally, we've prepared a small gift for each of you. For the girls, a
   <b>
    sewing kit
   </b>
   . And for the boys, a
   <b>
    toolkit
   </b>
   . The sewing kit includes a map of the body's vital organs. One stab will do the job, girls! For the boys, we believe a strong blow to the head with any of the tools should be ample. Don't think! Just feel! And let's all enjoy ourselves!"

I decided to take a little stroll around the 1st floor. ...I understand now that that was a mistake. Anyway, that is where I first saw the strange man. I was immediately wary of him... He was obviously suspicious, so I decided to follow after him in secret. As I followed, I saw him go into the rec room. I tried to peek through the gap in the door which is when he noticed me, and...

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Hina9.png"/>
   : Shouldn't we start looking for him, then...? Listen, Celeste...did anything in particular stand out about this strange guy?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Celeste5.png"/>
   : Did anything stand out? Well... Rather than trying to explain it, it would probably be faster if I simply showed you.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Show us...?

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Celeste17.png"/>
   : This is Hifumi's hand-me-down. His digital camera...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Makoto2.png"/>
   : You don't mean...!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Celeste2.png"/>
   : I was able to photograph the suspicious individual without him realizing it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Hina22.png"/>
   : Seriously!? Let's see it!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Celeste14.png"/>
   : I would tell you not to be shocked, but I fear it would do you no good.

    With that strange comment in mind, we all looked at the camera...

    Well, you were definitely right about the "strange" part... Their face is totally covered.

   : As I said, a very strange and suspicious individual, yes?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So this weird robot guy...dragged Hifumi away?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Celeste14.png"/>
   : And I took this right after being attacked. In other words, a full hour ago. Which is why if we don't hurry, it could become a serious problem.

   : I believe I understand what happened. Well, no, there is much I don't understand. But... The point is, someone dressed like that dragged Hifumi away.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Makoto2.png"/>
   : And it happened over an hour ago...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Hina15.png"/>
   : This is bad! We have to hurry!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Celeste, do you know where this mysterious man went?

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Celeste2.png"/>
   : When they left the rec room, they headed left...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Sakura5.png"/>
   : If that's true, they were headed toward the stairs leading down to the 2nd floor!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Then he must be down there, right!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Hina2.png"/>
   : The 2nd floor... That's where Kyoko was supposed to be...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh? Speaking of which, why isn't Kyoko here?
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Hina9.png"/>
   : Sorry...I didn't have time to go look for her.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Sakura5.png"/>
   : This is bad. If the strange man did head to the 2nd floor, Kyoko might run into him...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Makoto2.png"/>
   : We have to hurry! Kyoko's in danger!
   <br/>
   <br/>

    As soon as the words were out of my mouth, we all rushed out of the room and down to the 2nd floor.

   : You lied to us, plain and simple. If you look at the footprints, your movements in the chem lab are obvious. The powder had already been spilled when you came in, and you went straight to section A. So you never went to section C. Whatever you did there, it only involved section A.
   <br/>

   .

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : You're right, it must be. Of course, that leads to another question... How did a shard of glass from the window get inside this bottle of poison?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Jill2.png"/>
   : What's so strange about that!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Makoto30.png"/>

   ...

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Makoto31.png"/>
   : The bottle of poison was left
   <b>
    on the shelf in the chem lab
   </b>
   . That is what you said, right Hina?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Hina3.png"/>
   : Uh...umm...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Makoto31.png"/>
   : And yet, somehow a piece of glass from the rec room window made its way into the bottle...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-0624.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Hiro8.png"/>
   : Then everything Hina told us was
   <b>
    a lie
   </b>
   !?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Makoto31.png"/>
   : In reality, that bottle of poison most definitely found its way to the
   <b>
    rec room
   </b>
   . It was there at least until the window got broken. In other words, when the locked room was unlocked. There's no other way to explain the presence of that glass in that bottle.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : And then, once the room was opened, the bottle somehow got moved back to the shelf in the chem lab. Meanwhile, the protein can we found at the crime scene was planted there.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kyoko14.png"/>
   : That had to be after the locked room was opened. In other words, after Sakura died.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-0629.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Byakuya11.png"/>
   : Wait, hold on... You're moving too fast!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Byakuya6.png"/>
   : I'll grant you, the bottle of poison may well have been in the rec room when it was locked, but how can you say the protein can was put there after the room was unlocked!? We already know she was given the protein can with the poison inside, right? If that can wasn't there when she died, how did she get poisoned!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : You're right. We do need to explain that. But before we do, there's something I'd like to confirm with everyone here.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Hiro7.png"/>
   : Huh...?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-0637.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : It has to do with the protein can. After Sakura's body was discovered, did anyone move it or trip over it or anything like that?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Byakuya6.png"/>
   : What are you talking about? Is this some kind of loaded question?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : Not at all. Just answer to the best of your ability.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-0640.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Byakuya6.png"/>
   : ...Well, no. Not that I remember.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Makoto20.png"/>
   : Yeah, me either.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Hiro5.png"/>
   : Not me.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Jill9.png"/>
   : Same here!

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Kyoko15.png"/>
   : Okay then, that settles it. That proves that the protein can found its way to the murder scene *after* the room was opened.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Byakuya11.png"/>
   : Oh, come on! How can you say that!?

   scattered all around the room, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Byakuya6.png"/>
   : Of course! It came from the window you broke to get in. What about it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Makoto28.png"/>
   : Well, those pieces weren't just scattered *around* the protein can...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-0659.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Makoto29.png"/>
   : We also found pieces
   <b>
    *underneath* the can
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-0660.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Byakuya13.png"/>
   : Wh-What!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Makoto28.png"/>
   : And this proves it... It shows that the can must have been put down on the floor *after* the window was broken.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Makoto32.png"/>
   : So it had to be after we got into the room!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Byakuya13.png"/>
   : Kh--!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Byakuya11.png"/>
   : I-I see... So that's your explanation... Kyoko...earlier, when you asked if anyone had moved the can, or tripped over it...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-0665.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : If that were the case, that would explain the can being on top of the glass.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Makoto25.png"/>
   : So you asked everyone about it to eliminate that possibility right out of the gate...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Kyoko15.png"/>
   : And that's made everything clear, hasn't it? As long as it was a "locked room," it only contained the bottle of poison, and *not* the protein can. But once the room was opened up, they were switched. And as a result the protein can wound up in the rec room, and the bottle of poison returned to the chem lab.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Byakuya6.png"/>
   : If that's all true, then...why did Sakura drink the poison? I thought we all agreed she was tricked into drinking it because of the protein can...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Makoto30.png"/>
   : No...that's not why... The only explanation is...she drank it from its original bottle, knowing exactly what it was.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : Precisely. She was alone in a locked room. All she had was the poison. What other possibility is there?
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Byakuya11.png"/>
   : You're saying she drank it...knowing what it was? Such a ridiculous fiction is...

   : ...exactly what happened.

   : Now that Byakuya is finally gone, I'm finally able to resume narration duties instead of him dragging us everywhere. Our first stop on our individual investigation is the pool hallway, where we can find Hifumi hanging around.

   : Evidence? What did you find?
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : Generally speaking. But I have to get going. I have something unrelated to take care of.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Something besides the investigation...? What...is it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Kyoko2.png"/>

   : Before I go, let me give you one piece of advice. You should examine
   <b>
    Chihiro's body
   </b>
   one more time. Thoroughly. Also, her
   <b>
    handbook
   </b>
   is missing. You might want to determine its whereabouts.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kyoko19.png"/>
   : That's it. I'll be praying for your success. *leaves*
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    With that, Kyoko turned and left the girls locker room.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I guess I'll take another look at the body, then...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    And...Chihiro's handbook is missing? That's definitely worth worrying about...
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Kyoko said I should...examine the body one more time.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I know she said "thoroughly" but I do have my limits... Well, I'd better give it a shot anyway. Let's see...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-301.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Chihiro's hands are bound with...what looks like some kind of rope. The rope was used to prop her up in a kind of crucifix position. ...Huh?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-302.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This rope has a...
    <b>
     plug
    </b>
    !? Wait, so then...this isn't a rope at all! But the more I think about it, the more that's not the only thing that concerns me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-303.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Chihiro's
    <b>
     fatal injury
    </b>
    was the
    <b>
     blow to the head
    </b>
    ... Which means someone struck her in the head in order to kill her. That's right... There's the issue of her being suspended, and the fatal blow... At first, I didn't see any reason to think too much about either of them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-304.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But seeing them again after looking through the Genocide Jack file, something's not quite right... What does this all mean...?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-305.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well, the one thing most likely to tie all these mysteries together is the true nature of the "rope" that was used to suspend Chihiro. And to figure that out, there's a
    <b>
     certain place
    </b>
    I need to revisit and look over again. Plus, it might help to look at the Genocide Jack case file one more time.

    It's the bloodstained poster. The blood is the most noteworthy part, but the big-breasted swimsuit model is pretty noticeable, too. A girls locker room doesn't seem like the kind of place you'd find something like this...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Oh, but wait...that reminds me! The poster in the other locker room is...

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Sakura.png"/>
   : I've used it nearly every day since it opened up. Sometimes Hina and I use it together.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Okay then, let me ask you something... Do you think the posters in the boys and girls locker rooms could have been
   <b>
    switched
   </b>
   ?

   : But there *is*
   <b>
    something that's been bothering me
   </b>
   about the locker room... You see, I like to drink a little protein coffee every time I finish exercising.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : We have protein coffee?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Sakura4.png"/>
   : In the warehouse. It's not the highest quality, but I don't have a lot of other options. I mix protein powder with coffee, and down a glass of it after exercising. Anyway, the other day, I spilled some on the carpet in the girls locker room, and
   <b>
    it left a stain
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>

   : Exactly. I noticed it earlier--the stain has

    disappeared

   : In the Skills menu, I've taken a moment to equip Upshift and Algorithm in addition to all the skills I had equipped for Trial #1. I explained what these did back when I got them earlier in the chapter, but here's the game's explanation for each:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    Upshift:
   </b>
   Increases your aim speed. Effective during the Nonstop Debate and the Hangman's Gambit. Costs 1 SP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   -This skill came from Mondo. The increased cursor speed is not absolutely necessary but there's a mechanic introduced in this trial that makes having a faster cursor much more desirable in the Nonstop Debate. Plus, I just like having a fast cursor.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    Algorithm:
   </b>
   Increases the speed of memorizing a statement. Effective during the Nonstop Debate. Costs 2 SP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   -This skill came from Chihiro. If I'm remembering the game correctly, we'll be encountering the Memorization mechanic during Nonstop Debates in this trial. This skill just speeds up how long it takes to memorize something. It sounds like a quality of life skill but later on in the game I'm sure it will be quite handy.

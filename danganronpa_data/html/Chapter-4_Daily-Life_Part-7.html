   : What...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : A useless commoner like you could never hop to earn more than, say, 100,000 dollars a year. But as my secretary, you would be guaranteed an ample salary and job security for the rest of your life. And in honor of it being my birthday today, how about I multiply your already impossible expectations by, oh, 5.5?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    100,000 dollars times 5.5? You mean...?

   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Byakuya.png"/>
   : Of course, as my secretary you wouldn't be a mere servant. At some point, I would want you to become an actual assistant, taking the lead on important projects. Assuming you produce acceptable results, you could even become a core part of the Togami Corporation.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Byakuya2.png"/>
   : You have no reason to refuse.

   : ...I'm trying to give you a chance to enter the battlefield of life and claim victory. Most commoners will never get that chance. This is literally a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Do you understand? This is your chance. This is your one and only chance to rise above the 99%.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Byakuya7.png"/>
   : Are you really so scared of having to fight, to compete, in order to win?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto.png"/>
   : It's not that I'm scared... It's that I want to succeed based on my own effort. I want to find my own battlefield... I don't want it handed to me--I want to earn it. I want to find something I'm willing to fight and die for. That's the only way I'll be satisfied.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Byakuya9.png"/>

   : Wait, so then...
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto.png"/>
   : It's like I said... For me, happiness comes from

   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Byakuya3.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Byakuya2.png"/>
   : If you can do that, if you can make it to the end, I'm afraid I'll be forced to acknowledge you...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto.png"/>
   : Then that's exactly what I'll do. Someday, absolutely...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Byakuya.png"/>
   : I don't expect much from you, but I'll be waiting.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : This Free Time gives us SP+1. I actually went and looked up Byakuya's date of birth in the supplemental materials for this game and it's listed as May 5th. The 5.5x salary thing makes a lot more sense now. I don't know much about when Japanese schools start their terms but would May 5th make sense as a date shortly after the beginning of a new term for the students? I'm just curious if there's consistency here.

    The finality of his statement left no room for doubt or question. Nobody but Byakuya could talk that way and sound so convincing. But because of him, it seems possible that maybe that *is* his fate... Honestly, the more I talk to him, the more I see how far apart we are. At the same time, I feel like I understand him that much more... At least...I *think* I do...

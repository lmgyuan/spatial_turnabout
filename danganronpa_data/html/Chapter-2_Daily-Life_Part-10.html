    you don't want anyone to know about... A way to connect to the outside world... Honestly, all that crap Monokuma was spouting didn't have any effect on me. There's no way anyone would kill over stuff like that. At least, that's what I thought. But maybe I was just being optimistic. Which is probably why, without too much of a struggle...

   : Hey, do you have a second? I wanna confide in you... It's about the prevailing world attitude right now. The difference between passive and active. I mean... For example, it's the difference between like, "Oops! I killed him," and, "Yeah that's right. I killed him." Amazingly, there are tons of people who don't understand the difference. Can you believe it!? But there's a HUGE difference between "Oops!" and "That's right." You know what I'm saying, right? Anyone can kill someone in the heat of the moment. But surprisingly few can do it with calculated intent. To make that choice, then put it into action, it's way harder than just letting your emotions lead you. It's all about preparation. Resolve. So maybe you're wondering, what's the point I'm trying to make? Well, I'm not totally sure myself. Maybe you should try reading between the lines.

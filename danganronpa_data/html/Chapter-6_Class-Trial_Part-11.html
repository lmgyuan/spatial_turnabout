   : So, let me make this clear. Everyone has two choices in front of them. If a single person votes for "hope" to be
   <b>
    punished
   </b>
   ...then only Makoto will receive a harsh
   <b>
    punishment
   </b>
   , and the rest of you will live here in peace.

   : If, on the other hand, you desire to see us
   <b>
    punished
   </b>
   , then you must all leave this place.

   : I will force you out, ensuring you all die horrible deaths in the outside world.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Junko13.png"/>
   : What I'm saying is, if you sacrifice Makoto, the rest of you will get to live out your lives.

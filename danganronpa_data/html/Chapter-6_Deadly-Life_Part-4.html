    "Due to the explosion, the victim's identity is unknown. They were, however, dead before the blast. The victim had been stabbed a single time with a knife, which went completely through the body. They had also been struck in the head with an object about as thick as a metal pipe. The body was covered with other wounds, but these were at least several days old."

   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>

   : I guess I should start with the rooms that were locked up until now.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The headmaster's room, the bio lab, and the door in the data center with Monokuma's face on it... Oh, and the 2nd floor of the dorms where the gate was down before... That should be open now, right?

   <br/>
   <br/>

   : Even the dorm rooms are destroyed. Maybe this is where Kyoko stayed to avoid the "You may only sleep in the dorms" regulation. There is actually nothing to discover in here but it is unsettling nonetheless.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Narration.png"/>
   : Apparently, the Eye of Horus has several different meanings, but was often painted on Ancient Egyptian ships to ensure safe passage. It was also used to symbolize sacrifice, healing, restoration and protection. No clue if it's supposed to have any meaning here. This place certainly doesn't look safe or protected. Maybe sacrifice considering the whole Tragedy thing...

    It must have been for the Hope's Peak students who came before us... The
    <b>

    must have used these lockers.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's a card reader installed on the door. That must be how you get the locker open. After all, it's pretty similar to the card readers for the locker rooms on the 2nd floor of the school. And you have to use your e-Handbook to open those up. So does that mean...?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Well, let's just give it a try.
   <br/>
   <br/>

    regret

   <i>
    Huh? A regret...?

   : Whoever used this last, it looks like they were very interested in the Ultimate Despair. The PC still has some search results left on it...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Then we might be able to get some info on the Ultimate Despair!?

   : "The Ultimate Despair isn't one individual, but instead points to some kind of
   <b>
    group
   </b>
   . That group is responsible for
   <b>
    The Tragedy
   </b>
   , which happened one year ago. They're the worst sorts of people, whose driving force comes from despair..."
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : And that's all there is. Not much to it, is there?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : But I guess that's the best he could do as a complete Kirigiri failure...
   <br/>

   : B-But...any information about the mastermind is helpful, right? I appreciate whatever info we can get our hands on.

   <br/>

   : A very easy trick, yes. So easy, I'm not sure you can even call it a trick... I saw a program on that PC that I think controls it. Enter the right password, and the door should open right up.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : But I don't have a clue what that password might be. All we know is it's probably made up of letters and/or numbers. We can't really go from there...

   : You're right, that's not nearly enough to go on...
   <br/>

   <i>
    Jeez... So there's a hidden room she couldn't get into. That's what she meant by regret... I think we can assume that there must be some kind of clue waiting in there. But maybe for her, there's more to it than that...

    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-225.png"/>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    ...No, wait. There might be a chance... The password could be... Something Kyoko wouldn't have thought of. Or something she didn't *want* to think of... For example...

    I'm sure she hasn't tried it. I mean, it's totally understandable... After the way she talked about her dad, the idea that he would use her name as his password. Knowing how she is, I bet the idea never even occurred to her.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Umm...do you mind if I try it, just to be sure?

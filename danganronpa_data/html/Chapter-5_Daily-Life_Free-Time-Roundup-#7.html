   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Taka7.png"/>
   : Then let's get down to brass tacks and find out where we stand on all the big issues! So, what should we discuss? Politics? The economy? International affairs!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Makoto.png"/>
   : Wait, hold on. Instead of a big, serious discussion...can't we just have a normal conversation? That's the best way to learn about people, I think.

   : What do you mean by a "normal conversation"?

   : Study, of course! I'm a student, aren't I? A student must be a studying professional! And of course my duties as the chairperson of the morals committee keep me quite busy, as well!
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Makoto.png"/>
   : N-No, it's not about studying. It's just for fun, ya know?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Taka7.png"/>
   : But doing things "just for fun" serves no purpose! There must be more to it... You wouldn't spend your valuable time doing something useless, would you!?

   : Like when you see something awesome on TV, or some awesome game, and you want to share it with someone. You find other people who feel the same way, and that's how you make friends. See?

   <br/>

   : Huh...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Taka6.png"/>
   : That hoodie would only protect your head! It's hardly a raincoat if it doesn't cover the rest of your body! My suggestion is to get an umbrella!

   : G-Good advice...

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Taka16.png"/>
   : Hrmm... You may have a point there...
   <br/>

   : Even on your days off? Even on holidays!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Taka9.png"/>
   : School itself may observe holidays, but there's no such thing as vacation for a student! So as long as I live the life of a student, I will always wear my uniform!

   : Also, I have ten sets of my uniform, so I always have a clean one. There's nothing strange about that.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Um, no...I'd say wearing your uniform when you're not at school is *totally* strange... I'd better keep that to myself, though...

   : He was your grandpa!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Taka.png"/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Taka7.png"/>
   : He was a genius. He'd never known failure. His success was unimaginable to a normal person. But because of that...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Taka6.png"/>
   : ...he allowed himself to be controlled by naive emotions, and got roped into a corruption scandal. He had no idea what the world of geniuses was really like. At least, that's how I see it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Taka15.png"/>
   : At that point, he fell just as fast as he had risen. And it wasn't just in politics. The business world had no use for him anymore, and he plummeted. The debt he left behind torments my family to this day. He dies a few years ago. By the end, he wasn't speaking to anyone. Despite his fame, his legacy...the only people who came to his funeral were family members.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Makoto.png"/>
   : That's hard to imagine.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Taka7.png"/>
   : Some consider genius fate's blessing. But I see it as a tragedy more than anything. The tragedy of finding success without understanding the important of effort. There's nothing worse than a genius who trips and falls. Just like my grandfather...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Makoto.png"/>

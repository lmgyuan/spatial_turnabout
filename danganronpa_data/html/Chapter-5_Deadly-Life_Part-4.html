   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Byakuya5.png"/>
   : Regardless, if you plan on poking around at random, you're doomed no matter how much time you take. Surely you have something more concrete. Something to give us some sort of direction here.

   <b>
    The Ultimate Soldier
   </b>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although small for her age, she was a military specialist trained in every weapon type imaginable. She showed an interest in the military from childhood and soon found herself completely absorbed in it. In elementary school, she won a survival game tournament and began writing for military magazines.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Just before entering middle school, while she and her family were on vacation in Europe...she disappeared. The story of a young Japanese girl being kidnapped quickly took over Japanese media outlets. An intense international investigation turned up no information, and she was never found.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, she reappeared in Japan three years later, alone and completely unannounced. She revealed that she had joined a mercenary group known as
   <b>
    Fenrir
   </b>
   for those three years. She insisted that she hadn't been kidnapped, that she'd received battle training of her own volition. However, she never revealed why she decided to return home when she did.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Byakuya5.png"/>
   : Obviously, Monokuma was trying to tell us that
   <b>
    Mukuro is the one creating the rules to the game
   </b>
   . But why would he tell us that? And why now?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : He said he wanted to make things clear so there wouldn't be any complaints later...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Byakuya5.png"/>
   : But the mere fact that he said that proves that Mukuro is connected to this case. *That's* why Monokuma revealed the existence of a sixteenth student. He needs to make our investigation fair.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Mukuro is related to the case...?

   <br/>

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : What!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Byakuya5.png"/>
   : That would explain why we would have to have a class trial, wouldn't it? If she's a student, and she killed someone, that would make her part of the school killing game.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Byakuya2.png"/>
   : But...based on what Monokuma just told us, I've changed my mind.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Byakuya7.png"/>
   : Mukuro Ikusaba isn't the culprit!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-365.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : We thought Mukuro, the Ultimate Despair, was the mastermind's true identity. But if that's true, Monokuma's behavior makes no sense. Why would the mastermind go out of their way to reveal themselves to us?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : That's a good point...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : Mukuro giving us information that would raise questions about her would be bold, to say that least. It makes more sense, then, to assume that Mukuro *isn't* the culprit.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So that's the trap... They want us to suspect Mukuro, and come to the wrong conclusion...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : That's what makes sense to me.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The way you say it, it definitely does seem possible. But if that's really true... If Mukuro isn't the killer...then who is?

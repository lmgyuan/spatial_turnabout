    First of all, I'd better check the Monokuma File to see exactly what's going on.

    <br/>
    "The victim was Chihiro Fujisaki. The time of death is estimated to be around 2:00 a.m. The body was discovered in
    <b>
     the girls locker room
    </b>
    , on the 2nd floor of the school. The cause of death was a blow to the head with a blunt object. She was killed instantly."

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : But...why was she killed in the locker room? Actually, if you think about it, she could have been killed somewhere else, then carried here.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Sakura3.png"/>
   : She was very light, that is true. It wouldn't be hard for someone to carry her. But still... I still think
   <b>
    she came here on her own, by choice
   </b>
   .
   <br/>

   : What makes you say that?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sakura4.png"/>
   : She'd been talking a lot lately about how she wanted to get stronger.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So you're saying she came here to exercise? But according to the Monokuma File, apparently she was killed around
   <b>
    two in the morning
   </b>
   . Would she really have been exercising that late?
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Sakura3.png"/>
   : Hina or myself are usually in the locker room during the day. So she was probably avoiding it then.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Avoiding it...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sakura4.png"/>
   : Although we invited her to join us more than once, she never showed up. So I can only assume she was trying to avoid us.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : And instead, she came to exercise in the middle of the night?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-130.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Sakura6.png"/>
   : Perhaps. But it's difficult for me to imagine she would have come alone. She did want to start exercising, but she specifically mentioned she couldn't do it be herself. She needed
   <b>
    support from others
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So you're saying she could have come here in the middle of the night to train in secret but that she also would have come with someone else.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Makoto2.png"/>
   : But...did she really need to get stronger that badly? You already mentioned it, but...she *was* a girl, after all. Most girls aren't all that strong.

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : You should pay closer attention to the regulations. The answer has been in front of you the entire time. "Loaning your e-Handbook to another student is strictly prohibited." Only the act of *loaning* a handbook is prohibited.

    The proof that Byakuya did it is hidden within the rope...? I guess it's possible. But first... The item she had been bound with was used *like* rope...but was it actually a rope?

   : Is that right? And what, pray tell, is still bothering you? I killed her in the girls locker room, then disguised my crime. Specifically, I dressed it up to make it look like it was the work of a homicidal psychopath. What about all that "bothers" you?

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : She was found dead in the girls locker room. There is absolutely no question about that. How could the scene of the crime have been anywhere else?
   <br/>

   : The poster in the girls locker room was a picture of a

    big-boobed supermodel

   : Meanwhile, the boys locker room had a poster of the super popular boy band
   <b>
    Tornado
   </b>
   . Again, that doesn't really seem to belong in a boys locker room.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Celeste8.png"/>
   : So you're saying that maybe the posters were switched?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Makoto28.png"/>

   : Then...does that mean that the carpets were switched, too? But...why would anyone do that?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto2.png"/>
   : To move the murder scene from one locker room to the other. It's certainly plausible, don't you think?

   : What!?
   <br/>

   <b>
    poster
   </b>
   and
   <b>
    carpet
   </b>
   were moved along with the dead body.
   <br/>

   then how did Chihiro get in the boys locker room in the first place?

   across the

    card reader

   device. But Chihiro's handbook should have only allowed her access to the girls locker room.

    Theoretically, if Chihiro was able to use Leon's handbook, she could get into the boys locker room. But that's *if* she was able to use it.

   : Actually, the rule states that loaning your handbook is prohibited. It says nothing about borrowing one. In other words, you could borrow a dead person's handbook all you want, and you'd be safe.

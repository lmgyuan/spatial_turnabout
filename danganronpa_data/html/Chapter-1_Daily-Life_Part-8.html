    If it had ended there, that would've been fine. A message of love and support. After leaving my family behind to attend Hope's Peak it would have given me hope, given me strength. If this was a normal school, I would've been happy, if a little embarrassed. With my family's support to rely on, I would've been motivated to do even better.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But here, now, it was totally different. I *wasn't* living an ordinary school life. So I had a pretty strong feeling that the video wasn't going to end there.

    As soon as I saw their reactions, I knew... They'd all seen something like what I'd seen. Nobody even bothered trying to hide their fear and confusion. Except for *her*. Even now, she was totally calm.

   so that we're more likely to start killing each other.

   : Let me use an example. Imagine two countries are on the brink of war. But both countries want peace, and each commits to scaling back their forces as a sign of good faith. But there's a chance that one country may betray the other, so each country fears lowering their guard. The result is that neither scales back their forces and they both end up betraying each other.

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Toko12.png"/>
   : That kinda sounds l-like us right now... Everyone says they'll work together, but in our hearts we're all afraid someone might betray us...

   : You can say that, but maybe you're thinking that once everyone drops their guard, you can just...

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Chihiro10.png"/>
   : Yeah, you're right. We all need to calm down...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Junko3.png"/>
   : Okay, then. Maybe we should start by all just...talking. Maybe if we all just talk about what we saw, that'll help get everything out of our system.

   : Besides, I think we're all super curious, right?

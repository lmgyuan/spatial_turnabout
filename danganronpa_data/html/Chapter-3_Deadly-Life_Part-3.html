    First I'd better check the Monokuma File... "The victims were Hifumi Yamada and Kiyotaka Ishimaru. The cause of death for each was a
    <b>
     blow to the head
    </b>
    . It is thought that they were both killed with a
    <b>
     similar weapon
    </b>
    .
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : ...That's it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Byakuya2.png"/>
   : Yeah, it's pretty strange. We got way less information this time than before.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Celeste8.png"/>
   : That is no problem. After all, the events of this case unfolded before our very eyes. We should know more about what happened than the Monokuma File could, anyway.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Byakuya.png"/>
   : Maybe...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-006.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Sakura4.png"/>
   : There's something else that's bothering me... Someone else has been missing for quite a while...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Are you talking about Kyoko?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Sakura3.png"/>
   : Without a doubt, she has an alibi for when Celeste and Hifumi were attacked. But what if the killer wasn't acting alone? What if they had...
   <b>
    an accomplice
   </b>
   ?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : An accomplice!?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-008.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <a href="https://clyp.it/m3kns5ed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">

   </a>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Monokuma.png"/>
   : An accomplice!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Celeste2.png"/>
   : ...What are you doing here?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Monokuma13.png"/>
   : Don't be rude! I'm here to answer your question!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : What question...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Monokuma.png"/>
   : You're talking about accomplices, right? I'm pretty sure I explained it before, didn't I? During the first class trial!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-012.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Byakuya2.png"/>
   : Speaking of which, I'd like to ask the bear...if there *is* an accomplice, do they also become "blackened"?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Monokuma.png"/>
   : So you ask, and so I shall answer! Each murder is allowed to have an accomplice, but only the one who does the killing will get to graduate.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : So in other words, two people can work together, but one of them has no chance of profiting from it...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Mondo3.png"/>
   : Then there's no way anyone would work together, right...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-011.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Monokuma.png"/>
   : So basically...you can be an accomplice if you want, but there's no gratification in it!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sakura.png"/>
   : So are you saying nobody worked together this time, either?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Monokuma13.png"/>
   : Sorry, can't answer that! it would obstruct the free exchange of information between you guys. I just want to make sure you don't forget--no matter how much you assist in a murder
   <b>
    only one blackened can graduate
   </b>
   . An accomplice gets NOTHING!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-018.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Byakuya5.png"/>
   : Then we only need to figure out who that one blackened is that did the killing, right? Just like normal?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Monokuma.png"/>
   : Okay, okay, let me take this opportunity to clarify the whole shebang. In this class trial, what you need to determine is...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Monokuma12.png"/>
   : ...the
   <b>
    one true blackened
   </b>
   who devised the murder plot and put it into action!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The true blackened...? So just one person?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Monokuma.png"/>
   : Now it's down to the final battle between all of you, and the blackened! Good luck to all the contestants! *leaves*
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-020.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <a href="https://clyp.it/dubt1o0j" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-BOX15.png"/>
   </a>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    So there can only be one blackened. An accomplice wouldn't benefit...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Then I can't see any way Kyoko would be connected to this case, after all.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Byakuya.png"/>
   : You may be right...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Hina9.png"/>
   : If that's true then...Kyoko, where are you?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Sakura4.png"/>
   : As long as she's not connected to the case, it doesn't matter. Let's get back to the investigation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-022.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Celeste7.png"/>
   : I have absolutely no doubt that Hiro is responsible. But for the time being, I suppose it can't hurt to pursue further information.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Hina9.png"/>
   : You know...don't you think we should consider a certain someone a suspect, just in case? I'm talking about the murderous fiend...Genocide Jack!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-023.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Jill5.png"/>
   : Wha--!? I'm offended!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Hina12.png"/>
   : Kyah!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Byakuya12.png"/>
   : You... When did you--?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Jill2.png"/>
   : I've been looking all over for you, Master! When I woke up, you were nowhere to be found!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Byakuya12.png"/>
   : ...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-027.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Jill8.png"/>
   : Anyway! You there, milk sack swimmer girl!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Hina12.png"/>
   : Milk sack...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Jill8.png"/>
   : Why do I gotta be a suspect!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Hina16.png"/>
   : Well, I mean...you *are* a serial killer.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Jill5.png"/>
   : So what, I'm like a special guest suspect every time!? I have an alibi, you know!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-029.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : She's right about that... When we heard Hifumi scream, she was with me. And when the bodies disappeared, she was still lying unconscious in the equipment room. Plus, Taka's body aside, I can't imagine any way she would have been able to move Hifumi's body.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Jill9.png"/>
   : Besides, I calculate every move I make! I'm not gonna kill someone when everyone knows what I look like!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Jill7.png"/>
   : They don't call me the murderous fiend for nothing!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Hina15.png"/>
   : That's not the kind of thing you should be bragging about!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-033.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Celeste8.png"/>
   : On another topic, should we post a guard by the bodies like before? We can't have them disappearing again...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sakura.png"/>
   : Hina and I can handle that. You don't mind, do you Hina?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Hina14.png"/>
   : Sure. I'd be totally useless on the investigation anyway...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Byakuya.png"/>
   : Then that's that. Let's begin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    This whole thing is so strange... All but one of us has an alibi, so figuring out who did it should be obvious, right? But... Maybe it's just me, but I don't think it's going to be as straightforward as it seems.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-038.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-039.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Narration.png"/>
   : We can finally start our investigation. The lead-up to the investigation can get a little confusing though with all the running around and disappearing bodies so luckily, Sakura can help us by refreshing our heads on the sequence of events so far. It's a bit long but it does a good job of organizing what we know.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-040.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Sakura4.png"/>
   : There are many aspects to the incident this time. *Too* many, to be honest. Considering that, it may be good to look back on everything that's happened. Would you like my help?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-041.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   &gt; Yes
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Yeah, let's look back on things.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-042.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sakura.png"/>
   : This morning, only four of us met up at the dining hall--
   <b>
    Hina, Kyoko, you,
   </b>
   and
   <b>
    myself
   </b>
   . We waited for the others, but nobody showed up. So we decided to go look for them. It was around
   <b>
    8 o'clock
   </b>
   when we began our search.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : And soon after we split up, Kyoko disappeared...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sakura.png"/>
   : After that, Hina found
   <b>
    Celeste
   </b>
   in the
   <b>
    rec room, on the 3rd floor
   </b>
   , then quickly came and got you and me.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : According to Celeste, she was attacked by a suspicious individual and lay unconscious for about an hour. In other words, she was attacked an hour before we found her. Meaning,
   <b>
    just after 7 o'clock
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-FlashT.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-043.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-FlashB.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sakura.png"/>
   : Based on the picture Celeste took, we discovered her attacker was dressed in a strange costume. It was...
   <b>
    Robo Justice
   </b>
   . It also became clear that this Robo Justice had
   <b>
    dragged Hifumi away
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-044.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Sakura6.png"/>
   : After meeting up with Toko and Byakuya, we began searching for the costumed assailant. We found an
   <b>
    injured Hifumi
   </b>
   in the
   <b>
    library, on the 2nd floor
   </b>
   . We took him down to the
   <b>
    nurse's office, on the 1st floor
   </b>
   , then resumed our search. But not long after leaving the nurse's office...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-045.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Celeste14.png"/>
   : ...!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Byakuya15.png"/>
   : What's wrong...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Celeste14.png"/>
   : I saw a shadow! Something moving around at the top of the stairs!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Based on Celeste's claims, we went back up to the
   <b>
    2nd floor
   </b>
   , where we split up and began searching. Then, right after that...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Sakura7.png"/>
   : Celeste screamed. This time she had apparently seen the suspect on the
   <b>
    3rd floor
   </b>
   . Hearing her screams, we quickly made our way to the
   <b>
    3rd floor
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-047.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Hina15.png"/>
   : Celeste! What's wrong!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Byakuya7.png"/>
   : That was a rather...intense scream for someone like you.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Celeste14.png"/>
   : I saw him! The strange costumed man...! He ran off as soon as I screamed... I was blocking the stairs, so he headed
   <b>
    further down into the hallway
   </b>
   and disappeared...!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sakura.png"/>
   : And then...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-048.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   ???: Ungyaaaaaahhh!!!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Hina10.png"/>
   : Wh-What was that!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Celeste14.png"/>
   : That came from downstairs! It must have been...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Hifumi! He's in the nurse's office! This is bad! Come on, we have to go back!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : At that point, we decided to split up into two groups.
   <b>
    Celeste, Hina and I
   </b>
   went back to the nurse's office. Meanwhile
   <b>
    you, Byakuya, and Toko
   </b>
   pursued the suspect up on the 3rd floor. And when we got back to the nurse's office...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-FlashT.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-049.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-FlashB.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : ...we found Hifumi's corpse. Which is also when we heard the
   <b>
    body discovery announcement
   </b>
   play. I left Celeste and Hina alone and headed back to the 3rd floor to tell the others what had happened.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-FlashT.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-050.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-FlashB.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sakura.png"/>
   : But at that same time, we had discovered Taka's body in the
   <b>
    equipment room
   </b>
   . Which means Hifumi and Taka's bodies were discovered
   <b>
    right around the same time
   </b>
   . Because I remember hearing the body discovery announcement play right after finding Taka.

   : And that's when I showed up and told you and Byakuya that Hifumi had been killed, right? Then
   <b>
    you, me, and Byakuya

   all headed back to the nurse's office leaving behind Toko, who had fainted. But as soon as we left the physics lab we ran into Celeste, who'd just arrived to tell us something very unusual.

   : Then we remembered we had abandoned the unconscious Toko, and rushed back to the

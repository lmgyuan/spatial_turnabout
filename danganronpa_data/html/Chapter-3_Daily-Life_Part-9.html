    I was totally lost. Hiro grabbed me by the shoulder, pulled me close, and whispered into my ear...

    What...? Then...did Alter Ego finish his search...?

    I was probably louder than I needed to be...but me an Hiro hurried to the dressing room.

    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-009.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As soon as I got to the dressing room, an angry voice echoed out.

    Taka's irritated voice pierced the air as he stared pointedly at his wristwatch.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Kiyondo3.png"/>
   : It's almost 10 o'clock, you know that!? Bedtime for all the good little boys and girls!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Hifumi12.png"/>
   : Tch... Shut up...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Kiyondo.png"/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : Taka... He seems to be even worse off than I'd heard. Well, maybe it's a good thing. Maybe he's finally starting to grow a personality.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Kiyondo3.png"/>
   : What--!? You got a lotta poop fallin' outta that mouth of yours, you know that!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Toko12.png"/>
   : How rude... A maggot like you has no right to speak that way to our heaven-sent Master...!
   <br/>

   : Hm? Are you back to your normal gloomy self? I can hardly keep track at this point.

   : You wanted us all to meet here, right Kyoko? So, what are we doing here?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Hiro15.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Hina21.png"/>
   : Yeah, totally! Did he finally find a clue? What is it? A way out!? The mastermind's true identity!?

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Celeste8.png"/>
   : Was it the mastermind? Did they finally notice what we were up to?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : I told Alter Ego to yell if anyone he didn't recognize appeared. If it was the mastermind, I'm sure he would have alerted us.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Hina2.png"/>
   : Maybe we just...missed it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Kyoko7.png"/>

   : Mr. Ishimaru! You stole her, didn't you!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Kiyondo3.png"/>
   : What!? I'm the Ultimate Moral Compass! I would never do something like that!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Hina12.png"/>
   : I don't think it counts when you say it about yourself like that...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Kiyondo.png"/>
   : You're the suspicious one here! You're nothin' but a big, jiggling sack of fat!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Hifumi12.png"/>
   : Shows what you know. This isn't my true form! I still have three more transformations left!
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Hiro5.png"/>
   : Well I'm sure it was *one* of you. So whoever did it, just hurry up and confess!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : No. There's no way either one of them did it.

   : Huh? Why not!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : I told Alter Ego to yell if either Taka or Hifumi came into the dressing room.

   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : It was a countermeasure against the clear danger that one of them might come for it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Celeste2.png"/>
   : But...I never heard any yell.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : Exactly. Which means it wasn't them.
   <br/>

   : The fundamental circumstances are becoming clear... If it wasn't the mastermind, and it wasn't Taka or Hifumi...then quite simply, it was someone else.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Byakuya7.png"/>
   : Makoto, Celeste, Sakura, Hina, Toko, or myself... One of us must be the thief.

    Alter Ego...gone as quickly as he appeared... We'd finally discovered some small measure of hope. But even that was taken away from us. And we couldn't even put up a fight.

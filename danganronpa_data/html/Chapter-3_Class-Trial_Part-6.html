   : That was
   <b>
    to signal Hifumi

   : ...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Hina10.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto31.png"/>
   : Hina. You were with Celeste when Hifumi's body disappeared, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Hina2.png"/>
   : Yeah... I was feeling kinda sick, so Celeste took me to the bathroom...

   : ...Wait! Then that was--!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto31.png"/>
   : She wasn't worried about you. She just saw a chance to help Hifumi sneak out of the nurse's office.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : Each piece isn't much by itself, but start putting them together and the picture gets very ugly indeed.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Byakuya4.png"/>

   : ...Oh did I?

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : I didn't even catch it myself when you first said it, but looking back, I can say that that one little slip-up was your undoing.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Celeste15.png"/>
   : Wh-What are you talking about...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Byakuya7.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Byakuya5.png"/>
   : Then pay attention. Sakura, Toko, and I were first to discover Taka's body in the equipment room. Then Makoto showed up and told us Hifumi had been killed. So Sakura and I left with Makoto. Once we were in the hall, we ran into Celeste, and the four of us headed to the nurse's office. Now, the entire time we were together, none of us said anything about Taka being dead.

   : Quick side note about a detail I love: If you haven't been watching the videos or listening to any of the audio tracks or conversations in the game, Celeste speaks with an accent during the whole game. During this trial though, as soon as she starts yelling and her portraits become exaggerated, her accent totally disappears. At one point she tries to put it back on but she's barely maintaining it through her anger so you can tell she's basically been faking the accent the whole game. I don't know why I like this detail so much but I do and I wanted to share that.

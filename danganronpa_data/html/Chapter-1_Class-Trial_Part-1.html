   : A couple of notes about the trials. I highly recommend watching the videos for the trial updates. Trials are fully voice-acted and will look much better in motion than they will in screenshot format, plus you will get to see the full depth of the minigames this way since I will only be taking a few screen shots of each of them. Each trial update video will cover the whole update from start to finish.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Narration.png"/>
   : Additionally, in the videos, I will be skipping the tutorial text explaining the various minigames but I will write it out for the screenshot version of each update.

   : Let's begin with a basic explanation of the class trial! So, your votes will determine the results. If you can figure out "whodunnit" then only they will receive punishment. But if you pick the wrong one... then I'll punish everyone *besides* the blackened, and the one that deceived everyone else will graduate!

   : As things progress during each class trial, you will engage in a number of
   <b>
    Nonstop Debates
   </b>
   . During these discussions, characters will speak one after another,
   <b>
    without pause
   </b>
   . It's up to you to unearth any
   <b>
    lies or contradictions
   </b>
   buried within their statements. What this means is that you'll have to use your
   <b>
    Truth Bullets
   </b>
   to
   <b>
    refute
   </b>
   what they say. Any relevant Truth Bullets you've found during your investigation will be loaded into the
   <b>
    Truth Cylinder
   </b>
   . Pay close attention to each character's
   <b>
    statements
   </b>
   , and use your Truth Bullets to blast the right ones. Note that if you run out of time, you will automatically
   <b>
    fail
   </b>
   , so please be careful! Well then...good luck, and have fun!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Narration.png"/>
   : Nonstop Debates are the real meat of the trial. They're pretty fun to play especially as they get harder throughout the game. All you need to do is aim and shoot the correct truth bullet at the orange highlighted weak point to end the debate and move on. At any time while the others are talking, we can pause and review truth bullets from our e-Handbook. For this first debate I'll provide pictures of each person saying a line so you can get a feel for what the debate looks like, but after this one I will only show the debate transcript and me refuting the weak point.

   : For this first debate, we'd like to take a quick sidebar. If you're unable to spot and refute someone's
   <b>
    lies or contradictions
   </b>
   , the argument will
   <b>
    repeat
   </b>
   . Within a group of statements, some words appear in
   <b>
    a different color [bolded terms for this LP's purpose]
   </b>
   . Did you happen to notice? That represents a potential hole in a person's statement--a possible
   <b>
    weak spot
   </b>
   . These weak spots reveal important--though not always inaccurate--sections of a person's statement. Your Truth Bullets are
   <b>
    only effective against these weak spots
   </b>
   . So when you see one come up, take aim and fire--but only if you're sure it's actually wrong!

    slow down
   </b>
   so you can pay closer attention to what everyone's saying. On top of that, it'll
   <b>
    steady your aim
   </b>
   making it easier to target potential weak spots. Concentrating like this consumes the
   <b>
    Focus Gauge
   </b>
   , and if this gauge empties, you can't concentrate. But the Focus Gauge will
   <b>
    recover over time
   </b>
   . So let your brain take a rest. No need to rush!

   : Concentration is an extremely useful ability especially as the game progresses. We don't actually see it for this entire trial because this trial doesn't really demand it but later on when other mechanics get introduced it can be a big help and I'm sure I'll make liberal use of it. The Focus Gauge is represented by the Star meter we have in the upper right of the debate screen. The 5 stars will deplete quickly when concentrating, giving you just a few seconds of slowed time.

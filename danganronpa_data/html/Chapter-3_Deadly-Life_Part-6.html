   : So, Makoto...first I'd like to examine the corpses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    "Examine the corpses"... I can't believe I'm hearing that from a girl the same age as me...

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : Dead bodies don't lie, you know. They tell the truth far more easily than the living. Wouldn't you agree?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : How am I supposed to answer...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Anyway, we have to hurry. Before the class trial begins again...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Y-Yeah, you're right...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Okay then, show me where the bodies are.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    They're in...the repository. Then I guess we should head that way for now...

   : Hifumi...and Taka...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    For a moment, Kyoko seemed to go rigid. But *only* for a moment...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : Well then, let's get started.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    She crouched down next to Taka and without hesitation began poking and prodding the bodies.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : The Monokuma File was right. They were killed using similar weapons.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Her movements were so smooth--she was so...calm. Seeing how comfortable she was actually made *me* feel a little more comfortable...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-210.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : Makoto. I found something.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : You did...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : You remember the
   <b>
    wristwatch
   </b>
   Taka always wore on his left hand?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : He did...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kyoko3.png"/>
   : Are you so oblivious to the people around you? Do you dislike other people that much?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : N-No, that's not it... Anyway, so you said he had a watch?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-213.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Take a look... It's broken. You can see the hands aren't moving, right? It most likely broke when he had his encounter with his assailant. And if you notice, the hands are frozen at
   <b>
    just past 6 o'clock
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So that would mean...the watch was broken
   <b>
    sometime just after 6
   </b>
   ?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : But last night, Taka's watch definitely wasn't broken...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-214.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Kiyondo3.png"/>
   : Hey! You! How long were you gonna keep us waiting!?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Taka's irritated voice pierced the air as he stared pointedly at his wristwatch.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Kiyondo3.png"/>
   : It's almost 10 o'clock, you know that!? Bedtime for all the little boys and girls!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-209.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : So if it worked at 10 last night, it couldn't have been broken at 6 p.m. Meaning it must have happened at
   <b>
    6 this morning
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-215.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-216.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : And that's not all. Look at Taka's left hand. He appears to be gripping something...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : You're right! There's something...white in there.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Can you try and pry it out?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Me!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : Rigor mortis has already set in. Boys are better suited to this kind of manual labor, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : O-Okay...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    As much as I didn't want to, I grasped Taka's cold hand... The ice-cold hand was nearly enough to cause my heart to stop beating... After some effort, I was finally able to free the
    <b>
     object
    </b>
    from his tightly clenched fist.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-220.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : A...piece of paper?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : Was that all he had in his hand?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Yeah, that's it... Just a little scrap of paper. Doesn't seem like much of a clue, does it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : I wonder about that...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Kyoko then turned to Hifumi's body.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Let's check Hifumi's body now. Perhaps he's left us a few clues of his own.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-222.png"/>

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So? Did you find anything?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : I did. More than I expected, to be honest. Look at this...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-225.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : A...wad of paper?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Hifumi had it hidden on him.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Hidden...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : He'd stuffed it in his pants. So I can only assume he'd hidden it on purpose, you see?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : In his pants...? Wait, so you--!?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-228.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : It was just his pants. Not like his socks or something...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    I don't...know what that means...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : Anyway,, let's take a look at the paper. Go ahead, Makoto. Open it up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    When I think of how it was stuffed down his pants, it's like...it better be important, Hifumi, or I'll never forgive you for this!
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-230.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : ...A note!?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    "I found a hole maybe we can use to escape. Monokuma can't find out, so don't tell anyone else for now. Let's meet in the equipment room at 6 a.m."
   </b>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : That sounds...very familiar.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : That's it! It's the same thing Hiro said! Then he was telling us the truth!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : Although...it's not exactly the same, is it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-FlashT.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-232.png"/>

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-FlashB.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Hiro5.png"/>
   : Last night, someone slipped a
   <b>
    weird note
   </b>
   under my door. And here's what it said... "I found a hole maybe we can use to escape. Monokuma can't find out, so don't tell anyone else for now. Let's meet in the
   <b>
    rec room at 1 a.m.
   </b>
   "
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-233.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : The time is different... Hiro told us that his note said to meet at
   <b>
    1 a.m.
   </b>
   But the note they wrote to Hifumi asked him to meet at
   <b>
    6 a.m.
   </b>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : Hold on. Just because Hifumi had the note, doesn't mean it was meant for him.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : Part of it has been torn off, right? I think there's likely some meaning there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    There's some meaning to part of it being ripped...?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Umm...could you maybe explain it a little more?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : Think carefully...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-234.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Kyoko15.png"/>
   : Why would he have been clutching that scrap of paper so tightly?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I...I have no idea...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : What if it *wasn't* just a scrap of paper when he was holding it? What if it was something more important? And how would something important like that become a mere scrap of paper? That's what you need to answer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-235.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-236.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko.png"/>
   : And while we're at it, I should tell you one other thing. The two victims this time definitely had their e-Handbooks on them. So the handbooks have nothing to do with how the murders were carried out. Not that there was any reason to think they were connected to the killings in the first place...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So you're saying I don't have to think about the handbooks this time, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : If you didn't have to think about them at all, I wouldn't have gone out of my way to mention it. All I said was that they weren't used to help carry out the murders. There may come a point, however, where a handbook may play a role.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    A handbook may play a role...? I...don't think I understand. But if Kyoko thinks it's important, I'd better keep it in mind...

   : We have some new skills available to use. I explained a couple of them during the chapter but let's go over them in detail.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    Envious Influence:
   </b>
   Increases the Influence Gauge by 5. Effective during the Class Trial. Costs 4 SP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   -This skill came from Byakuya. It adds 5 hearts to your Influence Gauge, effectively doubling your health meter. There is a less powerful version of this skill that gives you only 2 hearts that cannot be combined with this skill. It's a very useful skill if you're playing through for the first time and you can find it because it gives you more room for error. I shouldn't ever be needing it because I know the answers at this point, but if the Bullet Time Battles get too crazy later on I might. I hope not though, there are a lot more useful skills to choose from.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    Breathing Technique:
   </b>
   The Focus Gauge recovers more quickly. Effective during the Nonstop Debate, the Hangman's Gambit, and the Bullet Time Battle. Costs 4 SP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   -This skill came from Sakura. If you find yourself using the Focus Gauge often this skill might be helpful to you. It speeds up the recovery rate for the Focus Gauge. I haven't used the gauge much this run so I don't think I'll be needing it. On a side note, one of the most useful combinations that I don't think we're able to get at this point is to combine it with a skill that slowly restores your Influence Gauge while you are using your Focus Gauge. It's a great combination that I used a lot in the sequel to restore my health because the end of DR2 gets hard and apparently I'm bad at logic.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    Handiwork:
   </b>
   Allows you to reload two bullets at once. Effective during the Bullet Time Battle. Costs 4 SP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   -We got this skill from Hifumi. Reloading is a mechanic that will be introduced during this trial. Basically, during BTB from now on when I shoot an argument I will use bullets. I have to press Square in time with the beat to reload bullets. If I don't have bullets, I can't shoot the arguments. I'm not looking forward to this because as I mentioned before, my audio setup doesn't allow me to hear the game audio as I record the trial so I have to do BTBs purely on visual cues. I'm definitely going to use this skill because the less I have to worry about messing up a BTB, the better.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Narration.png"/>
   : So we got some interesting and costly skills this chapter. Unfortunately, I can't equip any of them if I want to keep using all of the skills I had set before. As such, I'm trading out
   <b>

   for
   <b>
    Handiwork
   </b>
   . I think I can deal with a slightly wobbly cursor in exchange for the double bullet reloading. I've kept [b]Algorithm, Upshift, Robot Jock and Melodious Voice on as well. This brings me to 13/13 SP used.

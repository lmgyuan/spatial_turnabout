   : And...I guess it's in sleep mode, but...the power is definitely on.
   <br/>

   : Huh? But I thought it was broken...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sakura6.png"/>
   : I would bet that Chihiro fixed it. After all, he was known as the Ultimate Programmer.

   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Hiro4.png"/>
   : It's okay. I mean, anyone can make a mistake like that.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Hiro2.png"/>
   : As a matter of fact, one time I thought I'd spotted a Grey alien, but it turned out to be a tadpole!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Hina15.png"/>

   : But listen, isn't this really strange? What's this laptop doing in here?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kyoko3.png"/>
   : Maybe someone hid it here.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Hiro12.png"/>
   : If that's the case, we found it pretty easy...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Whoever put it here, I don't think they were trying to hide it from *us*.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Makoto.png"/>
   : Huh...? What do you mean?
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kyoko3.png"/>
   : Haven't you noticed? There's one big difference between this room and all the others.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    There's a difference...?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Makoto.png"/>
   : There's...no surveillance camera...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Precisely. There's no camera in here. Which means, this is the one spot where the mastermind is blind.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-302.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Hifumi18.png"/>
   : So you're saying someone put the laptop here so the mastermind wouldn't know about it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : And what Hina saw wasn't the ordinary glow of a computer screen. It was...the figure of Chihiro, shining pale green.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Kyoko.png"/>
   : I think it would be best if we investigated this laptop in a little more detail.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-304.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    It's just like Kyoko said... The display isn't on, but the laptop definitely has power.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Kyoko.png"/>
   : So first of all, we have to wake it up.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Makoto.png"/>
   : Right...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    I started hitting random buttons on the keyboard...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-306.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    ...and the display instantly began to glow a pale green. There were a bunch of different icons on the desktop.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : There--the icon on the far left.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Makoto.png"/>
   : What is it...? It says...
   <b>
    Alter Ego
   </b>
   ?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Celeste7.png"/>
   : "Alter ego" literally means..."another self," I believe. In the field of artificial intelligence, it is not uncommon to create different aspects of a personality. You can consider it something like...a pen name.

   : Could you let me see it, Makoto?

    With that, Kyoko moved between me and the computer. She moved the cursor over the Alter Ego icon...and when she double-clicked it...

   <b>
    Alter Ego
   </b>
   ... I've heard about this kind of AI program, but I've never seen one for myself.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Makoto.png"/>
   : AI program...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : It's how Chihiro earned his title of Ultimate Programmer. The AI lives in a computer, and by repeating different tasks, it gains knowledge and grows bit by bit. Apparently, Chihiro used a support vector machine and reinforcement learning to develop it... Eventually, he came up with a breakthrough in artificial intelligence design.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Makoto.png"/>
   : Support vector machine...? Reinforcement learning...?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-320.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : To put it simply, it's a learning method for computers.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Hifumi14.png"/>
   : If you wanna know more...just Google it, okay!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : But if this AI continues to grow, it will become more than just a piece of software to help people. Some say that an AI like this might someday *replace* people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-323.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Celeste8.png"/>
   : And that is why it is called Alter Ego? A fine choice then, I must say... It can create memories, have thoughts, and "grow up." The process isn't much different from how humans work.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Celeste3.png"/>
   : If you were to raise your own AI that way, it would make perfect sense to refer to it as your alter ego.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : A second, perfect personality that can never forget or grow old. That's what Chihiro created. That's...Alter Ego.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Makoto.png"/>
   : Kyoko... How do you know so much about this?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : ...

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Celeste17.png"/>
   : Anyway, so he fixed the broken laptop and put his own program on there. That is what this means, yes? Then he brought the machine to this dressing room, where the mastermind would not be able to see it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Hifumi20.png"/>
   : Hmm, but you know... All this about "Master" and whatnot... Yes, yes...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Hifumi15.png"/>
   : I...I believe I'm on fire...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Hiro12.png"/>

   : But he's a guy! And also a computer program!

   : Oh, that aspect is no problem.

   : That...aspect?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : Anyway, let's talk to him a little more.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Kyoko typed away rhythmically...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    &gt; "How much do you know about what's going on?"
   </b>
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-AlterEgo.png"/>
   : Master only gave me a general idea... But I do know things have become very grave. He found himself caught up in this without any warning...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Kyoko immediately shot out another question...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    &gt; "Why are you here?"
   </b>
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-AlterEgo5.png"/>
   : Are you asking what Master had planned for me? Well... He wanted me to
   <b>
    analyze
   </b>
   the massive number of files stored on this laptop. I believe the files are related to the school, but the protection on them is surprisingly strong. So it's taking me a little longer than I thought. But here's what Master must have been thinking... The fact that the files are protected so tightly means they must contain some important secret. For example, perhaps...the
   <b>
    secret of this school
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Makoto.png"/>
   : ...!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    While I was busy struggling to make a sound, Kyoko pushed forward and asked her next question.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    &gt; "How much longer until everything's unlocked?"
   </b>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-AlterEgo.png"/>
   : Umm...it's gonna be a while. But I'm definitely gonna do it, so you can just leave it to me!
   <br/>

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-337.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : So because of how long it would take, he designed Alter Ego to handle the workload.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Celeste4.png"/>
   : Smart. It also means that the work remains uninterrupted, even after his death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>

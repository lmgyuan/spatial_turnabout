Well, I have to say Larry, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.\n\nLarry:\nUm... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.\n\nPhoenix:\nA favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?\n\nLarry:\nYes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's news to me!\n\nLarry:\nI want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him, I owe him that much.\n\n???:\n(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)\n\nPhoenix:\n... Isn't that your client screaming over there?\n\nLarry:\nYeah... that's him.\n\n???:\n(Death! Despair! Ohhhh! I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die!!!)\n\nPhoenix:\nIt sounds like he wants to die...\n\nLarry:\nUm, yeah. *sigh*\n\nFey:\nNick!!!\n\nLarry:\nHey. Hey there, Mia.\n\nFey:\nDude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!\n\nLarry:\nWhat!? What's wrong, Mia?\n\nFey:\nOh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?\n\nLarry:\n(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)\n\nLarry:\nMy name is Larry Butz. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Mia Fey... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: 'When something smells, it's usually the Fey.' In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!\n\nAugust 3, 10:00 AM\nDistrict Court\nCourtroom No. 2\n\nJudge:\nThe court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Mia Fey.\n\nPayne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.\n\nLarry:\nThe, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nAhem. Mr. Butz? This is your first trial, is it not?\n\nLarry:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.\n\nJudge:\nYour conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.\n\nLarry:\nThank... thank you, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\n... Mr. Butz, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.\n\nLarry:\nY-Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)\n\nJudge:\nThis test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.",

When it's 4:00 PM here, it's 1:00 AM the next day there. The clock wasn't three hours slow, it was nine hours fast! The victim hadn't reset her clock since returning home! That's why the time you heard when you struck her dead in her apartment was wrong! Proof enough for you, Mr. Sahwit? Or should I say... Mr. Did It!\n\nSahwit:\nNgh! ...!\n\nJudge:\nO-order! Order, I say!\n\nJudge:\nWell... This case has certainly turned out differently than we all expected. Mr. Payne... your witness?\n\nPayne:\nHe... er... he was arrested and has been taken away, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nVery well. Mr. Butz?\n\nLarry:\nYes, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nI have to say, I'm impressed. I don't think I've ever seen someone complete a defense so quickly... and find the true culprit at the same time!\n\nLarry:\nThank you, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nAt this point, this is only a formality, but... This court finds the defendant, Mr. Mia Fey...\n\nNot Guilty\n\nJudge:\nAnd with that... The court is adjourned.\n\nLarry:\nIt turns out that Frank Sahwit was a common burglar! He posed as a newspaper sales-man to check and see when people were out of the house! That day... When Mia went to her apartment, the victim wasn't home. After he left, Mr. Sahwit let himself in to do his dirty work! While he was searching her place, the victim returned! Flustered, Mr. Sahwit grabbed the nearest blunt object he could find...\n\nAugust 3, 2:32 PM\nDistrict Court\nDefendant Lobby No. 2\n\nLarry:\n(Whew... I still can't believe we won!)\n\nPhoenix:\nButz! Good job in there! Congratulations!\n\nLarry:\nTh-thanks, Chief. I owe it all to you.\n\nPhoenix:\nNot at all, not at all! You fought your own battles in there. It's been a while since I've seen a trial end on such a satisfying note!\n\nLarry:\n(I've never seen the chief looking this happy... If she's this glad, imagine how Mia must feel!)\n\nFey:\nMy life is over...\n\nLarry:\nMia! You're supposed to be happy! What's wrong now!?\n\nFey:\nAww, Nick... Don't worry 'bout me! I'll be dead and gone soon!\n\nLarry:\nGood! Wait, no! I mean... Bad! Bad bad bad! Mia, you're innocent! The case is closed.\n\nFey:\n... But... but my Cindy-windy's gone, man! Gone forever!\n\nLarry:\n(Mia, she was a... Nah... Never mind.)\n\nPhoenix:\nCongratulations, Harry!\n\nFey:\nH-Harry...?\n\nPhoenix:\nYes, you! I can practically see the headlines now: 'Harry Fey, Innocent!'\n\nFey:\nHeh... um... thanks! I really owe you one. I won't forget this, ever! Let's celebrate! Dinner? Movie? My treat!\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, I couldn't.\n\nLarry:\n(Hey, I was the one who got you off the hook!)\n\nFey:\nOh, hey! H-here, take this! It's a present!\n\nPhoenix:\nA present? For me? Wait... Wasn't this the evidence that...\n\nFey:\nActually, I made this clock for her! I made one for her and one for me.\n\nPhoenix:\nR-really? You? You made this? ... Well, thank you. I'll keep it as a memento.\n\nFey:\nYo, Nick... Can you believe it? I was so into that chick... And... and she was just playing me for a fool! Don't that make you wanna just cry? *sob*\n\nLarry:\nMia...\n\nPhoenix:\n... Are you so sure?\n\nFey:\nEx-squeeze me?\n\nPhoenix:\nI think she thought quite a lot of you, in her own way.\n\nFey:\nNah, you don't gotta sympathize with me, 'sokay.\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, I'm not just sympathizing, really. Isn't that right, Butz? Don't you have something to show your friend? Something that proves how she felt about him?\n\nLarry:\nH-huh? Oh, yeah, right! (What the heck is she talking about?)",

Part, at least.\n\nPhoenix:\nYou'll have to tell me more about it sometime! Maybe... over drinks?\n\nLarry:\nAnd so, my first trial came to a close. Mia slapped me on the back and said, 'Gee, Nick, it's good to have friends!' But I'm pretty sure he's not going to pay us. Unless you count the clock he gave Phoenix. ... I didn't know it then... but that clock was soon going to be at the center of another incident.

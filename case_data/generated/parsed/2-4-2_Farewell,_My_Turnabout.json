That woman couldn't do anything like that.Phoenix:\nIn court today, there will be a mountain of evidence that will implicate you.Engarde:\nA mountain of evidence...?Phoenix:\nI'm certain there is someone out there trying very hard to pin this whole thing on you.Engarde:\nPlease, Mr. Lawyer! Dude, like I said yesterday... I'm \"refreshing like a spring breeze\", alright? I can't let any sort of scandal ruin that.Phoenix:\nI understand...???:\nWell, it's almost time.Phoenix:\nMia...Mia:\nWe must get a complete acquittal today.Phoenix:\nI know... But I can't focus on Maya's situation right now. (Changed from [I can't focus on Maya's situation right now.] in the original release) ...Or Pearls' either. No matter what, I have to focus on winning this case by the end of the day!Mia:\nIndeed. Well, let's get going!...*beep beep beep*...Phoenix:\n(It's him!)...*beep*...Phoenix:\nThis is Wright!???:\nGood morning. This is it, Mr. Attorney; the day of the trial.Phoenix:\nMaya... She's unharmed, right!????:\nWell... When I checked on her earlier this morning, she seemed a bit, how shall we say, tired.Phoenix:\n...!???:\nDon't worry. People don't die that easily. Besides, what you really should be concentrating on, is winning today's trial.Phoenix:\nG...Grrrr...???:\nFor my sake, as well as yours, you must win today's trial. (Changed from [For myself, you must win today's trial.] in the original release) Which is why... I sent you a little present this morning.Phoenix:\nPresent? What in the world would you want to give me!????:\nYou'll figure it out once the trial starts... And even if you don't \"like\" my gift... (Changed from [You'll figure it out once the trial opens... even if you don't 'like' my gift...] in the original release) I expect you to graciously accept it, and win the day's contest... If you please.Phoenix:\nWait!...*beep*...Phoenix:\n(The kidnapper sent me a \"present\"...?)Engarde:\nMr. Lawyer dude? Who was that...?Phoenix:\nAh, um... No one. It has nothing to do with you, so forget you heard anything!Engarde:\n...Dude, did your nose just get longer?March 22, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Matt Engarde. Are the prosecution and defense ready?Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\n... I say! Mr. Wright! What happened to Ms. von Karma!?Phoenix:\nI-I don't know, Your Honor! (Why are you getting mad at me!?)Bailiff:\n...Your Honor!Judge:\nPlease be quiet, bailiff. Court is in session. If you must tell me something, please keep it brief. Now then, what is it?Bailiff:\nProsecutor... Prosecutor von Karma has... This morning, Ms. von Karma was shot by an unknown gunman!Judge:\n... WWWWWWWHAT!?Phoenix:\nSh-Shot!?Mia:\nSomehow... I think this is the \"present\" that man was talking about.Phoenix:\nHis \"present\"...!Mia:\nMs. von Karma is one of the top prosecutors in the country at the moment. If she were to disappear... (Changed from [If she disappeared...] in the original release) it would be to your \"advantage\". (Changed from [This would be to your 'advantage'.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Th-This... This is totally insane!) M-Ms. von Karma! Is she alright!?Judge:\nI don't have that answer! ...???:\nShe's alive and in stable condition.Judge:\nThat's good... Phew. ... ...! Y-Y-You're...Phoenix:\n(I thought he'd show up...)Edgeworth:\n...Your Honor... Due to the circumstances, Ms. Franziska von Karma can not appear in court today. I, Miles Edgeworth, will be taking her place. The prosecution is ready... naturally.Edgeworth:\nMs. von Karma was shot in her right shoulder, and is currently undergoing surgery. Luckily, I have looked this case over and am familiar with the details. The prosecution seeks to prove the guilt of Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge:\nTh-The court acknowledges the prosecution.Edgeworth:\n...Wright. I finally found the answer I was struggling for on my long journey this past year. By the time this case comes to an end, you too, will know the answer.Phoenix:\n...!Edgeworth:\nNow then, the prosecution would like to call its first witness... Please bring Detective Gumshoe to the witness stand!Edgeworth:\nWitness, your name and occupation.Gumshoe:\nMy name's Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm a detective down at the precinct... for now.Judge:\n\"For now\"...?Gumshoe:\nAfter this trial's over... I'm supposed to turn in my badge, sir.Phoenix:\n(D-Detective Gumshoe...)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution has no need for a depressed witness. Lift your head up and face forward like a proud officer, Detective Dick Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!Edgeworth:\nNow, let's have your testimony. If we want to explore the various facets of this case, we must start with that.Mia:\nGet ready, Phoenix. This is going to be one very rough fight.Phoenix:\nYeah... It would have to be with Edgeworth as my opponent.  (The answer he was \"struggling\" for... Interesting... Show me this \"answer\" you finally found, Edgeworth...)Witness Testimony-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:\nHmm... After the award ceremony ended, the victim was alone in his room...?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! Both the victim and defendant went alone to their rooms, sir.Judge:\nI see. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you please give us a brief timeline of what happened after the ceremony?\nGumshoe:\nOK, pal. The ceremony started at 6 PM. It ended around 8 PM... and then there was a short break. A special post-ceremony show was supposed to start in the lobby 30 minutes later.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when the victim's body was found, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nWhich is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period.\nJudge:\nHmm... Please continue with your testimony, Detective.Gumshoe:\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe person who discovered the victim's body was Adrian Andrews, correct?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Adrian Andrews\" you're talking about?\nGumshoe:\nShe's the defendant, Matt Engarde's, manager. She's a really pretty lady... sir.\nJudge:\nAh, so she's a pretty lady... I wonder if she will grace us with her presence...\nGumshoe:\nWhen the post-ceremony show was about to start, she went to get Mr. Engarde. After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir.\nJudge:\nI see... And that's when she found the victim's body...Gumshoe:\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana.\nJudge:\nMmm... \"Banana\"...\nGumshoe:\nUm, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir.\nJudge:\nAh, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana.\nPhoenix:\nThen, what about the knife...?\nGumshoe:\nIt seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death.\nJudge:\nHmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death...

The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.

The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir.\nJudge:\nSo you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar.\nPhoenix:\nSo that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all.\nJudge:\nHmm...Mia:\nOur first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.Phoenix:\nBut there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...Mia:\nMaybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.Phoenix:\nIf you say so...Mia:\nOf course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?After pressing third, fourth and fifth statements:Edgeworth:\nI believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWhich brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.Phoenix:\n(Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)Judge:\nVery well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Judge:\nHmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.Gumshoe:\nIt was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.Knife added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\n...And there's this button.Judge:\nThat was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?Gumshoe:\nYes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Jammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAll of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?Edgeworth:\nYes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?Phoenix:\nHmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!Edgeworth:\nYou can press as hard as you'd like.

Show me this \"answer\" you finally found, Edgeworth...)Witness Testimony-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:\nHmm... After the award ceremony ended, the victim was alone in his room...?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! Both the victim and defendant went alone to their rooms, sir.Judge:\nI see. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you please give us a brief timeline of what happened after the ceremony?\nGumshoe:\nOK, pal. The ceremony started at 6 PM. It ended around 8 PM... and then there was a short break. A special post-ceremony show was supposed to start in the lobby 30 minutes later.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when the victim's body was found, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nWhich is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period.\nJudge:\nHmm... Please continue with your testimony, Detective.Gumshoe:\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe person who discovered the victim's body was Adrian Andrews, correct?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Adrian Andrews\" you're talking about?\nGumshoe:\nShe's the defendant, Matt Engarde's, manager. She's a really pretty lady... sir.\nJudge:\nAh, so she's a pretty lady... I wonder if she will grace us with her presence...\nGumshoe:\nWhen the post-ceremony show was about to start, she went to get Mr. Engarde. After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir.\nJudge:\nI see... And that's when she found the victim's body...Gumshoe:\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana.\nJudge:\nMmm... \"Banana\"...\nGumshoe:\nUm, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir.\nJudge:\nAh, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana.\nPhoenix:\nThen, what about the knife...?\nGumshoe:\nIt seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death.\nJudge:\nHmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death...

We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.Gumshoe:\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...\nGuitar Case updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal.

Ah, so much for my theory then...Gumshoe:\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat convinced you it had nothing to do with the case?\nGumshoe:\nThe guitar wasn't at the Gatewater Hotel that night.\nJudge:\nWell then, where was it?\nGumshoe:\nThe bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir.\nJudge:\nSo you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar.\nPhoenix:\nSo that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all.\nJudge:\nHmm...Mia:\nOur first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.Phoenix:\nBut there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...Mia:\nMaybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.Phoenix:\nIf you say so...Mia:\nOf course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?After pressing third, fourth and fifth statements:Edgeworth:\nI believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWhich brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.Phoenix:\n(Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)Judge:\nVery well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Judge:\nHmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.Gumshoe:\nIt was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.Knife added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\n...And there's this button.Judge:\nThat was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?Gumshoe:\nYes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Jammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAll of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?Edgeworth:\nYes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?Phoenix:\nHmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!Edgeworth:\nYou can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.Phoenix:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Cross Examination-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown.\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end...\nJudge:\nThat is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing.\nEdgeworth:\n...Gumshoe:\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls!\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah, I guess, but...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all!\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUm, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired.\nGumshoe:\nEh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's...\nEdgeworth:\nI look forward to your pension negotiations.\nGumshoe:\nN-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony.\nGumshoe:\n*sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too...\nEdgeworth:\nDetective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)Gumshoe:\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any proof that button belonged to the victim?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nOh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\".\nGumshoe:\nHuh? But can't you tell by just looking at it?\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nA-And the victim's blood is on it.\nPhoenix:\nAnyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward.\nGumshoe:\n... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Thread.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nThe button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal!\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nMia:\nThat's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.Gumshoe:\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhen was this button found?\nGumshoe:\nPretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder...\nEdgeworth:\nThe police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people...\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe:\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow were the fingerprints arranged on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nBy examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...?\nGumshoe:\nOh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe the bumbling of this department...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe:\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife!\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...)\nMia:\n...Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nThere's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"Phoenix:\n(A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)Mia:\nBe grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix:\nWe're still in a world of trouble...Mia:\nWell, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?Phoenix:\nWait a second!Gumshoe:\nWh-What?Phoenix:\nSo the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?Gumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The defendant...Phoenix:\n...Did not buy this knife.Gumshoe:\nH-Huh!?Phoenix:\nTake a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe:\n...Huh?Judge:\nIt has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...Gumshoe:\n\"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.Phoenix:\nThat's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.Gumshoe:\n... Uh oh.Phoenix:\nThe murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!Judge:\nYes, that is very true! This is a very big...Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...Judge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nI think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.Phoenix:\nH-How so!?Edgeworth:\nI admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.Gumshoe:\n...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*Edgeworth:\nThe question is... Where did this knife come from?Judge:\nWh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...Edgeworth:\nSorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.Judge:\nThere is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?Edgeworth:\nIf it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.Phoenix:\nUrk...Edgeworth:\nMr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.Judge:\nAmazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.Mia:\nIt seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...Phoenix:\n(This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)Judge:\nA murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.Edgeworth:\nI can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.Phoenix:\n(Evidence not yet shown...?)Mia:\nHe means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.Judge:\nWhat does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nUm, well...Mia:\nPhoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...Phoenix:\n(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)Judge:\nMr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?Actually, I do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"No, not right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.)\nJudge:\nLooks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means this court is adjourned.\nMia:\nPhoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!)\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"Phoenix:\nThere's one...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nOne piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!Judge:\nMr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.Edgeworth:\nWhat the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.Phoenix:\n(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)Judge:\nYou may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?Present Wine Glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong.\nJudge:\nI can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nI am a man of my word, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penaltyJudge:\nThis... is a wine glass, is it not?Phoenix:\nPlease look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... Well, yes, I see your point.Phoenix:\nHowever! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!Judge:\n...Gumshoe:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nW-Well? What do you all have to say...?Judge:\nAh, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...Phoenix:\nY-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!Judge:\nYou can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nWhat is it, Your Honor?Judge:\nYour opinion...Edgeworth:\n...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.Phoenix:\n...What!?Edgeworth:\nIt's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.Judge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)It's possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...)\nMia:\nYou can't think like that, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nRight now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(So in other words, push as far as we can go...)\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"There's no way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!)\nMia:\nThey just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough!\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"Phoenix:\nThe defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!Judge:\nHmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?Phoenix:\n(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)Edgeworth:\nUnlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Edgeworth:\nYou're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?Phoenix:\nTh-Then...Edgeworth:\nOf course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.Phoenix:\nFingerprints...Edgeworth:\nThere were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.Judge:\nOnly one? Well, whose were they!?Edgeworth:\nThey were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nThat is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)Edgeworth:\nMs. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.Phoenix:\nGrrr!Edgeworth:\nI've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!Judge:\nW-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...Edgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.Phoenix:\n\"Another witness\"...?Edgeworth:\nYes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!Mia:\nWhat in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?Edgeworth:\nNow then, witness, please state your name and occupation...Oldbag:\n...Edgeworth:\n... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Edgeworth:\nUurrngh!Oldbag:\n...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!Edgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Phoenix:\n(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)Oldbag:\nOh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!Edgeworth:\nI saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?Oldbag:\nI tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.Judge:\nMs... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nOof!Oldbag:\nShush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!Judge:\nYes, madam.Edgeworth:\nNo no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.Oldbag:\nIt's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?Edgeworth:\nThe witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag:\nIt was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!Judge:\nYou mean... You were a fan of the victim?Oldbag:\nLook, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!Phoenix:\n(Um... But those two were the same age...)Oldbag:\nAnyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.Edgeworth:\nVery well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.Oldbag:\nLeave it to me, Edgey-poo!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Judge:\nHmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...Oldbag:\nSee! It has to be him! He's the murderer!Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination",

Never misses a beat.Gumshoe:\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhen was this button found?\nGumshoe:\nPretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder...\nEdgeworth:\nThe police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people...\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe:\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow were the fingerprints arranged on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nBy examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...?\nGumshoe:\nOh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe the bumbling of this department...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe:\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife!\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...)\nMia:\n...Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nThere's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"Phoenix:\n(A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)Mia:\nBe grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix:\nWe're still in a world of trouble...Mia:\nWell, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?Phoenix:\nWait a second!Gumshoe:\nWh-What?Phoenix:\nSo the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?Gumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The defendant...Phoenix:\n...Did not buy this knife.Gumshoe:\nH-Huh!?Phoenix:\nTake a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe:\n...Huh?Judge:\nIt has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...Gumshoe:\n\"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.Phoenix:\nThat's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.Gumshoe:\n... Uh oh.Phoenix:\nThe murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!Judge:\nYes, that is very true! This is a very big...Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...Judge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nI think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.Phoenix:\nH-How so!?Edgeworth:\nI admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.Gumshoe:\n...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*Edgeworth:\nThe question is... Where did this knife come from?Judge:\nWh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...Edgeworth:\nSorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.Judge:\nThere is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?Edgeworth:\nIf it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.Phoenix:\nUrk...Edgeworth:\nMr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.Judge:\nAmazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.Mia:\nIt seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...Phoenix:\n(This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)Judge:\nA murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.Edgeworth:\nI can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.Phoenix:\n(Evidence not yet shown...?)Mia:\nHe means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.Judge:\nWhat does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nUm, well...Mia:\nPhoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...Phoenix:\n(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)Judge:\nMr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?Actually, I do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"No, not right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.)\nJudge:\nLooks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means this court is adjourned.\nMia:\nPhoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!)\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"Phoenix:\nThere's one...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nOne piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!Judge:\nMr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.Edgeworth:\nWhat the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.Phoenix:\n(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)Judge:\nYou may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?Present Wine Glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong.\nJudge:\nI can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nI am a man of my word, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penaltyJudge:\nThis... is a wine glass, is it not?Phoenix:\nPlease look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... Well, yes, I see your point.Phoenix:\nHowever! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!Judge:\n...Gumshoe:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nW-Well? What do you all have to say...?Judge:\nAh, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...Phoenix:\nY-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!Judge:\nYou can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nWhat is it, Your Honor?Judge:\nYour opinion...Edgeworth:\n...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.Phoenix:\n...What!?Edgeworth:\nIt's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.Judge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)It's possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...)\nMia:\nYou can't think like that, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nRight now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(So in other words, push as far as we can go...)\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"There's no way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!)\nMia:\nThey just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough!\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"Phoenix:\nThe defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!Judge:\nHmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?Phoenix:\n(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)Edgeworth:\nUnlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Edgeworth:\nYou're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?Phoenix:\nTh-Then...Edgeworth:\nOf course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.Phoenix:\nFingerprints...Edgeworth:\nThere were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.Judge:\nOnly one? Well, whose were they!?Edgeworth:\nThey were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nThat is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)Edgeworth:\nMs. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.Phoenix:\nGrrr!Edgeworth:\nI've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!Judge:\nW-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...Edgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.Phoenix:\n\"Another witness\"...?Edgeworth:\nYes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!Mia:\nWhat in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?Edgeworth:\nNow then, witness, please state your name and occupation...Oldbag:\n...Edgeworth:\n... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Edgeworth:\nUurrngh!Oldbag:\n...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!Edgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Phoenix:\n(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)Oldbag:\nOh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!Edgeworth:\nI saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?Oldbag:\nI tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.Judge:\nMs... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nOof!Oldbag:\nShush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!Judge:\nYes, madam.Edgeworth:\nNo no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.Oldbag:\nIt's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?Edgeworth:\nThe witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag:\nIt was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!Judge:\nYou mean... You were a fan of the victim?Oldbag:\nLook, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!Phoenix:\n(Um... But those two were the same age...)Oldbag:\nAnyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.Edgeworth:\nVery well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.Oldbag:\nLeave it to me, Edgey-poo!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Judge:\nHmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...Oldbag:\nSee! It has to be him! He's the murderer!Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination",

That woman couldn't do anything like that.Phoenix:\nIn court today, there will be a mountain of evidence that will implicate you.Engarde:\nA mountain of evidence...?Phoenix:\nI'm certain there is someone out there trying very hard to pin this whole thing on you.Engarde:\nPlease, Mr. Lawyer! Dude, like I said yesterday... I'm \"refreshing like a spring breeze\", alright? I can't let any sort of scandal ruin that.Phoenix:\nI understand...???:\nWell, it's almost time.Phoenix:\nMia...Mia:\nWe must get a complete acquittal today.Phoenix:\nI know... But I can't focus on Maya's situation right now. (Changed from [I can't focus on Maya's situation right now.] in the original release) ...Or Pearls' either. No matter what, I have to focus on winning this case by the end of the day!Mia:\nIndeed. Well, let's get going!...*beep beep beep*...Phoenix:\n(It's him!)...*beep*...Phoenix:\nThis is Wright!???:\nGood morning. This is it, Mr. Attorney; the day of the trial.Phoenix:\nMaya... She's unharmed, right!????:\nWell... When I checked on her earlier this morning, she seemed a bit, how shall we say, tired.Phoenix:\n...!???:\nDon't worry. People don't die that easily. Besides, what you really should be concentrating on, is winning today's trial.Phoenix:\nG...Grrrr...???:\nFor my sake, as well as yours, you must win today's trial. (Changed from [For myself, you must win today's trial.] in the original release) Which is why... I sent you a little present this morning.Phoenix:\nPresent? What in the world would you want to give me!????:\nYou'll figure it out once the trial starts... And even if you don't \"like\" my gift... (Changed from [You'll figure it out once the trial opens... even if you don't 'like' my gift...] in the original release) I expect you to graciously accept it, and win the day's contest... If you please.Phoenix:\nWait!...*beep*...Phoenix:\n(The kidnapper sent me a \"present\"...?)Engarde:\nMr. Lawyer dude? Who was that...?Phoenix:\nAh, um... No one. It has nothing to do with you, so forget you heard anything!Engarde:\n...Dude, did your nose just get longer?March 22, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Matt Engarde. Are the prosecution and defense ready?Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\n... I say! Mr. Wright! What happened to Ms. von Karma!?Phoenix:\nI-I don't know, Your Honor! (Why are you getting mad at me!?)Bailiff:\n...Your Honor!Judge:\nPlease be quiet, bailiff. Court is in session. If you must tell me something, please keep it brief. Now then, what is it?Bailiff:\nProsecutor... Prosecutor von Karma has... This morning, Ms. von Karma was shot by an unknown gunman!Judge:\n... WWWWWWWHAT!?Phoenix:\nSh-Shot!?Mia:\nSomehow... I think this is the \"present\" that man was talking about.Phoenix:\nHis \"present\"...!Mia:\nMs. von Karma is one of the top prosecutors in the country at the moment. If she were to disappear... (Changed from [If she disappeared...] in the original release) it would be to your \"advantage\". (Changed from [This would be to your 'advantage'.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Th-This... This is totally insane!) M-Ms. von Karma! Is she alright!?Judge:\nI don't have that answer! ...???:\nShe's alive and in stable condition.Judge:\nThat's good... Phew. ... ...! Y-Y-You're...Phoenix:\n(I thought he'd show up...)Edgeworth:\n...Your Honor... Due to the circumstances, Ms. Franziska von Karma can not appear in court today. I, Miles Edgeworth, will be taking her place. The prosecution is ready... naturally.Edgeworth:\nMs. von Karma was shot in her right shoulder, and is currently undergoing surgery. Luckily, I have looked this case over and am familiar with the details. The prosecution seeks to prove the guilt of Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge:\nTh-The court acknowledges the prosecution.Edgeworth:\n...Wright. I finally found the answer I was struggling for on my long journey this past year. By the time this case comes to an end, you too, will know the answer.Phoenix:\n...!Edgeworth:\nNow then, the prosecution would like to call its first witness... Please bring Detective Gumshoe to the witness stand!Edgeworth:\nWitness, your name and occupation.Gumshoe:\nMy name's Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm a detective down at the precinct... for now.Judge:\n\"For now\"...?Gumshoe:\nAfter this trial's over... I'm supposed to turn in my badge, sir.Phoenix:\n(D-Detective Gumshoe...)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution has no need for a depressed witness. Lift your head up and face forward like a proud officer, Detective Dick Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!Edgeworth:\nNow, let's have your testimony. If we want to explore the various facets of this case, we must start with that.Mia:\nGet ready, Phoenix. This is going to be one very rough fight.Phoenix:\nYeah... It would have to be with Edgeworth as my opponent.  (The answer he was \"struggling\" for... Interesting... Show me this \"answer\" you finally found, Edgeworth...)Witness Testimony-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:\nHmm... After the award ceremony ended, the victim was alone in his room...?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! Both the victim and defendant went alone to their rooms, sir.Judge:\nI see. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you please give us a brief timeline of what happened after the ceremony?\nGumshoe:\nOK, pal. The ceremony started at 6 PM. It ended around 8 PM... and then there was a short break. A special post-ceremony show was supposed to start in the lobby 30 minutes later.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when the victim's body was found, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nWhich is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period.\nJudge:\nHmm... Please continue with your testimony, Detective.Gumshoe:\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe person who discovered the victim's body was Adrian Andrews, correct?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Adrian Andrews\" you're talking about?\nGumshoe:\nShe's the defendant, Matt Engarde's, manager. She's a really pretty lady... sir.\nJudge:\nAh, so she's a pretty lady... I wonder if she will grace us with her presence...\nGumshoe:\nWhen the post-ceremony show was about to start, she went to get Mr. Engarde. After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir.\nJudge:\nI see... And that's when she found the victim's body...Gumshoe:\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana.\nJudge:\nMmm... \"Banana\"...\nGumshoe:\nUm, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir.\nJudge:\nAh, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana.\nPhoenix:\nThen, what about the knife...?\nGumshoe:\nIt seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death.\nJudge:\nHmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana.\nJudge:\nMmm... \"Banana\"...\nGumshoe:\nUm, his \"bandana\", sir...

His banana-scented bandana.\nPhoenix:\nThen, what about the knife...?\nGumshoe:\nIt seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death.\nJudge:\nHmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.Gumshoe:\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...\nGuitar Case updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal.

A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...Gumshoe:\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat convinced you it had nothing to do with the case?\nGumshoe:\nThe guitar wasn't at the Gatewater Hotel that night.\nJudge:\nWell then, where was it?\nGumshoe:\nThe bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir.\nJudge:\nSo you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar.\nPhoenix:\nSo that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all.\nJudge:\nHmm...Mia:\nOur first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.Phoenix:\nBut there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...Mia:\nMaybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.Phoenix:\nIf you say so...Mia:\nOf course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?After pressing third, fourth and fifth statements:Edgeworth:\nI believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWhich brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.Phoenix:\n(Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)Judge:\nVery well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Judge:\nHmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.Gumshoe:\nIt was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.Knife added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\n...And there's this button.Judge:\nThat was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?Gumshoe:\nYes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Jammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAll of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?Edgeworth:\nYes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?Phoenix:\nHmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!Edgeworth:\nYou can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.Phoenix:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Cross Examination-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown.\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end...\nJudge:\nThat is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing.\nEdgeworth:\n...Gumshoe:\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls!\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah, I guess, but...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all!\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUm, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired.\nGumshoe:\nEh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's...\nEdgeworth:\nI look forward to your pension negotiations.\nGumshoe:\nN-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony.\nGumshoe:\n*sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too...\nEdgeworth:\nDetective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)Gumshoe:\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any proof that button belonged to the victim?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nOh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\".\nGumshoe:\nHuh? But can't you tell by just looking at it?\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nA-And the victim's blood is on it.\nPhoenix:\nAnyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward.\nGumshoe:\n... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Thread.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nThe button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal!\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nMia:\nThat's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.Gumshoe:\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhen was this button found?\nGumshoe:\nPretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder...\nEdgeworth:\nThe police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people...\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe:\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow were the fingerprints arranged on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nBy examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...?\nGumshoe:\nOh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe the bumbling of this department...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe:\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife!\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...)\nMia:\n...Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nThere's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"Phoenix:\n(A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)Mia:\nBe grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix:\nWe're still in a world of trouble...Mia:\nWell, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?Phoenix:\nWait a second!Gumshoe:\nWh-What?Phoenix:\nSo the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?Gumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The defendant...Phoenix:\n...Did not buy this knife.Gumshoe:\nH-Huh!?Phoenix:\nTake a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe:\n...Huh?Judge:\nIt has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...Gumshoe:\n\"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.Phoenix:\nThat's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.Gumshoe:\n... Uh oh.Phoenix:\nThe murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!Judge:\nYes, that is very true! This is a very big...Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...Judge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nI think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.Phoenix:\nH-How so!?Edgeworth:\nI admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.Gumshoe:\n...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*Edgeworth:\nThe question is... Where did this knife come from?Judge:\nWh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...Edgeworth:\nSorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.Judge:\nThere is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?Edgeworth:\nIf it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.Phoenix:\nUrk...Edgeworth:\nMr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.Judge:\nAmazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.Mia:\nIt seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...Phoenix:\n(This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)Judge:\nA murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.Edgeworth:\nI can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.Phoenix:\n(Evidence not yet shown...?)Mia:\nHe means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.Judge:\nWhat does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nUm, well...Mia:\nPhoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...Phoenix:\n(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)Judge:\nMr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?Actually, I do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"No, not right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.)\nJudge:\nLooks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means this court is adjourned.\nMia:\nPhoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!)\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"Phoenix:\nThere's one...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nOne piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!Judge:\nMr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.Edgeworth:\nWhat the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.Phoenix:\n(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)Judge:\nYou may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?Present Wine Glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong.\nJudge:\nI can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nI am a man of my word, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penaltyJudge:\nThis... is a wine glass, is it not?Phoenix:\nPlease look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... Well, yes, I see your point.Phoenix:\nHowever! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!Judge:\n...Gumshoe:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nW-Well? What do you all have to say...?Judge:\nAh, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...Phoenix:\nY-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!Judge:\nYou can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nWhat is it, Your Honor?Judge:\nYour opinion...Edgeworth:\n...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.Phoenix:\n...What!?Edgeworth:\nIt's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.Judge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)It's possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...)\nMia:\nYou can't think like that, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nRight now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(So in other words, push as far as we can go...)\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"There's no way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!)\nMia:\nThey just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough!\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"Phoenix:\nThe defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!Judge:\nHmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?Phoenix:\n(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)Edgeworth:\nUnlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Edgeworth:\nYou're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?Phoenix:\nTh-Then...Edgeworth:\nOf course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.Phoenix:\nFingerprints...Edgeworth:\nThere were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.Judge:\nOnly one? Well, whose were they!?Edgeworth:\nThey were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nThat is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)Edgeworth:\nMs. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.Phoenix:\nGrrr!Edgeworth:\nI've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!Judge:\nW-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...Edgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.Phoenix:\n\"Another witness\"...?Edgeworth:\nYes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!Mia:\nWhat in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?Edgeworth:\nNow then, witness, please state your name and occupation...Oldbag:\n...Edgeworth:\n... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Edgeworth:\nUurrngh!Oldbag:\n...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!Edgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Phoenix:\n(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)Oldbag:\nOh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!Edgeworth:\nI saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?Oldbag:\nI tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.Judge:\nMs... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nOof!Oldbag:\nShush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!Judge:\nYes, madam.Edgeworth:\nNo no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.Oldbag:\nIt's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?Edgeworth:\nThe witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag:\nIt was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!Judge:\nYou mean... You were a fan of the victim?Oldbag:\nLook, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!Phoenix:\n(Um... But those two were the same age...)Oldbag:\nAnyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.Edgeworth:\nVery well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.Oldbag:\nLeave it to me, Edgey-poo!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Judge:\nHmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...Oldbag:\nSee! It has to be him! He's the murderer!Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what was your post on that night?\nOldbag:\nThe lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...)\nOldbag:\nBesides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?Oldbag:\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSomething you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that?\nOldbag:\nIt's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course.\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Gossip\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nIf this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony.\nMia:\nIt looks like we shouldn't force it right now.\nJudge:\nHmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?Oldbag:\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room?\nOldbag:\nI have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am!\nJudge:\n...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?Oldbag:\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho in the world was that!?\nOldbag:\nI'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was...\nJudge:\nYes...? He was...?\nOldbag:\n... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...)\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.Oldbag:\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get a sense of déjà vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release))\n\n\n\nThe person's face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's face in more detail!\nOldbag:\nYou don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth!\nPhoenix:\nHis teeth were... shining?\nOldbag:\nWell, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie.\nPhoenix:\n... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!?\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the person was carrying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was the man you saw carrying?\nOldbag:\nIn which hand? His right or his left?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nAh, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand?\nOldbag:\nAh, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand.\nPhoenix:\nThen how about his left?\nOldbag:\nEmpty.\nPhoenix:\n... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright.

Oh, yes, it was that thing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat thing?\nOldbag:\nThat gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...)\nOldbag:\nThat thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!!\nPhoenix:\nUm, right...\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright.

But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror.

I can't say his name out loud!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...)\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.Oldbag:\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get a sense of déjà vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release))\n\n\n\nThe person's face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's face in more detail!\nOldbag:\nYou don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth!\nPhoenix:\nHis teeth were... shining?\nOldbag:\nWell, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie.\nPhoenix:\n... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!?\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the person was carrying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was the man you saw carrying?\nOldbag:\nIn which hand? His right or his left?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nAh, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand?\nOldbag:\nAh, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand.\nPhoenix:\nThen how about his left?\nOldbag:\nEmpty.\nPhoenix:\n... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable?

Really, as if something like that matters.\nPhoenix:\nBut it does.\nOldbag:\nUm... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat thing?\nOldbag:\nThat gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...)\nOldbag:\nThat thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!!\nPhoenix:\nUm, right...\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable?

I request what the witness said about the jacket be appended to her testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't quite see where you're going with this, but alright. Witness, please...\nOldbag:\nAh well, I don't like to badmouth anyone without reason, but if I must...\nAdds statement \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I'm going to have to press a little harder on this one... There's got to be some sort of huge contradiction I can find here...)Oldbag:\nHe was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure the defendant was wearing a racing jacket?\nOldbag:\nWhat do you think? It's not like I've seen him in anything other than that horrible thing. I'm sure he was wearing it!\nPhoenix:\n(She is so sure of herself that it's to the point of self-absorption...)Present Jammin' Ninja's Button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag...\"Mia:\nShe may not remember things or be mistaken here and there, but I don't think she's lying.Phoenix:\nThat's bad for us. Really bad.Mia:\nBut, that's how the human mind is. It also has the tendency to jump off-topic. She's strayed onto a few interesting side-topics this time too, hasn't she? But that's what makes her a sweet old lady, right?Phoenix:\n(That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag...Oldbag:\nWhat!? Don't say my name for no reason!Phoenix:\nDo you know what this is?Oldbag:\nAaaah! It's button number 2 on the Jammin' Ninja's costume!Phoenix:\n(Now I KNOW she's an obsessed fan... She identified it in a single glance!)Oldbag:\nGive it here! Give it here! If you don't give it to me, I'll punish you with this!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Phoenix:\n(Wow... She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.Oldbag:\nSee! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!Phoenix:\nIt was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.Oldbag:\nSee! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!Phoenix:\n...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his \"usual racing jacket\"!?Oldbag:\n... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nNow hold your tongue still there for one second! So what you saw in actuality, was not Mr. Engarde, the man... but Mr. Engarde, the Nickel Samurai!?Oldbag:\nBut when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!Oldbag:\nEdgey-poo! Do you think so too?Edgeworth:\nWell, it might be something worth considering. (Changed from [Well, it might be something worth thinking about.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nJust say, \"It's important\" and agree with me for a change!Judge:\nWitness! Think carefully and try to remember as much as you can before you testify!Oldbag:\n*sigh* Alright, if you insist.Phoenix:\n(I should be the one sighing, not you!)Witness Testimony-- Who I Saw --Oldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Phoenix:\nI... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!Oldbag:\nWhat? Did you think there could've been someone else inside that costume? Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.Phoenix:\nBut... But the possibility does exist!Oldbag:\nAh, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.Judge:\nH-How do you know that?Oldbag:\nBecause... I said so. And what I say is the truth.Phoenix:\n(At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)Judge:\nMr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination",

That woman couldn't do anything like that.Phoenix:\nIn court today, there will be a mountain of evidence that will implicate you.Engarde:\nA mountain of evidence...?Phoenix:\nI'm certain there is someone out there trying very hard to pin this whole thing on you.Engarde:\nPlease, Mr. Lawyer! Dude, like I said yesterday... I'm \"refreshing like a spring breeze\", alright? I can't let any sort of scandal ruin that.Phoenix:\nI understand...???:\nWell, it's almost time.Phoenix:\nMia...Mia:\nWe must get a complete acquittal today.Phoenix:\nI know... But I can't focus on Maya's situation right now. (Changed from [I can't focus on Maya's situation right now.] in the original release) ...Or Pearls' either. No matter what, I have to focus on winning this case by the end of the day!Mia:\nIndeed. Well, let's get going!...*beep beep beep*...Phoenix:\n(It's him!)...*beep*...Phoenix:\nThis is Wright!???:\nGood morning. This is it, Mr. Attorney; the day of the trial.Phoenix:\nMaya... She's unharmed, right!????:\nWell... When I checked on her earlier this morning, she seemed a bit, how shall we say, tired.Phoenix:\n...!???:\nDon't worry. People don't die that easily. Besides, what you really should be concentrating on, is winning today's trial.Phoenix:\nG...Grrrr...???:\nFor my sake, as well as yours, you must win today's trial. (Changed from [For myself, you must win today's trial.] in the original release) Which is why... I sent you a little present this morning.Phoenix:\nPresent? What in the world would you want to give me!????:\nYou'll figure it out once the trial starts... And even if you don't \"like\" my gift... (Changed from [You'll figure it out once the trial opens... even if you don't 'like' my gift...] in the original release) I expect you to graciously accept it, and win the day's contest... If you please.Phoenix:\nWait!...*beep*...Phoenix:\n(The kidnapper sent me a \"present\"...?)Engarde:\nMr. Lawyer dude? Who was that...?Phoenix:\nAh, um... No one. It has nothing to do with you, so forget you heard anything!Engarde:\n...Dude, did your nose just get longer?March 22, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Matt Engarde. Are the prosecution and defense ready?Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\n... I say! Mr. Wright! What happened to Ms. von Karma!?Phoenix:\nI-I don't know, Your Honor! (Why are you getting mad at me!?)Bailiff:\n...Your Honor!Judge:\nPlease be quiet, bailiff. Court is in session. If you must tell me something, please keep it brief. Now then, what is it?Bailiff:\nProsecutor... Prosecutor von Karma has... This morning, Ms. von Karma was shot by an unknown gunman!Judge:\n... WWWWWWWHAT!?Phoenix:\nSh-Shot!?Mia:\nSomehow... I think this is the \"present\" that man was talking about.Phoenix:\nHis \"present\"...!Mia:\nMs. von Karma is one of the top prosecutors in the country at the moment. If she were to disappear... (Changed from [If she disappeared...] in the original release) it would be to your \"advantage\". (Changed from [This would be to your 'advantage'.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Th-This... This is totally insane!) M-Ms. von Karma! Is she alright!?Judge:\nI don't have that answer! ...???:\nShe's alive and in stable condition.Judge:\nThat's good... Phew. ... ...! Y-Y-You're...Phoenix:\n(I thought he'd show up...)Edgeworth:\n...Your Honor... Due to the circumstances, Ms. Franziska von Karma can not appear in court today. I, Miles Edgeworth, will be taking her place. The prosecution is ready... naturally.Edgeworth:\nMs. von Karma was shot in her right shoulder, and is currently undergoing surgery. Luckily, I have looked this case over and am familiar with the details. The prosecution seeks to prove the guilt of Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge:\nTh-The court acknowledges the prosecution.Edgeworth:\n...Wright. I finally found the answer I was struggling for on my long journey this past year. By the time this case comes to an end, you too, will know the answer.Phoenix:\n...!Edgeworth:\nNow then, the prosecution would like to call its first witness... Please bring Detective Gumshoe to the witness stand!Edgeworth:\nWitness, your name and occupation.Gumshoe:\nMy name's Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm a detective down at the precinct... for now.Judge:\n\"For now\"...?Gumshoe:\nAfter this trial's over... I'm supposed to turn in my badge, sir.Phoenix:\n(D-Detective Gumshoe...)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution has no need for a depressed witness. Lift your head up and face forward like a proud officer, Detective Dick Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!Edgeworth:\nNow, let's have your testimony. If we want to explore the various facets of this case, we must start with that.Mia:\nGet ready, Phoenix. This is going to be one very rough fight.Phoenix:\nYeah... It would have to be with Edgeworth as my opponent.  (The answer he was \"struggling\" for... Interesting... Show me this \"answer\" you finally found, Edgeworth...)Witness Testimony-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:\nHmm... After the award ceremony ended, the victim was alone in his room...?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! Both the victim and defendant went alone to their rooms, sir.Judge:\nI see. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you please give us a brief timeline of what happened after the ceremony?\nGumshoe:\nOK, pal. The ceremony started at 6 PM. It ended around 8 PM... and then there was a short break. A special post-ceremony show was supposed to start in the lobby 30 minutes later.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when the victim's body was found, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nWhich is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period.\nJudge:\nHmm... Please continue with your testimony, Detective.Gumshoe:\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe person who discovered the victim's body was Adrian Andrews, correct?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Adrian Andrews\" you're talking about?\nGumshoe:\nShe's the defendant, Matt Engarde's, manager. She's a really pretty lady... sir.\nJudge:\nAh, so she's a pretty lady... I wonder if she will grace us with her presence...\nGumshoe:\nWhen the post-ceremony show was about to start, she went to get Mr. Engarde. After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir.\nJudge:\nI see... And that's when she found the victim's body...Gumshoe:\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana.\nJudge:\nMmm... \"Banana\"...\nGumshoe:\nUm, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir.\nJudge:\nAh, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana.\nPhoenix:\nThen, what about the knife...?\nGumshoe:\nIt seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death.\nJudge:\nHmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana.\nJudge:\nMmm... \"Banana\"...\nGumshoe:\nUm, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir.\nJudge:\nAh, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana.\nPhoenix:\nThen, what about the knife...?\nGumshoe:\nIt seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death.\nJudge:\nHmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.Gumshoe:\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...\nGuitar Case updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...Gumshoe:\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat convinced you it had nothing to do with the case?\nGumshoe:\nThe guitar wasn't at the Gatewater Hotel that night.\nJudge:\nWell then, where was it?\nGumshoe:\nThe bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir.\nJudge:\nSo you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar.\nPhoenix:\nSo that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all.\nJudge:\nHmm...Mia:\nOur first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.Phoenix:\nBut there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...Mia:\nMaybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.Phoenix:\nIf you say so...Mia:\nOf course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?After pressing third, fourth and fifth statements:Edgeworth:\nI believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWhich brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.Phoenix:\n(Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)Judge:\nVery well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Judge:\nHmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.Gumshoe:\nIt was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.Knife added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\n...And there's this button.Judge:\nThat was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?Gumshoe:\nYes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Jammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAll of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?Edgeworth:\nYes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?Phoenix:\nHmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!Edgeworth:\nYou can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.Phoenix:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Cross Examination-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown.\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end...\nJudge:\nThat is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing.\nEdgeworth:\n...Gumshoe:\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls!\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah, I guess, but...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all!\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUm, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired.\nGumshoe:\nEh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's...\nEdgeworth:\nI look forward to your pension negotiations.\nGumshoe:\nN-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony.\nGumshoe:\n*sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too...\nEdgeworth:\nDetective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)Gumshoe:\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any proof that button belonged to the victim?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nOh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\".\nGumshoe:\nHuh? But can't you tell by just looking at it?\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nA-And the victim's blood is on it.\nPhoenix:\nAnyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward.\nGumshoe:\n... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Thread.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nThe button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal!\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nMia:\nThat's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.Gumshoe:\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhen was this button found?\nGumshoe:\nPretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder...\nEdgeworth:\nThe police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people...\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe:\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow were the fingerprints arranged on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nBy examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...?\nGumshoe:\nOh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe the bumbling of this department...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe:\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife!\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...)\nMia:\n...Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nThere's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"Phoenix:\n(A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)Mia:\nBe grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix:\nWe're still in a world of trouble...Mia:\nWell, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?Phoenix:\nWait a second!Gumshoe:\nWh-What?Phoenix:\nSo the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?Gumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The defendant...Phoenix:\n...Did not buy this knife.Gumshoe:\nH-Huh!?Phoenix:\nTake a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe:\n...Huh?Judge:\nIt has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...Gumshoe:\n\"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.Phoenix:\nThat's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.Gumshoe:\n... Uh oh.Phoenix:\nThe murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!Judge:\nYes, that is very true! This is a very big...Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...Judge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nI think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.Phoenix:\nH-How so!?Edgeworth:\nI admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.Gumshoe:\n...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*Edgeworth:\nThe question is... Where did this knife come from?Judge:\nWh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...Edgeworth:\nSorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.Judge:\nThere is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?Edgeworth:\nIf it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.Phoenix:\nUrk...Edgeworth:\nMr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.Judge:\nAmazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.Mia:\nIt seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...Phoenix:\n(This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)Judge:\nA murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.Edgeworth:\nI can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.Phoenix:\n(Evidence not yet shown...?)Mia:\nHe means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.Judge:\nWhat does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nUm, well...Mia:\nPhoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...Phoenix:\n(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)Judge:\nMr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?Actually, I do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"No, not right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.)\nJudge:\nLooks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means this court is adjourned.\nMia:\nPhoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!)\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"Phoenix:\nThere's one...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nOne piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!Judge:\nMr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.Edgeworth:\nWhat the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.Phoenix:\n(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)Judge:\nYou may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?Present Wine Glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong.\nJudge:\nI can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nI am a man of my word, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penaltyJudge:\nThis... is a wine glass, is it not?Phoenix:\nPlease look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... Well, yes, I see your point.Phoenix:\nHowever! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!Judge:\n...Gumshoe:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nW-Well? What do you all have to say...?Judge:\nAh, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...Phoenix:\nY-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!Judge:\nYou can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nWhat is it, Your Honor?Judge:\nYour opinion...Edgeworth:\n...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.Phoenix:\n...What!?Edgeworth:\nIt's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.Judge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)It's possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...)\nMia:\nYou can't think like that, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nRight now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(So in other words, push as far as we can go...)\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"There's no way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!)\nMia:\nThey just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough!\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"Phoenix:\nThe defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!Judge:\nHmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?Phoenix:\n(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)Edgeworth:\nUnlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Edgeworth:\nYou're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?Phoenix:\nTh-Then...Edgeworth:\nOf course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.Phoenix:\nFingerprints...Edgeworth:\nThere were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.Judge:\nOnly one? Well, whose were they!?Edgeworth:\nThey were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nThat is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)Edgeworth:\nMs. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.Phoenix:\nGrrr!Edgeworth:\nI've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!Judge:\nW-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...Edgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.Phoenix:\n\"Another witness\"...?Edgeworth:\nYes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!Mia:\nWhat in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?Edgeworth:\nNow then, witness, please state your name and occupation...Oldbag:\n...Edgeworth:\n... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Edgeworth:\nUurrngh!Oldbag:\n...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!Edgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Phoenix:\n(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)Oldbag:\nOh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!Edgeworth:\nI saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?Oldbag:\nI tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.Judge:\nMs... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nOof!Oldbag:\nShush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!Judge:\nYes, madam.Edgeworth:\nNo no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.Oldbag:\nIt's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?Edgeworth:\nThe witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag:\nIt was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!Judge:\nYou mean... You were a fan of the victim?Oldbag:\nLook, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!Phoenix:\n(Um... But those two were the same age...)Oldbag:\nAnyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.Edgeworth:\nVery well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.Oldbag:\nLeave it to me, Edgey-poo!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Judge:\nHmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...Oldbag:\nSee! It has to be him! He's the murderer!Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what was your post on that night?\nOldbag:\nThe lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...)\nOldbag:\nBesides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?Oldbag:\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSomething you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that?\nOldbag:\nIt's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course.\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Gossip\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nIf this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony.\nMia:\nIt looks like we shouldn't force it right now.\nJudge:\nHmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?Oldbag:\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room?\nOldbag:\nI have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am!\nJudge:\n...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?Oldbag:\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho in the world was that!?\nOldbag:\nI'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was...\nJudge:\nYes...? He was...?\nOldbag:\n... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...)\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.Oldbag:\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get a sense of déjà vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release))\n\n\n\nThe person's face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's face in more detail!\nOldbag:\nYou don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth!\nPhoenix:\nHis teeth were... shining?\nOldbag:\nWell, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie.\nPhoenix:\n... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!?\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the person was carrying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was the man you saw carrying?\nOldbag:\nIn which hand? His right or his left?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nAh, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand?\nOldbag:\nAh, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand.\nPhoenix:\nThen how about his left?\nOldbag:\nEmpty.\nPhoenix:\n... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth.

There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nThe person's clothes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's clothes in more detail!\nOldbag:\nWhat a troublesome man you are. Really, as if something like that matters.\nPhoenix:\nBut it does.\nOldbag:\nUm... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat thing?\nOldbag:\nThat gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...)\nOldbag:\nThat thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!!\nPhoenix:\nUm, right...\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable?

I request what the witness said about the jacket be appended to her testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't quite see where you're going with this, but alright. Witness, please...\nOldbag:\nAh well, I don't like to badmouth anyone without reason, but if I must...\nAdds statement \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I'm going to have to press a little harder on this one... There's got to be some sort of huge contradiction I can find here...)Oldbag:\nHe was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure the defendant was wearing a racing jacket?\nOldbag:\nWhat do you think? It's not like I've seen him in anything other than that horrible thing. I'm sure he was wearing it!\nPhoenix:\n(She is so sure of herself that it's to the point of self-absorption...)Present Jammin' Ninja's Button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag...\"Mia:\nShe may not remember things or be mistaken here and there, but I don't think she's lying.Phoenix:\nThat's bad for us. Really bad.Mia:\nBut, that's how the human mind is. It also has the tendency to jump off-topic. She's strayed onto a few interesting side-topics this time too, hasn't she? But that's what makes her a sweet old lady, right?Phoenix:\n(That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag...Oldbag:\nWhat!? Don't say my name for no reason!Phoenix:\nDo you know what this is?Oldbag:\nAaaah! It's button number 2 on the Jammin' Ninja's costume!Phoenix:\n(Now I KNOW she's an obsessed fan... She identified it in a single glance!)Oldbag:\nGive it here! Give it here! If you don't give it to me, I'll punish you with this!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Phoenix:\n(Wow... She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.Oldbag:\nSee! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!Phoenix:\nIt was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.Oldbag:\nSee! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!Phoenix:\n...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his \"usual racing jacket\"!?Oldbag:\n... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nNow hold your tongue still there for one second! So what you saw in actuality, was not Mr. Engarde, the man... but Mr. Engarde, the Nickel Samurai!?Oldbag:\nBut when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!Oldbag:\nEdgey-poo! Do you think so too?Edgeworth:\nWell, it might be something worth considering. (Changed from [Well, it might be something worth thinking about.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nJust say, \"It's important\" and agree with me for a change!Judge:\nWitness! Think carefully and try to remember as much as you can before you testify!Oldbag:\n*sigh* Alright, if you insist.Phoenix:\n(I should be the one sighing, not you!)Witness Testimony-- Who I Saw --Oldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Phoenix:\nI... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!Oldbag:\nWhat? Did you think there could've been someone else inside that costume? Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.Phoenix:\nBut... But the possibility does exist!Oldbag:\nAh, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.Judge:\nH-How do you know that?Oldbag:\nBecause... I said so. And what I say is the truth.Phoenix:\n(At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)Judge:\nMr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- Who I Saw --Oldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you please get on with your testimony!\nOldbag:\nHmph! Watch your language, young man! What sort of tone is that to take with an elder! My youthfulness isn't what it used to be, so you should forgive me for everything! If you keep on barking at me like that, I'll start singing at the top of my lungs!\nPhoenix:\nUh, what?\nOldbag:\n\"A striking figure by the sea, standing all alone is he. He's the Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n(...She's actually singing... Someone help my poor ears.)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Can you please do something about this racket!?\nEdgeworth:\nWitness. I'll give you a piece of gum later if you'll be good and stick to just the facts.\nOldbag:\nOKAAAAAAAY! ... You promise, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I'll be sending the bill for the chewing gum to your office at a later date.\nPhoenix:\n(Remind me to send you a thank you note later too, Edgeworth, old chum...)Oldbag:\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBe a little more careful with your testimony, please! Not too long ago, you said he was wearing his \"racing jacket\", and now he's not!?\nOldbag:\n\"Not too long ago\"...? Then let me ask you this! When you were itty-bitty, what was your grand dream?\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nOldbag:\nWhat did you want to be when you grew up, whippersnapper!?\nPhoenix:\nMy dream, huh...? Well, I... uh, wanted to be Judge Wackner, hero of the Public's Court. So what!?\nOldbag:\nSee! And look at where you are now! You're not Judge Wackner, are you!? Are you!?\nPhoenix:\nWell...\nOldbag:\n\"What I said earlier\"... Who puts any weight into things like that!? The \"now\" is everything! I can't be held responsible for the \"past\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did court become theatrics over testimonies?)\nOldbag:\nAll that matters is that man was inside that costume. Isn't that enough!?Oldbag:\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why would that be?\nOldbag:\nThat way, no one could see his face, of course!\nPhoenix:\nBut there's still no advantage for him that I can see. In fact, you would think the costume would make him stand out all the more!\nOldbag:\n... You are such a annoying child, you know that? You disagree with everything I say...\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that what YOU'RE always doing to me!?)\nOldbag:\nI got it! Maybe it was more troublesome for him to change in and out of his costume!Oldbag:\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas there anyone else scheduled to appear at the post-ceremony show?\nOldbag:\nWell, all the contestants were supposed to go onstage in a friendly gesture thing.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that included the Jammin' Ninja...?\nOldbag:\nOf course it included him! That's why when Engarde came out of dear Juan's room, I didn't give it a second thought.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nOldbag:\nWell, anyway.Oldbag:\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo let me ask you one last time. The person you saw, it really was the Nickel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nAs showy as ever. Haven't I been saying that from the very beginning!?\nPhoenix:\n(Can I throw in the towel yet?)Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Please take a look at this.\"Phoenix:\nHmm...Mia:\nYou don't need to think too hard on this one.Phoenix:\nHuh?Mia:\nThere's a contradiction in her testimony and it's sitting in plain sight. The question is what that contradiction means for us...Phoenix:\n(Well, I have to figure out what you're talking about first, but OK...)Phoenix:\nPlease take a look at this.Oldbag:\nYeah, so, it's a knife. Big deal. If you're trying to scare me with that, I'll have you know it won't work!Phoenix:\nNo no, that's not my intention at all...Judge:\nThat's the knife that was used in the murder, correct?Phoenix:\nYour Honor. Do you know why this piece of evidence is important to this case?Judge:\nYou don't even have to ask. It's because the defendant's fingerprints are on it.Edgeworth:\n... Is that what you're driving at...?Phoenix:\nThat is exactly what I am driving at.Judge:\nWhat are we driving at? And whose car are we driving?Phoenix:\nIf Mr. Engarde was really in the Nickel Samurai costume at the time of the murder, then it's impossible for his fingerprints to have been left on this knife! Actually, he would have wiped all previous fingerprints on this knife right off!Judge:\nOh, that's right! The Nickel Samurai wears gloves, doesn't he?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHe probably took his gloves off before he began the stabbing!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nAnd why would he do something like that? To leave his prints on the murder weapon? There is no way he would do something like that!Edgeworth:\nHowever, there is one possibility!Phoenix:\nThen let's hear your \"possibility\"!Edgeworth:\nIt's very simple. The defendant went to the victim's room while in costume as the Nickel Samurai. At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder.

When you were itty-bitty, what was your grand dream?\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nOldbag:\nWhat did you want to be when you grew up, whippersnapper!?\nPhoenix:\nMy dream, huh...? Well, I... uh, wanted to be Judge Wackner, hero of the Public's Court. So what!?\nOldbag:\nSee! And look at where you are now! You're not Judge Wackner, are you!? Are you!?\nPhoenix:\nWell...\nOldbag:\n\"What I said earlier\"... Who puts any weight into things like that!? The \"now\" is everything! I can't be held responsible for the \"past\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did court become theatrics over testimonies?)\nOldbag:\nAll that matters is that man was inside that costume.

You disagree with everything I say...\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that what YOU'RE always doing to me!?)\nOldbag:\nI got it!

That's why when Engarde came out of dear Juan's room, I didn't give it a second thought.\nJudge:\nHmm...

Dude, like I said yesterday... I'm \"refreshing like a spring breeze\", alright? I can't let any sort of scandal ruin that.Phoenix:\nI understand...???:\nWell, it's almost time.Phoenix:\nMia...Mia:\nWe must get a complete acquittal today.Phoenix:\nI know...

Luckily, I have looked this case over and am familiar with the details. The prosecution seeks to prove the guilt of Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge:\nTh-The court acknowledges the prosecution.Edgeworth:\n...Wright. I finally found the answer I was struggling for on my long journey this past year. By the time this case comes to an end, you too, will know the answer.Phoenix:\n...!Edgeworth:\nNow then, the prosecution would like to call its first witness... Please bring Detective Gumshoe to the witness stand!Edgeworth:\nWitness, your name and occupation.Gumshoe:\nMy name's Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm a detective down at the precinct... for now.Judge:\n\"For now\"...?Gumshoe:\nAfter this trial's over... I'm supposed to turn in my badge, sir.Phoenix:\n(D-Detective Gumshoe...)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution has no need for a depressed witness. Lift your head up and face forward like a proud officer, Detective Dick Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!Edgeworth:\nNow, let's have your testimony. If we want to explore the various facets of this case, we must start with that.Mia:\nGet ready, Phoenix. This is going to be one very rough fight.Phoenix:\nYeah... It would have to be with Edgeworth as my opponent.  (The answer he was \"struggling\" for... Interesting... Show me this \"answer\" you finally found, Edgeworth...)Witness Testimony-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:\nHmm... After the award ceremony ended, the victim was alone in his room...?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! Both the victim and defendant went alone to their rooms, sir.Judge:\nI see. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you please give us a brief timeline of what happened after the ceremony?\nGumshoe:\nOK, pal. The ceremony started at 6 PM. It ended around 8 PM... and then there was a short break. A special post-ceremony show was supposed to start in the lobby 30 minutes later.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when the victim's body was found, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nWhich is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period.\nJudge:\nHmm... Please continue with your testimony, Detective.Gumshoe:\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe person who discovered the victim's body was Adrian Andrews, correct?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Adrian Andrews\" you're talking about?\nGumshoe:\nShe's the defendant, Matt Engarde's, manager. She's a really pretty lady... sir.\nJudge:\nAh, so she's a pretty lady... I wonder if she will grace us with her presence...\nGumshoe:\nWhen the post-ceremony show was about to start, she went to get Mr. Engarde. After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir.\nJudge:\nI see... And that's when she found the victim's body...Gumshoe:\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death...

That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir.\nJudge:\nAh, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana.\nPhoenix:\nThen, what about the knife...?\nGumshoe:\nIt seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death.\nJudge:\nHmm...

We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.Gumshoe:\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...\nGuitar Case updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal.

Ah, so much for my theory then...Gumshoe:\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat convinced you it had nothing to do with the case?\nGumshoe:\nThe guitar wasn't at the Gatewater Hotel that night.\nJudge:\nWell then, where was it?\nGumshoe:\nThe bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir.\nJudge:\nSo you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar.\nPhoenix:\nSo that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all.\nJudge:\nHmm...Mia:\nOur first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.Phoenix:\nBut there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...Mia:\nMaybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.Phoenix:\nIf you say so...Mia:\nOf course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?After pressing third, fourth and fifth statements:Edgeworth:\nI believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWhich brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.Phoenix:\n(Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)Judge:\nVery well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Judge:\nHmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.Gumshoe:\nIt was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.Knife added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\n...And there's this button.Judge:\nThat was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?Gumshoe:\nYes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Jammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAll of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?Edgeworth:\nYes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?Phoenix:\nHmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!Edgeworth:\nYou can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.Phoenix:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Cross Examination-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown.\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end...\nJudge:\nThat is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing.\nEdgeworth:\n...Gumshoe:\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls!\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah, I guess, but...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all!\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUm, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired.\nGumshoe:\nEh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's...\nEdgeworth:\nI look forward to your pension negotiations.\nGumshoe:\nN-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony.\nGumshoe:\n*sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too...\nEdgeworth:\nDetective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)Gumshoe:\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any proof that button belonged to the victim?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nOh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\".\nGumshoe:\nHuh? But can't you tell by just looking at it?\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nA-And the victim's blood is on it.\nPhoenix:\nAnyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward.\nGumshoe:\n... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Thread.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nThe button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal!\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nMia:\nThat's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.Gumshoe:\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhen was this button found?\nGumshoe:\nPretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder...\nEdgeworth:\nThe police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people...\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe:\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow were the fingerprints arranged on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nBy examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...?\nGumshoe:\nOh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe the bumbling of this department...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe:\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife!\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...)\nMia:\n...Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nThere's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"Phoenix:\n(A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)Mia:\nBe grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix:\nWe're still in a world of trouble...Mia:\nWell, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?Phoenix:\nWait a second!Gumshoe:\nWh-What?Phoenix:\nSo the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?Gumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The defendant...Phoenix:\n...Did not buy this knife.Gumshoe:\nH-Huh!?Phoenix:\nTake a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe:\n...Huh?Judge:\nIt has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...Gumshoe:\n\"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.Phoenix:\nThat's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.Gumshoe:\n... Uh oh.Phoenix:\nThe murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!Judge:\nYes, that is very true! This is a very big...Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...Judge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nI think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.Phoenix:\nH-How so!?Edgeworth:\nI admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.Gumshoe:\n...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*Edgeworth:\nThe question is... Where did this knife come from?Judge:\nWh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...Edgeworth:\nSorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.Judge:\nThere is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?Edgeworth:\nIf it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.Phoenix:\nUrk...Edgeworth:\nMr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.Judge:\nAmazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.Mia:\nIt seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...Phoenix:\n(This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)Judge:\nA murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.Edgeworth:\nI can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.Phoenix:\n(Evidence not yet shown...?)Mia:\nHe means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.Judge:\nWhat does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nUm, well...Mia:\nPhoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...Phoenix:\n(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)Judge:\nMr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?Actually, I do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"No, not right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.)\nJudge:\nLooks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means this court is adjourned.\nMia:\nPhoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!)\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"Phoenix:\nThere's one...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nOne piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!Judge:\nMr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.Edgeworth:\nWhat the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.Phoenix:\n(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)Judge:\nYou may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?Present Wine Glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong.\nJudge:\nI can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nI am a man of my word, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penaltyJudge:\nThis... is a wine glass, is it not?Phoenix:\nPlease look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... Well, yes, I see your point.Phoenix:\nHowever! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!Judge:\n...Gumshoe:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nW-Well? What do you all have to say...?Judge:\nAh, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...Phoenix:\nY-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!Judge:\nYou can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nWhat is it, Your Honor?Judge:\nYour opinion...Edgeworth:\n...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.Phoenix:\n...What!?Edgeworth:\nIt's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.Judge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)It's possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...)\nMia:\nYou can't think like that, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nRight now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(So in other words, push as far as we can go...)\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"There's no way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!)\nMia:\nThey just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough!\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"Phoenix:\nThe defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!Judge:\nHmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?Phoenix:\n(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)Edgeworth:\nUnlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Edgeworth:\nYou're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?Phoenix:\nTh-Then...Edgeworth:\nOf course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.Phoenix:\nFingerprints...Edgeworth:\nThere were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.Judge:\nOnly one? Well, whose were they!?Edgeworth:\nThey were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nThat is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)Edgeworth:\nMs. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.Phoenix:\nGrrr!Edgeworth:\nI've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!Judge:\nW-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...Edgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.Phoenix:\n\"Another witness\"...?Edgeworth:\nYes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!Mia:\nWhat in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?Edgeworth:\nNow then, witness, please state your name and occupation...Oldbag:\n...Edgeworth:\n... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Edgeworth:\nUurrngh!Oldbag:\n...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!Edgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Phoenix:\n(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)Oldbag:\nOh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!Edgeworth:\nI saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?Oldbag:\nI tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.Judge:\nMs... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nOof!Oldbag:\nShush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!Judge:\nYes, madam.Edgeworth:\nNo no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.Oldbag:\nIt's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?Edgeworth:\nThe witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag:\nIt was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!Judge:\nYou mean... You were a fan of the victim?Oldbag:\nLook, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!Phoenix:\n(Um... But those two were the same age...)Oldbag:\nAnyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.Edgeworth:\nVery well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.Oldbag:\nLeave it to me, Edgey-poo!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Judge:\nHmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...Oldbag:\nSee! It has to be him! He's the murderer!Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what was your post on that night?\nOldbag:\nThe lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...)\nOldbag:\nBesides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?Oldbag:\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSomething you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that?\nOldbag:\nIt's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course.\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Gossip\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nIf this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony.\nMia:\nIt looks like we shouldn't force it right now.\nJudge:\nHmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?Oldbag:\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room?\nOldbag:\nI have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am!\nJudge:\n...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?Oldbag:\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho in the world was that!?\nOldbag:\nI'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was...\nJudge:\nYes...? He was...?\nOldbag:\n... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...)\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.Oldbag:\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get a sense of déjà vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release))\n\n\n\nThe person's face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's face in more detail!\nOldbag:\nYou don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth!\nPhoenix:\nHis teeth were... shining?\nOldbag:\nWell, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie.\nPhoenix:\n... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!?\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright.

His right or his left?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nAh, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand?\nOldbag:\nAh, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand.\nPhoenix:\nThen how about his left?\nOldbag:\nEmpty.\nPhoenix:\n... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable?

Really, as if something like that matters.\nPhoenix:\nBut it does.\nOldbag:\nUm... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat thing?\nOldbag:\nThat gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...)\nOldbag:\nThat thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!!\nPhoenix:\nUm, right...\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable?

I request what the witness said about the jacket be appended to her testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't quite see where you're going with this, but alright. Witness, please...\nOldbag:\nAh well, I don't like to badmouth anyone without reason, but if I must...\nAdds statement \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I'm going to have to press a little harder on this one... There's got to be some sort of huge contradiction I can find here...)Oldbag:\nHe was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure the defendant was wearing a racing jacket?\nOldbag:\nWhat do you think? It's not like I've seen him in anything other than that horrible thing. I'm sure he was wearing it!\nPhoenix:\n(She is so sure of herself that it's to the point of self-absorption...)Present Jammin' Ninja's Button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag...\"Mia:\nShe may not remember things or be mistaken here and there, but I don't think she's lying.Phoenix:\nThat's bad for us. Really bad.Mia:\nBut, that's how the human mind is. It also has the tendency to jump off-topic. She's strayed onto a few interesting side-topics this time too, hasn't she? But that's what makes her a sweet old lady, right?Phoenix:\n(That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag...Oldbag:\nWhat!? Don't say my name for no reason!Phoenix:\nDo you know what this is?Oldbag:\nAaaah! It's button number 2 on the Jammin' Ninja's costume!Phoenix:\n(Now I KNOW she's an obsessed fan... She identified it in a single glance!)Oldbag:\nGive it here! Give it here! If you don't give it to me, I'll punish you with this!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Phoenix:\n(Wow... She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.Oldbag:\nSee! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!Phoenix:\nIt was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.Oldbag:\nSee! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!Phoenix:\n...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his \"usual racing jacket\"!?Oldbag:\n... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nNow hold your tongue still there for one second! So what you saw in actuality, was not Mr. Engarde, the man... but Mr. Engarde, the Nickel Samurai!?Oldbag:\nBut when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!Oldbag:\nEdgey-poo! Do you think so too?Edgeworth:\nWell, it might be something worth considering. (Changed from [Well, it might be something worth thinking about.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nJust say, \"It's important\" and agree with me for a change!Judge:\nWitness! Think carefully and try to remember as much as you can before you testify!Oldbag:\n*sigh* Alright, if you insist.Phoenix:\n(I should be the one sighing, not you!)Witness Testimony-- Who I Saw --Oldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Phoenix:\nI... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!Oldbag:\nWhat? Did you think there could've been someone else inside that costume? Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.Phoenix:\nBut... But the possibility does exist!Oldbag:\nAh, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.Judge:\nH-How do you know that?Oldbag:\nBecause... I said so. And what I say is the truth.Phoenix:\n(At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)Judge:\nMr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- Who I Saw --Oldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you please get on with your testimony!\nOldbag:\nHmph! Watch your language, young man! What sort of tone is that to take with an elder! My youthfulness isn't what it used to be, so you should forgive me for everything! If you keep on barking at me like that, I'll start singing at the top of my lungs!\nPhoenix:\nUh, what?\nOldbag:\n\"A striking figure by the sea, standing all alone is he. He's the Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n(...She's actually singing... Someone help my poor ears.)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Can you please do something about this racket!?\nEdgeworth:\nWitness. I'll give you a piece of gum later if you'll be good and stick to just the facts.\nOldbag:\nOKAAAAAAAY! ... You promise, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I'll be sending the bill for the chewing gum to your office at a later date.\nPhoenix:\n(Remind me to send you a thank you note later too, Edgeworth, old chum...)Oldbag:\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBe a little more careful with your testimony, please! Not too long ago, you said he was wearing his \"racing jacket\", and now he's not!?\nOldbag:\n\"Not too long ago\"...? Then let me ask you this! When you were itty-bitty, what was your grand dream?\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nOldbag:\nWhat did you want to be when you grew up, whippersnapper!?\nPhoenix:\nMy dream, huh...? Well, I... uh, wanted to be Judge Wackner, hero of the Public's Court. So what!?\nOldbag:\nSee! And look at where you are now! You're not Judge Wackner, are you!? Are you!?\nPhoenix:\nWell...\nOldbag:\n\"What I said earlier\"... Who puts any weight into things like that!? The \"now\" is everything! I can't be held responsible for the \"past\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did court become theatrics over testimonies?)\nOldbag:\nAll that matters is that man was inside that costume. Isn't that enough!?Oldbag:\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why would that be?\nOldbag:\nThat way, no one could see his face, of course!\nPhoenix:\nBut there's still no advantage for him that I can see. In fact, you would think the costume would make him stand out all the more!\nOldbag:\n... You are such a annoying child, you know that? You disagree with everything I say...\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that what YOU'RE always doing to me!?)\nOldbag:\nI got it! Maybe it was more troublesome for him to change in and out of his costume!Oldbag:\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas there anyone else scheduled to appear at the post-ceremony show?\nOldbag:\nWell, all the contestants were supposed to go onstage in a friendly gesture thing.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that included the Jammin' Ninja...?\nOldbag:\nOf course it included him! That's why when Engarde came out of dear Juan's room, I didn't give it a second thought.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nOldbag:\nWell, anyway.Oldbag:\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo let me ask you one last time. The person you saw, it really was the Nickel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nAs showy as ever. Haven't I been saying that from the very beginning!?\nPhoenix:\n(Can I throw in the towel yet?)Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Please take a look at this.\"Phoenix:\nHmm...Mia:\nYou don't need to think too hard on this one.Phoenix:\nHuh?Mia:\nThere's a contradiction in her testimony and it's sitting in plain sight. The question is what that contradiction means for us...Phoenix:\n(Well, I have to figure out what you're talking about first, but OK...)Phoenix:\nPlease take a look at this.Oldbag:\nYeah, so, it's a knife. Big deal. If you're trying to scare me with that, I'll have you know it won't work!Phoenix:\nNo no, that's not my intention at all...Judge:\nThat's the knife that was used in the murder, correct?Phoenix:\nYour Honor. Do you know why this piece of evidence is important to this case?Judge:\nYou don't even have to ask. It's because the defendant's fingerprints are on it.Edgeworth:\n... Is that what you're driving at...?Phoenix:\nThat is exactly what I am driving at.Judge:\nWhat are we driving at? And whose car are we driving?Phoenix:\nIf Mr. Engarde was really in the Nickel Samurai costume at the time of the murder, then it's impossible for his fingerprints to have been left on this knife! Actually, he would have wiped all previous fingerprints on this knife right off!Judge:\nOh, that's right! The Nickel Samurai wears gloves, doesn't he?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHe probably took his gloves off before he began the stabbing!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nAnd why would he do something like that? To leave his prints on the murder weapon? There is no way he would do something like that!Edgeworth:\nHowever, there is one possibility!Phoenix:\nThen let's hear your \"possibility\"!Edgeworth:\nIt's very simple. The defendant went to the victim's room while in costume as the Nickel Samurai. At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder. He was probably just going to relax and talk with the victim about the stage show. Which is why he took his gloves off!Judge:\nHmm... But the murder still did take place...Edgeworth:\nIt's well known that there was bad blood between the defendant and the victim. (Changed from [It's well known that the defendant and the victim had bad blood between them.] in the original release)Judge:\nHmm, yes... I have heard that before... (Changed from [Hmm, yes... I have heard of that...] in the original release) Well, Mr. Wright? What do you have to say about Mr. Edgeworth's theory...?Phoenix:\n(So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this: When the defendant went to the victim's room, he had no intentions of killing him. Now, up to this point, are there any problems with his theory...?)There are no problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... I can't see any real problems with his theory...)\nMia:\nBut if you let Edgeworth's theory stand, then we're one very large step closer to a guilty verdict. Look at the Court Record again and take another shot at it.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I just have to think about it one more time...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please make your decision soon.\nLeads back to:\n\"So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this:\"There is a contradiction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!\"Think about it one more time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I think I need a little more time on this one.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this:\"Phoenix:\nThis theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!Edgeworth:\nWh-What are you babbling about...?Phoenix:\nNow, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer. If that's the case, I think it's impossible for the killer to have gone to the victim's room without intent!Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nNaturally, you point to the one piece with the least value... but with such vigor! Enjoy your energy while you can. Humans don't live forever... Neither do lawyers.\nJudge:\nYou sure like to think you can bluff your way out of things, don't you?\nMia:\nPhoenix, pay attention! Let's pretend for a second that Mr. Engarde is the murderer. Now from that angle, if he didn't have a murderous intent from the very beginning, then that means there is a certain object that shouldn't be at the crime scene, right?\nPhoenix:\n(\"A certain thing\"...? What certain thing...?)\nEdgeworth:\nHow are you doing over there? Busy collecting your thoughts?\nPhoenix:\n(Alright, let's give this one more try... and with even more spirit this time!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer.\"Phoenix:\nThis knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.Judge:\nY-Yes, we did establish that.Phoenix:\nWhich means that if my client was, in fact, the killer... Then he brought this knife with him when he went to visit Mr. Corrida.Edgeworth:\nI suppose...Phoenix:\nHowever, you just said it yourself. \"At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder.\" If that were true, then why would he bring a knife!? He wouldn't, would he!?Edgeworth:\nHmm...Phoenix:\nWhich means, Mr. Edgeworth, your theory was flawed from supposition one! And one more thing! If the murderer was wearing the costume at the time of the murder... Then there should be glove marks left on the knife! Which means the defendant's fingerprints shouldn't be all over it like bees on a hive!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nAnd that brings me to my final point... This knife was planted by the real killer to hide their identity and mislead us!Judge:\nO-Order! Order, I say! Order in the court!! Was this knife really planted by the killer!? Why would the murderer do such a thing!?To hide the murder method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's to hide the way in which the murder was carried out, of course!\nEdgeworth:\nM-More of your nonsense!?\nPhoenix:\nTake another good look at the autopsy report! The victim actually died from strangulation! The killer tried to hide thisx by stabbing a knife into thex victim's chest!\nJudge:\nBut doesn't the autopsy admit that the cause of death was strangulation?\nPhoenix:\nWell, yes, the real cause of death was easily discovered...\nEdgeworth:\nThen I'd say the knife did a terrible job of \"concealing\" this fact!\nPhoenix:\n... Aha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that laugh doesn't do a very good job of concealing your error either!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! I will ask you one more time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Was this knife really planted by the killer!?\"To frame Matt Engarde.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"It's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!\"Phoenix:\nIt's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!Judge:\nTo frame...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nA-Aren't you forcing the interpretation just a little too hard on this one!?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut we just established that the witness saw the \"Nickel Samurai\" in costume, and if that were true, then there shouldn't be a single fingerprint on this knife!Edgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr! Witneeeeeesssssss!!Oldbag:\n... Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey-poo...? (Changed from [Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey...?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nGnnnnngh...Judge:\nWitness, did you or did you not really see the Nickel Samurai?Oldbag:\nWell, I guess at first I might have forgotten, but...Phoenix:\nAre you saying you mixed up Mr. Engarde with the Nickel Samurai, his character on TV!?Oldbag:\nBut I mean, I can't really do anything about that now! (Changed from [But I mean, I can't really do anything about that!] in the original release) Look, I was waiting around in front of their doors because, well... Well, I wasn't waiting around for the Nickel Samurai, that's for sure!Phoenix:\n...! (She wasn't waiting for the \"Nickel Samurai\"...?) Alright then... Who were you waiting around for then?Oldbag:\n... Hmph! That's top secret to anyone outside of security!Judge:\nI have a feeling that you were waiting for Mr. Juan Corrida. Am I correct, witness?Oldbag:\nHa ha ha. The way you think, you are a sad amateur with a terrible case of near-sightedness.Judge:\nAmateur...? Me...? What am I an amateur of...?Phoenix:\n(So Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room... But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...)Mia:\nMaybe... Phoenix! Maybe the old bag was waiting around for \"that\" person!Phoenix:\n(Hmm, if it's who I think Mia's hinting at... It's certainly possible...) Ms. Oldbag. You were waiting for this person to come out of the victim's room, weren't you?Present Adrian Andrews profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Who is this person...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nMia:\nWhat are you talking about, Phoenix!? She could've waited until the next century and this would never have appeared!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch... Busted... Guess there's no fooling her.)\nJudge:\nYou two! What do you think you're doing flirting in my courtroom!?\nPhoenix:\nWe weren't doing anything like that... Honest... (Well, back to the drawing board on this one... Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room...)\nLeads back to:\n\"But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...\"Judge:\nWho is this person...?Phoenix:\nThis is Adrian Andrews, Mr. Engarde's manager.Judge:\nB-But why would the defendant's manager be in the victim's room...?Edgeworth:\nIt seems that this is the latest rumor in circulation, Your Honor.Judge:\n...Hmm... Oh... This is... Well, this is... Hmm, hmm... Hah, I see...Phoenix:\n(The judge seems to be really into the \"article\"... If it can be called such a thing...)Judge:\nThen this manager with the initials A. A.... Are you saying it's...?Edgeworth:\nAdrian Andrews. Without a doubt, the witness thought so as well.Oldbag:\n... Hmph. Looks like you found me out. Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole \"sworn to confidentiality stuff\" then. (Changed from [Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole sworn to confidentiality stuff.] in the original release)Judge:\nW-Witness...? What in the world are you...Mia:\nWatch out, Phoenix. I've got a bad feeling about this... A very bad feeling.Oldbag:\nI got some information... Some very secret information from a certain source. So that's why I was doing my own little investigation... In secret, of course.Judge:\nB-But what for...?Oldbag:\nOh, just for myself... Personal reasons and all that.Judge:\n... Well, Mr. Edgeworth. How will you proceed from here?Edgeworth:\nI really don't want to do this, however I cannot simply let this point slide.Judge:\nI see. Very well then. Witness, please testify about this \"secret information\".Oldbag:\nGet ready! This is going to take the wind out of you young'uns!Phoenix:\n(I'm sure we're all capable of handling this... Really, it's not like we're ten years old.)Witness Testimony-- Secret Information --Oldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!\nI cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?Judge:\nThe defendant sent his manager...? What a distasteful topic for this court!Oldbag:\nWhat!? Nobody's above gossip! And isn't there a saying!? \"The truth is never pleasant.\"Phoenix:\n(Never heard that one before...)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What about this Adrian Andrews person...?Edgeworth:\nWe have looked into this matter, and found that the \"truth\" the article proposes is, in fact, baseless gossip.Judge:\nHmm... But should this be true... Then this proves that the defendant did bear ill-will towards the victim.Phoenix:\n(...So this means I have to smash this rumor once and for all.)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Mia:\nBe careful. The old bag seems rather excited right now.Oldbag:\nThat's right! Engarde is nothing but your average foul-blooded youth!Phoenix:\n(Well, as the old saying goes... You've gotta burn old bags with fire! Time to fire up the afterburners and hit the highway to the danger zone!)Cross Examination-- Secret Information --Oldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou can't say something like that without proof! That's just slander!\nOldbag:\nBut it's true! That woman was getting intimate with poor Juan! Look! It says so right here, doesn't it!? \"Manager to the stars, Ms. A. A.!\"\nPhoenix:\nBut the name of the magazine this came from is \"Gossip Land\"...\nOldbag:\nWhat? Are you saying that \"gossip\" is all just a pack of lies? Hmph, what do you know? I suppose next you'll swear to me that the \"news\" is 100% truth!\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nHonestly, sonny. You can't discriminate between the news and gossip!\nJudge:\nYes, discrimination is bad, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Discriminate? When did I do anything like that?)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, Engarde will never get me to say \"touché\"!Oldbag:\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA scandal...? What do you mean by that?\nOldbag:\nYou're a dimwitted one, aren't you? I can't believe you don't know what a \"scandal\" is! Honestly, what are they teaching kids in middle school these days...?\nPhoenix:\nAh, no no! I wasn't asking what the word \"scandal\" means! Even I know that much!\nOldbag:\nWell! That Engarde thought he could own a monopoly on popularity!Oldbag:\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou don't have any proof that Mr. Engarde did any such thing!\nOldbag:\nYou must be suffering from shock; the shock of hearing the truth.

Can you show me proof that Engarde didn't bear any ill-will towards Juan!?\n\n\n\nPresent evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm not going to let you push me around that easily!\nOldbag:\nHeh.

Tell him that no matter what he does, the only thing he's good at is failing.\nEdgeworth:\nUm... What she said, Wright! Or should I say... Baboon-boy!\nJudge:\nYes, I agree this isn't much of a piece of evidence... Baboon-boy.\nPhoenix:\n(Did I just gain a new nickname here...?)\nLeads to:\n\"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDecline the offer to present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...I don't have anything to offer.\nOldbag:\nSeeeeeee! Just as I thought.\nLeads to:\n\"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\"\n\n\nOldbag:\nAnd you were lecturing me about saying things without proof! You've just given me a free pass to say whatever I want whenever I want, silly boy!\nPhoenix:\n(Me and my big mouth...)\nOldbag:\nThat's the way the cookie crumbles. For you, anyway.Oldbag:\nI cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you mean by \"I took action\"...?\nOldbag:\nLike I already told you, I was lying in wait close to the crime scene! Once that slimy woman came out of Juan's room... I was going to capture her, and teach her a good lesson. Something you young'uns need!\nJudge:\nYou were going to \"teach her a good lesson\"...?\nOldbag:\nI was going to make her eat the damaging beams of my ray gun! Like this!\nJudge:\nN-No, stop!\nOldbag:\nWell, it was too bad that woman didn't come through the door that night.Oldbag:\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait!\nOldbag:\nWhat!? I'm a busy woman! Tea time with the kids is over!\nPhoenix:\nSecret information that no one else knows yet... If that's true, then how do you know this \"secret information\"!?\nOldbag:\nHuh!? Well... That's... because I'm a pro... Yes, that's it...\nPhoenix:\n...\nOldbag:\nI-It's a secret! Even if you drill a hole into my brain, you'll never find out!\nPhoenix:\n(How in the world did that old bat get such a \"secret\" piece of information...?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't be a good girl and tell me where you got this secret information... You won't get to go home today!\nOldbag:\nUmm... Edgey-boy! What are you doing!? Help me!\nEdgeworth:\nEh!? What do I have to do with this!?\nOldbag:\nJust do this for me... You'll get your reward.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I don't want your reward, but you don't leave me much of a choice...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness could have gotten her information from anywhere! It's even possible that it was spontaneously made up inside the witness's head!\nPhoenix:\n(And he lectures ME on \"reckless blabbering\"!?)\nJudge:\nAs long as we don't know where this information came from, it's quite a waste of time to focus on this line of questioning.\nPhoenix:\n(Where did Oldbag get her inside information...? There has to be something I can use to figure it out!)\nLeads back to corss-examination\n\n\n\n\nPresent evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo no one else is supposed to know this \"secret information\", correct? If that's true, then why do you know it, Ms. Oldbag...?\nOldbag:\nWh-Wh-Why are you looking at me like that...? Stop that!\nPhoenix:\nWitness! I hate to say it, but this is how you came to acquire your secret info, isn't it!?

It looks more like proof of spite towards the witness! If you have nothing to back up your claims, then they are no more valid than \"gossip\"!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained. Witness, please feel free to ignore the defense's gesture of ill-will and continue.\nOldbag:\nOkie-dokie! See, nothing can get me down!\nPhoenix:\n(Great... That did nothing but set me back a few minutes of my life...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nWait and see\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I should probably think a bit more about this... I don't want to do anything rash... For now, maybe I should sit back and watch how things play out...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationMia:\nSounds like just another tidbit of gossip, doesn't it? But you can't just ignore it either. It makes your client look bad either way.Phoenix:\n(Well, I don't think I heard anything really out of the ordinary just now...)Mia:\nThere has to be something we can catch her on...Phoenix:\n(Yeah... And when I find it, I'm going to press the heck out of it...)Phoenix:\nThe \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...Judge:\nOh yes... I remember that mischievous girl.Phoenix:\nShe reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.Judge:\nShe reported such a thing...?Phoenix:\nOn that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.Oldbag:\nWh-What!? Outrageous ideas, you say!?Phoenix:\nNo no no, I said impressions.Oldbag:\nThen... Then...! Then everything written on this piece of paper is completely meaningless!?Phoenix:\nAh! That's it! That's the note!Oldbag:\nAh! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Noooo! You see, this is something completely different! This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!Judge:\nHmm, then you are the one who took Ms. Hart's note?Oldbag:\nI'm a huuuuuuuge fan of Juan's, that's why! That infamous, puffy-haired whippersnapper... She's working with that evil Engarde! She said so herself! \"En garde! I'm his sidekick!\" She was so happy, smiling like a silly duck. I was only checking what she had written!Phoenix:\n...Judge:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Oldbag:\n... Edgey-poo! You believe me, don't you!?Edgeworth:\nNngh...Oldbag:\nI was only trying to help out like the angel I am! It's only one little piece of paper! I've never taken anything else before!Edgeworth:\nYou really should come with a supply of cheese to match your vintage whine.Judge:\nWell, it was only a piece of paper. I suppose we can overlook this just this once.Phoenix:\n(She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)Pile on more pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I let up on her now, she'll get away... I have to find some way to inflict a deafening blow to the prosecution!)\nLeads to:\n\"Witness!\"Forgive her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess we should forgive her.\nOldbag:\nHmph! Who the heck are you to decide who should be forgiven, you delinquent!\nPhoenix:\nGrr... (Number of endearing qualities: ZERO.)\nMia:\nPhoenix. You can't go easy on her. She's no frail old lady.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nMia:\nYou should be pressing her until she gives in!\nPhoenix:\n(Mia is really scary today... *gulp*)\nLeads to:\n\"Witness!\"Phoenix:\nWitness! You said that the only thing you stole was that note. Is this correct?Oldbag:\nS-S-Stole!? Why don't you listen more carefully, you annoying brat!? I saved this piece of paper from the terrible, lonely trash can! That's all!Phoenix:\nYou're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!Oldbag:\nAre you putting my credibility under scrutiny again!?Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! I don't believe that the note is the only thing you stole that night!Present Lotta's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. More than the witness' credibility, perhaps you should be worrying about your legal standing, or should I say, falling?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nJudge:\nI'm setting the volume down to low so I won't have to waste my time with your objections!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I never knew the judge had hearing aids... Argh! Now's not the time to be wondering about health conditions! OK, one more try!)\nLeads back to:\n\"You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\"Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?Judge:\nA camera...?Phoenix:\nYesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, \"My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!\"Judge:\nWhy... Why... Witness!!Oldbag:\nWhat is it, gramps?Phoenix:\nIf you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!Oldbag:\nGrr... Looks like you found me out again, sonny... Is this the camera you're looking for?Phoenix:\nAh, that's...!Oldbag:\nWhat!? Even though I look like this, I'm still a person, you know! I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and \"borrow\" things from people!Judge:\nUm... I think your definition of \"borrow\" is a little off...Oldbag:\nI saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, \"Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire\"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!Judge:\nBailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?Edgeworth:\nThere is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.Judge:\nPlease present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!Oldbag:\nSee, I told you! That's the guy I saw!Judge:\nThis proves that the witness was not lying earlier about this matter.Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record.Judge:\nWh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nThis photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was still in his Nickel Samurai costume!Judge:\nIf that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...Edgeworth:\nThe defendant.Judge:\nHow did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?Phoenix:\n(If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...nothing strange with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is nothing strange with this photo.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I have done nothing to alter this picture either, in case you're wondering, Wright.\nJudge:\nI see... And it seems the defense will rest on this matter. In that case, there is no reason to further prolong this trial.\nMia:\nIs this really alright with you, Phoenix!?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well... There's nothing wrong with this photo that I can poi--\nMia:\nTry again! Take another good look at it! And if you still don't see anything... Do something... anything to prolong the trial!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Chief! W-Wait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright? I'm about to enter my verdict. Please address me with your comment afterwards.\nPhoenix:\nUm, no, I'm sorry, but this can't wait...\nEdgeworth:\nOh? Let me guess. You are going to point out some peculiarity with this photo?\nJudge:\nWh-What? Why didn't you say so earlier!?\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"something strange with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"Phoenix:\nThere's... There's something strange with this photo!Edgeworth:\nI knew this was coming, Wright.Judge:\nYour thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.Judge:\n\"Debunk with a bunker buster\"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!Judge:\nIf you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need one chance, correct...?Phoenix:\nUm... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this photo from anyway...? (Changed from [Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...?] in the original release) It's all out of focus! Why can't she take a good shot, especially when it counts!?)Judge:\nNow then, let's hear your objection.

His ankles...?Phoenix:\nIf you could see this person's ankle, that would be one thing... However you can't.Judge:\nA-And...? What does that mean...?Phoenix:\nThe costumed person in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde! (Changed from [The 'Nickel Samurai' in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!] in the original release)Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of this!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI wonder if you would care to elaborate... With actual facts, that is.Phoenix:\nLet's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.Judge:\nHis... His socks... You can see his socks...Phoenix:\nExactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nThere is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)Mia:\nThat's curious...Phoenix:\nHuh? What is?Mia:\nEdgeworth is unusually calm today...Phoenix:\nThat's true...Mia:\nHe's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.Phoenix:\n\"Along for the ride\"...? What do you mean by that?Mia:\nI can only think that perhaps he doesn't feel under attack at all...Phoenix:\n(He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, I haven't damaged his case at all!?) (Changed from [He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?] in the original release)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nIf the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!Edgeworth:\n... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Edgeworth:\nWright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?Phoenix:\n(Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)Mia:\nDon't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)Judge:\nMr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts. Who is the person in this photograph...?Present Adrian Andrews profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"A-Adrian Andrews...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nAre you saying this is who you think was in the costume...?\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um... Well, I know there isn't a lot to back me up here, but...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSometimes I wonder about you. Do you just pick the first piece of evidence you see?\nMia:\nI can't believe it. I didn't think you would mess up here of all places...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... And I really thought I had it!)\nJudge:\nNow then, would you care to try one more time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts.\"Judge:\nA-Adrian Andrews...?Phoenix:\nIf you want to know who that Nickel Samurai is, it is none other than this woman!Edgeworth:\nAnd why would you say it must be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her? (Changed from [And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nFor starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.Judge:\nAnd how does that all add up?Phoenix:\nIt means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!Judge:\nThe knife that was used as a murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nWhy don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?Phoenix:\n(I have to do this now!

Looks like this battle is far from over.Edgeworth:\nExactly.Judge:\nVery well. We will call the next witness. However... Before we proceed, we shall take a 10 minute recess. Please prepare your witness in that time, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nThe court will now take a 10 minute recess.To be continued.March 22, 2:14 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Engarde:\nDude! I can't believe that Adrian... No way! Not cool and collected Adrian Andrews!Phoenix:\nShe is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... her.Engarde:\nSo after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...Phoenix:\nSee, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.Engarde:\nHmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?Phoenix:\nYes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.Engarde:\nBut... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!Phoenix:\nShe has her own agenda.Engarde:\nH-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?Phoenix:\nI'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.Engarde:\nGet me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?Mia:\nPhoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's missing suicide note, right?Phoenix:\n...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live. (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release) But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...Mia:\n...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.Phoenix:\nAnd that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!Mia:\nThat sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.Phoenix:\nUm, what...?Mia:\nWho was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' dependency issues with regards to Ms. Inpax...? (Changed from [Better stated, Mr. Andrews' co-dependency with regards to Ms. Inpax...?] in the original release)Phoenix:\n... It was Edgeworth...Mia:\nIt looks like he's still the one in command of this ship. Don't let your guard down yet.March 22, 2:25 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you please.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls the witness subpoenaed by this court. Ms. Adrian Andrews, the person who discovered the crime in Mr. Juan Corrida's room!Edgeworth:\nWhat is your occupation?Andrews:\nI am the manager of the defendant in this case, Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge:\nI see. Now then...Andrews:\nBefore we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.Judge:\nUh, yes, sure. What is it?Andrews:\nI'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly \"magazine\" recently...Judge:\nAh, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of \"Gossip Land\"...Phoenix:\n(If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)Edgeworth:\nAnyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.Andrews:\nYes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.Judge:\nHmm, so it was a \"fry 'n bait\" matter... or was that \"bait 'n fry\"? Reminds me of fishing...Andrews:\nBut I... But I didn't kill him.Edgeworth:\nNo one has accused you of that.Andrews:\nI think there's someone who would beg to differ. (Changed from [I've got a feeling someone will soon...] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nI think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.Edgeworth:\nVery well then. Witness, please testify to the court about what happened when you discovered the murder that had taken place.Witness Testimony-- When I Found the Body --Andrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...\nWhat I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.\nI felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.Judge:\nYou poured yourself a glass of juice...?Andrews:\nYes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...Edgeworth:\nAnd that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:\nPhoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.Phoenix:\nYes... I know.Mia:\nIn order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pacing. (Changed from [You should disrupt her pace.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nDisrupt her pacing...? (Changed from [Disrupt her pace...?] in the original release)Mia:\nShe's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it.

Something you young'uns need!\nJudge:\nYou were going to \"teach her a good lesson\"...?\nOldbag:\nI was going to make her eat the damaging beams of my ray gun! Like this!\nJudge:\nN-No, stop!\nOldbag:\nWell, it was too bad that woman didn't come through the door that night.Oldbag:\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait!\nOldbag:\nWhat!? I'm a busy woman! Tea time with the kids is over!\nPhoenix:\nSecret information that no one else knows yet... If that's true, then how do you know this \"secret information\"!?\nOldbag:\nHuh!? Well... That's... because I'm a pro... Yes, that's it...\nPhoenix:\n...\nOldbag:\nI-It's a secret! Even if you drill a hole into my brain, you'll never find out!\nPhoenix:\n(How in the world did that old bat get such a \"secret\" piece of information...?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't be a good girl and tell me where you got this secret information... You won't get to go home today!\nOldbag:\nUmm... Edgey-boy! What are you doing!? Help me!\nEdgeworth:\nEh!? What do I have to do with this!?\nOldbag:\nJust do this for me... You'll get your reward.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I don't want your reward, but you don't leave me much of a choice...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness could have gotten her information from anywhere! It's even possible that it was spontaneously made up inside the witness's head!\nPhoenix:\n(And he lectures ME on \"reckless blabbering\"!?)\nJudge:\nAs long as we don't know where this information came from, it's quite a waste of time to focus on this line of questioning.\nPhoenix:\n(Where did Oldbag get her inside information...? There has to be something I can use to figure it out!)\nLeads back to corss-examination\n\n\n\n\nPresent evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo no one else is supposed to know this \"secret information\", correct? If that's true, then why do you know it, Ms. Oldbag...?\nOldbag:\nWh-Wh-Why are you looking at me like that...? Stop that!\nPhoenix:\nWitness! I hate to say it, but this is how you came to acquire your secret info, isn't it!? (Changed from [I'm sad to say it, but this is how you found out this secret, isn't it!?] in the original release)\n\n\n\nPresent Lotta's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou call that \"proof\"!? It looks more like proof of spite towards the witness! If you have nothing to back up your claims, then they are no more valid than \"gossip\"!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained. Witness, please feel free to ignore the defense's gesture of ill-will and continue.\nOldbag:\nOkie-dokie! See, nothing can get me down!\nPhoenix:\n(Great... That did nothing but set me back a few minutes of my life...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nWait and see\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I should probably think a bit more about this... I don't want to do anything rash... For now, maybe I should sit back and watch how things play out...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationMia:\nSounds like just another tidbit of gossip, doesn't it? But you can't just ignore it either. It makes your client look bad either way.Phoenix:\n(Well, I don't think I heard anything really out of the ordinary just now...)Mia:\nThere has to be something we can catch her on...Phoenix:\n(Yeah... And when I find it, I'm going to press the heck out of it...)Phoenix:\nThe \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...Judge:\nOh yes... I remember that mischievous girl.Phoenix:\nShe reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.Judge:\nShe reported such a thing...?Phoenix:\nOn that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.Oldbag:\nWh-What!? Outrageous ideas, you say!?Phoenix:\nNo no no, I said impressions.Oldbag:\nThen... Then...! Then everything written on this piece of paper is completely meaningless!?Phoenix:\nAh! That's it! That's the note!Oldbag:\nAh! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Noooo! You see, this is something completely different! This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!Judge:\nHmm, then you are the one who took Ms. Hart's note?Oldbag:\nI'm a huuuuuuuge fan of Juan's, that's why! That infamous, puffy-haired whippersnapper... She's working with that evil Engarde! She said so herself! \"En garde! I'm his sidekick!\" She was so happy, smiling like a silly duck. I was only checking what she had written!Phoenix:\n...Judge:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Oldbag:\n... Edgey-poo! You believe me, don't you!?Edgeworth:\nNngh...Oldbag:\nI was only trying to help out like the angel I am! It's only one little piece of paper! I've never taken anything else before!Edgeworth:\nYou really should come with a supply of cheese to match your vintage whine.Judge:\nWell, it was only a piece of paper. I suppose we can overlook this just this once.Phoenix:\n(She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)Pile on more pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I let up on her now, she'll get away... I have to find some way to inflict a deafening blow to the prosecution!)\nLeads to:\n\"Witness!\"Forgive her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess we should forgive her.\nOldbag:\nHmph! Who the heck are you to decide who should be forgiven, you delinquent!\nPhoenix:\nGrr... (Number of endearing qualities: ZERO.)\nMia:\nPhoenix. You can't go easy on her. She's no frail old lady.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nMia:\nYou should be pressing her until she gives in!\nPhoenix:\n(Mia is really scary today... *gulp*)\nLeads to:\n\"Witness!\"Phoenix:\nWitness! You said that the only thing you stole was that note. Is this correct?Oldbag:\nS-S-Stole!? Why don't you listen more carefully, you annoying brat!? I saved this piece of paper from the terrible, lonely trash can! That's all!Phoenix:\nYou're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!Oldbag:\nAre you putting my credibility under scrutiny again!?Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! I don't believe that the note is the only thing you stole that night!Present Lotta's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. More than the witness' credibility, perhaps you should be worrying about your legal standing, or should I say, falling?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nJudge:\nI'm setting the volume down to low so I won't have to waste my time with your objections!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I never knew the judge had hearing aids... Argh! Now's not the time to be wondering about health conditions! OK, one more try!)\nLeads back to:\n\"You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\"Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?Judge:\nA camera...?Phoenix:\nYesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, \"My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!\"Judge:\nWhy... Why... Witness!!Oldbag:\nWhat is it, gramps?Phoenix:\nIf you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!Oldbag:\nGrr... Looks like you found me out again, sonny... Is this the camera you're looking for?Phoenix:\nAh, that's...!Oldbag:\nWhat!? Even though I look like this, I'm still a person, you know! I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and \"borrow\" things from people!Judge:\nUm... I think your definition of \"borrow\" is a little off...Oldbag:\nI saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, \"Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire\"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!Judge:\nBailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?Edgeworth:\nThere is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.Judge:\nPlease present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!Oldbag:\nSee, I told you! That's the guy I saw!Judge:\nThis proves that the witness was not lying earlier about this matter.Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record.Judge:\nWh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nThis photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was still in his Nickel Samurai costume!Judge:\nIf that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...Edgeworth:\nThe defendant.Judge:\nHow did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?Phoenix:\n(If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...nothing strange with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is nothing strange with this photo.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I have done nothing to alter this picture either, in case you're wondering, Wright.\nJudge:\nI see... And it seems the defense will rest on this matter. In that case, there is no reason to further prolong this trial.\nMia:\nIs this really alright with you, Phoenix!?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well... There's nothing wrong with this photo that I can poi--\nMia:\nTry again! Take another good look at it! And if you still don't see anything... Do something... anything to prolong the trial!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Chief! W-Wait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright? I'm about to enter my verdict. Please address me with your comment afterwards.\nPhoenix:\nUm, no, I'm sorry, but this can't wait...\nEdgeworth:\nOh? Let me guess. You are going to point out some peculiarity with this photo?\nJudge:\nWh-What? Why didn't you say so earlier!?\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"something strange with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"Phoenix:\nThere's... There's something strange with this photo!Edgeworth:\nI knew this was coming, Wright.Judge:\nYour thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.Judge:\n\"Debunk with a bunker buster\"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!Judge:\nIf you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need one chance, correct...?Phoenix:\nUm... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this photo from anyway...? (Changed from [Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...?] in the original release) It's all out of focus! Why can't she take a good shot, especially when it counts!?)Judge:\nNow then, let's hear your objection. What about this photo is \"strange\"...?Present Nickel Samurai's feet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!\"Present Nickel Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's this person here, of course!\nJudge:\nYou mean the \"Nickel Samurai\"? And what is wrong with that?\nPhoenix:\nAt the time of the murder, Mr. Engarde was in his own room! Which means this Nickel Samurai is a fa--\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf you think that's all it takes, you should reconsider your choice of occupation.\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nEdgeworth:\nI think it's about time you retired!\nJudge:\nHmm, it looks like there was no problem with this photo after all.\nEdgeworth:\nThe problem was with the brain of that lawyer, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nYou are the one who let your last chance fly away from you, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penaltyPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe strange thing is somewhere around here! ...I think.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Somewhere\"...?\nJudge:\n\"Around here\"...?\nMia:\n\"I think\"...?\nPhoenix:\nA-Am I seeing something you all are not...?\nJudge:\nHmm, it looks like there was no problem with this photo after all.\nEdgeworth:\nThe problem was with the brain of that lawyer, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nYou are the one who let your last chance fly away from you, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penaltyPhoenix:\nI would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!Judge:\nWh-What are you pointing to? His ankles...?Phoenix:\nIf you could see this person's ankle, that would be one thing... However you can't.Judge:\nA-And...? What does that mean...?Phoenix:\nThe costumed person in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde! (Changed from [The 'Nickel Samurai' in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!] in the original release)Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of this!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI wonder if you would care to elaborate... With actual facts, that is.Phoenix:\nLet's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.Judge:\nHis... His socks... You can see his socks...Phoenix:\nExactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nThere is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)Mia:\nThat's curious...Phoenix:\nHuh? What is?Mia:\nEdgeworth is unusually calm today...Phoenix:\nThat's true...Mia:\nHe's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.Phoenix:\n\"Along for the ride\"...? What do you mean by that?Mia:\nI can only think that perhaps he doesn't feel under attack at all...Phoenix:\n(He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, I haven't damaged his case at all!?) (Changed from [He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?] in the original release)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nIf the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!Edgeworth:\n... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Edgeworth:\nWright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?Phoenix:\n(Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)Mia:\nDon't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)Judge:\nMr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts. Who is the person in this photograph...?Present Adrian Andrews profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"A-Adrian Andrews...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nAre you saying this is who you think was in the costume...?\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um... Well, I know there isn't a lot to back me up here, but...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSometimes I wonder about you. Do you just pick the first piece of evidence you see?\nMia:\nI can't believe it. I didn't think you would mess up here of all places...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... And I really thought I had it!)\nJudge:\nNow then, would you care to try one more time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts.\"Judge:\nA-Adrian Andrews...?Phoenix:\nIf you want to know who that Nickel Samurai is, it is none other than this woman!Edgeworth:\nAnd why would you say it must be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her? (Changed from [And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nFor starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.Judge:\nAnd how does that all add up?Phoenix:\nIt means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!Judge:\nThe knife that was used as a murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nWhy don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?Phoenix:\n(I have to do this now! This is my last chance to turn things around!) The defense motions to indict Ms. Adrian Andrews in the murder of Juan Corrida! It was Ms. Andrews who tried to frame the defendant for the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order!! ORDER!! It looks like this trial has hit a most unexpected development! Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nThis court is issuing a subpoena for Ms. Adrian Andrews! A verdict cannot be passed without first hearing her testimony!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\n(Alright! This is it...)Mia:\nThis... is kind of bad for us.Phoenix:\nHuh? What do you mean?Mia:\nIf Adrian Andrews is summoned to court as a witness... It means that the trial will go on for another day.Phoenix:\nOne more day...? Ack!! (If I don't get a verdict TODAY, then Maya...!)Judge:\nNow then, we shall set Ms. Andrews' testimony for tomorrow...Phoenix:\n(Wh-What am I supposed to do!? The judge is about to adjourn the court!)Wait and see\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I have to do something... The trial must go on! But I don't have anything left... No evidence, no nothing!)\nJudge:\nNow then, court will adjourn for tod--\n???:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I abhor wasting such valuable time...\"Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nNow then...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease, Your Honor! Continue the trial! You must pass a verdict today!\nJudge:\nI can't do that. We cannot hear Ms. Andrews' testimony if she is not--\n???:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I abhor wasting such valuable time...\"Edgeworth:\nI abhor wasting such valuable time...Phoenix:\nE-Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. I request that you please continue with today's trial.Judge:\nB-But... We cannot continue due to this unexpected development!Edgeworth:\nTsk, tsk. \"Unexpected\" development? I think you underestimate me, Your Honor.Judge:\nAnd what do you mean by that...?Edgeworth:\nThat Mr. Phoenix Wright would slave his way to subpoenaing Ms. Adrian Andrews is all happening according to plan... Even if Wright was a bit slow to catch on...Phoenix:\nWh-Wh-Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of your statement, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nMs. Adrian Andrews is currently waiting in the prosecution lobby... She is the next witness.Phoenix:\n...! (Everything... Everything was planned out in advance by that man...?)Mia:\nSomehow, I knew there was no way Edgeworth would overlook Ms. Andrews... Looks like this battle is far from over.Edgeworth:\nExactly.Judge:\nVery well. We will call the next witness. However... Before we proceed, we shall take a 10 minute recess. Please prepare your witness in that time, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nThe court will now take a 10 minute recess.To be continued.March 22, 2:14 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Engarde:\nDude! I can't believe that Adrian... No way! Not cool and collected Adrian Andrews!Phoenix:\nShe is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... her.Engarde:\nSo after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...Phoenix:\nSee, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.Engarde:\nHmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?Phoenix:\nYes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.Engarde:\nBut... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!Phoenix:\nShe has her own agenda.Engarde:\nH-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?Phoenix:\nI'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.Engarde:\nGet me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?Mia:\nPhoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's missing suicide note, right?Phoenix:\n...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live. (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release) But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...Mia:\n...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.Phoenix:\nAnd that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!Mia:\nThat sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.Phoenix:\nUm, what...?Mia:\nWho was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' dependency issues with regards to Ms. Inpax...? (Changed from [Better stated, Mr. Andrews' co-dependency with regards to Ms. Inpax...?] in the original release)Phoenix:\n... It was Edgeworth...Mia:\nIt looks like he's still the one in command of this ship. Don't let your guard down yet.March 22, 2:25 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you please.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls the witness subpoenaed by this court. Ms. Adrian Andrews, the person who discovered the crime in Mr. Juan Corrida's room!Edgeworth:\nWhat is your occupation?Andrews:\nI am the manager of the defendant in this case, Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge:\nI see. Now then...Andrews:\nBefore we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.Judge:\nUh, yes, sure. What is it?Andrews:\nI'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly \"magazine\" recently...Judge:\nAh, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of \"Gossip Land\"...Phoenix:\n(If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)Edgeworth:\nAnyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.Andrews:\nYes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.Judge:\nHmm, so it was a \"fry 'n bait\" matter... or was that \"bait 'n fry\"? Reminds me of fishing...Andrews:\nBut I... But I didn't kill him.Edgeworth:\nNo one has accused you of that.Andrews:\nI think there's someone who would beg to differ. (Changed from [I've got a feeling someone will soon...] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nI think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.Edgeworth:\nVery well then. Witness, please testify to the court about what happened when you discovered the murder that had taken place.Witness Testimony-- When I Found the Body --Andrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...\nWhat I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.\nI felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.Judge:\nYou poured yourself a glass of juice...?Andrews:\nYes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...Edgeworth:\nAnd that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:\nPhoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.Phoenix:\nYes... I know.Mia:\nIn order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pacing. (Changed from [You should disrupt her pace.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nDisrupt her pacing...? (Changed from [Disrupt her pace...?] in the original release)Mia:\nShe's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it. The instant you let up on your offense is the instant this trial is over. Understand?Cross Examination",

Luckily, I have looked this case over and am familiar with the details. The prosecution seeks to prove the guilt of Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge:\nTh-The court acknowledges the prosecution.Edgeworth:\n...Wright.

Please bring Detective Gumshoe to the witness stand!Edgeworth:\nWitness, your name and occupation.Gumshoe:\nMy name's Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm a detective down at the precinct... for now.Judge:\n\"For now\"...?Gumshoe:\nAfter this trial's over... I'm supposed to turn in my badge, sir.Phoenix:\n(D-Detective Gumshoe...)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution has no need for a depressed witness. Lift your head up and face forward like a proud officer, Detective Dick Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!Edgeworth:\nNow, let's have your testimony. If we want to explore the various facets of this case, we must start with that.Mia:\nGet ready, Phoenix. This is going to be one very rough fight.Phoenix:\nYeah... It would have to be with Edgeworth as my opponent.  (The answer he was \"struggling\" for... Interesting... Show me this \"answer\" you finally found, Edgeworth...)Witness Testimony-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:\nHmm... After the award ceremony ended, the victim was alone in his room...?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! Both the victim and defendant went alone to their rooms, sir.Judge:\nI see. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you please give us a brief timeline of what happened after the ceremony?\nGumshoe:\nOK, pal. The ceremony started at 6 PM. It ended around 8 PM... and then there was a short break. A special post-ceremony show was supposed to start in the lobby 30 minutes later.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when the victim's body was found, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nWhich is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period.\nJudge:\nHmm... Please continue with your testimony, Detective.Gumshoe:\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe person who discovered the victim's body was Adrian Andrews, correct?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Adrian Andrews\" you're talking about?\nGumshoe:\nShe's the defendant, Matt Engarde's, manager. She's a really pretty lady... sir.\nJudge:\nAh, so she's a pretty lady... I wonder if she will grace us with her presence...\nGumshoe:\nWhen the post-ceremony show was about to start, she went to get Mr. Engarde. After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir.\nJudge:\nI see... And that's when she found the victim's body...Gumshoe:\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana.\nJudge:\nMmm... \"Banana\"...\nGumshoe:\nUm, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir.\nJudge:\nAh, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana.\nPhoenix:\nThen, what about the knife...?\nGumshoe:\nIt seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death.\nJudge:\nHmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana.\nJudge:\nMmm... \"Banana\"...\nGumshoe:\nUm, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir.\nJudge:\nAh, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana.\nPhoenix:\nThen, what about the knife...?\nGumshoe:\nIt seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death.\nJudge:\nHmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.Gumshoe:\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...\nGuitar Case updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...Gumshoe:\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat convinced you it had nothing to do with the case?\nGumshoe:\nThe guitar wasn't at the Gatewater Hotel that night.\nJudge:\nWell then, where was it?\nGumshoe:\nThe bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir.\nJudge:\nSo you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar.\nPhoenix:\nSo that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all.\nJudge:\nHmm...Mia:\nOur first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.Phoenix:\nBut there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...Mia:\nMaybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.Phoenix:\nIf you say so...Mia:\nOf course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?After pressing third, fourth and fifth statements:Edgeworth:\nI believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWhich brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.Phoenix:\n(Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)Judge:\nVery well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Judge:\nHmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.Gumshoe:\nIt was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.Knife added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\n...And there's this button.Judge:\nThat was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?Gumshoe:\nYes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Jammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAll of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?Edgeworth:\nYes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?Phoenix:\nHmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!Edgeworth:\nYou can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.Phoenix:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Cross Examination-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown.\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end...\nJudge:\nThat is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing.\nEdgeworth:\n...Gumshoe:\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls!\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah, I guess, but...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all!\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUm, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired.\nGumshoe:\nEh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's...\nEdgeworth:\nI look forward to your pension negotiations.\nGumshoe:\nN-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony.\nGumshoe:\n*sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too...\nEdgeworth:\nDetective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)Gumshoe:\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any proof that button belonged to the victim?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nOh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\".\nGumshoe:\nHuh? But can't you tell by just looking at it?\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nA-And the victim's blood is on it.\nPhoenix:\nAnyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward.\nGumshoe:\n... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Thread.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nThe button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal!\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nMia:\nThat's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.Gumshoe:\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhen was this button found?\nGumshoe:\nPretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder...\nEdgeworth:\nThe police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people...\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe:\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow were the fingerprints arranged on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nBy examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...?\nGumshoe:\nOh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe the bumbling of this department...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe:\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife!\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...)\nMia:\n...Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nThere's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"Phoenix:\n(A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)Mia:\nBe grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix:\nWe're still in a world of trouble...Mia:\nWell, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?Phoenix:\nWait a second!Gumshoe:\nWh-What?Phoenix:\nSo the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?Gumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The defendant...Phoenix:\n...Did not buy this knife.Gumshoe:\nH-Huh!?Phoenix:\nTake a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe:\n...Huh?Judge:\nIt has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...Gumshoe:\n\"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.Phoenix:\nThat's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.Gumshoe:\n... Uh oh.Phoenix:\nThe murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!Judge:\nYes, that is very true! This is a very big...Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...Judge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nI think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.Phoenix:\nH-How so!?Edgeworth:\nI admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.Gumshoe:\n...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*Edgeworth:\nThe question is... Where did this knife come from?Judge:\nWh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...Edgeworth:\nSorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.Judge:\nThere is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?Edgeworth:\nIf it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.Phoenix:\nUrk...Edgeworth:\nMr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.Judge:\nAmazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.Mia:\nIt seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...Phoenix:\n(This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)Judge:\nA murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.Edgeworth:\nI can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.Phoenix:\n(Evidence not yet shown...?)Mia:\nHe means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.Judge:\nWhat does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nUm, well...Mia:\nPhoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...Phoenix:\n(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)Judge:\nMr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?Actually, I do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"No, not right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.)\nJudge:\nLooks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means this court is adjourned.\nMia:\nPhoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!)\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"Phoenix:\nThere's one...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nOne piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!Judge:\nMr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.Edgeworth:\nWhat the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.Phoenix:\n(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)Judge:\nYou may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?Present Wine Glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong.\nJudge:\nI can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nI am a man of my word, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penaltyJudge:\nThis... is a wine glass, is it not?Phoenix:\nPlease look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... Well, yes, I see your point.Phoenix:\nHowever! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!Judge:\n...Gumshoe:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nW-Well? What do you all have to say...?Judge:\nAh, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...Phoenix:\nY-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!Judge:\nYou can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nWhat is it, Your Honor?Judge:\nYour opinion...Edgeworth:\n...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.Phoenix:\n...What!?Edgeworth:\nIt's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.Judge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)It's possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...)\nMia:\nYou can't think like that, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nRight now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(So in other words, push as far as we can go...)\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"There's no way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!)\nMia:\nThey just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough!\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"Phoenix:\nThe defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!Judge:\nHmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?Phoenix:\n(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)Edgeworth:\nUnlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Edgeworth:\nYou're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?Phoenix:\nTh-Then...Edgeworth:\nOf course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.Phoenix:\nFingerprints...Edgeworth:\nThere were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.Judge:\nOnly one? Well, whose were they!?Edgeworth:\nThey were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nThat is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)Edgeworth:\nMs. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.Phoenix:\nGrrr!Edgeworth:\nI've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!Judge:\nW-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...Edgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.Phoenix:\n\"Another witness\"...?Edgeworth:\nYes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!Mia:\nWhat in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?Edgeworth:\nNow then, witness, please state your name and occupation...Oldbag:\n...Edgeworth:\n... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Edgeworth:\nUurrngh!Oldbag:\n...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!Edgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Phoenix:\n(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)Oldbag:\nOh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!Edgeworth:\nI saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?Oldbag:\nI tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.Judge:\nMs... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nOof!Oldbag:\nShush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!Judge:\nYes, madam.Edgeworth:\nNo no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.Oldbag:\nIt's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?Edgeworth:\nThe witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag:\nIt was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!Judge:\nYou mean... You were a fan of the victim?Oldbag:\nLook, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!Phoenix:\n(Um... But those two were the same age...)Oldbag:\nAnyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.Edgeworth:\nVery well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.Oldbag:\nLeave it to me, Edgey-poo!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Judge:\nHmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...Oldbag:\nSee! It has to be him! He's the murderer!Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what was your post on that night?\nOldbag:\nThe lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...)\nOldbag:\nBesides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?Oldbag:\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSomething you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that?\nOldbag:\nIt's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course.\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Gossip\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nIf this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony.\nMia:\nIt looks like we shouldn't force it right now.\nJudge:\nHmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?Oldbag:\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room?\nOldbag:\nI have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am!\nJudge:\n...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?Oldbag:\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho in the world was that!?\nOldbag:\nI'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was...\nJudge:\nYes...? He was...?\nOldbag:\n... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...)\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.Oldbag:\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get a sense of déjà vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release))\n\n\n\nThe person's face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's face in more detail!\nOldbag:\nYou don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth!\nPhoenix:\nHis teeth were... shining?\nOldbag:\nWell, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie.\nPhoenix:\n... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!?\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the person was carrying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was the man you saw carrying?\nOldbag:\nIn which hand? His right or his left?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nAh, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand?\nOldbag:\nAh, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand.\nPhoenix:\nThen how about his left?\nOldbag:\nEmpty.\nPhoenix:\n... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nThe person's clothes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's clothes in more detail!\nOldbag:\nWhat a troublesome man you are. Really, as if something like that matters.\nPhoenix:\nBut it does.\nOldbag:\nUm... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat thing?\nOldbag:\nThat gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...)\nOldbag:\nThat thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!!\nPhoenix:\nUm, right...\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth.

I request what the witness said about the jacket be appended to her testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't quite see where you're going with this, but alright. Witness, please...\nOldbag:\nAh well, I don't like to badmouth anyone without reason, but if I must...\nAdds statement \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I'm going to have to press a little harder on this one... There's got to be some sort of huge contradiction I can find here...)Oldbag:\nHe was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure the defendant was wearing a racing jacket?\nOldbag:\nWhat do you think? It's not like I've seen him in anything other than that horrible thing. I'm sure he was wearing it!\nPhoenix:\n(She is so sure of herself that it's to the point of self-absorption...)Present Jammin' Ninja's Button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag...\"Mia:\nShe may not remember things or be mistaken here and there, but I don't think she's lying.Phoenix:\nThat's bad for us. Really bad.Mia:\nBut, that's how the human mind is. It also has the tendency to jump off-topic. She's strayed onto a few interesting side-topics this time too, hasn't she? But that's what makes her a sweet old lady, right?Phoenix:\n(That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag...Oldbag:\nWhat!? Don't say my name for no reason!Phoenix:\nDo you know what this is?Oldbag:\nAaaah! It's button number 2 on the Jammin' Ninja's costume!Phoenix:\n(Now I KNOW she's an obsessed fan... She identified it in a single glance!)Oldbag:\nGive it here! Give it here! If you don't give it to me, I'll punish you with this!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Phoenix:\n(Wow... She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.Oldbag:\nSee! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!Phoenix:\nIt was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.Oldbag:\nSee! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!Phoenix:\n...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his \"usual racing jacket\"!?Oldbag:\n... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nNow hold your tongue still there for one second! So what you saw in actuality, was not Mr. Engarde, the man... but Mr. Engarde, the Nickel Samurai!?Oldbag:\nBut when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!Oldbag:\nEdgey-poo! Do you think so too?Edgeworth:\nWell, it might be something worth considering. (Changed from [Well, it might be something worth thinking about.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nJust say, \"It's important\" and agree with me for a change!Judge:\nWitness! Think carefully and try to remember as much as you can before you testify!Oldbag:\n*sigh* Alright, if you insist.Phoenix:\n(I should be the one sighing, not you!)Witness Testimony-- Who I Saw --Oldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Phoenix:\nI... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!Oldbag:\nWhat? Did you think there could've been someone else inside that costume? Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.Phoenix:\nBut... But the possibility does exist!Oldbag:\nAh, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.Judge:\nH-How do you know that?Oldbag:\nBecause... I said so. And what I say is the truth.Phoenix:\n(At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)Judge:\nMr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- Who I Saw --Oldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you please get on with your testimony!\nOldbag:\nHmph! Watch your language, young man! What sort of tone is that to take with an elder! My youthfulness isn't what it used to be, so you should forgive me for everything! If you keep on barking at me like that, I'll start singing at the top of my lungs!\nPhoenix:\nUh, what?\nOldbag:\n\"A striking figure by the sea, standing all alone is he. He's the Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n(...She's actually singing... Someone help my poor ears.)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Can you please do something about this racket!?\nEdgeworth:\nWitness. I'll give you a piece of gum later if you'll be good and stick to just the facts.\nOldbag:\nOKAAAAAAAY! ... You promise, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I'll be sending the bill for the chewing gum to your office at a later date.\nPhoenix:\n(Remind me to send you a thank you note later too, Edgeworth, old chum...)Oldbag:\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBe a little more careful with your testimony, please! Not too long ago, you said he was wearing his \"racing jacket\", and now he's not!?\nOldbag:\n\"Not too long ago\"...? Then let me ask you this! When you were itty-bitty, what was your grand dream?\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nOldbag:\nWhat did you want to be when you grew up, whippersnapper!?\nPhoenix:\nMy dream, huh...? Well, I... uh, wanted to be Judge Wackner, hero of the Public's Court. So what!?\nOldbag:\nSee! And look at where you are now! You're not Judge Wackner, are you!? Are you!?\nPhoenix:\nWell...\nOldbag:\n\"What I said earlier\"... Who puts any weight into things like that!? The \"now\" is everything! I can't be held responsible for the \"past\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did court become theatrics over testimonies?)\nOldbag:\nAll that matters is that man was inside that costume. Isn't that enough!?Oldbag:\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why would that be?\nOldbag:\nThat way, no one could see his face, of course!\nPhoenix:\nBut there's still no advantage for him that I can see. In fact, you would think the costume would make him stand out all the more!\nOldbag:\n... You are such a annoying child, you know that? You disagree with everything I say...\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that what YOU'RE always doing to me!?)\nOldbag:\nI got it! Maybe it was more troublesome for him to change in and out of his costume!Oldbag:\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas there anyone else scheduled to appear at the post-ceremony show?\nOldbag:\nWell, all the contestants were supposed to go onstage in a friendly gesture thing.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that included the Jammin' Ninja...?\nOldbag:\nOf course it included him! That's why when Engarde came out of dear Juan's room, I didn't give it a second thought.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nOldbag:\nWell, anyway.Oldbag:\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo let me ask you one last time. The person you saw, it really was the Nickel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nAs showy as ever. Haven't I been saying that from the very beginning!?\nPhoenix:\n(Can I throw in the towel yet?)Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Please take a look at this.\"Phoenix:\nHmm...Mia:\nYou don't need to think too hard on this one.Phoenix:\nHuh?Mia:\nThere's a contradiction in her testimony and it's sitting in plain sight. The question is what that contradiction means for us...Phoenix:\n(Well, I have to figure out what you're talking about first, but OK...)Phoenix:\nPlease take a look at this.Oldbag:\nYeah, so, it's a knife. Big deal. If you're trying to scare me with that, I'll have you know it won't work!Phoenix:\nNo no, that's not my intention at all...Judge:\nThat's the knife that was used in the murder, correct?Phoenix:\nYour Honor. Do you know why this piece of evidence is important to this case?Judge:\nYou don't even have to ask. It's because the defendant's fingerprints are on it.Edgeworth:\n... Is that what you're driving at...?Phoenix:\nThat is exactly what I am driving at.Judge:\nWhat are we driving at? And whose car are we driving?Phoenix:\nIf Mr. Engarde was really in the Nickel Samurai costume at the time of the murder, then it's impossible for his fingerprints to have been left on this knife! Actually, he would have wiped all previous fingerprints on this knife right off!Judge:\nOh, that's right! The Nickel Samurai wears gloves, doesn't he?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHe probably took his gloves off before he began the stabbing!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nAnd why would he do something like that? To leave his prints on the murder weapon? There is no way he would do something like that!Edgeworth:\nHowever, there is one possibility!Phoenix:\nThen let's hear your \"possibility\"!Edgeworth:\nIt's very simple. The defendant went to the victim's room while in costume as the Nickel Samurai. At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder. He was probably just going to relax and talk with the victim about the stage show. Which is why he took his gloves off!Judge:\nHmm... But the murder still did take place...Edgeworth:\nIt's well known that there was bad blood between the defendant and the victim. (Changed from [It's well known that the defendant and the victim had bad blood between them.] in the original release)Judge:\nHmm, yes... I have heard that before... (Changed from [Hmm, yes... I have heard of that...] in the original release) Well, Mr. Wright? What do you have to say about Mr. Edgeworth's theory...?Phoenix:\n(So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this: When the defendant went to the victim's room, he had no intentions of killing him. Now, up to this point, are there any problems with his theory...?)There are no problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... I can't see any real problems with his theory...)\nMia:\nBut if you let Edgeworth's theory stand, then we're one very large step closer to a guilty verdict. Look at the Court Record again and take another shot at it.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I just have to think about it one more time...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please make your decision soon.\nLeads back to:\n\"So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this:\"There is a contradiction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!\"Think about it one more time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I think I need a little more time on this one.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this:\"Phoenix:\nThis theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!Edgeworth:\nWh-What are you babbling about...?Phoenix:\nNow, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer. If that's the case, I think it's impossible for the killer to have gone to the victim's room without intent!Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nNaturally, you point to the one piece with the least value... but with such vigor! Enjoy your energy while you can. Humans don't live forever... Neither do lawyers.\nJudge:\nYou sure like to think you can bluff your way out of things, don't you?\nMia:\nPhoenix, pay attention! Let's pretend for a second that Mr. Engarde is the murderer. Now from that angle, if he didn't have a murderous intent from the very beginning, then that means there is a certain object that shouldn't be at the crime scene, right?\nPhoenix:\n(\"A certain thing\"...? What certain thing...?)\nEdgeworth:\nHow are you doing over there? Busy collecting your thoughts?\nPhoenix:\n(Alright, let's give this one more try... and with even more spirit this time!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer.\"Phoenix:\nThis knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.Judge:\nY-Yes, we did establish that.Phoenix:\nWhich means that if my client was, in fact, the killer... Then he brought this knife with him when he went to visit Mr. Corrida.Edgeworth:\nI suppose...Phoenix:\nHowever, you just said it yourself. \"At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder.\" If that were true, then why would he bring a knife!? He wouldn't, would he!?Edgeworth:\nHmm...Phoenix:\nWhich means, Mr. Edgeworth, your theory was flawed from supposition one! And one more thing! If the murderer was wearing the costume at the time of the murder... Then there should be glove marks left on the knife! Which means the defendant's fingerprints shouldn't be all over it like bees on a hive!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nAnd that brings me to my final point... This knife was planted by the real killer to hide their identity and mislead us!Judge:\nO-Order! Order, I say! Order in the court!! Was this knife really planted by the killer!? Why would the murderer do such a thing!?To hide the murder method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's to hide the way in which the murder was carried out, of course!\nEdgeworth:\nM-More of your nonsense!?\nPhoenix:\nTake another good look at the autopsy report! The victim actually died from strangulation! The killer tried to hide thisx by stabbing a knife into thex victim's chest!\nJudge:\nBut doesn't the autopsy admit that the cause of death was strangulation?\nPhoenix:\nWell, yes, the real cause of death was easily discovered...\nEdgeworth:\nThen I'd say the knife did a terrible job of \"concealing\" this fact!\nPhoenix:\n... Aha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that laugh doesn't do a very good job of concealing your error either!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! I will ask you one more time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Was this knife really planted by the killer!?\"To frame Matt Engarde.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"It's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!\"Phoenix:\nIt's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!Judge:\nTo frame...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nA-Aren't you forcing the interpretation just a little too hard on this one!?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut we just established that the witness saw the \"Nickel Samurai\" in costume, and if that were true, then there shouldn't be a single fingerprint on this knife!Edgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr! Witneeeeeesssssss!!Oldbag:\n... Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey-poo...? (Changed from [Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey...?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nGnnnnngh...Judge:\nWitness, did you or did you not really see the Nickel Samurai?Oldbag:\nWell, I guess at first I might have forgotten, but...Phoenix:\nAre you saying you mixed up Mr. Engarde with the Nickel Samurai, his character on TV!?Oldbag:\nBut I mean, I can't really do anything about that now! (Changed from [But I mean, I can't really do anything about that!] in the original release) Look, I was waiting around in front of their doors because, well... Well, I wasn't waiting around for the Nickel Samurai, that's for sure!Phoenix:\n...! (She wasn't waiting for the \"Nickel Samurai\"...?) Alright then... Who were you waiting around for then?Oldbag:\n... Hmph! That's top secret to anyone outside of security!Judge:\nI have a feeling that you were waiting for Mr. Juan Corrida. Am I correct, witness?Oldbag:\nHa ha ha. The way you think, you are a sad amateur with a terrible case of near-sightedness.Judge:\nAmateur...? Me...? What am I an amateur of...?Phoenix:\n(So Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room... But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...)Mia:\nMaybe... Phoenix! Maybe the old bag was waiting around for \"that\" person!Phoenix:\n(Hmm, if it's who I think Mia's hinting at... It's certainly possible...) Ms. Oldbag. You were waiting for this person to come out of the victim's room, weren't you?Present Adrian Andrews profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Who is this person...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nMia:\nWhat are you talking about, Phoenix!? She could've waited until the next century and this would never have appeared!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch... Busted... Guess there's no fooling her.)\nJudge:\nYou two! What do you think you're doing flirting in my courtroom!?\nPhoenix:\nWe weren't doing anything like that... Honest... (Well, back to the drawing board on this one... Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room...)\nLeads back to:\n\"But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...\"Judge:\nWho is this person...?Phoenix:\nThis is Adrian Andrews, Mr. Engarde's manager.Judge:\nB-But why would the defendant's manager be in the victim's room...?Edgeworth:\nIt seems that this is the latest rumor in circulation, Your Honor.Judge:\n...Hmm... Oh... This is... Well, this is... Hmm, hmm... Hah, I see...Phoenix:\n(The judge seems to be really into the \"article\"... If it can be called such a thing...)Judge:\nThen this manager with the initials A. A.... Are you saying it's...?Edgeworth:\nAdrian Andrews. Without a doubt, the witness thought so as well.Oldbag:\n... Hmph. Looks like you found me out. Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole \"sworn to confidentiality stuff\" then. (Changed from [Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole sworn to confidentiality stuff.] in the original release)Judge:\nW-Witness...? What in the world are you...Mia:\nWatch out, Phoenix. I've got a bad feeling about this... A very bad feeling.Oldbag:\nI got some information... Some very secret information from a certain source. So that's why I was doing my own little investigation... In secret, of course.Judge:\nB-But what for...?Oldbag:\nOh, just for myself... Personal reasons and all that.Judge:\n... Well, Mr. Edgeworth. How will you proceed from here?Edgeworth:\nI really don't want to do this, however I cannot simply let this point slide.Judge:\nI see. Very well then. Witness, please testify about this \"secret information\".Oldbag:\nGet ready! This is going to take the wind out of you young'uns!Phoenix:\n(I'm sure we're all capable of handling this... Really, it's not like we're ten years old.)Witness Testimony-- Secret Information --Oldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!\nI cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?Judge:\nThe defendant sent his manager...? What a distasteful topic for this court!Oldbag:\nWhat!? Nobody's above gossip! And isn't there a saying!? \"The truth is never pleasant.\"Phoenix:\n(Never heard that one before...)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What about this Adrian Andrews person...?Edgeworth:\nWe have looked into this matter, and found that the \"truth\" the article proposes is, in fact, baseless gossip.Judge:\nHmm... But should this be true... Then this proves that the defendant did bear ill-will towards the victim.Phoenix:\n(...So this means I have to smash this rumor once and for all.)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Mia:\nBe careful. The old bag seems rather excited right now.Oldbag:\nThat's right! Engarde is nothing but your average foul-blooded youth!Phoenix:\n(Well, as the old saying goes... You've gotta burn old bags with fire!

A.!\"\nPhoenix:\nBut the name of the magazine this came from is \"Gossip Land\"...\nOldbag:\nWhat? Are you saying that \"gossip\" is all just a pack of lies? Hmph, what do you know? I suppose next you'll swear to me that the \"news\" is 100% truth!\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nHonestly, sonny. You can't discriminate between the news and gossip!\nJudge:\nYes, discrimination is bad, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Discriminate? When did I do anything like that?)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, Engarde will never get me to say \"touché\"!Oldbag:\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA scandal...? What do you mean by that?\nOldbag:\nYou're a dimwitted one, aren't you? I can't believe you don't know what a \"scandal\" is! Honestly, what are they teaching kids in middle school these days...?\nPhoenix:\nAh, no no! I wasn't asking what the word \"scandal\" means! Even I know that much!\nOldbag:\nWell! That Engarde thought he could own a monopoly on popularity!Oldbag:\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou don't have any proof that Mr. Engarde did any such thing!\nOldbag:\nYou must be suffering from shock; the shock of hearing the truth.

Can you show me proof that Engarde didn't bear any ill-will towards Juan!?\n\n\n\nPresent evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm not going to let you push me around that easily!\nOldbag:\nHeh.

Tell him that no matter what he does, the only thing he's good at is failing.\nEdgeworth:\nUm... What she said, Wright! Or should I say... Baboon-boy!\nJudge:\nYes, I agree this isn't much of a piece of evidence... Baboon-boy.\nPhoenix:\n(Did I just gain a new nickname here...?)\nLeads to:\n\"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDecline the offer to present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...I don't have anything to offer.\nOldbag:\nSeeeeeee!

Something you young'uns need!\nJudge:\nYou were going to \"teach her a good lesson\"...?\nOldbag:\nI was going to make her eat the damaging beams of my ray gun! Like this!\nJudge:\nN-No, stop!\nOldbag:\nWell, it was too bad that woman didn't come through the door that night.Oldbag:\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!?

Even if you drill a hole into my brain, you'll never find out!\nPhoenix:\n(How in the world did that old bat get such a \"secret\" piece of information...?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf you don't be a good girl and tell me where you got this secret information... You won't get to go home today!\nOldbag:\nUmm... Edgey-boy! What are you doing!? Help me!\nEdgeworth:\nEh!? What do I have to do with this!?\nOldbag:\nJust do this for me... You'll get your reward.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I don't want your reward, but you don't leave me much of a choice...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness could have gotten her information from anywhere! It's even possible that it was spontaneously made up inside the witness's head!\nPhoenix:\n(And he lectures ME on \"reckless blabbering\"!?)\nJudge:\nAs long as we don't know where this information came from, it's quite a waste of time to focus on this line of questioning.\nPhoenix:\n(Where did Oldbag get her inside information...? There has to be something I can use to figure it out!)\nLeads back to corss-examination\n\n\n\n\nPresent evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo no one else is supposed to know this \"secret information\", correct? If that's true, then why do you know it, Ms. Oldbag...?\nOldbag:\nWh-Wh-Why are you looking at me like that...? Stop that!\nPhoenix:\nWitness! I hate to say it, but this is how you came to acquire your secret info, isn't it!? (Changed from [I'm sad to say it, but this is how you found out this secret, isn't it!?] in the original release)\n\n\n\nPresent Lotta's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou call that \"proof\"!? It looks more like proof of spite towards the witness! If you have nothing to back up your claims, then they are no more valid than \"gossip\"!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained. Witness, please feel free to ignore the defense's gesture of ill-will and continue.\nOldbag:\nOkie-dokie! See, nothing can get me down!\nPhoenix:\n(Great... That did nothing but set me back a few minutes of my life...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nWait and see\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I should probably think a bit more about this... I don't want to do anything rash... For now, maybe I should sit back and watch how things play out...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationMia:\nSounds like just another tidbit of gossip, doesn't it? But you can't just ignore it either. It makes your client look bad either way.Phoenix:\n(Well, I don't think I heard anything really out of the ordinary just now...)Mia:\nThere has to be something we can catch her on...Phoenix:\n(Yeah... And when I find it, I'm going to press the heck out of it...)Phoenix:\nThe \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...Judge:\nOh yes... I remember that mischievous girl.Phoenix:\nShe reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.Judge:\nShe reported such a thing...?Phoenix:\nOn that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.Oldbag:\nWh-What!? Outrageous ideas, you say!?Phoenix:\nNo no no, I said impressions.Oldbag:\nThen... Then...! Then everything written on this piece of paper is completely meaningless!?Phoenix:\nAh! That's it! That's the note!Oldbag:\nAh! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Noooo! You see, this is something completely different! This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!Judge:\nHmm, then you are the one who took Ms. Hart's note?Oldbag:\nI'm a huuuuuuuge fan of Juan's, that's why! That infamous, puffy-haired whippersnapper... She's working with that evil Engarde! She said so herself! \"En garde! I'm his sidekick!\" She was so happy, smiling like a silly duck. I was only checking what she had written!Phoenix:\n...Judge:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Oldbag:\n... Edgey-poo! You believe me, don't you!?Edgeworth:\nNngh...Oldbag:\nI was only trying to help out like the angel I am! It's only one little piece of paper! I've never taken anything else before!Edgeworth:\nYou really should come with a supply of cheese to match your vintage whine.Judge:\nWell, it was only a piece of paper. I suppose we can overlook this just this once.Phoenix:\n(She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)Pile on more pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I let up on her now, she'll get away... I have to find some way to inflict a deafening blow to the prosecution!)\nLeads to:\n\"Witness!\"Forgive her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess we should forgive her.\nOldbag:\nHmph! Who the heck are you to decide who should be forgiven, you delinquent!\nPhoenix:\nGrr... (Number of endearing qualities: ZERO.)\nMia:\nPhoenix. You can't go easy on her. She's no frail old lady.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nMia:\nYou should be pressing her until she gives in!\nPhoenix:\n(Mia is really scary today... *gulp*)\nLeads to:\n\"Witness!\"Phoenix:\nWitness! You said that the only thing you stole was that note. Is this correct?Oldbag:\nS-S-Stole!? Why don't you listen more carefully, you annoying brat!? I saved this piece of paper from the terrible, lonely trash can! That's all!Phoenix:\nYou're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!Oldbag:\nAre you putting my credibility under scrutiny again!?Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! I don't believe that the note is the only thing you stole that night!Present Lotta's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. More than the witness' credibility, perhaps you should be worrying about your legal standing, or should I say, falling?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nJudge:\nI'm setting the volume down to low so I won't have to waste my time with your objections!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I never knew the judge had hearing aids... Argh! Now's not the time to be wondering about health conditions! OK, one more try!)\nLeads back to:\n\"You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\"Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?Judge:\nA camera...?Phoenix:\nYesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, \"My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!\"Judge:\nWhy... Why... Witness!!Oldbag:\nWhat is it, gramps?Phoenix:\nIf you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!Oldbag:\nGrr... Looks like you found me out again, sonny... Is this the camera you're looking for?Phoenix:\nAh, that's...!Oldbag:\nWhat!? Even though I look like this, I'm still a person, you know! I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and \"borrow\" things from people!Judge:\nUm... I think your definition of \"borrow\" is a little off...Oldbag:\nI saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, \"Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire\"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!Judge:\nBailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?Edgeworth:\nThere is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.Judge:\nPlease present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!Oldbag:\nSee, I told you! That's the guy I saw!Judge:\nThis proves that the witness was not lying earlier about this matter.Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record.Judge:\nWh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nThis photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was still in his Nickel Samurai costume!Judge:\nIf that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...Edgeworth:\nThe defendant.Judge:\nHow did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?Phoenix:\n(If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...nothing strange with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is nothing strange with this photo.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I have done nothing to alter this picture either, in case you're wondering, Wright.\nJudge:\nI see... And it seems the defense will rest on this matter. In that case, there is no reason to further prolong this trial.\nMia:\nIs this really alright with you, Phoenix!?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well... There's nothing wrong with this photo that I can poi--\nMia:\nTry again! Take another good look at it! And if you still don't see anything... Do something... anything to prolong the trial!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Chief! W-Wait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright? I'm about to enter my verdict. Please address me with your comment afterwards.\nPhoenix:\nUm, no, I'm sorry, but this can't wait...\nEdgeworth:\nOh? Let me guess. You are going to point out some peculiarity with this photo?\nJudge:\nWh-What? Why didn't you say so earlier!?\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"something strange with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"Phoenix:\nThere's... There's something strange with this photo!Edgeworth:\nI knew this was coming, Wright.Judge:\nYour thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.Judge:\n\"Debunk with a bunker buster\"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!Judge:\nIf you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need one chance, correct...?Phoenix:\nUm... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this photo from anyway...? (Changed from [Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...?] in the original release) It's all out of focus! Why can't she take a good shot, especially when it counts!?)Judge:\nNow then, let's hear your objection.

His ankles...?Phoenix:\nIf you could see this person's ankle, that would be one thing... However you can't.Judge:\nA-And...? What does that mean...?Phoenix:\nThe costumed person in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde! (Changed from [The 'Nickel Samurai' in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!] in the original release)Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of this!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI wonder if you would care to elaborate... With actual facts, that is.Phoenix:\nLet's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.Judge:\nHis... His socks... You can see his socks...Phoenix:\nExactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nThere is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)Mia:\nThat's curious...Phoenix:\nHuh? What is?Mia:\nEdgeworth is unusually calm today...Phoenix:\nThat's true...Mia:\nHe's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.Phoenix:\n\"Along for the ride\"...? What do you mean by that?Mia:\nI can only think that perhaps he doesn't feel under attack at all...Phoenix:\n(He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, I haven't damaged his case at all!?) (Changed from [He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?] in the original release)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nIf the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!Edgeworth:\n... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Edgeworth:\nWright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?Phoenix:\n(Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)Mia:\nDon't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)Judge:\nMr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts. Who is the person in this photograph...?Present Adrian Andrews profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"A-Adrian Andrews...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nAre you saying this is who you think was in the costume...?\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um... Well, I know there isn't a lot to back me up here, but...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSometimes I wonder about you. Do you just pick the first piece of evidence you see?\nMia:\nI can't believe it. I didn't think you would mess up here of all places...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... And I really thought I had it!)\nJudge:\nNow then, would you care to try one more time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts.\"Judge:\nA-Adrian Andrews...?Phoenix:\nIf you want to know who that Nickel Samurai is, it is none other than this woman!Edgeworth:\nAnd why would you say it must be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her? (Changed from [And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nFor starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.Judge:\nAnd how does that all add up?Phoenix:\nIt means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!Judge:\nThe knife that was used as a murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nWhy don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?Phoenix:\n(I have to do this now! This is my last chance to turn things around!) The defense motions to indict Ms. Adrian Andrews in the murder of Juan Corrida! It was Ms. Andrews who tried to frame the defendant for the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order!! ORDER!! It looks like this trial has hit a most unexpected development! Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nThis court is issuing a subpoena for Ms. Adrian Andrews! A verdict cannot be passed without first hearing her testimony!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\n(Alright! This is it...)Mia:\nThis... is kind of bad for us.Phoenix:\nHuh?

Looks like this battle is far from over.Edgeworth:\nExactly.Judge:\nVery well. We will call the next witness. However... Before we proceed, we shall take a 10 minute recess. Please prepare your witness in that time, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nThe court will now take a 10 minute recess.To be continued.March 22, 2:14 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Engarde:\nDude! I can't believe that Adrian... No way! Not cool and collected Adrian Andrews!Phoenix:\nShe is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... her.Engarde:\nSo after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...Phoenix:\nSee, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.Engarde:\nHmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?Phoenix:\nYes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.Engarde:\nBut... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!Phoenix:\nShe has her own agenda.Engarde:\nH-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?Phoenix:\nI'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.Engarde:\nGet me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?Mia:\nPhoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's missing suicide note, right?Phoenix:\n...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live. (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release) But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...Mia:\n...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.Phoenix:\nAnd that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!Mia:\nThat sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.Phoenix:\nUm, what...?Mia:\nWho was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' dependency issues with regards to Ms. Inpax...? (Changed from [Better stated, Mr. Andrews' co-dependency with regards to Ms. Inpax...?] in the original release)Phoenix:\n... It was Edgeworth...Mia:\nIt looks like he's still the one in command of this ship. Don't let your guard down yet.March 22, 2:25 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you please.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls the witness subpoenaed by this court. Ms. Adrian Andrews, the person who discovered the crime in Mr. Juan Corrida's room!Edgeworth:\nWhat is your occupation?Andrews:\nI am the manager of the defendant in this case, Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge:\nI see. Now then...Andrews:\nBefore we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.Judge:\nUh, yes, sure. What is it?Andrews:\nI'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly \"magazine\" recently...Judge:\nAh, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of \"Gossip Land\"...Phoenix:\n(If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)Edgeworth:\nAnyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.Andrews:\nYes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.Judge:\nHmm, so it was a \"fry 'n bait\" matter... or was that \"bait 'n fry\"? Reminds me of fishing...Andrews:\nBut I... But I didn't kill him.Edgeworth:\nNo one has accused you of that.Andrews:\nI think there's someone who would beg to differ. (Changed from [I've got a feeling someone will soon...] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nI think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.Edgeworth:\nVery well then. Witness, please testify to the court about what happened when you discovered the murder that had taken place.Witness Testimony-- When I Found the Body --Andrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...\nWhat I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.\nI felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.Judge:\nYou poured yourself a glass of juice...?Andrews:\nYes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...Edgeworth:\nAnd that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:\nPhoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.Phoenix:\nYes... I know.Mia:\nIn order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pacing. (Changed from [You should disrupt her pace.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nDisrupt her pacing...? (Changed from [Disrupt her pace...?] in the original release)Mia:\nShe's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it. The instant you let up on your offense is the instant this trial is over. Understand?Cross Examination-- When I Found the Body --Andrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what was Mr. Engarde doing at the time...?\nAndrews:\nHe was taking a nap. He was worn out from his mini performance as the Nickel Samurai during the ceremony...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, Mr. Engarde did say he was taking a nap...) Then I guess you could say it could not have been taken out of his room, yes?\nAndrews:\nExcuse me? \"It\"...? What are you...?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I thought years of school would have taught you how to construct a sentence. If you can't make a sensible sentence with a subject, then I'll make one for you. Watch. Did you, Ms. Andrews, remove Mr. Engarde's knife from his room?\nAndrews:\n...No.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nSubject, verb, object Wright. Did you skip basic grammar? The witness may continue.Andrews:\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you do that...?\nAndrews:\nAs a friendly gesture, Juan was to make an appearance with the other Heroes.\nPhoenix:\n(So the show was supposed to be a \"show\" of friendship, huh?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIs that the only reason?\nAndrews:\nI beg your pardon? What are you implying...?\nPhoenix:\nYou had a certain goal in mind when you started to get close to him, correct...? So perhaps you had a more personal matter to discuss with the victim...?\nAndrews:\n... Sorry, but I didn't have any such intentions in mind at that time.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't get her to talk without a strong piece of evidence, I guess...)\nLeads to:\n\"May we continue now...?\"\n\n\n\n\nLet her be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I should back off... As long as I don't have any proof, she's not going to talk.)\nLeads to:\n\"May we continue now...?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMay we continue now...? Witness, what did you see when you got to his room?Andrews:\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were \"in shock\"...?\nAndrews:\nWhat? Was I not supposed to be?\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Andrews is a very calculating person... And despite how \"close\" they were, I doubt she had romantic feelings for Mr. Corrida...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnyone randomly stumbling upon a dead body would be in shock. And you can't seriously expect that a young beauty like her would not be shocked.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think beauty has anything to do with being shocked or not...)\nJudge:\nHmm... I see...Press (after pressing fifth statement, before adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were \"in shock\"...?\nAndrews:\nWhat?

And you can't seriously expect that a young beauty like her would not be shocked.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think beauty has anything to do with being shocked or not...)\nJudge:\nHmm... I see...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews, I would like to confirm with you one more time. When you discovered the dead body of Juan Corrida, you were in great shock. And that's when you poured yourself the glass of juice, correct?\nAndrews:\nAnd what of it...? My mind really was a complete blank at the time.\nPhoenix:\nYour mind was a complete blank? I didn't think that was possible for you.\nAndrews:\nAren't you rude today? I was so dazed that I made one careless mistake... That one thing...\nPhoenix:\nWhat \"one thing\"?\nAndrews:\nUm, never mind. It's no big deal.\nPhoenix:\n(What was she starting to say just now...?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Andrews!\"\n\n\n\n\nLet her be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Well, it probably doesn't have anything to do with the case, so...)\nMia:\nStop right there. You finally got her to open her mouth on this one, and you're going to let it go? Now is the time to get as much out of her as we can.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're right.\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Andrews!\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews!

He was worn out from his mini performance as the Nickel Samurai during the ceremony...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, Mr. Engarde did say he was taking a nap...) Then I guess you could say it could not have been taken out of his room, yes?\nAndrews:\nExcuse me? \"It\"...? What are you...?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I thought years of school would have taught you how to construct a sentence. If you can't make a sensible sentence with a subject, then I'll make one for you. Watch. Did you, Ms. Andrews, remove Mr. Engarde's knife from his room?\nAndrews:\n...No.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nSubject, verb, object Wright. Did you skip basic grammar?

Dude, like I said yesterday... I'm \"refreshing like a spring breeze\", alright? I can't let any sort of scandal ruin that.Phoenix:\nI understand...???:\nWell, it's almost time.Phoenix:\nMia...Mia:\nWe must get a complete acquittal today.Phoenix:\nI know...

She's unharmed, right!????:\nWell... When I checked on her earlier this morning, she seemed a bit, how shall we say, tired.Phoenix:\n...!???:\nDon't worry. People don't die that easily. Besides, what you really should be concentrating on, is winning today's trial.Phoenix:\nG...Grrrr...???:\nFor my sake, as well as yours, you must win today's trial. (Changed from [For myself, you must win today's trial.] in the original release) Which is why... I sent you a little present this morning.Phoenix:\nPresent? What in the world would you want to give me!????:\nYou'll figure it out once the trial starts... And even if you don't \"like\" my gift... (Changed from [You'll figure it out once the trial opens... even if you don't 'like' my gift...] in the original release) I expect you to graciously accept it, and win the day's contest...

I, Miles Edgeworth, will be taking her place. The prosecution is ready... naturally.Edgeworth:\nMs. von Karma was shot in her right shoulder, and is currently undergoing surgery. Luckily, I have looked this case over and am familiar with the details. The prosecution seeks to prove the guilt of Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge:\nTh-The court acknowledges the prosecution.Edgeworth:\n...Wright. I finally found the answer I was struggling for on my long journey this past year. By the time this case comes to an end, you too, will know the answer.Phoenix:\n...!Edgeworth:\nNow then, the prosecution would like to call its first witness... Please bring Detective Gumshoe to the witness stand!Edgeworth:\nWitness, your name and occupation.Gumshoe:\nMy name's Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm a detective down at the precinct... for now.Judge:\n\"For now\"...?Gumshoe:\nAfter this trial's over... I'm supposed to turn in my badge, sir.Phoenix:\n(D-Detective Gumshoe...)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution has no need for a depressed witness. Lift your head up and face forward like a proud officer, Detective Dick Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!Edgeworth:\nNow, let's have your testimony. If we want to explore the various facets of this case, we must start with that.Mia:\nGet ready, Phoenix. This is going to be one very rough fight.Phoenix:\nYeah... It would have to be with Edgeworth as my opponent.  (The answer he was \"struggling\" for... Interesting... Show me this \"answer\" you finally found, Edgeworth...)Witness Testimony-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:\nHmm... After the award ceremony ended, the victim was alone in his room...?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! Both the victim and defendant went alone to their rooms, sir.Judge:\nI see. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you please give us a brief timeline of what happened after the ceremony?\nGumshoe:\nOK, pal. The ceremony started at 6 PM. It ended around 8 PM... and then there was a short break. A special post-ceremony show was supposed to start in the lobby 30 minutes later.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when the victim's body was found, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nWhich is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period.\nJudge:\nHmm... Please continue with your testimony, Detective.Gumshoe:\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe person who discovered the victim's body was Adrian Andrews, correct?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Adrian Andrews\" you're talking about?\nGumshoe:\nShe's the defendant, Matt Engarde's, manager. She's a really pretty lady... sir.\nJudge:\nAh, so she's a pretty lady... I wonder if she will grace us with her presence...\nGumshoe:\nWhen the post-ceremony show was about to start, she went to get Mr. Engarde. After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir.\nJudge:\nI see... And that's when she found the victim's body...Gumshoe:\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana.\nJudge:\nMmm... \"Banana\"...\nGumshoe:\nUm, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir.\nJudge:\nAh, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana.\nPhoenix:\nThen, what about the knife...?\nGumshoe:\nIt seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death.\nJudge:\nHmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death...

The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...\nGuitar Case updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...Gumshoe:\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat convinced you it had nothing to do with the case?\nGumshoe:\nThe guitar wasn't at the Gatewater Hotel that night.\nJudge:\nWell then, where was it?\nGumshoe:\nThe bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir.\nJudge:\nSo you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar.\nPhoenix:\nSo that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all.\nJudge:\nHmm...Mia:\nOur first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.Phoenix:\nBut there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...Mia:\nMaybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.Phoenix:\nIf you say so...Mia:\nOf course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?After pressing third, fourth and fifth statements:Edgeworth:\nI believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWhich brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.Phoenix:\n(Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)Judge:\nVery well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Judge:\nHmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.Gumshoe:\nIt was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.Knife added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\n...And there's this button.Judge:\nThat was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?Gumshoe:\nYes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Jammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAll of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?Edgeworth:\nYes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?Phoenix:\nHmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!Edgeworth:\nYou can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.Phoenix:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Cross Examination-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown.\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end...\nJudge:\nThat is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing.\nEdgeworth:\n...Gumshoe:\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls!\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah, I guess, but...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all!\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUm, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired.\nGumshoe:\nEh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's...\nEdgeworth:\nI look forward to your pension negotiations.\nGumshoe:\nN-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony.\nGumshoe:\n*sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too...\nEdgeworth:\nDetective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)Gumshoe:\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any proof that button belonged to the victim?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nOh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\".\nGumshoe:\nHuh? But can't you tell by just looking at it?\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nA-And the victim's blood is on it.\nPhoenix:\nAnyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward.\nGumshoe:\n... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Thread.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nThe button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal!\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nMia:\nThat's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.Gumshoe:\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhen was this button found?\nGumshoe:\nPretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder...\nEdgeworth:\nThe police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people...\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe:\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow were the fingerprints arranged on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nBy examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...?\nGumshoe:\nOh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe the bumbling of this department...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe:\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife!\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...)\nMia:\n...Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nThere's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"Phoenix:\n(A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)Mia:\nBe grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix:\nWe're still in a world of trouble...Mia:\nWell, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?Phoenix:\nWait a second!Gumshoe:\nWh-What?Phoenix:\nSo the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?Gumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The defendant...Phoenix:\n...Did not buy this knife.Gumshoe:\nH-Huh!?Phoenix:\nTake a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe:\n...Huh?Judge:\nIt has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...Gumshoe:\n\"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.Phoenix:\nThat's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.Gumshoe:\n... Uh oh.Phoenix:\nThe murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!Judge:\nYes, that is very true! This is a very big...Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...Judge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nI think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.Phoenix:\nH-How so!?Edgeworth:\nI admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.Gumshoe:\n...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*Edgeworth:\nThe question is... Where did this knife come from?Judge:\nWh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...Edgeworth:\nSorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.Judge:\nThere is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?Edgeworth:\nIf it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.Phoenix:\nUrk...Edgeworth:\nMr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.Judge:\nAmazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.Mia:\nIt seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...Phoenix:\n(This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)Judge:\nA murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.Edgeworth:\nI can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.Phoenix:\n(Evidence not yet shown...?)Mia:\nHe means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.Judge:\nWhat does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nUm, well...Mia:\nPhoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...Phoenix:\n(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)Judge:\nMr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?Actually, I do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"No, not right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.)\nJudge:\nLooks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means this court is adjourned.\nMia:\nPhoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!)\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"Phoenix:\nThere's one...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nOne piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!Judge:\nMr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.Edgeworth:\nWhat the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.Phoenix:\n(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)Judge:\nYou may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?Present Wine Glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong.\nJudge:\nI can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nI am a man of my word, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penaltyJudge:\nThis... is a wine glass, is it not?Phoenix:\nPlease look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... Well, yes, I see your point.Phoenix:\nHowever! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!Judge:\n...Gumshoe:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nW-Well? What do you all have to say...?Judge:\nAh, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...Phoenix:\nY-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!Judge:\nYou can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nWhat is it, Your Honor?Judge:\nYour opinion...Edgeworth:\n...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.Phoenix:\n...What!?Edgeworth:\nIt's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.Judge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)It's possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...)\nMia:\nYou can't think like that, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nRight now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(So in other words, push as far as we can go...)\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"There's no way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!)\nMia:\nThey just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough!\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"Phoenix:\nThe defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!Judge:\nHmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?Phoenix:\n(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)Edgeworth:\nUnlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Edgeworth:\nYou're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?Phoenix:\nTh-Then...Edgeworth:\nOf course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.Phoenix:\nFingerprints...Edgeworth:\nThere were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.Judge:\nOnly one? Well, whose were they!?Edgeworth:\nThey were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nThat is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)Edgeworth:\nMs. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.Phoenix:\nGrrr!Edgeworth:\nI've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!Judge:\nW-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...Edgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.Phoenix:\n\"Another witness\"...?Edgeworth:\nYes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!Mia:\nWhat in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?Edgeworth:\nNow then, witness, please state your name and occupation...Oldbag:\n...Edgeworth:\n... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Edgeworth:\nUurrngh!Oldbag:\n...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!Edgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Phoenix:\n(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)Oldbag:\nOh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!Edgeworth:\nI saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?Oldbag:\nI tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.Judge:\nMs... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nOof!Oldbag:\nShush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!Judge:\nYes, madam.Edgeworth:\nNo no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.Oldbag:\nIt's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?Edgeworth:\nThe witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag:\nIt was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!Judge:\nYou mean... You were a fan of the victim?Oldbag:\nLook, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!Phoenix:\n(Um... But those two were the same age...)Oldbag:\nAnyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.Edgeworth:\nVery well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.Oldbag:\nLeave it to me, Edgey-poo!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Judge:\nHmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...Oldbag:\nSee! It has to be him! He's the murderer!Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what was your post on that night?\nOldbag:\nThe lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...)\nOldbag:\nBesides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?Oldbag:\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSomething you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that?\nOldbag:\nIt's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course.\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Gossip\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nIf this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony.\nMia:\nIt looks like we shouldn't force it right now.\nJudge:\nHmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?Oldbag:\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room?\nOldbag:\nI have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am!\nJudge:\n...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?Oldbag:\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho in the world was that!?\nOldbag:\nI'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was...\nJudge:\nYes...? He was...?\nOldbag:\n... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...)\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.Oldbag:\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get a sense of déjà vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release))\n\n\n\nThe person's face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's face in more detail!\nOldbag:\nYou don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth!\nPhoenix:\nHis teeth were... shining?\nOldbag:\nWell, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie.\nPhoenix:\n... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!?\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the person was carrying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was the man you saw carrying?\nOldbag:\nIn which hand? His right or his left?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nAh, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand?\nOldbag:\nAh, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand.\nPhoenix:\nThen how about his left?\nOldbag:\nEmpty.\nPhoenix:\n... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...

Really, as if something like that matters.\nPhoenix:\nBut it does.\nOldbag:\nUm... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat thing?\nOldbag:\nThat gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...)\nOldbag:\nThat thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!!\nPhoenix:\nUm, right...\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nDon't you see it, Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! I request what the witness said about the jacket be appended to her testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't quite see where you're going with this, but alright. Witness, please...\nOldbag:\nAh well, I don't like to badmouth anyone without reason, but if I must...\nAdds statement \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I'm going to have to press a little harder on this one... There's got to be some sort of huge contradiction I can find here...)Oldbag:\nHe was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure the defendant was wearing a racing jacket?\nOldbag:\nWhat do you think? It's not like I've seen him in anything other than that horrible thing. I'm sure he was wearing it!\nPhoenix:\n(She is so sure of herself that it's to the point of self-absorption...)Present Jammin' Ninja's Button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag...\"Mia:\nShe may not remember things or be mistaken here and there, but I don't think she's lying.Phoenix:\nThat's bad for us. Really bad.Mia:\nBut, that's how the human mind is. It also has the tendency to jump off-topic. She's strayed onto a few interesting side-topics this time too, hasn't she? But that's what makes her a sweet old lady, right?Phoenix:\n(That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag...Oldbag:\nWhat!? Don't say my name for no reason!Phoenix:\nDo you know what this is?Oldbag:\nAaaah! It's button number 2 on the Jammin' Ninja's costume!Phoenix:\n(Now I KNOW she's an obsessed fan... She identified it in a single glance!)Oldbag:\nGive it here! Give it here! If you don't give it to me, I'll punish you with this!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Phoenix:\n(Wow... She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.Oldbag:\nSee! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!Phoenix:\nIt was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.Oldbag:\nSee! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!Phoenix:\n...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his \"usual racing jacket\"!?Oldbag:\n... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nNow hold your tongue still there for one second! So what you saw in actuality, was not Mr. Engarde, the man... but Mr. Engarde, the Nickel Samurai!?Oldbag:\nBut when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!Oldbag:\nEdgey-poo! Do you think so too?Edgeworth:\nWell, it might be something worth considering. (Changed from [Well, it might be something worth thinking about.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nJust say, \"It's important\" and agree with me for a change!Judge:\nWitness! Think carefully and try to remember as much as you can before you testify!Oldbag:\n*sigh* Alright, if you insist.Phoenix:\n(I should be the one sighing, not you!)Witness Testimony-- Who I Saw --Oldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Phoenix:\nI... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!Oldbag:\nWhat? Did you think there could've been someone else inside that costume? Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.Phoenix:\nBut... But the possibility does exist!Oldbag:\nAh, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.Judge:\nH-How do you know that?Oldbag:\nBecause... I said so. And what I say is the truth.Phoenix:\n(At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)Judge:\nMr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- Who I Saw --Oldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you please get on with your testimony!\nOldbag:\nHmph! Watch your language, young man! What sort of tone is that to take with an elder! My youthfulness isn't what it used to be, so you should forgive me for everything! If you keep on barking at me like that, I'll start singing at the top of my lungs!\nPhoenix:\nUh, what?\nOldbag:\n\"A striking figure by the sea, standing all alone is he. He's the Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n(...She's actually singing... Someone help my poor ears.)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Can you please do something about this racket!?\nEdgeworth:\nWitness. I'll give you a piece of gum later if you'll be good and stick to just the facts.\nOldbag:\nOKAAAAAAAY! ... You promise, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I'll be sending the bill for the chewing gum to your office at a later date.\nPhoenix:\n(Remind me to send you a thank you note later too, Edgeworth, old chum...)Oldbag:\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBe a little more careful with your testimony, please! Not too long ago, you said he was wearing his \"racing jacket\", and now he's not!?\nOldbag:\n\"Not too long ago\"...? Then let me ask you this! When you were itty-bitty, what was your grand dream?\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nOldbag:\nWhat did you want to be when you grew up, whippersnapper!?\nPhoenix:\nMy dream, huh...? Well, I... uh, wanted to be Judge Wackner, hero of the Public's Court. So what!?\nOldbag:\nSee! And look at where you are now! You're not Judge Wackner, are you!? Are you!?\nPhoenix:\nWell...\nOldbag:\n\"What I said earlier\"... Who puts any weight into things like that!? The \"now\" is everything! I can't be held responsible for the \"past\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did court become theatrics over testimonies?)\nOldbag:\nAll that matters is that man was inside that costume. Isn't that enough!?Oldbag:\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why would that be?\nOldbag:\nThat way, no one could see his face, of course!\nPhoenix:\nBut there's still no advantage for him that I can see. In fact, you would think the costume would make him stand out all the more!\nOldbag:\n... You are such a annoying child, you know that? You disagree with everything I say...\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that what YOU'RE always doing to me!?)\nOldbag:\nI got it! Maybe it was more troublesome for him to change in and out of his costume!Oldbag:\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas there anyone else scheduled to appear at the post-ceremony show?\nOldbag:\nWell, all the contestants were supposed to go onstage in a friendly gesture thing.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that included the Jammin' Ninja...?\nOldbag:\nOf course it included him! That's why when Engarde came out of dear Juan's room, I didn't give it a second thought.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nOldbag:\nWell, anyway.Oldbag:\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo let me ask you one last time. The person you saw, it really was the Nickel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nAs showy as ever. Haven't I been saying that from the very beginning!?\nPhoenix:\n(Can I throw in the towel yet?)Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Please take a look at this.\"Phoenix:\nHmm...Mia:\nYou don't need to think too hard on this one.Phoenix:\nHuh?Mia:\nThere's a contradiction in her testimony and it's sitting in plain sight. The question is what that contradiction means for us...Phoenix:\n(Well, I have to figure out what you're talking about first, but OK...)Phoenix:\nPlease take a look at this.Oldbag:\nYeah, so, it's a knife. Big deal. If you're trying to scare me with that, I'll have you know it won't work!Phoenix:\nNo no, that's not my intention at all...Judge:\nThat's the knife that was used in the murder, correct?Phoenix:\nYour Honor. Do you know why this piece of evidence is important to this case?Judge:\nYou don't even have to ask. It's because the defendant's fingerprints are on it.Edgeworth:\n... Is that what you're driving at...?Phoenix:\nThat is exactly what I am driving at.Judge:\nWhat are we driving at? And whose car are we driving?Phoenix:\nIf Mr. Engarde was really in the Nickel Samurai costume at the time of the murder, then it's impossible for his fingerprints to have been left on this knife! Actually, he would have wiped all previous fingerprints on this knife right off!Judge:\nOh, that's right! The Nickel Samurai wears gloves, doesn't he?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHe probably took his gloves off before he began the stabbing!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nAnd why would he do something like that? To leave his prints on the murder weapon? There is no way he would do something like that!Edgeworth:\nHowever, there is one possibility!Phoenix:\nThen let's hear your \"possibility\"!Edgeworth:\nIt's very simple. The defendant went to the victim's room while in costume as the Nickel Samurai. At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder. He was probably just going to relax and talk with the victim about the stage show. Which is why he took his gloves off!Judge:\nHmm... But the murder still did take place...Edgeworth:\nIt's well known that there was bad blood between the defendant and the victim. (Changed from [It's well known that the defendant and the victim had bad blood between them.] in the original release)Judge:\nHmm, yes... I have heard that before... (Changed from [Hmm, yes... I have heard of that...] in the original release) Well, Mr. Wright? What do you have to say about Mr. Edgeworth's theory...?Phoenix:\n(So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this: When the defendant went to the victim's room, he had no intentions of killing him. Now, up to this point, are there any problems with his theory...?)There are no problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... I can't see any real problems with his theory...)\nMia:\nBut if you let Edgeworth's theory stand, then we're one very large step closer to a guilty verdict. Look at the Court Record again and take another shot at it.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I just have to think about it one more time...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please make your decision soon.\nLeads back to:\n\"So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this:\"There is a contradiction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!\"Think about it one more time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I think I need a little more time on this one.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this:\"Phoenix:\nThis theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!Edgeworth:\nWh-What are you babbling about...?Phoenix:\nNow, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer. If that's the case, I think it's impossible for the killer to have gone to the victim's room without intent!Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nNaturally, you point to the one piece with the least value... but with such vigor! Enjoy your energy while you can. Humans don't live forever... Neither do lawyers.\nJudge:\nYou sure like to think you can bluff your way out of things, don't you?\nMia:\nPhoenix, pay attention! Let's pretend for a second that Mr. Engarde is the murderer. Now from that angle, if he didn't have a murderous intent from the very beginning, then that means there is a certain object that shouldn't be at the crime scene, right?\nPhoenix:\n(\"A certain thing\"...? What certain thing...?)\nEdgeworth:\nHow are you doing over there? Busy collecting your thoughts?\nPhoenix:\n(Alright, let's give this one more try... and with even more spirit this time!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer.\"Phoenix:\nThis knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.Judge:\nY-Yes, we did establish that.Phoenix:\nWhich means that if my client was, in fact, the killer... Then he brought this knife with him when he went to visit Mr. Corrida.Edgeworth:\nI suppose...Phoenix:\nHowever, you just said it yourself. \"At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder.\" If that were true, then why would he bring a knife!? He wouldn't, would he!?Edgeworth:\nHmm...Phoenix:\nWhich means, Mr. Edgeworth, your theory was flawed from supposition one! And one more thing! If the murderer was wearing the costume at the time of the murder... Then there should be glove marks left on the knife! Which means the defendant's fingerprints shouldn't be all over it like bees on a hive!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nAnd that brings me to my final point... This knife was planted by the real killer to hide their identity and mislead us!Judge:\nO-Order! Order, I say! Order in the court!! Was this knife really planted by the killer!? Why would the murderer do such a thing!?To hide the murder method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's to hide the way in which the murder was carried out, of course!\nEdgeworth:\nM-More of your nonsense!?\nPhoenix:\nTake another good look at the autopsy report! The victim actually died from strangulation! The killer tried to hide thisx by stabbing a knife into thex victim's chest!\nJudge:\nBut doesn't the autopsy admit that the cause of death was strangulation?\nPhoenix:\nWell, yes, the real cause of death was easily discovered...\nEdgeworth:\nThen I'd say the knife did a terrible job of \"concealing\" this fact!\nPhoenix:\n... Aha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that laugh doesn't do a very good job of concealing your error either!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! I will ask you one more time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Was this knife really planted by the killer!?\"To frame Matt Engarde.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"It's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!\"Phoenix:\nIt's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!Judge:\nTo frame...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nA-Aren't you forcing the interpretation just a little too hard on this one!?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut we just established that the witness saw the \"Nickel Samurai\" in costume, and if that were true, then there shouldn't be a single fingerprint on this knife!Edgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr! Witneeeeeesssssss!!Oldbag:\n... Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey-poo...? (Changed from [Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey...?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nGnnnnngh...Judge:\nWitness, did you or did you not really see the Nickel Samurai?Oldbag:\nWell, I guess at first I might have forgotten, but...Phoenix:\nAre you saying you mixed up Mr. Engarde with the Nickel Samurai, his character on TV!?Oldbag:\nBut I mean, I can't really do anything about that now! (Changed from [But I mean, I can't really do anything about that!] in the original release) Look, I was waiting around in front of their doors because, well... Well, I wasn't waiting around for the Nickel Samurai, that's for sure!Phoenix:\n...! (She wasn't waiting for the \"Nickel Samurai\"...?) Alright then... Who were you waiting around for then?Oldbag:\n... Hmph! That's top secret to anyone outside of security!Judge:\nI have a feeling that you were waiting for Mr. Juan Corrida. Am I correct, witness?Oldbag:\nHa ha ha. The way you think, you are a sad amateur with a terrible case of near-sightedness.Judge:\nAmateur...? Me...? What am I an amateur of...?Phoenix:\n(So Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room... But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...)Mia:\nMaybe... Phoenix! Maybe the old bag was waiting around for \"that\" person!Phoenix:\n(Hmm, if it's who I think Mia's hinting at... It's certainly possible...) Ms. Oldbag. You were waiting for this person to come out of the victim's room, weren't you?Present Adrian Andrews profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Who is this person...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nMia:\nWhat are you talking about, Phoenix!? She could've waited until the next century and this would never have appeared!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch... Busted... Guess there's no fooling her.)\nJudge:\nYou two! What do you think you're doing flirting in my courtroom!?\nPhoenix:\nWe weren't doing anything like that... Honest... (Well, back to the drawing board on this one... Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room...)\nLeads back to:\n\"But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...\"Judge:\nWho is this person...?Phoenix:\nThis is Adrian Andrews, Mr. Engarde's manager.Judge:\nB-But why would the defendant's manager be in the victim's room...?Edgeworth:\nIt seems that this is the latest rumor in circulation, Your Honor.Judge:\n...Hmm... Oh... This is... Well, this is... Hmm, hmm... Hah, I see...Phoenix:\n(The judge seems to be really into the \"article\"... If it can be called such a thing...)Judge:\nThen this manager with the initials A. A.... Are you saying it's...?Edgeworth:\nAdrian Andrews. Without a doubt, the witness thought so as well.Oldbag:\n... Hmph. Looks like you found me out. Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole \"sworn to confidentiality stuff\" then. (Changed from [Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole sworn to confidentiality stuff.] in the original release)Judge:\nW-Witness...? What in the world are you...Mia:\nWatch out, Phoenix. I've got a bad feeling about this... A very bad feeling.Oldbag:\nI got some information... Some very secret information from a certain source. So that's why I was doing my own little investigation... In secret, of course.Judge:\nB-But what for...?Oldbag:\nOh, just for myself... Personal reasons and all that.Judge:\n... Well, Mr. Edgeworth. How will you proceed from here?Edgeworth:\nI really don't want to do this, however I cannot simply let this point slide.Judge:\nI see. Very well then. Witness, please testify about this \"secret information\".Oldbag:\nGet ready! This is going to take the wind out of you young'uns!Phoenix:\n(I'm sure we're all capable of handling this... Really, it's not like we're ten years old.)Witness Testimony-- Secret Information --Oldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!\nI cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?Judge:\nThe defendant sent his manager...? What a distasteful topic for this court!Oldbag:\nWhat!? Nobody's above gossip! And isn't there a saying!? \"The truth is never pleasant.\"Phoenix:\n(Never heard that one before...)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What about this Adrian Andrews person...?Edgeworth:\nWe have looked into this matter, and found that the \"truth\" the article proposes is, in fact, baseless gossip.Judge:\nHmm... But should this be true... Then this proves that the defendant did bear ill-will towards the victim.Phoenix:\n(...So this means I have to smash this rumor once and for all.)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Mia:\nBe careful. The old bag seems rather excited right now.Oldbag:\nThat's right! Engarde is nothing but your average foul-blooded youth!Phoenix:\n(Well, as the old saying goes... You've gotta burn old bags with fire! Time to fire up the afterburners and hit the highway to the danger zone!)Cross Examination-- Secret Information --Oldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou can't say something like that without proof! That's just slander!\nOldbag:\nBut it's true! That woman was getting intimate with poor Juan! Look! It says so right here, doesn't it!? \"Manager to the stars, Ms. A. A.!\"\nPhoenix:\nBut the name of the magazine this came from is \"Gossip Land\"...\nOldbag:\nWhat? Are you saying that \"gossip\" is all just a pack of lies? Hmph, what do you know? I suppose next you'll swear to me that the \"news\" is 100% truth!\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nHonestly, sonny. You can't discriminate between the news and gossip!\nJudge:\nYes, discrimination is bad, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Discriminate? When did I do anything like that?)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, Engarde will never get me to say \"touché\"!Oldbag:\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA scandal...? What do you mean by that?\nOldbag:\nYou're a dimwitted one, aren't you? I can't believe you don't know what a \"scandal\" is! Honestly, what are they teaching kids in middle school these days...?\nPhoenix:\nAh, no no! I wasn't asking what the word \"scandal\" means! Even I know that much!\nOldbag:\nWell! That Engarde thought he could own a monopoly on popularity!Oldbag:\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou don't have any proof that Mr. Engarde did any such thing!\nOldbag:\nYou must be suffering from shock; the shock of hearing the truth. And now, since you're in so much shock, you can't do anything right!\nPhoenix:\n(You're right, I can't do anything, but boy do I wish I could do something about you.)\nOldbag:\nAlright then, sonny, show me what you've got! Can you show me proof that Engarde didn't bear any ill-will towards Juan!?\n\n\n\nPresent evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm not going to let you push me around that easily!\nOldbag:\nHeh.

Tell him that no matter what he does, the only thing he's good at is failing.\nEdgeworth:\nUm... What she said, Wright! Or should I say... Baboon-boy!\nJudge:\nYes, I agree this isn't much of a piece of evidence... Baboon-boy.\nPhoenix:\n(Did I just gain a new nickname here...?)\nLeads to:\n\"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDecline the offer to present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...I don't have anything to offer.\nOldbag:\nSeeeeeee! Just as I thought.\nLeads to:\n\"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\"\n\n\nOldbag:\nAnd you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!

So I took action!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you mean by \"I took action\"...?\nOldbag:\nLike I already told you, I was lying in wait close to the crime scene! Once that slimy woman came out of Juan's room... I was going to capture her, and teach her a good lesson. Something you young'uns need!\nJudge:\nYou were going to \"teach her a good lesson\"...?\nOldbag:\nI was going to make her eat the damaging beams of my ray gun! Like this!\nJudge:\nN-No, stop!\nOldbag:\nWell, it was too bad that woman didn't come through the door that night.Oldbag:\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!?

You'll get your reward.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I don't want your reward, but you don't leave me much of a choice...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness could have gotten her information from anywhere! It's even possible that it was spontaneously made up inside the witness's head!\nPhoenix:\n(And he lectures ME on \"reckless blabbering\"!?)\nJudge:\nAs long as we don't know where this information came from, it's quite a waste of time to focus on this line of questioning.\nPhoenix:\n(Where did Oldbag get her inside information...? There has to be something I can use to figure it out!)\nLeads back to corss-examination\n\n\n\n\nPresent evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo no one else is supposed to know this \"secret information\", correct? If that's true, then why do you know it, Ms. Oldbag...?\nOldbag:\nWh-Wh-Why are you looking at me like that...? Stop that!\nPhoenix:\nWitness! I hate to say it, but this is how you came to acquire your secret info, isn't it!? (Changed from [I'm sad to say it, but this is how you found out this secret, isn't it!?] in the original release)\n\n\n\nPresent Lotta's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou call that \"proof\"!? It looks more like proof of spite towards the witness! If you have nothing to back up your claims, then they are no more valid than \"gossip\"!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained. Witness, please feel free to ignore the defense's gesture of ill-will and continue.\nOldbag:\nOkie-dokie! See, nothing can get me down!\nPhoenix:\n(Great... That did nothing but set me back a few minutes of my life...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nWait and see\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I should probably think a bit more about this... I don't want to do anything rash... For now, maybe I should sit back and watch how things play out...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationMia:\nSounds like just another tidbit of gossip, doesn't it? But you can't just ignore it either. It makes your client look bad either way.Phoenix:\n(Well, I don't think I heard anything really out of the ordinary just now...)Mia:\nThere has to be something we can catch her on...Phoenix:\n(Yeah... And when I find it, I'm going to press the heck out of it...)Phoenix:\nThe \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...Judge:\nOh yes... I remember that mischievous girl.Phoenix:\nShe reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.Judge:\nShe reported such a thing...?Phoenix:\nOn that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.Oldbag:\nWh-What!? Outrageous ideas, you say!?Phoenix:\nNo no no, I said impressions.Oldbag:\nThen... Then...! Then everything written on this piece of paper is completely meaningless!?Phoenix:\nAh! That's it! That's the note!Oldbag:\nAh! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Noooo! You see, this is something completely different! This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!Judge:\nHmm, then you are the one who took Ms. Hart's note?Oldbag:\nI'm a huuuuuuuge fan of Juan's, that's why! That infamous, puffy-haired whippersnapper... She's working with that evil Engarde! She said so herself! \"En garde! I'm his sidekick!\" She was so happy, smiling like a silly duck. I was only checking what she had written!Phoenix:\n...Judge:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Oldbag:\n... Edgey-poo! You believe me, don't you!?Edgeworth:\nNngh...Oldbag:\nI was only trying to help out like the angel I am! It's only one little piece of paper! I've never taken anything else before!Edgeworth:\nYou really should come with a supply of cheese to match your vintage whine.Judge:\nWell, it was only a piece of paper. I suppose we can overlook this just this once.Phoenix:\n(She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)Pile on more pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I let up on her now, she'll get away... I have to find some way to inflict a deafening blow to the prosecution!)\nLeads to:\n\"Witness!\"Forgive her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess we should forgive her.\nOldbag:\nHmph! Who the heck are you to decide who should be forgiven, you delinquent!\nPhoenix:\nGrr... (Number of endearing qualities: ZERO.)\nMia:\nPhoenix. You can't go easy on her. She's no frail old lady.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nMia:\nYou should be pressing her until she gives in!\nPhoenix:\n(Mia is really scary today... *gulp*)\nLeads to:\n\"Witness!\"Phoenix:\nWitness! You said that the only thing you stole was that note. Is this correct?Oldbag:\nS-S-Stole!? Why don't you listen more carefully, you annoying brat!? I saved this piece of paper from the terrible, lonely trash can! That's all!Phoenix:\nYou're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!Oldbag:\nAre you putting my credibility under scrutiny again!?Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! I don't believe that the note is the only thing you stole that night!Present Lotta's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. More than the witness' credibility, perhaps you should be worrying about your legal standing, or should I say, falling?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nJudge:\nI'm setting the volume down to low so I won't have to waste my time with your objections!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I never knew the judge had hearing aids... Argh! Now's not the time to be wondering about health conditions! OK, one more try!)\nLeads back to:\n\"You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\"Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?Judge:\nA camera...?Phoenix:\nYesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, \"My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!\"Judge:\nWhy... Why... Witness!!Oldbag:\nWhat is it, gramps?Phoenix:\nIf you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!Oldbag:\nGrr... Looks like you found me out again, sonny... Is this the camera you're looking for?Phoenix:\nAh, that's...!Oldbag:\nWhat!? Even though I look like this, I'm still a person, you know! I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and \"borrow\" things from people!Judge:\nUm... I think your definition of \"borrow\" is a little off...Oldbag:\nI saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, \"Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire\"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!Judge:\nBailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?Edgeworth:\nThere is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.Judge:\nPlease present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!Oldbag:\nSee, I told you! That's the guy I saw!Judge:\nThis proves that the witness was not lying earlier about this matter.Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record.Judge:\nWh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nThis photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was still in his Nickel Samurai costume!Judge:\nIf that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...Edgeworth:\nThe defendant.Judge:\nHow did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?Phoenix:\n(If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...nothing strange with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is nothing strange with this photo.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I have done nothing to alter this picture either, in case you're wondering, Wright.\nJudge:\nI see... And it seems the defense will rest on this matter. In that case, there is no reason to further prolong this trial.\nMia:\nIs this really alright with you, Phoenix!?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well... There's nothing wrong with this photo that I can poi--\nMia:\nTry again! Take another good look at it! And if you still don't see anything... Do something... anything to prolong the trial!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Chief! W-Wait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright? I'm about to enter my verdict. Please address me with your comment afterwards.\nPhoenix:\nUm, no, I'm sorry, but this can't wait...\nEdgeworth:\nOh? Let me guess. You are going to point out some peculiarity with this photo?\nJudge:\nWh-What? Why didn't you say so earlier!?\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"something strange with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"Phoenix:\nThere's... There's something strange with this photo!Edgeworth:\nI knew this was coming, Wright.Judge:\nYour thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.Judge:\n\"Debunk with a bunker buster\"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!Judge:\nIf you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need one chance, correct...?Phoenix:\nUm... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this photo from anyway...? (Changed from [Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...?] in the original release) It's all out of focus! Why can't she take a good shot, especially when it counts!?)Judge:\nNow then, let's hear your objection. What about this photo is \"strange\"...?Present Nickel Samurai's feet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!\"Present Nickel Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's this person here, of course!\nJudge:\nYou mean the \"Nickel Samurai\"?

His ankles...?Phoenix:\nIf you could see this person's ankle, that would be one thing... However you can't.Judge:\nA-And...? What does that mean...?Phoenix:\nThe costumed person in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde! (Changed from [The 'Nickel Samurai' in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!] in the original release)Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of this!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI wonder if you would care to elaborate... With actual facts, that is.Phoenix:\nLet's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.Judge:\nHis... His socks... You can see his socks...Phoenix:\nExactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nThere is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)Mia:\nThat's curious...Phoenix:\nHuh? What is?Mia:\nEdgeworth is unusually calm today...Phoenix:\nThat's true...Mia:\nHe's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.Phoenix:\n\"Along for the ride\"...? What do you mean by that?Mia:\nI can only think that perhaps he doesn't feel under attack at all...Phoenix:\n(He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, I haven't damaged his case at all!?) (Changed from [He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?] in the original release)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nIf the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!Edgeworth:\n... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Edgeworth:\nWright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?Phoenix:\n(Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)Mia:\nDon't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)Judge:\nMr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts. Who is the person in this photograph...?Present Adrian Andrews profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"A-Adrian Andrews...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nAre you saying this is who you think was in the costume...?\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um... Well, I know there isn't a lot to back me up here, but...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSometimes I wonder about you. Do you just pick the first piece of evidence you see?\nMia:\nI can't believe it. I didn't think you would mess up here of all places...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... And I really thought I had it!)\nJudge:\nNow then, would you care to try one more time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts.\"Judge:\nA-Adrian Andrews...?Phoenix:\nIf you want to know who that Nickel Samurai is, it is none other than this woman!Edgeworth:\nAnd why would you say it must be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her? (Changed from [And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nFor starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.Judge:\nAnd how does that all add up?Phoenix:\nIt means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!Judge:\nThe knife that was used as a murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nWhy don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?Phoenix:\n(I have to do this now! This is my last chance to turn things around!) The defense motions to indict Ms. Adrian Andrews in the murder of Juan Corrida! It was Ms. Andrews who tried to frame the defendant for the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order!! ORDER!! It looks like this trial has hit a most unexpected development! Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nThis court is issuing a subpoena for Ms. Adrian Andrews! A verdict cannot be passed without first hearing her testimony!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\n(Alright! This is it...)Mia:\nThis... is kind of bad for us.Phoenix:\nHuh?

I think you underestimate me, Your Honor.Judge:\nAnd what do you mean by that...?Edgeworth:\nThat Mr. Phoenix Wright would slave his way to subpoenaing Ms. Adrian Andrews is all happening according to plan...

WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of your statement, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nMs. Adrian Andrews is currently waiting in the prosecution lobby... She is the next witness.Phoenix:\n...! (Everything... Everything was planned out in advance by that man...?)Mia:\nSomehow, I knew there was no way Edgeworth would overlook Ms. Andrews... Looks like this battle is far from over.Edgeworth:\nExactly.Judge:\nVery well. We will call the next witness. However... Before we proceed, we shall take a 10 minute recess. Please prepare your witness in that time, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nThe court will now take a 10 minute recess.To be continued.March 22, 2:14 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Engarde:\nDude! I can't believe that Adrian... No way! Not cool and collected Adrian Andrews!Phoenix:\nShe is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... her.Engarde:\nSo after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...Phoenix:\nSee, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.Engarde:\nHmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?Phoenix:\nYes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.Engarde:\nBut... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!Phoenix:\nShe has her own agenda.Engarde:\nH-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?Phoenix:\nI'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.Engarde:\nGet me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?Mia:\nPhoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's missing suicide note, right?Phoenix:\n...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live. (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release) But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...Mia:\n...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.Phoenix:\nAnd that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!Mia:\nThat sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.Phoenix:\nUm, what...?Mia:\nWho was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' dependency issues with regards to Ms. Inpax...? (Changed from [Better stated, Mr. Andrews' co-dependency with regards to Ms. Inpax...?] in the original release)Phoenix:\n... It was Edgeworth...Mia:\nIt looks like he's still the one in command of this ship. Don't let your guard down yet.March 22, 2:25 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you please.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls the witness subpoenaed by this court. Ms. Adrian Andrews, the person who discovered the crime in Mr. Juan Corrida's room!Edgeworth:\nWhat is your occupation?Andrews:\nI am the manager of the defendant in this case, Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge:\nI see. Now then...Andrews:\nBefore we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.Judge:\nUh, yes, sure. What is it?Andrews:\nI'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly \"magazine\" recently...Judge:\nAh, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of \"Gossip Land\"...Phoenix:\n(If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)Edgeworth:\nAnyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.Andrews:\nYes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.Judge:\nHmm, so it was a \"fry 'n bait\" matter... or was that \"bait 'n fry\"? Reminds me of fishing...Andrews:\nBut I... But I didn't kill him.Edgeworth:\nNo one has accused you of that.Andrews:\nI think there's someone who would beg to differ. (Changed from [I've got a feeling someone will soon...] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nI think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.Edgeworth:\nVery well then. Witness, please testify to the court about what happened when you discovered the murder that had taken place.Witness Testimony-- When I Found the Body --Andrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...\nWhat I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.\nI felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.Judge:\nYou poured yourself a glass of juice...?Andrews:\nYes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...Edgeworth:\nAnd that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:\nPhoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.Phoenix:\nYes... I know.Mia:\nIn order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pacing. (Changed from [You should disrupt her pace.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nDisrupt her pacing...? (Changed from [Disrupt her pace...?] in the original release)Mia:\nShe's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it. The instant you let up on your offense is the instant this trial is over. Understand?Cross Examination-- When I Found the Body --Andrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what was Mr. Engarde doing at the time...?\nAndrews:\nHe was taking a nap. He was worn out from his mini performance as the Nickel Samurai during the ceremony...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, Mr. Engarde did say he was taking a nap...) Then I guess you could say it could not have been taken out of his room, yes?\nAndrews:\nExcuse me? \"It\"...? What are you...?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I thought years of school would have taught you how to construct a sentence. If you can't make a sensible sentence with a subject, then I'll make one for you. Watch. Did you, Ms. Andrews, remove Mr. Engarde's knife from his room?\nAndrews:\n...No.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nSubject, verb, object Wright. Did you skip basic grammar? The witness may continue.Andrews:\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you do that...?\nAndrews:\nAs a friendly gesture, Juan was to make an appearance with the other Heroes.\nPhoenix:\n(So the show was supposed to be a \"show\" of friendship, huh?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIs that the only reason?\nAndrews:\nI beg your pardon? What are you implying...?\nPhoenix:\nYou had a certain goal in mind when you started to get close to him, correct...? So perhaps you had a more personal matter to discuss with the victim...?\nAndrews:\n... Sorry, but I didn't have any such intentions in mind at that time.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't get her to talk without a strong piece of evidence, I guess...)\nLeads to:\n\"May we continue now...?\"\n\n\n\n\nLet her be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I should back off... As long as I don't have any proof, she's not going to talk.)\nLeads to:\n\"May we continue now...?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMay we continue now...? Witness, what did you see when you got to his room?Andrews:\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were \"in shock\"...?\nAndrews:\nWhat? Was I not supposed to be?\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Andrews is a very calculating person... And despite how \"close\" they were, I doubt she had romantic feelings for Mr. Corrida...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnyone randomly stumbling upon a dead body would be in shock. And you can't seriously expect that a young beauty like her would not be shocked.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think beauty has anything to do with being shocked or not...)\nJudge:\nHmm... I see...Press (after pressing fifth statement, before adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were \"in shock\"...?\nAndrews:\nWhat? Was I not supposed to be?\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Andrews is a very calculating person... And despite how \"close\" they were, I doubt she had romantic feelings for Mr. Corrida...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnyone randomly stumbling upon a dead body would be in shock. And you can't seriously expect that a young beauty like her would not be shocked.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think beauty has anything to do with being shocked or not...)\nJudge:\nHmm... I see...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews, I would like to confirm with you one more time. When you discovered the dead body of Juan Corrida, you were in great shock. And that's when you poured yourself the glass of juice, correct?\nAndrews:\nAnd what of it...? My mind really was a complete blank at the time.\nPhoenix:\nYour mind was a complete blank? I didn't think that was possible for you.\nAndrews:\nAren't you rude today? I was so dazed that I made one careless mistake... That one thing...\nPhoenix:\nWhat \"one thing\"?\nAndrews:\nUm, never mind. It's no big deal.\nPhoenix:\n(What was she starting to say just now...?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Andrews!\"\n\n\n\n\nLet her be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Well, it probably doesn't have anything to do with the case, so...)\nMia:\nStop right there. You finally got her to open her mouth on this one, and you're going to let it go? Now is the time to get as much out of her as we can.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're right.\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Andrews!\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews! I'm convinced that as you said, you made a \"mistake\" at the scene of the crime.\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat I really want to know is what this \"mistake\" was.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, actually... So would I...\nAndrews:\nI... I'm sorry... It's just... It's kind of... embarrassing... When I... When I set the glass down on the dresser... I accidentally... knocked the flower vase over...\nJudge:\nF-Flower vase...? Are you talking about the one on the floor in the crime photo...? This mess of glass shards!?\nAndrews:\nIt was originally on top of the dresser... but when I bumped into it with my elbow, it fell... onto the guitar case.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-Why did you withhold such an important piece of information!?\nAndrews:\nI'm sorry...

I wasn't feeling terribly great, so I set the glass down. Without drinking it...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews, I would like to confirm with you one more time. When you discovered the dead body of Juan Corrida, you were in great shock. And that's when you poured yourself the glass of juice, correct?\nAndrews:\nAnd what of it...? My mind really was a complete blank at the time.\nPhoenix:\nYour mind was a complete blank? I didn't think that was possible for you.\nAndrews:\nAren't you rude today? I was so dazed that I made one careless mistake... That one thing...\nPhoenix:\nWhat \"one thing\"?\nAndrews:\nUm, never mind.

You finally got her to open her mouth on this one, and you're going to let it go? Now is the time to get as much out of her as we can.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're right.\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Andrews!\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews! I'm convinced that as you said, you made a \"mistake\" at the scene of the crime.\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat I really want to know is what this \"mistake\" was.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, actually... So would I...\nAndrews:\nI... I'm sorry... It's just... It's kind of... embarrassing... When I... When I set the glass down on the dresser... I accidentally... knocked the flower vase over...\nJudge:\nF-Flower vase...? Are you talking about the one on the floor in the crime photo...? This mess of glass shards!?\nAndrews:\nIt was originally on top of the dresser... but when I bumped into it with my elbow, it fell... onto the guitar case.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-Why did you withhold such an important piece of information!?\nAndrews:\nI'm sorry...

I thought I would try to take Juan's pulse... So I set the glass I was holding down on the dresser. And that's when my elbow accidentally hit the vase...\nPhoenix:\n(That's odd. I thought she was always in total control of herself...?)\nMia:\nThat's what she would like people to think. Always be mindful of the gap between the perception and reality.Present Guitar Case or Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You testified that you knocked the flower vase over. Is this correct?\"Phoenix:\n(It doesn't sound like there's any glaring contradictions in her testimony just now...)Mia:\nI warned you earlier that she would not crack so easily. The only way to make her is to...Phoenix:\n...Keep on the offensive and not let up.Mia:\nThe only way you're going to catch her is with some very strong, decisive evidence...Phoenix:\n(I have to find something! I just have to! ...For Maya's sake...)Phoenix:\nYou testified that you knocked the flower vase over. Is this correct?Andrews:\nYes.Phoenix:\nAnd are you sure it fell onto the guitar case?Andrews:\nI-Is there some problem with what I said...?Phoenix:\nIt's not \"some\" problem, it's a \"major\" problem. It's true that the top of the guitar case was wet with water. However, that's exactly what is so strange! Ms. Andrews! You testified that the vase fell onto the guitar case! However! If that was true, the case should have gotten wet on the inside, not the outside!Judge:\nTh-That's very true!Phoenix:\nFurthermore, there is one other strange thing about this guitar case.Judge:\nAnd wh-what is that?Phoenix:\nLet's take another look at the crime scene photo. The remains of the vase are scattered on the floor.Judge:\nAnd what is wrong with that?Phoenix:\nIf the guitar case was open when the vase fell... The glass shards should be INSIDE, not outside the case!Andrews:\nAh!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWhat is your point, Wright!? That the case was closed at the time the vase was knocked over? Is that all!?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo. Think back to what Ms. Andrews testified to! She said that other than the vase, she didn't touch anything else!Edgeworth:\nNngh...Judge:\nYes, that's right... She did implicitly say she didn't touch the guitar case!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nBut... But this whole matter with the guitar case is a dead end! The bright red guitar was found at the studio! It has no bearing on this case at all!Phoenix:\n... That may very well be, however... (Argh, the empty guitar case does seem to have no relation to this case, doesn't it...) (Changed from [An empty guitar case does seem to have no relation to this case...] in the original release)Judge:\nHmm... It seems that there is no deeper meaning to the guitar case.

Well, maybe...\nPhoenix:\n... Why did you open the guitar case?\nAndrews:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida's dead body was right there in front of you, wasn't it? I would think that the first thing you would do is call for help, not open a guitar case.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs the witness has said multiple times, when she found the dead body, she was \"dazed\".\nJudge:\nHmm...\nAndrews:\nMaybe I...

That you put your gloves back on, just to open the guitar case!?Andrews:\nUgn!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!Mia:\nLooks like you hit the nail on the head this time.Phoenix:\n...? What do you mean?Mia:\nI believe that guitar case plays a very important role here.Phoenix:\nBut it's just an empty case...Mia:\nI wonder if it really was empty though...Phoenix:\nB-But the guitar... The bright red guitar was at the studio!Mia:\nPhoenix, drop all of your presumptions. What was in the guitar case was not the bright red guitar.Phoenix:\n(You don't mean... it was a bright WHITE guitar!? Wait, that's not right either...)Judge:\nHmm, I admit it would be unnatural for someone to do that. So the witness was not wearing gloves, despite the fact that on the case...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nYour Honor, this is obviously the defense's usual misdirection tactic at work. Steer the court towards an unrelated topic, and lull us all into his misguided...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor! Please recall that Ms. Andrews had testified that the vase \"fell onto the guitar case\"! Which means that the case was closed when the crime took place! However, it is wide open in this photo of the crime scene! I am sure this guitar case has some relation to the murder!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nIf you are so sure, Wright, then I'm sure you can somehow substantiate your outrageous claim, correct!? Please, enlighten us as to why that guitar case has anything at all to do with this murder!Phoenix:\nUh...Judge:\nCan you do that, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\nUm, well... Let's suppose for a second... That the bright red guitar was not the only thing that could have been in the case...Judge:\nThe bright red guitar not being the only thing...? Y-You don't mean to suggest that a bright BLACK guitar was inside the--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nSo, you intend to push your theory that the case was not empty!? Is that it, Wright!?Phoenix:\nI wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!Edgeworth:\nDeflate that head of yours! You haven't proven anything yet! Now then, let's have it. What was inside this case at the time of the murder!?Present The Nickel Samurai or Lotta's Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Th-This is... This is a photograph...!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why would something like that be inside a guitar case, let alone this one?\nJudge:\nWhy, Mr. Wright, why?\nPhoenix:\nWell... I just thought it might have been possible...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have a suggestion. Why don't you put that in the void where your brain is supposed to be!\nJudge:\nYes, and never bring it out again!\nPhoenix:\n(Can't a foolishly foolish fool get some love...?)\nEdgeworth:\nDo you still think you can prove your theory? Can you prove that the guitar case was not empty at the time of the murder?\nLeads back to:\n\"I wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!\"Judge:\nTh-This is... This is a photograph...!Phoenix:\nYes, but what is important is what is in that picture, Your Honor.Judge:\nI-In this picture...?Phoenix:\nIt doesn't take a genius to see what I mean! What I am proposing is... Inside the guitar case was the Nickel Samurai! The hero's very own costume!Edgeworth:\nWh-What!?Judge:\nM-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!Edgeworth:\nWright! Are you saying that the witness opened the guitar case to take out a costume!? What insane point would there be to doing something like that!?Phoenix:\nThat insane point would be to wear the costume, of course. Ms. Andrews put it on to hide her identity so she could make her escape. After all, you couldn't let anyone see you leave, could you, Ms. Andrews?Andrews:\n...!Edgeworth:\nI-I refuse to accept your theory! Do you have anything to support such a preposterous idea!?Phoenix:\nJust outside the door was an investigative photographer who was starving for a big scoop. And in the end, she managed to get this shot, correct?Judge:\nYou... You mean this photo!? Order! Ordeeeer! It looks like we've wandered into quite another mess again, haven't we...?Mia:\nNice job, Phoenix.Phoenix:\nWell, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later!Judge:\nHmm... So the real murderer was hiding inside a costume...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nW-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!?Judge:\nHmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...?It was stolen from Engarde.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI think it may have been stolen from Mr. Engarde...\nJudge:\nS-Stolen!? But why would someone do such a thing!?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe the thief wanted to interfere with the post-ceremony stage show.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nAnd so, if he didn't have his costume, then Mr. Engarde would be forced to go naked!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe YOU should be stripped naked and run out for making a mockery of this court!\nPhoenix:\nE-EXCUSE ME!?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Matt Engarde did not take his costume off after the award ceremony! He even testified that he took a nap while still wearing his costume! Is this not correct!?\nPhoenix:\n... Ah, yeah, he did say something like that, didn't he?\nJudge:\n*sigh* That's what I thought. Let's try that one more time, shall we, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts.\"It was a spare costume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period...\"Phoenix:\nMr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a spare one.Edgeworth:\nWhat...?Judge:\nThen... are you saying that on the night of the murder... there were TWO Nickel Samurai costumes at the Gatewater Hotel!?Phoenix:\nYes, that is what I am saying.Judge:\nAnd how do you explain the costume that was inside the guitar case...?Edgeworth:\nIt would mean that the victim himself had brought this spare to the ceremony on purpose! (Changed from [It would mean that the victim himself had planned to bring this spare to the ceremony!] in the original release)Judge:\nBut... But why!? The victim, Mr. Corrida, was the Jammin' Ninja. Why would he secretly bring the Nickel Samurai's spare costume with him...? What could be the reason behind such a peculiar act?Phoenix:\n... And therein lies the sticking point... (Changed from [... Ah, so that's what he intended...] in the original release)Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWh-What are you mumbling to yourself about now!? Have you just been rambling all this time without any sense of inner monologue!?Phoenix:\nHuh!? N-No, I just...Judge:\nMr. Wright, please explain yourself! Why do you think the victim had the Nickel Samurai's spare costume!?Mia:\nPhoenix... Are you sure you can explain this one? Think carefully before you answer... And then answer with gusto! I believe in you!Phoenix:\nAlright. This is what I think. The reason the victim brought the Nickel Samurai's spare costume to the hotel was...Present Press Conference Ticket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"What is this...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nMia:\nPhoenix! What are you doing!? Are you crazy!?\nPhoenix:\nI... I, uh... I presented the evidence with gusto, just like you said!\nMia:\nI told you to present it with gusto, yes... But I seem to recall the sentence before that was, \"Think carefully\"!\nPhoenix:\n*gulp*\nJudge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nAh, sorry...\nMia:\nThis one is pretty tough. I really think you should look carefully at the Court Record. And then search through your memories! The answer is there, I know you'll find it!\nJudge:\nNow then. Are you ready to try again, Mr. Wright? Minus the wrong evidence this time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Alright. This is what I think.\"Judge:\nWhat is this...?Phoenix:\nOn the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special press conference.Judge:\nA press conference...?Phoenix:\nYes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something at this conference.Edgeworth:\nI heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright.Phoenix:\nBut what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had no idea he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night.Andrews:\n...Judge:\nBut how can that be!?Phoenix:\nThe way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida himself!Judge:\nTh-The victim?Phoenix:\nYes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the \"Nickel Samurai\"!Judge:\nHe was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!?Phoenix:\nThat's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is what he intended to reveal at that conference.Edgeworth:\nThe Nickel Samurai was going to \"confess\" something. And by \"confess\", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about \"himself\".Phoenix:\nWhich means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about Matt Engarde!Judge:\nYes, I guess that is what it would mean...Edgeworth:\nBut, if that's the case... that's not a \"confession\"! That's \"public disclosure\"!Andrews:\nHmph.Judge:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?Andrews:\nI can see why you are pros at what you do.Judge:\nPardon me?Andrews:\nYes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan.Judge:\nMs. Andrews!

Well, you see...\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure you are the one who opened the guitar case?\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...\nMia:\nShe's... She's waiting for someone to tell her if she should answer or not...\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like her dependent side is taking over...) (Changed from [Her 'co-dependency' is coming through, huh...?] in the original release)\nJudge:\nWell, Ms. Andrews...?\nAndrews:\nY...Yes, it was me...Andrews:\nI suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you opened the guitar case then?\nAndrews:\nY-Yes... Well, maybe...\nPhoenix:\n... Why did you open the guitar case?\nAndrews:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida's dead body was right there in front of you, wasn't it? I would think that the first thing you would do is call for help, not open a guitar case.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs the witness has said multiple times, when she found the dead body, she was \"dazed\".\nJudge:\nHmm...\nAndrews:\nMaybe I... Maybe I was curious to know if the bright red guitar was alright or not. I thought, \"Maybe the criminal took it.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Why would she care about the bright red guitar...?)\nAndrews:\nBut, getting back on topic...Present Guitar Case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way you were the one who opened the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nWhy would you say that!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's elementary, my dear. Because the only fingerprints on this guitar case are those of the victim!\nAndrews:\nAh!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\n... You shouldn't assume that I must have left prints just because I touched the case.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nAndrews:\nWhat if I were to tell you that I was wearing gloves at the time?\nJudge:\nGloves...? But why would you be wearing gloves at the time?\nAndrews:\nIt was the night of the award ceremony. So of course I dressed up for the occasion. Yes, now I remember... I'm almost sure I was wearing a pair of thin gloves.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see... Well, Mr. Wright. It seems the witness was wearing gloves at the scene of the crime.\n\n\n\nNothing strange about that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHmm, I guess so... And I guess that makes sense.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. You're the epitome of a half-baked idea.\nAndrews:\nA brain is to be used, not to look pretty for med students carving cadavers.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like I need to bake my thoughts just a little longer...)\nEdgeworth:\nNow, if the defense has no further objections, let's return to the testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nThat's strange...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were wearing gloves...?

Before you hurt yourself, that is.\nPhoenix:\n(Hurt myself...!?)\nJudge:\nIt's alright, Mr. Wright. You don't have to push yourself so hard.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I was trying a little too hard there...)\nEdgeworth:\nNow, if the defense has no further objections, let's return to the testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examinationAndrews:\nIt's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas it really empty?\nAndrews:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nI was just wondering if maybe when you opened the case, the guitar was still inside.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHow long have you been a lawyer, Mr. Wright!? Have a little professionalism. The bright red guitar was found at the studio. These trials would be over in half the time if you would just pay attention.\nJudge:\nYes, pay more attention, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nSorry...Present Guitar Case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way you were the one who opened the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nWhy would you say that!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's elementary, my dear.

We can't afford to let up on her now.Phoenix:\nI wasn't planning on letting up, but...Mia:\nShe's at her weakest now, so this is our chance!Phoenix:\n(Yeah, if we had a weapon to hit her with...)Mia:\nI'm sure a weapon is hiding somewhere in the Court Record, waiting to be found.Phoenix:\nI have your proof right here. This wine glass.Andrews:\nThe wine glass?Phoenix:\nYou left your fingerprints very clearly on this wine glass.Andrews:\nAh...Phoenix:\nEven if you took your gloves off when you poured yourself this glass of juice, wouldn't you think it was just a little strange... That you put your gloves back on, just to open the guitar case!?Andrews:\nUgn!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!Mia:\nLooks like you hit the nail on the head this time.Phoenix:\n...? What do you mean?Mia:\nI believe that guitar case plays a very important role here.Phoenix:\nBut it's just an empty case...Mia:\nI wonder if it really was empty though...Phoenix:\nB-But the guitar... The bright red guitar was at the studio!Mia:\nPhoenix, drop all of your presumptions. What was in the guitar case was not the bright red guitar.Phoenix:\n(You don't mean... it was a bright WHITE guitar!? Wait, that's not right either...)Judge:\nHmm, I admit it would be unnatural for someone to do that. So the witness was not wearing gloves, despite the fact that on the case...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nYour Honor, this is obviously the defense's usual misdirection tactic at work. Steer the court towards an unrelated topic, and lull us all into his misguided...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor! Please recall that Ms. Andrews had testified that the vase \"fell onto the guitar case\"! Which means that the case was closed when the crime took place! However, it is wide open in this photo of the crime scene! I am sure this guitar case has some relation to the murder!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nIf you are so sure, Wright, then I'm sure you can somehow substantiate your outrageous claim, correct!? Please, enlighten us as to why that guitar case has anything at all to do with this murder!Phoenix:\nUh...Judge:\nCan you do that, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\nUm, well... Let's suppose for a second... That the bright red guitar was not the only thing that could have been in the case...Judge:\nThe bright red guitar not being the only thing...? Y-You don't mean to suggest that a bright BLACK guitar was inside the--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nSo, you intend to push your theory that the case was not empty!? Is that it, Wright!?Phoenix:\nI wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!Edgeworth:\nDeflate that head of yours! You haven't proven anything yet! Now then, let's have it. What was inside this case at the time of the murder!?Present The Nickel Samurai or Lotta's Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Th-This is... This is a photograph...!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why would something like that be inside a guitar case, let alone this one?\nJudge:\nWhy, Mr. Wright, why?\nPhoenix:\nWell... I just thought it might have been possible...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have a suggestion. Why don't you put that in the void where your brain is supposed to be!\nJudge:\nYes, and never bring it out again!\nPhoenix:\n(Can't a foolishly foolish fool get some love...?)\nEdgeworth:\nDo you still think you can prove your theory? Can you prove that the guitar case was not empty at the time of the murder?\nLeads back to:\n\"I wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!\"Judge:\nTh-This is... This is a photograph...!Phoenix:\nYes, but what is important is what is in that picture, Your Honor.Judge:\nI-In this picture...?Phoenix:\nIt doesn't take a genius to see what I mean! What I am proposing is... Inside the guitar case was the Nickel Samurai! The hero's very own costume!Edgeworth:\nWh-What!?Judge:\nM-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!Edgeworth:\nWright! Are you saying that the witness opened the guitar case to take out a costume!? What insane point would there be to doing something like that!?Phoenix:\nThat insane point would be to wear the costume, of course. Ms. Andrews put it on to hide her identity so she could make her escape. After all, you couldn't let anyone see you leave, could you, Ms. Andrews?Andrews:\n...!Edgeworth:\nI-I refuse to accept your theory! Do you have anything to support such a preposterous idea!?Phoenix:\nJust outside the door was an investigative photographer who was starving for a big scoop. And in the end, she managed to get this shot, correct?Judge:\nYou... You mean this photo!? Order! Ordeeeer! It looks like we've wandered into quite another mess again, haven't we...?Mia:\nNice job, Phoenix.Phoenix:\nWell, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later!Judge:\nHmm... So the real murderer was hiding inside a costume...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nW-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!?Judge:\nHmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...?It was stolen from Engarde.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI think it may have been stolen from Mr. Engarde...\nJudge:\nS-Stolen!? But why would someone do such a thing!?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe the thief wanted to interfere with the post-ceremony stage show.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nAnd so, if he didn't have his costume, then Mr. Engarde would be forced to go naked!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe YOU should be stripped naked and run out for making a mockery of this court!\nPhoenix:\nE-EXCUSE ME!?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Matt Engarde did not take his costume off after the award ceremony! He even testified that he took a nap while still wearing his costume! Is this not correct!?\nPhoenix:\n... Ah, yeah, he did say something like that, didn't he?\nJudge:\n*sigh* That's what I thought. Let's try that one more time, shall we, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts.\"It was a spare costume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period...\"Phoenix:\nMr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a spare one.Edgeworth:\nWhat...?Judge:\nThen... are you saying that on the night of the murder... there were TWO Nickel Samurai costumes at the Gatewater Hotel!?Phoenix:\nYes, that is what I am saying.Judge:\nAnd how do you explain the costume that was inside the guitar case...?Edgeworth:\nIt would mean that the victim himself had brought this spare to the ceremony on purpose! (Changed from [It would mean that the victim himself had planned to bring this spare to the ceremony!] in the original release)Judge:\nBut... But why!? The victim, Mr. Corrida, was the Jammin' Ninja. Why would he secretly bring the Nickel Samurai's spare costume with him...? What could be the reason behind such a peculiar act?Phoenix:\n... And therein lies the sticking point... (Changed from [... Ah, so that's what he intended...] in the original release)Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWh-What are you mumbling to yourself about now!? Have you just been rambling all this time without any sense of inner monologue!?Phoenix:\nHuh!? N-No, I just...Judge:\nMr. Wright, please explain yourself! Why do you think the victim had the Nickel Samurai's spare costume!?Mia:\nPhoenix... Are you sure you can explain this one? Think carefully before you answer... And then answer with gusto! I believe in you!Phoenix:\nAlright. This is what I think. The reason the victim brought the Nickel Samurai's spare costume to the hotel was...Present Press Conference Ticket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"What is this...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nMia:\nPhoenix! What are you doing!? Are you crazy!?\nPhoenix:\nI... I, uh... I presented the evidence with gusto, just like you said!\nMia:\nI told you to present it with gusto, yes... But I seem to recall the sentence before that was, \"Think carefully\"!\nPhoenix:\n*gulp*\nJudge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nAh, sorry...\nMia:\nThis one is pretty tough. I really think you should look carefully at the Court Record. And then search through your memories! The answer is there, I know you'll find it!\nJudge:\nNow then. Are you ready to try again, Mr. Wright? Minus the wrong evidence this time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Alright. This is what I think.\"Judge:\nWhat is this...?Phoenix:\nOn the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special press conference.Judge:\nA press conference...?Phoenix:\nYes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something at this conference.Edgeworth:\nI heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright.Phoenix:\nBut what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had no idea he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night.Andrews:\n...Judge:\nBut how can that be!?Phoenix:\nThe way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida himself!Judge:\nTh-The victim?Phoenix:\nYes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the \"Nickel Samurai\"!Judge:\nHe was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!?Phoenix:\nThat's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is what he intended to reveal at that conference.Edgeworth:\nThe Nickel Samurai was going to \"confess\" something. And by \"confess\", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about \"himself\".Phoenix:\nWhich means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about Matt Engarde!Judge:\nYes, I guess that is what it would mean...Edgeworth:\nBut, if that's the case... that's not a \"confession\"! That's \"public disclosure\"!Andrews:\nHmph.Judge:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?Andrews:\nI can see why you are pros at what you do.Judge:\nPardon me?Andrews:\nYes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan.Judge:\nMs. Andrews! Please offer us an explanation for this!Andrews:\nI was the one he asked to help set it up. And the person who prepared the second costume for him... That was also me.Judge:\nYou...!?Andrews:\nJuan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway.Judge:\nHe was going to ruin him, huh...?Andrews:\nIt looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Judge:\nAnd do you know what this \"secret\" of Mr. Engarde's is, Ms. Andrews...?Andrews:\n... That's something only Juan knew. I... I don't know what it is.Judge:\nAh... I see.Edgeworth:\n...Andrews:\nI... I've probably been coming off quite suspicious to everyone, but that's to be expected.

She's unharmed, right!????:\nWell... When I checked on her earlier this morning, she seemed a bit, how shall we say, tired.Phoenix:\n...!???:\nDon't worry. People don't die that easily. Besides, what you really should be concentrating on, is winning today's trial.Phoenix:\nG...Grrrr...???:\nFor my sake, as well as yours, you must win today's trial. (Changed from [For myself, you must win today's trial.] in the original release) Which is why... I sent you a little present this morning.Phoenix:\nPresent? What in the world would you want to give me!????:\nYou'll figure it out once the trial starts... And even if you don't \"like\" my gift...

I, Miles Edgeworth, will be taking her place. The prosecution is ready... naturally.Edgeworth:\nMs. von Karma was shot in her right shoulder, and is currently undergoing surgery. Luckily, I have looked this case over and am familiar with the details. The prosecution seeks to prove the guilt of Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge:\nTh-The court acknowledges the prosecution.Edgeworth:\n...Wright. I finally found the answer I was struggling for on my long journey this past year. By the time this case comes to an end, you too, will know the answer.Phoenix:\n...!Edgeworth:\nNow then, the prosecution would like to call its first witness... Please bring Detective Gumshoe to the witness stand!Edgeworth:\nWitness, your name and occupation.Gumshoe:\nMy name's Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm a detective down at the precinct... for now.Judge:\n\"For now\"...?Gumshoe:\nAfter this trial's over... I'm supposed to turn in my badge, sir.Phoenix:\n(D-Detective Gumshoe...)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution has no need for a depressed witness. Lift your head up and face forward like a proud officer, Detective Dick Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!Edgeworth:\nNow, let's have your testimony. If we want to explore the various facets of this case, we must start with that.Mia:\nGet ready, Phoenix. This is going to be one very rough fight.Phoenix:\nYeah... It would have to be with Edgeworth as my opponent.  (The answer he was \"struggling\" for... Interesting... Show me this \"answer\" you finally found, Edgeworth...)Witness Testimony-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:\nHmm... After the award ceremony ended, the victim was alone in his room...?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! Both the victim and defendant went alone to their rooms, sir.Judge:\nI see. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you please give us a brief timeline of what happened after the ceremony?\nGumshoe:\nOK, pal. The ceremony started at 6 PM. It ended around 8 PM... and then there was a short break. A special post-ceremony show was supposed to start in the lobby 30 minutes later.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when the victim's body was found, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nWhich is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period.\nJudge:\nHmm... Please continue with your testimony, Detective.Gumshoe:\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe person who discovered the victim's body was Adrian Andrews, correct?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Adrian Andrews\" you're talking about?\nGumshoe:\nShe's the defendant, Matt Engarde's, manager. She's a really pretty lady... sir.\nJudge:\nAh, so she's a pretty lady... I wonder if she will grace us with her presence...\nGumshoe:\nWhen the post-ceremony show was about to start, she went to get Mr. Engarde. After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir.\nJudge:\nI see... And that's when she found the victim's body...Gumshoe:\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana.\nJudge:\nMmm... \"Banana\"...\nGumshoe:\nUm, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir.\nJudge:\nAh, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana.\nPhoenix:\nThen, what about the knife...?\nGumshoe:\nIt seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death.\nJudge:\nHmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death...

The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...\nGuitar Case updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...Gumshoe:\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat convinced you it had nothing to do with the case?\nGumshoe:\nThe guitar wasn't at the Gatewater Hotel that night.\nJudge:\nWell then, where was it?\nGumshoe:\nThe bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir.\nJudge:\nSo you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar.\nPhoenix:\nSo that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all.\nJudge:\nHmm...Mia:\nOur first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.Phoenix:\nBut there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...Mia:\nMaybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.Phoenix:\nIf you say so...Mia:\nOf course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?After pressing third, fourth and fifth statements:Edgeworth:\nI believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWhich brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.Phoenix:\n(Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)Judge:\nVery well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Judge:\nHmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.Gumshoe:\nIt was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.Knife added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\n...And there's this button.Judge:\nThat was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?Gumshoe:\nYes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Jammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAll of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?Edgeworth:\nYes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?Phoenix:\nHmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!Edgeworth:\nYou can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.Phoenix:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Cross Examination-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown.\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end...\nJudge:\nThat is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing.\nEdgeworth:\n...Gumshoe:\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls!\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah, I guess, but...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all!\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUm, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired.\nGumshoe:\nEh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's...\nEdgeworth:\nI look forward to your pension negotiations.\nGumshoe:\nN-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony.\nGumshoe:\n*sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too...\nEdgeworth:\nDetective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)Gumshoe:\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any proof that button belonged to the victim?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nOh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\".\nGumshoe:\nHuh? But can't you tell by just looking at it?\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nA-And the victim's blood is on it.\nPhoenix:\nAnyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward.\nGumshoe:\n... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Thread.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nThe button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal!\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nMia:\nThat's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.Gumshoe:\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhen was this button found?\nGumshoe:\nPretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder...\nEdgeworth:\nThe police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people...\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe:\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow were the fingerprints arranged on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nBy examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...?\nGumshoe:\nOh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe the bumbling of this department...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe:\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife!\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...)\nMia:\n...Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nThere's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"Phoenix:\n(A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)Mia:\nBe grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix:\nWe're still in a world of trouble...Mia:\nWell, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?Phoenix:\nWait a second!Gumshoe:\nWh-What?Phoenix:\nSo the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?Gumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The defendant...Phoenix:\n...Did not buy this knife.Gumshoe:\nH-Huh!?Phoenix:\nTake a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe:\n...Huh?Judge:\nIt has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...Gumshoe:\n\"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.Phoenix:\nThat's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.Gumshoe:\n... Uh oh.Phoenix:\nThe murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!Judge:\nYes, that is very true! This is a very big...Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...Judge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nI think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.Phoenix:\nH-How so!?Edgeworth:\nI admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.Gumshoe:\n...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*Edgeworth:\nThe question is... Where did this knife come from?Judge:\nWh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...Edgeworth:\nSorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.Judge:\nThere is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?Edgeworth:\nIf it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.Phoenix:\nUrk...Edgeworth:\nMr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.Judge:\nAmazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.Mia:\nIt seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...Phoenix:\n(This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)Judge:\nA murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.Edgeworth:\nI can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.Phoenix:\n(Evidence not yet shown...?)Mia:\nHe means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.Judge:\nWhat does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nUm, well...Mia:\nPhoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...Phoenix:\n(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)Judge:\nMr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?Actually, I do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"No, not right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.)\nJudge:\nLooks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means this court is adjourned.\nMia:\nPhoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!)\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"Phoenix:\nThere's one...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nOne piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!Judge:\nMr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.Edgeworth:\nWhat the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.Phoenix:\n(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)Judge:\nYou may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?Present Wine Glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong.\nJudge:\nI can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nI am a man of my word, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penaltyJudge:\nThis... is a wine glass, is it not?Phoenix:\nPlease look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... Well, yes, I see your point.Phoenix:\nHowever! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!Judge:\n...Gumshoe:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nW-Well? What do you all have to say...?Judge:\nAh, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...Phoenix:\nY-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!Judge:\nYou can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nWhat is it, Your Honor?Judge:\nYour opinion...Edgeworth:\n...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.Phoenix:\n...What!?Edgeworth:\nIt's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.Judge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)It's possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...)\nMia:\nYou can't think like that, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nRight now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(So in other words, push as far as we can go...)\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"There's no way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!)\nMia:\nThey just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough!\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"Phoenix:\nThe defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!Judge:\nHmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?Phoenix:\n(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)Edgeworth:\nUnlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Edgeworth:\nYou're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?Phoenix:\nTh-Then...Edgeworth:\nOf course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.Phoenix:\nFingerprints...Edgeworth:\nThere were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.Judge:\nOnly one? Well, whose were they!?Edgeworth:\nThey were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nThat is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)Edgeworth:\nMs. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.Phoenix:\nGrrr!Edgeworth:\nI've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!Judge:\nW-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...Edgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.Phoenix:\n\"Another witness\"...?Edgeworth:\nYes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!Mia:\nWhat in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?Edgeworth:\nNow then, witness, please state your name and occupation...Oldbag:\n...Edgeworth:\n... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Edgeworth:\nUurrngh!Oldbag:\n...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!Edgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Phoenix:\n(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)Oldbag:\nOh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!Edgeworth:\nI saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?Oldbag:\nI tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.Judge:\nMs... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nOof!Oldbag:\nShush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!Judge:\nYes, madam.Edgeworth:\nNo no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.Oldbag:\nIt's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?Edgeworth:\nThe witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag:\nIt was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!Judge:\nYou mean... You were a fan of the victim?Oldbag:\nLook, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!Phoenix:\n(Um... But those two were the same age...)Oldbag:\nAnyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.Edgeworth:\nVery well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.Oldbag:\nLeave it to me, Edgey-poo!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Judge:\nHmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...Oldbag:\nSee! It has to be him! He's the murderer!Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what was your post on that night?\nOldbag:\nThe lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...)\nOldbag:\nBesides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?Oldbag:\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSomething you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that?\nOldbag:\nIt's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course.\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Gossip\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nIf this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony.\nMia:\nIt looks like we shouldn't force it right now.\nJudge:\nHmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?Oldbag:\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room?\nOldbag:\nI have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am!\nJudge:\n...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?Oldbag:\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho in the world was that!?\nOldbag:\nI'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was...\nJudge:\nYes...? He was...?\nOldbag:\n... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...)\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.Oldbag:\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get a sense of déjà vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release))\n\n\n\nThe person's face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's face in more detail!\nOldbag:\nYou don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth!\nPhoenix:\nHis teeth were... shining?\nOldbag:\nWell, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie.\nPhoenix:\n... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!?\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the person was carrying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was the man you saw carrying?\nOldbag:\nIn which hand? His right or his left?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nAh, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand?\nOldbag:\nAh, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand.\nPhoenix:\nThen how about his left?\nOldbag:\nEmpty.\nPhoenix:\n... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...

Really, as if something like that matters.\nPhoenix:\nBut it does.\nOldbag:\nUm... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat thing?\nOldbag:\nThat gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...)\nOldbag:\nThat thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!!\nPhoenix:\nUm, right...\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nDon't you see it, Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! I request what the witness said about the jacket be appended to her testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't quite see where you're going with this, but alright. Witness, please...\nOldbag:\nAh well, I don't like to badmouth anyone without reason, but if I must...\nAdds statement \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I'm going to have to press a little harder on this one... There's got to be some sort of huge contradiction I can find here...)Oldbag:\nHe was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure the defendant was wearing a racing jacket?\nOldbag:\nWhat do you think? It's not like I've seen him in anything other than that horrible thing. I'm sure he was wearing it!\nPhoenix:\n(She is so sure of herself that it's to the point of self-absorption...)Present Jammin' Ninja's Button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag...\"Mia:\nShe may not remember things or be mistaken here and there, but I don't think she's lying.Phoenix:\nThat's bad for us. Really bad.Mia:\nBut, that's how the human mind is. It also has the tendency to jump off-topic. She's strayed onto a few interesting side-topics this time too, hasn't she? But that's what makes her a sweet old lady, right?Phoenix:\n(That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag...Oldbag:\nWhat!? Don't say my name for no reason!Phoenix:\nDo you know what this is?Oldbag:\nAaaah! It's button number 2 on the Jammin' Ninja's costume!Phoenix:\n(Now I KNOW she's an obsessed fan... She identified it in a single glance!)Oldbag:\nGive it here! Give it here! If you don't give it to me, I'll punish you with this!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Phoenix:\n(Wow... She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.Oldbag:\nSee! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!Phoenix:\nIt was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.Oldbag:\nSee! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!Phoenix:\n...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his \"usual racing jacket\"!?Oldbag:\n... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nNow hold your tongue still there for one second! So what you saw in actuality, was not Mr. Engarde, the man... but Mr. Engarde, the Nickel Samurai!?Oldbag:\nBut when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!Oldbag:\nEdgey-poo! Do you think so too?Edgeworth:\nWell, it might be something worth considering. (Changed from [Well, it might be something worth thinking about.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nJust say, \"It's important\" and agree with me for a change!Judge:\nWitness! Think carefully and try to remember as much as you can before you testify!Oldbag:\n*sigh* Alright, if you insist.Phoenix:\n(I should be the one sighing, not you!)Witness Testimony-- Who I Saw --Oldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Phoenix:\nI... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!Oldbag:\nWhat? Did you think there could've been someone else inside that costume? Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.Phoenix:\nBut... But the possibility does exist!Oldbag:\nAh, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.Judge:\nH-How do you know that?Oldbag:\nBecause... I said so. And what I say is the truth.Phoenix:\n(At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)Judge:\nMr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- Who I Saw --Oldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you please get on with your testimony!\nOldbag:\nHmph! Watch your language, young man! What sort of tone is that to take with an elder! My youthfulness isn't what it used to be, so you should forgive me for everything! If you keep on barking at me like that, I'll start singing at the top of my lungs!\nPhoenix:\nUh, what?\nOldbag:\n\"A striking figure by the sea, standing all alone is he. He's the Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n(...She's actually singing... Someone help my poor ears.)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Can you please do something about this racket!?\nEdgeworth:\nWitness. I'll give you a piece of gum later if you'll be good and stick to just the facts.\nOldbag:\nOKAAAAAAAY! ... You promise, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I'll be sending the bill for the chewing gum to your office at a later date.\nPhoenix:\n(Remind me to send you a thank you note later too, Edgeworth, old chum...)Oldbag:\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBe a little more careful with your testimony, please! Not too long ago, you said he was wearing his \"racing jacket\", and now he's not!?\nOldbag:\n\"Not too long ago\"...? Then let me ask you this! When you were itty-bitty, what was your grand dream?\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nOldbag:\nWhat did you want to be when you grew up, whippersnapper!?\nPhoenix:\nMy dream, huh...? Well, I... uh, wanted to be Judge Wackner, hero of the Public's Court. So what!?\nOldbag:\nSee! And look at where you are now! You're not Judge Wackner, are you!? Are you!?\nPhoenix:\nWell...\nOldbag:\n\"What I said earlier\"... Who puts any weight into things like that!? The \"now\" is everything! I can't be held responsible for the \"past\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did court become theatrics over testimonies?)\nOldbag:\nAll that matters is that man was inside that costume. Isn't that enough!?Oldbag:\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why would that be?\nOldbag:\nThat way, no one could see his face, of course!\nPhoenix:\nBut there's still no advantage for him that I can see. In fact, you would think the costume would make him stand out all the more!\nOldbag:\n... You are such a annoying child, you know that? You disagree with everything I say...\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that what YOU'RE always doing to me!?)\nOldbag:\nI got it! Maybe it was more troublesome for him to change in and out of his costume!Oldbag:\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas there anyone else scheduled to appear at the post-ceremony show?\nOldbag:\nWell, all the contestants were supposed to go onstage in a friendly gesture thing.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that included the Jammin' Ninja...?\nOldbag:\nOf course it included him! That's why when Engarde came out of dear Juan's room, I didn't give it a second thought.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nOldbag:\nWell, anyway.Oldbag:\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo let me ask you one last time. The person you saw, it really was the Nickel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nAs showy as ever. Haven't I been saying that from the very beginning!?\nPhoenix:\n(Can I throw in the towel yet?)Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Please take a look at this.\"Phoenix:\nHmm...Mia:\nYou don't need to think too hard on this one.Phoenix:\nHuh?Mia:\nThere's a contradiction in her testimony and it's sitting in plain sight. The question is what that contradiction means for us...Phoenix:\n(Well, I have to figure out what you're talking about first, but OK...)Phoenix:\nPlease take a look at this.Oldbag:\nYeah, so, it's a knife. Big deal. If you're trying to scare me with that, I'll have you know it won't work!Phoenix:\nNo no, that's not my intention at all...Judge:\nThat's the knife that was used in the murder, correct?Phoenix:\nYour Honor. Do you know why this piece of evidence is important to this case?Judge:\nYou don't even have to ask. It's because the defendant's fingerprints are on it.Edgeworth:\n... Is that what you're driving at...?Phoenix:\nThat is exactly what I am driving at.Judge:\nWhat are we driving at? And whose car are we driving?Phoenix:\nIf Mr. Engarde was really in the Nickel Samurai costume at the time of the murder, then it's impossible for his fingerprints to have been left on this knife! Actually, he would have wiped all previous fingerprints on this knife right off!Judge:\nOh, that's right! The Nickel Samurai wears gloves, doesn't he?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHe probably took his gloves off before he began the stabbing!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nAnd why would he do something like that? To leave his prints on the murder weapon? There is no way he would do something like that!Edgeworth:\nHowever, there is one possibility!Phoenix:\nThen let's hear your \"possibility\"!Edgeworth:\nIt's very simple. The defendant went to the victim's room while in costume as the Nickel Samurai. At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder. He was probably just going to relax and talk with the victim about the stage show. Which is why he took his gloves off!Judge:\nHmm... But the murder still did take place...Edgeworth:\nIt's well known that there was bad blood between the defendant and the victim. (Changed from [It's well known that the defendant and the victim had bad blood between them.] in the original release)Judge:\nHmm, yes... I have heard that before... (Changed from [Hmm, yes... I have heard of that...] in the original release) Well, Mr. Wright? What do you have to say about Mr. Edgeworth's theory...?Phoenix:\n(So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this: When the defendant went to the victim's room, he had no intentions of killing him. Now, up to this point, are there any problems with his theory...?)There are no problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... I can't see any real problems with his theory...)\nMia:\nBut if you let Edgeworth's theory stand, then we're one very large step closer to a guilty verdict. Look at the Court Record again and take another shot at it.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I just have to think about it one more time...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please make your decision soon.\nLeads back to:\n\"So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this:\"There is a contradiction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!\"Think about it one more time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I think I need a little more time on this one.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this:\"Phoenix:\nThis theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!Edgeworth:\nWh-What are you babbling about...?Phoenix:\nNow, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer. If that's the case, I think it's impossible for the killer to have gone to the victim's room without intent!Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nNaturally, you point to the one piece with the least value... but with such vigor! Enjoy your energy while you can. Humans don't live forever... Neither do lawyers.\nJudge:\nYou sure like to think you can bluff your way out of things, don't you?\nMia:\nPhoenix, pay attention! Let's pretend for a second that Mr. Engarde is the murderer. Now from that angle, if he didn't have a murderous intent from the very beginning, then that means there is a certain object that shouldn't be at the crime scene, right?\nPhoenix:\n(\"A certain thing\"...? What certain thing...?)\nEdgeworth:\nHow are you doing over there? Busy collecting your thoughts?\nPhoenix:\n(Alright, let's give this one more try... and with even more spirit this time!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer.\"Phoenix:\nThis knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.Judge:\nY-Yes, we did establish that.Phoenix:\nWhich means that if my client was, in fact, the killer... Then he brought this knife with him when he went to visit Mr. Corrida.Edgeworth:\nI suppose...Phoenix:\nHowever, you just said it yourself. \"At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder.\" If that were true, then why would he bring a knife!? He wouldn't, would he!?Edgeworth:\nHmm...Phoenix:\nWhich means, Mr. Edgeworth, your theory was flawed from supposition one! And one more thing! If the murderer was wearing the costume at the time of the murder... Then there should be glove marks left on the knife! Which means the defendant's fingerprints shouldn't be all over it like bees on a hive!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nAnd that brings me to my final point... This knife was planted by the real killer to hide their identity and mislead us!Judge:\nO-Order! Order, I say! Order in the court!! Was this knife really planted by the killer!? Why would the murderer do such a thing!?To hide the murder method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's to hide the way in which the murder was carried out, of course!\nEdgeworth:\nM-More of your nonsense!?\nPhoenix:\nTake another good look at the autopsy report! The victim actually died from strangulation! The killer tried to hide thisx by stabbing a knife into thex victim's chest!\nJudge:\nBut doesn't the autopsy admit that the cause of death was strangulation?\nPhoenix:\nWell, yes, the real cause of death was easily discovered...\nEdgeworth:\nThen I'd say the knife did a terrible job of \"concealing\" this fact!\nPhoenix:\n... Aha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that laugh doesn't do a very good job of concealing your error either!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! I will ask you one more time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Was this knife really planted by the killer!?\"To frame Matt Engarde.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"It's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!\"Phoenix:\nIt's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!Judge:\nTo frame...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nA-Aren't you forcing the interpretation just a little too hard on this one!?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut we just established that the witness saw the \"Nickel Samurai\" in costume, and if that were true, then there shouldn't be a single fingerprint on this knife!Edgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr! Witneeeeeesssssss!!Oldbag:\n... Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey-poo...? (Changed from [Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey...?] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nGnnnnngh...Judge:\nWitness, did you or did you not really see the Nickel Samurai?Oldbag:\nWell, I guess at first I might have forgotten, but...Phoenix:\nAre you saying you mixed up Mr. Engarde with the Nickel Samurai, his character on TV!?Oldbag:\nBut I mean, I can't really do anything about that now! (Changed from [But I mean, I can't really do anything about that!] in the original release) Look, I was waiting around in front of their doors because, well... Well, I wasn't waiting around for the Nickel Samurai, that's for sure!Phoenix:\n...! (She wasn't waiting for the \"Nickel Samurai\"...?) Alright then... Who were you waiting around for then?Oldbag:\n... Hmph! That's top secret to anyone outside of security!Judge:\nI have a feeling that you were waiting for Mr. Juan Corrida. Am I correct, witness?Oldbag:\nHa ha ha. The way you think, you are a sad amateur with a terrible case of near-sightedness.Judge:\nAmateur...? Me...? What am I an amateur of...?Phoenix:\n(So Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room... But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...)Mia:\nMaybe... Phoenix! Maybe the old bag was waiting around for \"that\" person!Phoenix:\n(Hmm, if it's who I think Mia's hinting at... It's certainly possible...) Ms. Oldbag. You were waiting for this person to come out of the victim's room, weren't you?Present Adrian Andrews profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Who is this person...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nMia:\nWhat are you talking about, Phoenix!? She could've waited until the next century and this would never have appeared!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch... Busted... Guess there's no fooling her.)\nJudge:\nYou two! What do you think you're doing flirting in my courtroom!?\nPhoenix:\nWe weren't doing anything like that... Honest... (Well, back to the drawing board on this one... Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room...)\nLeads back to:\n\"But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...\"Judge:\nWho is this person...?Phoenix:\nThis is Adrian Andrews, Mr. Engarde's manager.Judge:\nB-But why would the defendant's manager be in the victim's room...?Edgeworth:\nIt seems that this is the latest rumor in circulation, Your Honor.Judge:\n...Hmm... Oh... This is... Well, this is... Hmm, hmm... Hah, I see...Phoenix:\n(The judge seems to be really into the \"article\"... If it can be called such a thing...)Judge:\nThen this manager with the initials A. A.... Are you saying it's...?Edgeworth:\nAdrian Andrews. Without a doubt, the witness thought so as well.Oldbag:\n... Hmph. Looks like you found me out. Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole \"sworn to confidentiality stuff\" then. (Changed from [Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole sworn to confidentiality stuff.] in the original release)Judge:\nW-Witness...? What in the world are you...Mia:\nWatch out, Phoenix. I've got a bad feeling about this... A very bad feeling.Oldbag:\nI got some information... Some very secret information from a certain source. So that's why I was doing my own little investigation... In secret, of course.Judge:\nB-But what for...?Oldbag:\nOh, just for myself... Personal reasons and all that.Judge:\n... Well, Mr. Edgeworth. How will you proceed from here?Edgeworth:\nI really don't want to do this, however I cannot simply let this point slide.Judge:\nI see. Very well then. Witness, please testify about this \"secret information\".Oldbag:\nGet ready! This is going to take the wind out of you young'uns!Phoenix:\n(I'm sure we're all capable of handling this... Really, it's not like we're ten years old.)Witness Testimony-- Secret Information --Oldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!\nI cannot condone such dirty tricks! So I took action!\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?Judge:\nThe defendant sent his manager...? What a distasteful topic for this court!Oldbag:\nWhat!? Nobody's above gossip! And isn't there a saying!? \"The truth is never pleasant.\"Phoenix:\n(Never heard that one before...)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What about this Adrian Andrews person...?Edgeworth:\nWe have looked into this matter, and found that the \"truth\" the article proposes is, in fact, baseless gossip.Judge:\nHmm... But should this be true... Then this proves that the defendant did bear ill-will towards the victim.Phoenix:\n(...So this means I have to smash this rumor once and for all.)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Mia:\nBe careful. The old bag seems rather excited right now.Oldbag:\nThat's right! Engarde is nothing but your average foul-blooded youth!Phoenix:\n(Well, as the old saying goes... You've gotta burn old bags with fire! Time to fire up the afterburners and hit the highway to the danger zone!)Cross Examination-- Secret Information --Oldbag:\nThat Engarde is one evil, evil man!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou can't say something like that without proof! That's just slander!\nOldbag:\nBut it's true! That woman was getting intimate with poor Juan! Look! It says so right here, doesn't it!? \"Manager to the stars, Ms. A. A.!\"\nPhoenix:\nBut the name of the magazine this came from is \"Gossip Land\"...\nOldbag:\nWhat? Are you saying that \"gossip\" is all just a pack of lies? Hmph, what do you know? I suppose next you'll swear to me that the \"news\" is 100% truth!\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nHonestly, sonny. You can't discriminate between the news and gossip!\nJudge:\nYes, discrimination is bad, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Discriminate? When did I do anything like that?)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, Engarde will never get me to say \"touché\"!Oldbag:\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA scandal...? What do you mean by that?\nOldbag:\nYou're a dimwitted one, aren't you? I can't believe you don't know what a \"scandal\" is! Honestly, what are they teaching kids in middle school these days...?\nPhoenix:\nAh, no no! I wasn't asking what the word \"scandal\" means! Even I know that much!\nOldbag:\nWell! That Engarde thought he could own a monopoly on popularity!Oldbag:\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou don't have any proof that Mr. Engarde did any such thing!\nOldbag:\nYou must be suffering from shock; the shock of hearing the truth. And now, since you're in so much shock, you can't do anything right!\nPhoenix:\n(You're right, I can't do anything, but boy do I wish I could do something about you.)\nOldbag:\nAlright then, sonny, show me what you've got! Can you show me proof that Engarde didn't bear any ill-will towards Juan!?\n\n\n\nPresent evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm not going to let you push me around that easily!\nOldbag:\nHeh.

Tell him that no matter what he does, the only thing he's good at is failing.\nEdgeworth:\nUm... What she said, Wright! Or should I say... Baboon-boy!\nJudge:\nYes, I agree this isn't much of a piece of evidence... Baboon-boy.\nPhoenix:\n(Did I just gain a new nickname here...?)\nLeads to:\n\"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDecline the offer to present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...I don't have anything to offer.\nOldbag:\nSeeeeeee! Just as I thought.\nLeads to:\n\"And you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!\"\n\n\nOldbag:\nAnd you were lecturing me about saying things without proof!

So I took action!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you mean by \"I took action\"...?\nOldbag:\nLike I already told you, I was lying in wait close to the crime scene! Once that slimy woman came out of Juan's room... I was going to capture her, and teach her a good lesson. Something you young'uns need!\nJudge:\nYou were going to \"teach her a good lesson\"...?\nOldbag:\nI was going to make her eat the damaging beams of my ray gun! Like this!\nJudge:\nN-No, stop!\nOldbag:\nWell, it was too bad that woman didn't come through the door that night.Oldbag:\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!?

You'll get your reward.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I don't want your reward, but you don't leave me much of a choice...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness could have gotten her information from anywhere! It's even possible that it was spontaneously made up inside the witness's head!\nPhoenix:\n(And he lectures ME on \"reckless blabbering\"!?)\nJudge:\nAs long as we don't know where this information came from, it's quite a waste of time to focus on this line of questioning.\nPhoenix:\n(Where did Oldbag get her inside information...? There has to be something I can use to figure it out!)\nLeads back to corss-examination\n\n\n\n\nPresent evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo no one else is supposed to know this \"secret information\", correct? If that's true, then why do you know it, Ms. Oldbag...?\nOldbag:\nWh-Wh-Why are you looking at me like that...? Stop that!\nPhoenix:\nWitness! I hate to say it, but this is how you came to acquire your secret info, isn't it!? (Changed from [I'm sad to say it, but this is how you found out this secret, isn't it!?] in the original release)\n\n\n\nPresent Lotta's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou call that \"proof\"!? It looks more like proof of spite towards the witness! If you have nothing to back up your claims, then they are no more valid than \"gossip\"!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained. Witness, please feel free to ignore the defense's gesture of ill-will and continue.\nOldbag:\nOkie-dokie! See, nothing can get me down!\nPhoenix:\n(Great... That did nothing but set me back a few minutes of my life...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nWait and see\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I should probably think a bit more about this... I don't want to do anything rash... For now, maybe I should sit back and watch how things play out...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationMia:\nSounds like just another tidbit of gossip, doesn't it? But you can't just ignore it either. It makes your client look bad either way.Phoenix:\n(Well, I don't think I heard anything really out of the ordinary just now...)Mia:\nThere has to be something we can catch her on...Phoenix:\n(Yeah... And when I find it, I'm going to press the heck out of it...)Phoenix:\nThe \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...Judge:\nOh yes... I remember that mischievous girl.Phoenix:\nShe reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.Judge:\nShe reported such a thing...?Phoenix:\nOn that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.Oldbag:\nWh-What!? Outrageous ideas, you say!?Phoenix:\nNo no no, I said impressions.Oldbag:\nThen... Then...! Then everything written on this piece of paper is completely meaningless!?Phoenix:\nAh! That's it! That's the note!Oldbag:\nAh! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Noooo! You see, this is something completely different! This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!Judge:\nHmm, then you are the one who took Ms. Hart's note?Oldbag:\nI'm a huuuuuuuge fan of Juan's, that's why! That infamous, puffy-haired whippersnapper... She's working with that evil Engarde! She said so herself! \"En garde! I'm his sidekick!\" She was so happy, smiling like a silly duck. I was only checking what she had written!Phoenix:\n...Judge:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Oldbag:\n... Edgey-poo! You believe me, don't you!?Edgeworth:\nNngh...Oldbag:\nI was only trying to help out like the angel I am! It's only one little piece of paper! I've never taken anything else before!Edgeworth:\nYou really should come with a supply of cheese to match your vintage whine.Judge:\nWell, it was only a piece of paper. I suppose we can overlook this just this once.Phoenix:\n(She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)Pile on more pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I let up on her now, she'll get away... I have to find some way to inflict a deafening blow to the prosecution!)\nLeads to:\n\"Witness!\"Forgive her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess we should forgive her.\nOldbag:\nHmph! Who the heck are you to decide who should be forgiven, you delinquent!\nPhoenix:\nGrr... (Number of endearing qualities: ZERO.)\nMia:\nPhoenix. You can't go easy on her. She's no frail old lady.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nMia:\nYou should be pressing her until she gives in!\nPhoenix:\n(Mia is really scary today... *gulp*)\nLeads to:\n\"Witness!\"Phoenix:\nWitness! You said that the only thing you stole was that note. Is this correct?Oldbag:\nS-S-Stole!? Why don't you listen more carefully, you annoying brat!? I saved this piece of paper from the terrible, lonely trash can! That's all!Phoenix:\nYou're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!Oldbag:\nAre you putting my credibility under scrutiny again!?Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! I don't believe that the note is the only thing you stole that night!Present Lotta's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. More than the witness' credibility, perhaps you should be worrying about your legal standing, or should I say, falling?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nJudge:\nI'm setting the volume down to low so I won't have to waste my time with your objections!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I never knew the judge had hearing aids... Argh! Now's not the time to be wondering about health conditions! OK, one more try!)\nLeads back to:\n\"You're lying, dammit! And I can prove it!!\"Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?Judge:\nA camera...?Phoenix:\nYesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, \"My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!\"Judge:\nWhy... Why... Witness!!Oldbag:\nWhat is it, gramps?Phoenix:\nIf you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!Oldbag:\nGrr... Looks like you found me out again, sonny... Is this the camera you're looking for?Phoenix:\nAh, that's...!Oldbag:\nWhat!? Even though I look like this, I'm still a person, you know! I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and \"borrow\" things from people!Judge:\nUm... I think your definition of \"borrow\" is a little off...Oldbag:\nI saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, \"Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire\"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!Judge:\nBailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?Edgeworth:\nThere is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.Judge:\nPlease present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!Oldbag:\nSee, I told you! That's the guy I saw!Judge:\nThis proves that the witness was not lying earlier about this matter.Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record.Judge:\nWh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nThis photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was still in his Nickel Samurai costume!Judge:\nIf that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...Edgeworth:\nThe defendant.Judge:\nHow did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?Phoenix:\n(If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...nothing strange with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is nothing strange with this photo.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I have done nothing to alter this picture either, in case you're wondering, Wright.\nJudge:\nI see... And it seems the defense will rest on this matter. In that case, there is no reason to further prolong this trial.\nMia:\nIs this really alright with you, Phoenix!?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well... There's nothing wrong with this photo that I can poi--\nMia:\nTry again! Take another good look at it! And if you still don't see anything... Do something... anything to prolong the trial!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Chief! W-Wait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright? I'm about to enter my verdict. Please address me with your comment afterwards.\nPhoenix:\nUm, no, I'm sorry, but this can't wait...\nEdgeworth:\nOh? Let me guess. You are going to point out some peculiarity with this photo?\nJudge:\nWh-What? Why didn't you say so earlier!?\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"something strange with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"Phoenix:\nThere's... There's something strange with this photo!Edgeworth:\nI knew this was coming, Wright.Judge:\nYour thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.Judge:\n\"Debunk with a bunker buster\"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!Judge:\nIf you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need one chance, correct...?Phoenix:\nUm... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this photo from anyway...? (Changed from [Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...?] in the original release) It's all out of focus! Why can't she take a good shot, especially when it counts!?)Judge:\nNow then, let's hear your objection. What about this photo is \"strange\"...?Present Nickel Samurai's feet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to direct the court's attention to this one area right here!\"Present Nickel Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's this person here, of course!\nJudge:\nYou mean the \"Nickel Samurai\"?

His ankles...?Phoenix:\nIf you could see this person's ankle, that would be one thing... However you can't.Judge:\nA-And...? What does that mean...?Phoenix:\nThe costumed person in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde! (Changed from [The 'Nickel Samurai' in this photo could not have been Mr. Engarde!] in the original release)Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of this!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI wonder if you would care to elaborate... With actual facts, that is.Phoenix:\nLet's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.Judge:\nHis... His socks... You can see his socks...Phoenix:\nExactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nThere is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)Mia:\nThat's curious...Phoenix:\nHuh? What is?Mia:\nEdgeworth is unusually calm today...Phoenix:\nThat's true...Mia:\nHe's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.Phoenix:\n\"Along for the ride\"...? What do you mean by that?Mia:\nI can only think that perhaps he doesn't feel under attack at all...Phoenix:\n(He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, I haven't damaged his case at all!?) (Changed from [He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?] in the original release)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nIf the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!Edgeworth:\n... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Edgeworth:\nWright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?Phoenix:\n(Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)Mia:\nDon't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)Judge:\nMr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts. Who is the person in this photograph...?Present Adrian Andrews profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"A-Adrian Andrews...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nAre you saying this is who you think was in the costume...?\nPhoenix:\nUh... Um... Well, I know there isn't a lot to back me up here, but...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSometimes I wonder about you. Do you just pick the first piece of evidence you see?\nMia:\nI can't believe it. I didn't think you would mess up here of all places...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... And I really thought I had it!)\nJudge:\nNow then, would you care to try one more time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts.\"Judge:\nA-Adrian Andrews...?Phoenix:\nIf you want to know who that Nickel Samurai is, it is none other than this woman!Edgeworth:\nAnd why would you say it must be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her? (Changed from [And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nFor starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.Judge:\nAnd how does that all add up?Phoenix:\nIt means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!Judge:\nThe knife that was used as a murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nWhy don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?Phoenix:\n(I have to do this now! This is my last chance to turn things around!) The defense motions to indict Ms. Adrian Andrews in the murder of Juan Corrida! It was Ms. Andrews who tried to frame the defendant for the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order!! ORDER!! It looks like this trial has hit a most unexpected development! Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nThis court is issuing a subpoena for Ms. Adrian Andrews! A verdict cannot be passed without first hearing her testimony!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\n(Alright! This is it...)Mia:\nThis... is kind of bad for us.Phoenix:\nHuh?

I think you underestimate me, Your Honor.Judge:\nAnd what do you mean by that...?Edgeworth:\nThat Mr. Phoenix Wright would slave his way to subpoenaing Ms. Adrian Andrews is all happening according to plan...

WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of your statement, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nMs. Adrian Andrews is currently waiting in the prosecution lobby... She is the next witness.Phoenix:\n...! (Everything... Everything was planned out in advance by that man...?)Mia:\nSomehow, I knew there was no way Edgeworth would overlook Ms. Andrews... Looks like this battle is far from over.Edgeworth:\nExactly.Judge:\nVery well. We will call the next witness. However... Before we proceed, we shall take a 10 minute recess. Please prepare your witness in that time, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nThe court will now take a 10 minute recess.To be continued.March 22, 2:14 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Engarde:\nDude! I can't believe that Adrian... No way! Not cool and collected Adrian Andrews!Phoenix:\nShe is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... her.Engarde:\nSo after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...Phoenix:\nSee, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.Engarde:\nHmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?Phoenix:\nYes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.Engarde:\nBut... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!Phoenix:\nShe has her own agenda.Engarde:\nH-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?Phoenix:\nI'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.Engarde:\nGet me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?Mia:\nPhoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's missing suicide note, right?Phoenix:\n...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live. (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release) But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...Mia:\n...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.Phoenix:\nAnd that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!Mia:\nThat sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.Phoenix:\nUm, what...?Mia:\nWho was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' dependency issues with regards to Ms. Inpax...? (Changed from [Better stated, Mr. Andrews' co-dependency with regards to Ms. Inpax...?] in the original release)Phoenix:\n... It was Edgeworth...Mia:\nIt looks like he's still the one in command of this ship. Don't let your guard down yet.March 22, 2:25 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you please.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls the witness subpoenaed by this court. Ms. Adrian Andrews, the person who discovered the crime in Mr. Juan Corrida's room!Edgeworth:\nWhat is your occupation?Andrews:\nI am the manager of the defendant in this case, Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge:\nI see. Now then...Andrews:\nBefore we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.Judge:\nUh, yes, sure. What is it?Andrews:\nI'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly \"magazine\" recently...Judge:\nAh, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of \"Gossip Land\"...Phoenix:\n(If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)Edgeworth:\nAnyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.Andrews:\nYes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.Judge:\nHmm, so it was a \"fry 'n bait\" matter... or was that \"bait 'n fry\"? Reminds me of fishing...Andrews:\nBut I... But I didn't kill him.Edgeworth:\nNo one has accused you of that.Andrews:\nI think there's someone who would beg to differ. (Changed from [I've got a feeling someone will soon...] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nI think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.Edgeworth:\nVery well then. Witness, please testify to the court about what happened when you discovered the murder that had taken place.Witness Testimony-- When I Found the Body --Andrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...\nWhat I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.\nI felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.Judge:\nYou poured yourself a glass of juice...?Andrews:\nYes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...Edgeworth:\nAnd that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:\nPhoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.Phoenix:\nYes... I know.Mia:\nIn order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pacing. (Changed from [You should disrupt her pace.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nDisrupt her pacing...? (Changed from [Disrupt her pace...?] in the original release)Mia:\nShe's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it. The instant you let up on your offense is the instant this trial is over. Understand?Cross Examination-- When I Found the Body --Andrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what was Mr. Engarde doing at the time...?\nAndrews:\nHe was taking a nap. He was worn out from his mini performance as the Nickel Samurai during the ceremony...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, Mr. Engarde did say he was taking a nap...) Then I guess you could say it could not have been taken out of his room, yes?\nAndrews:\nExcuse me? \"It\"...? What are you...?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I thought years of school would have taught you how to construct a sentence. If you can't make a sensible sentence with a subject, then I'll make one for you. Watch. Did you, Ms. Andrews, remove Mr. Engarde's knife from his room?\nAndrews:\n...No.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nSubject, verb, object Wright. Did you skip basic grammar? The witness may continue.Andrews:\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you do that...?\nAndrews:\nAs a friendly gesture, Juan was to make an appearance with the other Heroes.\nPhoenix:\n(So the show was supposed to be a \"show\" of friendship, huh?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIs that the only reason?\nAndrews:\nI beg your pardon? What are you implying...?\nPhoenix:\nYou had a certain goal in mind when you started to get close to him, correct...? So perhaps you had a more personal matter to discuss with the victim...?\nAndrews:\n... Sorry, but I didn't have any such intentions in mind at that time.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't get her to talk without a strong piece of evidence, I guess...)\nLeads to:\n\"May we continue now...?\"\n\n\n\n\nLet her be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I should back off... As long as I don't have any proof, she's not going to talk.)\nLeads to:\n\"May we continue now...?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMay we continue now...? Witness, what did you see when you got to his room?Andrews:\nAnd there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were \"in shock\"...?\nAndrews:\nWhat? Was I not supposed to be?\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Andrews is a very calculating person... And despite how \"close\" they were, I doubt she had romantic feelings for Mr. Corrida...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnyone randomly stumbling upon a dead body would be in shock. And you can't seriously expect that a young beauty like her would not be shocked.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think beauty has anything to do with being shocked or not...)\nJudge:\nHmm... I see...Press (after pressing fifth statement, before adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were \"in shock\"...?\nAndrews:\nWhat? Was I not supposed to be?\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Andrews is a very calculating person... And despite how \"close\" they were, I doubt she had romantic feelings for Mr. Corrida...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnyone randomly stumbling upon a dead body would be in shock. And you can't seriously expect that a young beauty like her would not be shocked.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think beauty has anything to do with being shocked or not...)\nJudge:\nHmm... I see...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews, I would like to confirm with you one more time. When you discovered the dead body of Juan Corrida, you were in great shock. And that's when you poured yourself the glass of juice, correct?\nAndrews:\nAnd what of it...? My mind really was a complete blank at the time.\nPhoenix:\nYour mind was a complete blank? I didn't think that was possible for you.\nAndrews:\nAren't you rude today? I was so dazed that I made one careless mistake... That one thing...\nPhoenix:\nWhat \"one thing\"?\nAndrews:\nUm, never mind. It's no big deal.\nPhoenix:\n(What was she starting to say just now...?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Andrews!\"\n\n\n\n\nLet her be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Well, it probably doesn't have anything to do with the case, so...)\nMia:\nStop right there. You finally got her to open her mouth on this one, and you're going to let it go? Now is the time to get as much out of her as we can.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're right.\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Andrews!\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews! I'm convinced that as you said, you made a \"mistake\" at the scene of the crime.\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat I really want to know is what this \"mistake\" was.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, actually... So would I...\nAndrews:\nI... I'm sorry... It's just... It's kind of... embarrassing... When I... When I set the glass down on the dresser... I accidentally... knocked the flower vase over...\nJudge:\nF-Flower vase...? Are you talking about the one on the floor in the crime photo...? This mess of glass shards!?\nAndrews:\nIt was originally on top of the dresser... but when I bumped into it with my elbow, it fell... onto the guitar case.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-Why did you withhold such an important piece of information!?\nAndrews:\nI'm sorry...

I wasn't feeling terribly great, so I set the glass down. Without drinking it...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews, I would like to confirm with you one more time. When you discovered the dead body of Juan Corrida, you were in great shock. And that's when you poured yourself the glass of juice, correct?\nAndrews:\nAnd what of it...? My mind really was a complete blank at the time.\nPhoenix:\nYour mind was a complete blank? I didn't think that was possible for you.\nAndrews:\nAren't you rude today? I was so dazed that I made one careless mistake... That one thing...\nPhoenix:\nWhat \"one thing\"?\nAndrews:\nUm, never mind.

You finally got her to open her mouth on this one, and you're going to let it go? Now is the time to get as much out of her as we can.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're right.\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Andrews!\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews! I'm convinced that as you said, you made a \"mistake\" at the scene of the crime.\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat I really want to know is what this \"mistake\" was.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, actually... So would I...\nAndrews:\nI... I'm sorry... It's just... It's kind of... embarrassing... When I... When I set the glass down on the dresser... I accidentally... knocked the flower vase over...\nJudge:\nF-Flower vase...? Are you talking about the one on the floor in the crime photo...? This mess of glass shards!?\nAndrews:\nIt was originally on top of the dresser... but when I bumped into it with my elbow, it fell... onto the guitar case.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-Why did you withhold such an important piece of information!?\nAndrews:\nI'm sorry...

I thought I would try to take Juan's pulse... So I set the glass I was holding down on the dresser. And that's when my elbow accidentally hit the vase...\nPhoenix:\n(That's odd. I thought she was always in total control of herself...?)\nMia:\nThat's what she would like people to think. Always be mindful of the gap between the perception and reality.Present Guitar Case or Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You testified that you knocked the flower vase over. Is this correct?\"Phoenix:\n(It doesn't sound like there's any glaring contradictions in her testimony just now...)Mia:\nI warned you earlier that she would not crack so easily. The only way to make her is to...Phoenix:\n...Keep on the offensive and not let up.Mia:\nThe only way you're going to catch her is with some very strong, decisive evidence...Phoenix:\n(I have to find something! I just have to! ...For Maya's sake...)Phoenix:\nYou testified that you knocked the flower vase over. Is this correct?Andrews:\nYes.Phoenix:\nAnd are you sure it fell onto the guitar case?Andrews:\nI-Is there some problem with what I said...?Phoenix:\nIt's not \"some\" problem, it's a \"major\" problem. It's true that the top of the guitar case was wet with water. However, that's exactly what is so strange! Ms. Andrews! You testified that the vase fell onto the guitar case! However! If that was true, the case should have gotten wet on the inside, not the outside!Judge:\nTh-That's very true!Phoenix:\nFurthermore, there is one other strange thing about this guitar case.Judge:\nAnd wh-what is that?Phoenix:\nLet's take another look at the crime scene photo. The remains of the vase are scattered on the floor.Judge:\nAnd what is wrong with that?Phoenix:\nIf the guitar case was open when the vase fell... The glass shards should be INSIDE, not outside the case!Andrews:\nAh!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWhat is your point, Wright!? That the case was closed at the time the vase was knocked over? Is that all!?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo. Think back to what Ms. Andrews testified to! She said that other than the vase, she didn't touch anything else!Edgeworth:\nNngh...Judge:\nYes, that's right... She did implicitly say she didn't touch the guitar case!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nBut... But this whole matter with the guitar case is a dead end! The bright red guitar was found at the studio! It has no bearing on this case at all!Phoenix:\n... That may very well be, however... (Argh, the empty guitar case does seem to have no relation to this case, doesn't it...) (Changed from [An empty guitar case does seem to have no relation to this case...] in the original release)Judge:\nHmm... It seems that there is no deeper meaning to the guitar case.

Well, maybe...\nPhoenix:\n... Why did you open the guitar case?\nAndrews:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Corrida's dead body was right there in front of you, wasn't it? I would think that the first thing you would do is call for help, not open a guitar case.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs the witness has said multiple times, when she found the dead body, she was \"dazed\".\nJudge:\nHmm...\nAndrews:\nMaybe I...

That you put your gloves back on, just to open the guitar case!?Andrews:\nUgn!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!Mia:\nLooks like you hit the nail on the head this time.Phoenix:\n...? What do you mean?Mia:\nI believe that guitar case plays a very important role here.Phoenix:\nBut it's just an empty case...Mia:\nI wonder if it really was empty though...Phoenix:\nB-But the guitar... The bright red guitar was at the studio!Mia:\nPhoenix, drop all of your presumptions. What was in the guitar case was not the bright red guitar.Phoenix:\n(You don't mean... it was a bright WHITE guitar!? Wait, that's not right either...)Judge:\nHmm, I admit it would be unnatural for someone to do that. So the witness was not wearing gloves, despite the fact that on the case...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nYour Honor, this is obviously the defense's usual misdirection tactic at work. Steer the court towards an unrelated topic, and lull us all into his misguided...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor! Please recall that Ms. Andrews had testified that the vase \"fell onto the guitar case\"! Which means that the case was closed when the crime took place! However, it is wide open in this photo of the crime scene! I am sure this guitar case has some relation to the murder!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nIf you are so sure, Wright, then I'm sure you can somehow substantiate your outrageous claim, correct!? Please, enlighten us as to why that guitar case has anything at all to do with this murder!Phoenix:\nUh...Judge:\nCan you do that, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\nUm, well... Let's suppose for a second... That the bright red guitar was not the only thing that could have been in the case...Judge:\nThe bright red guitar not being the only thing...? Y-You don't mean to suggest that a bright BLACK guitar was inside the--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nSo, you intend to push your theory that the case was not empty!? Is that it, Wright!?Phoenix:\nI wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!Edgeworth:\nDeflate that head of yours! You haven't proven anything yet! Now then, let's have it. What was inside this case at the time of the murder!?Present The Nickel Samurai or Lotta's Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Th-This is... This is a photograph...!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why would something like that be inside a guitar case, let alone this one?\nJudge:\nWhy, Mr. Wright, why?\nPhoenix:\nWell... I just thought it might have been possible...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have a suggestion. Why don't you put that in the void where your brain is supposed to be!\nJudge:\nYes, and never bring it out again!\nPhoenix:\n(Can't a foolishly foolish fool get some love...?)\nEdgeworth:\nDo you still think you can prove your theory? Can you prove that the guitar case was not empty at the time of the murder?\nLeads back to:\n\"I wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!\"Judge:\nTh-This is... This is a photograph...!Phoenix:\nYes, but what is important is what is in that picture, Your Honor.Judge:\nI-In this picture...?Phoenix:\nIt doesn't take a genius to see what I mean! What I am proposing is... Inside the guitar case was the Nickel Samurai! The hero's very own costume!Edgeworth:\nWh-What!?Judge:\nM-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!Edgeworth:\nWright! Are you saying that the witness opened the guitar case to take out a costume!? What insane point would there be to doing something like that!?Phoenix:\nThat insane point would be to wear the costume, of course. Ms. Andrews put it on to hide her identity so she could make her escape. After all, you couldn't let anyone see you leave, could you, Ms. Andrews?Andrews:\n...!Edgeworth:\nI-I refuse to accept your theory! Do you have anything to support such a preposterous idea!?Phoenix:\nJust outside the door was an investigative photographer who was starving for a big scoop. And in the end, she managed to get this shot, correct?Judge:\nYou... You mean this photo!? Order! Ordeeeer! It looks like we've wandered into quite another mess again, haven't we...?Mia:\nNice job, Phoenix.Phoenix:\nWell, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later!Judge:\nHmm... So the real murderer was hiding inside a costume...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nW-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!?Judge:\nHmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...?It was stolen from Engarde.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI think it may have been stolen from Mr. Engarde...\nJudge:\nS-Stolen!? But why would someone do such a thing!?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe the thief wanted to interfere with the post-ceremony stage show.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nAnd so, if he didn't have his costume, then Mr. Engarde would be forced to go naked!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe YOU should be stripped naked and run out for making a mockery of this court!\nPhoenix:\nE-EXCUSE ME!?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Matt Engarde did not take his costume off after the award ceremony! He even testified that he took a nap while still wearing his costume! Is this not correct!?\nPhoenix:\n... Ah, yeah, he did say something like that, didn't he?\nJudge:\n*sigh* That's what I thought. Let's try that one more time, shall we, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts.\"It was a spare costume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period...\"Phoenix:\nMr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a spare one.Edgeworth:\nWhat...?Judge:\nThen... are you saying that on the night of the murder... there were TWO Nickel Samurai costumes at the Gatewater Hotel!?Phoenix:\nYes, that is what I am saying.Judge:\nAnd how do you explain the costume that was inside the guitar case...?Edgeworth:\nIt would mean that the victim himself had brought this spare to the ceremony on purpose! (Changed from [It would mean that the victim himself had planned to bring this spare to the ceremony!] in the original release)Judge:\nBut... But why!? The victim, Mr. Corrida, was the Jammin' Ninja. Why would he secretly bring the Nickel Samurai's spare costume with him...? What could be the reason behind such a peculiar act?Phoenix:\n... And therein lies the sticking point... (Changed from [... Ah, so that's what he intended...] in the original release)Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWh-What are you mumbling to yourself about now!? Have you just been rambling all this time without any sense of inner monologue!?Phoenix:\nHuh!? N-No, I just...Judge:\nMr. Wright, please explain yourself! Why do you think the victim had the Nickel Samurai's spare costume!?Mia:\nPhoenix... Are you sure you can explain this one? Think carefully before you answer... And then answer with gusto! I believe in you!Phoenix:\nAlright. This is what I think. The reason the victim brought the Nickel Samurai's spare costume to the hotel was...Present Press Conference Ticket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"What is this...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nMia:\nPhoenix! What are you doing!? Are you crazy!?\nPhoenix:\nI... I, uh... I presented the evidence with gusto, just like you said!\nMia:\nI told you to present it with gusto, yes... But I seem to recall the sentence before that was, \"Think carefully\"!\nPhoenix:\n*gulp*\nJudge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nAh, sorry...\nMia:\nThis one is pretty tough. I really think you should look carefully at the Court Record. And then search through your memories! The answer is there, I know you'll find it!\nJudge:\nNow then. Are you ready to try again, Mr. Wright? Minus the wrong evidence this time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Alright. This is what I think.\"Judge:\nWhat is this...?Phoenix:\nOn the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special press conference.Judge:\nA press conference...?Phoenix:\nYes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something at this conference.Edgeworth:\nI heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright.Phoenix:\nBut what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had no idea he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night.Andrews:\n...Judge:\nBut how can that be!?Phoenix:\nThe way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida himself!Judge:\nTh-The victim?Phoenix:\nYes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the \"Nickel Samurai\"!Judge:\nHe was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!?Phoenix:\nThat's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is what he intended to reveal at that conference.Edgeworth:\nThe Nickel Samurai was going to \"confess\" something. And by \"confess\", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about \"himself\".Phoenix:\nWhich means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about Matt Engarde!Judge:\nYes, I guess that is what it would mean...Edgeworth:\nBut, if that's the case... that's not a \"confession\"! That's \"public disclosure\"!Andrews:\nHmph.Judge:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?Andrews:\nI can see why you are pros at what you do.Judge:\nPardon me?Andrews:\nYes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan.Judge:\nMs. Andrews! Please offer us an explanation for this!Andrews:\nI was the one he asked to help set it up. And the person who prepared the second costume for him... That was also me.Judge:\nYou...!?Andrews:\nJuan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway.Judge:\nHe was going to ruin him, huh...?Andrews:\nIt looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Judge:\nAnd do you know what this \"secret\" of Mr. Engarde's is, Ms. Andrews...?Andrews:\n... That's something only Juan knew. I... I don't know what it is.Judge:\nAh... I see.Edgeworth:\n...Andrews:\nI... I've probably been coming off quite suspicious to everyone, but that's to be expected. I've been trying to protect Matt, after all...Phoenix:\nP-Protect Mr. Engarde!?Judge:\nAnd yet again another strange bit of truth comes to light it seems... Ms. Andrews, if you could, please tell us the truth about your behavior!Andrews:\nYes, Your Honor. I understand.Witness Testimony-- Protecting Matt --Andrews:\nFrom the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.\nMatt had to kill Juan no matter what.\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...Judge:\nHmm... This does account for everything...Andrews:\nWell... I am the logical type.Mia:\nWe're finally seeing her true self. She is more nervous than a scared rabbit.Judge:\nIf the defense can find no fault with this testimony, I am ready to make a ruling. (Changed from [If there are no objections, I feel that I can pass a verdict based on this testimony.] in the original release) Please keep that in mind as you cross-examine, Mr. Wright. (Changed from [Now then, Mr. Wright, if you please.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Looks like somehow everything has swung to the opposite end of the scale again... That just means I have to put my weight into this and turn her logic upside-down!)Cross Examination-- Protecting Matt --Andrews:\nFrom the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you say that was your \"intuition\" speaking to you?\nAndrews:\nDon't confuse my methods of reasoning with your own.\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\nAndrews:\nIf you want to prove that someone did something, you need three things.\nPhoenix:\nThree... things?\nAndrews:\nA motive, an opportunity to commit the crime, and finally... decisive evidence. And if you think these three things through, the answer becomes quite clear.\nMia:\nYou should have already known that, Phoenix...\nPhoenix:\nThey didn't teach that to us in school... At least, not from what I remember...\nAndrews:\nMay I continue now?Andrews:\nMatt had to kill Juan no matter what.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo would you say this \"need\" came from the press conference?\nAndrews:\nYes. Do you know why Juan chose that event and that hotel for the conference? Because that was when he could cause the most damage to the public's beloved Matt Engarde.\nJudge:\nAnd you knew of this plan, didn't you, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\nYes... because I was the one who set up the conference and prepared the costume.\nPhoenix:\nBut... I'm sure Mr. Engarde himself didn't know anything about a press conference.\nAndrews:\nOh really? Can you show me any proof that he didn't know about the press conference?\nPhoenix:\nA-Anyway! The important thing here is that this information was not in your testimony!\nJudge:\nYes, I agree. Ms. Andrews, please correct your testimony, if you please.\nAndrews:\n\"Grasping at straws\" now, are we, Mr. Wright?\nChanges statement from \"Matt had to kill Juan no matter what.\" to \"I know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.\"Andrews:\nI know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHas Mr. Engarde done something to hurt or betray you personally?\nAndrews:\n... Why do you ask?\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one who helped Mr. Corrida with his press conference... And that event was supposed to bring down Mr. Engarde, yet you still helped out!\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe person on trial right now is Mr. Engarde, Wright. What the witness was thinking, helping the victim with his plan, is none of our concern. In any case, this means that the defendant had a motive to kill.\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I keep doing this to myself...?)Andrews:\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nB-But didn't you already testify earlier that Mr. Engarde was... \"Taking a nap in his room\"!? Are you telling me now that, that too, was a lie so you could cover for Mr. Engarde!?\nAndrews:\nI'm not telling you anything of the sort. When I went to get him for the show, he honestly was sleeping. However, as to whether he was sleeping the entire time, that I cannot say. I was too busy setting up the stage at the time.\nJudge:\nHmm... I keep trying, but I can find no flaws with what Ms. Andrews has said. I can't say the same for some people here in this courtroom, however.\nPhoenix:\n(The judge is glaring straight at Mia...)\nMia:\nHe's glaring at you, smart guy!Andrews:\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou can hardly call the knife \"decisive evidence\"! The fingerprints on the knife could very well be a clever camouflage!\nAndrews:\nThen... What about the button?\nPhoenix:\nThe button...?\nAndrews:\nIt's clear from the crime scene that the victim and the murderer fought. And during the fight, the killer ripped the button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nJudge:\nYou're talking about this button, correct?\nAndrews:\nThat button was found in the pleats of Matt's hakama, isn't that correct? I would think that makes it very decisive evidence.\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nJudge:\nLooks like you were out-foxed again, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nA-Anyway! The knife doesn't prove a thing! Please fix your testimony!\nAndrews:\nI can't stand the sight of a man who can't gracefully accept his defeat.\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(... Thank goodness Mia can still look at me...)\nMia:\nWith an icy stare, yes.\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews, for Mr. Wright's sake, please add this information to your testimony.\nChanges statement from \"My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\" to \"That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\"Andrews:\nThat button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd how do you know that?\nAndrews:\nWhen the ends of the threads on the button and the costume were matched up, they were found to fit together perfectly... Or so I heard.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I've heard that before too. But why would Ms. Andrews know about this case down to such a fine detail?)\nAndrews:\nDon't look at me like that! Just because I'm prepared and you are not!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... And I thought I had her this time for sure. If there's anything to trip her up on, it has to be here. ...But where and what?)Present Juan's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is the victim's autopsy report.\"Andrews:\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut what you really did was stab the guy in the back, didn't you? And at the worst possible time.\nAndrews:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nWho's to say she really \"stabbed the guy in the back\" as you put it?\nPhoenix:\nThis witness could have disclosed things about Mr. Engarde at any time. Why, then, would she wait until there was a large audience before doing so? It's the same reason why Mr. Corrida planned such an elaborate conference. Ms. Andrews wanted to cause Mr. Engarde as much damage as she possibly could! This witness bears ill-will towards the defendant!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis isn't the \"Phoenix Wright Wax Philosophical Power Hour\". And please, stop slandering the witness.\nAndrews:\n...Phoenix:\nAs I expected, Ms. Andrews' testimony seems pretty solid.Mia:\nReally? Because to me, it sounded a little wishy-washy.Phoenix:\nWishy-washy? (Well, I guess we'll see if I press a little more...)Mia:\nYou should know this by now, but you'll need strong, decisive evidence to make her talk.Phoenix:\nGot it, Chief! (...I'm going to pin you down this time, Ms. Andrews!)Phoenix:\nThis is the victim's autopsy report. It clearly states that the cause of death was \"strangulation by a scarf\".Andrews:\nS...Strangulation...Phoenix:\nThe knife stab to the victim was done after the victim had already died.Judge:\nA-And what does that mean?Phoenix:\nLet's examine the evidence. This button has the victim's blood on it. Which would mean that it was ripped off of the costume... when?Edgeworth:\nAfter the knife was stabbed into the victim...Phoenix:\nExactly! Which means... It is impossible that this button was torn off during the victim's final struggle, because the victim was strangled to death in that fight!Andrews:\nAh...Phoenix:\nThat's right, Ms. Andrews. There is no way this button was ripped off during the struggle. This button was consciously pulled off of the victim's already dead body!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Wh-What is the meaning--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWhat is the meaning of this, Wright!? So what if the button was torn off the body after the victim had already died? What does that change!?Phoenix:\nLet me ask you one simple question, Mr. Edgeworth. Why was the button torn off? What purpose did that serve?Edgeworth:\nWhat \"purpose\"...?Phoenix:\nWe now know this button was not torn off during the fight. So the murderer took the time and effort to purposely rip this from the victim's body. That would mean that the murderer had something in mind, wouldn't it?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nMr. Wright! Does this mean... Does this mean you know what the murderer wanted to do with this button!? What was it!?To have a memento of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaybe this was the criminal's first crime and since it went so well, the person wanted something as a memento...\nEdgeworth:\nWright... I'll give this button to you as a memento.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nA reminder to never set foot in another court of law again for as long as you live!\nJudge:\nYes... I think it would be for the best if you stayed away from the attorney's bench.\nPhoenix:\nW-W-Wait! Please, Your Honor! I... I'll get it right this time! I'm sure of it!\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\"To pin the crime on Engarde\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is only one logical reason for doing something like that.\"To destroy evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was to destroy the evidence, of course!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... To destroy the evidence...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, we heard you the first time! And which blasted piece of evidence was the person trying to destroy, Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! If you continue like this, I'm afraid you'll only destroy yourself!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\"Phoenix:\nThere is only one logical reason for doing something like that. It was to pin the crime on Mr. Engarde!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nThere is no way anyone would put a bloodied button in their own pants! That's right! Mr. Engarde was set up! By the real killer, of course!Judge:\nAnd... The real murder is...? Well, Mr. Wright!? Who in the world is the real killer then!?Phoenix:\n(Finally... I can't believe I managed to bring this trial all the way up to this point...)Mia:\nPhoenix... You can't let your guard down yet! Not until the very end!Phoenix:\nThe real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...Present Adrian Andrews profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Adrian Andrews!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWright. Which of these four doesn't belong here? Up, down, left, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nUm, \"Wright\"?\nEdgeworth:\nThank you, I feel much better. I'm relieved to know you can at least pick that much out. I worry about you. You seem to fail every time you try to make logical sense!\nMia:\nOr in other words, \"think before you speak\", Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\n(Is it just me or is everyone ganging up on me?)\nJudge:\nThat's enough dawdling now, Mr. Wright. We don't have all day.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"The real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...\"Phoenix:\nMs. Adrian Andrews! I choose you! You are Mr. Corrida's killer!Andrews:\nWh-What!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!! Mr. Wright! This is a very grave matter! Do you have any evidence that supports your charge...?Phoenix:\n\"Any evidence\"...? ALL of the evidence points to Ms. Andrews!Andrews:\nWh... How preposterous! You can't stick any of that on me!Phoenix:\nI can't, can I? Would you care to test me?Andrews:\nThen... Then what about this knife!?Phoenix:\nThe knife was used to stab the victim after he had already been strangled to death. It was used to throw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, naturally. A knife covered in the defendant's fingerprints could only be taken from his room. And the only one who had dinner with him, and knew which knife to take, was you.Andrews:\n...Tsk! Th-Then! What... What about the button that was found in Matt's hakama!?Phoenix:\nThis button was removed from the victim's body after he had already died. The only people who could've done so were the person who found his body or the killer. However, if Mr. Engarde was the real killer, there is no way he would have put such incriminating evidence in his own hakama!Andrews:\nUghn...Phoenix:\nThe only person who could have put this button into Mr. Engarde's hakama, is the person who went to wake him from his nap... which is you, yet again, Ms. Andrews.Judge:\nI... I see... What about the empty guitar case...?Phoenix:\nThat is also another piece of evidence that incriminates Ms. Andrews. That costume was used to hide the real killer's identity as they fled the crime scene. Now, who could have known that there was just such a costume inside the guitar case...? It could only have been the person who prepared the costume for the victim. And that person is... you, Ms. Adrian Andrews!Andrews:\nN...No... I...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nBut Ms. Andrews' fingerprints were nowhere to be found on the guitar case! And it was you who proved that she was not wearing gloves at the time!Judge:\n...! Th-That's right!Phoenix:\nThat's because she did not intend on leaving any prints. If anyone had found out that she had touched the case, they would have asked her why. So to avoid leaving any prints, she used a towel or something else to open it. But! The glass of tomato juice is a different story! Ms. Andrews purposefully left her fingerprints on the glass to show that yes, indeed, she was the classic \"dazed discoverer\" of a dead body!Andrews:\nAaaaaah!Phoenix:\nAnd to top it all off, there is this photo! A photo of the killer as they exited the scene of the crime. No reasonable person on Earth can believe this Nickel Samurai is Mr. Engarde! He would be much too short for his own costume if it was him.Andrews:\n...!Phoenix:\nSpeaking of how tall people are... Ms. Andrews, you're also kind of short in stature, are you not?Andrews:\nP-Please... Stop...Phoenix:\nWell, how about it, Ms. Andrews!?Andrews:\nUm...Phoenix:\n(I've got her this time!)Andrews:\n...Judge:\nMs. Andrews...?Andrews:\n... I... I... I refuse... to testify.Phoenix:\nWhat was that...?Andrews:\nTh-There's a law... It says I can't be forced to testify about something... if it can incriminate me!Judge:\nWell, yes... You are absolutely correct, Ms. Andrews. The law does provide us with a way to avoid self-incrimination... by allowing a witness to not testify if the testimony can cause damage to themselves.Phoenix:\nWHAT!? (\"Pleading the fifth\" is not something most people would think to do on the spot! Actually... Thinking back to yesterday in Mr. Engarde's room...)von Karma:\nAdrian Andrews!Andrews:\nY-Yes...?von Karma:\nThink hard about what we just discussed. Understood!?Andrews:\nA-Alright... ...Phoenix:\n(That's it. That's when Franziska planted this idea into her head... She must have told Ms. Andrews to not testify if things looked bad.)Mia:\nYou did a good job proving everything up to this point, Phoenix. But there is still one thing you haven't done.Phoenix:\nSomething I haven't done...?Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh. What's wrong, Wright? Are you finished already? Run out of evidence?Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nWhat is so humorous, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nI'm sure you realize this as well, Your Honor... But, everything the good lawyer here has proven up to this point is meaningless.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Edgeworth:\nEverything you have proven is circumstantial.Phoenix:\nCircumstantial...?Edgeworth:\nYes, circumstantial. You have yet to provide a single piece of definitive proof. Proof that Ms. Andrews, did in fact, harbor a wish to murder Mr. Corrida!Judge:\nM-Ms. Andrews! You... Did you want to kill Mr. Corrida...?Andrews:\nI believe this may lead to me incriminating myself, so I will abstain from answering.Judge:\nBut Ms. Andrews... If you do that, it would be the same as admitting your guilt, don't you think...?Andrews:\nMaybe so, or maybe not. There is nothing to prove it either way. Besides, you don't even know what crime I would be \"guilty\" of due to my silence.Phoenix:\n(NO!! She's taking that defiant attitude again!) M-Mia! What should we do...?Mia:\nSomehow, we've landed in the worst possible situation.Judge:\nI think we have reached a certain conclusion at this point in time. Ms. Adrian Andrews has refused to testify. And the defense's theory that she is the actual murderer... has not been fully substantiated with solid, definitive proof.Phoenix:\nBut! That's not true!Judge:\nIn this situation, there is only one thing this court can do. And that is to declare a recess.Phoenix:\nR-Recess...!?Judge:\nI request that both the prosecution and the defense look further into this matter. And at tomorrow's trial...Phoenix:\n(T-Tomorrow...!? We don't have a \"tomorrow\"! If we don't get a not guilty verdict today, then...)Phoenix:Phoenix:\nPlease wait, Your Honor! Th...That's not necessary! The trial... Please continue the trial!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you sweating for...? Your client is getting one more day to live, isn't he?Phoenix:\nThat... That's not it! This isn't about that. Edgeworth! I know you know who the real killer is! Please... Let the trial continue! If I don't get the verdict... then Maya...Edgeworth:\n...?Judge:\nBut it's impossible to continue as long as the witness refuses to testify. Now then, this court is...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nIt is not impossible for this trial to continue.Andrews:\n...!Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you...Edgeworth:\nIt's true Ms. Andrews holds the right against self-incrimination; however, if the topic of conversation were something unrelated to whatever she may be guilty of, then she has no right to withhold testimony!Judge:\nY-Yes, that is very true, but...Edgeworth:\nActually, there is one little thing that I'm curious about. Ms. Andrews.Andrews:\n...Edgeworth:\nWhen you found the victim's dead body, you poured yourself a glass of juice.Andrews:\nY-Yes... And...?Edgeworth:\nI can't help but think how unnatural that is. Usually when one finds a body, they are shaken up, not stirring a glass of juice.Andrews:\nSo my actions were \"unusual\"? But I've already...Edgeworth:\nBefore you speak, I want to state that if you have a reason behind your actions, I would like you to testify to that effect.Andrews:\nTestify...!?Edgeworth:\nYour Honor! I would like to request that the witness testify again as to what happened when she first discovered the victim's body! Whatever we find out in this testimony should in no way implicate the witness.Judge:\nHmm...Mia:\nI don't know what it is about Edgeworth today, but I can't get a good read off of him. Is he friend or foe? I just don't know...Judge:\nThe court acknowledges the prosecution's request. Ms. Andrews, if you please.Witness Testimony-- When I Found the Body --Andrews:\nThat glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.\nI was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.\nAnd Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.\nWhen I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.\nTo be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.\nWhen I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.Judge:\nHmm... So you poured that glass of juice for the victim. Why didn't you say so in your earlier testimony?Andrews:\n...I didn't think I needed to include something so trivial.Mia:\nPhoenix. Please be careful here. If you can't find anything wrong with this testimony, then there's nothing left...Phoenix:\nI know. (Edgeworth... What the heck is going on in that brain of yours...?)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination",

What was it!?To have a memento of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaybe this was the criminal's first crime and since it went so well, the person wanted something as a memento...\nEdgeworth:\nWright... I'll give this button to you as a memento.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nA reminder to never set foot in another court of law again for as long as you live!\nJudge:\nYes... I think it would be for the best if you stayed away from the attorney's bench.\nPhoenix:\nW-W-Wait! Please, Your Honor! I... I'll get it right this time! I'm sure of it!\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\"To pin the crime on Engarde\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is only one logical reason for doing something like that.\"To destroy evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was to destroy the evidence, of course!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... To destroy the evidence...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, we heard you the first time! And which blasted piece of evidence was the person trying to destroy, Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! If you continue like this, I'm afraid you'll only destroy yourself!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\"Phoenix:\nThere is only one logical reason for doing something like that. It was to pin the crime on Mr. Engarde!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nThere is no way anyone would put a bloodied button in their own pants! That's right! Mr. Engarde was set up! By the real killer, of course!Judge:\nAnd... The real murder is...? Well, Mr. Wright!? Who in the world is the real killer then!?Phoenix:\n(Finally... I can't believe I managed to bring this trial all the way up to this point...)Mia:\nPhoenix... You can't let your guard down yet! Not until the very end!Phoenix:\nThe real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...Present Adrian Andrews profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Adrian Andrews!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWright. Which of these four doesn't belong here? Up, down, left, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nUm, \"Wright\"?\nEdgeworth:\nThank you, I feel much better. I'm relieved to know you can at least pick that much out. I worry about you. You seem to fail every time you try to make logical sense!\nMia:\nOr in other words, \"think before you speak\", Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\n(Is it just me or is everyone ganging up on me?)\nJudge:\nThat's enough dawdling now, Mr. Wright. We don't have all day.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"The real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...\"Phoenix:\nMs. Adrian Andrews! I choose you! You are Mr. Corrida's killer!Andrews:\nWh-What!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!! Mr. Wright! This is a very grave matter! Do you have any evidence that supports your charge...?Phoenix:\n\"Any evidence\"...? ALL of the evidence points to Ms. Andrews!Andrews:\nWh... How preposterous! You can't stick any of that on me!Phoenix:\nI can't, can I? Would you care to test me?Andrews:\nThen... Then what about this knife!?Phoenix:\nThe knife was used to stab the victim after he had already been strangled to death. It was used to throw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, naturally. A knife covered in the defendant's fingerprints could only be taken from his room. And the only one who had dinner with him, and knew which knife to take, was you.Andrews:\n...Tsk! Th-Then! What... What about the button that was found in Matt's hakama!?Phoenix:\nThis button was removed from the victim's body after he had already died. The only people who could've done so were the person who found his body or the killer. However, if Mr. Engarde was the real killer, there is no way he would have put such incriminating evidence in his own hakama!Andrews:\nUghn...Phoenix:\nThe only person who could have put this button into Mr. Engarde's hakama, is the person who went to wake him from his nap... which is you, yet again, Ms. Andrews.Judge:\nI... I see... What about the empty guitar case...?Phoenix:\nThat is also another piece of evidence that incriminates Ms. Andrews. That costume was used to hide the real killer's identity as they fled the crime scene. Now, who could have known that there was just such a costume inside the guitar case...? It could only have been the person who prepared the costume for the victim. And that person is... you, Ms. Adrian Andrews!Andrews:\nN...No... I...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nBut Ms. Andrews' fingerprints were nowhere to be found on the guitar case! And it was you who proved that she was not wearing gloves at the time!Judge:\n...! Th-That's right!Phoenix:\nThat's because she did not intend on leaving any prints. If anyone had found out that she had touched the case, they would have asked her why. So to avoid leaving any prints, she used a towel or something else to open it. But! The glass of tomato juice is a different story! Ms. Andrews purposefully left her fingerprints on the glass to show that yes, indeed, she was the classic \"dazed discoverer\" of a dead body!Andrews:\nAaaaaah!Phoenix:\nAnd to top it all off, there is this photo! A photo of the killer as they exited the scene of the crime. No reasonable person on Earth can believe this Nickel Samurai is Mr. Engarde! He would be much too short for his own costume if it was him.Andrews:\n...!Phoenix:\nSpeaking of how tall people are... Ms. Andrews, you're also kind of short in stature, are you not?Andrews:\nP-Please... Stop...Phoenix:\nWell, how about it, Ms. Andrews!?Andrews:\nUm...Phoenix:\n(I've got her this time!)Andrews:\n...Judge:\nMs. Andrews...?Andrews:\n... I... I... I refuse... to testify.Phoenix:\nWhat was that...?Andrews:\nTh-There's a law... It says I can't be forced to testify about something... if it can incriminate me!Judge:\nWell, yes... You are absolutely correct, Ms. Andrews. The law does provide us with a way to avoid self-incrimination... by allowing a witness to not testify if the testimony can cause damage to themselves.Phoenix:\nWHAT!? (\"Pleading the fifth\" is not something most people would think to do on the spot! Actually... Thinking back to yesterday in Mr. Engarde's room...)von Karma:\nAdrian Andrews!Andrews:\nY-Yes...?von Karma:\nThink hard about what we just discussed. Understood!?Andrews:\nA-Alright... ...Phoenix:\n(That's it. That's when Franziska planted this idea into her head... She must have told Ms. Andrews to not testify if things looked bad.)Mia:\nYou did a good job proving everything up to this point, Phoenix. But there is still one thing you haven't done.Phoenix:\nSomething I haven't done...?Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh. What's wrong, Wright? Are you finished already? Run out of evidence?Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nWhat is so humorous, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nI'm sure you realize this as well, Your Honor... But, everything the good lawyer here has proven up to this point is meaningless.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Edgeworth:\nEverything you have proven is circumstantial.Phoenix:\nCircumstantial...?Edgeworth:\nYes, circumstantial. You have yet to provide a single piece of definitive proof. Proof that Ms. Andrews, did in fact, harbor a wish to murder Mr. Corrida!Judge:\nM-Ms. Andrews! You... Did you want to kill Mr. Corrida...?Andrews:\nI believe this may lead to me incriminating myself, so I will abstain from answering.Judge:\nBut Ms. Andrews... If you do that, it would be the same as admitting your guilt, don't you think...?Andrews:\nMaybe so, or maybe not. There is nothing to prove it either way. Besides, you don't even know what crime I would be \"guilty\" of due to my silence.Phoenix:\n(NO!! She's taking that defiant attitude again!) M-Mia! What should we do...?Mia:\nSomehow, we've landed in the worst possible situation.Judge:\nI think we have reached a certain conclusion at this point in time. Ms. Adrian Andrews has refused to testify. And the defense's theory that she is the actual murderer... has not been fully substantiated with solid, definitive proof.Phoenix:\nBut! That's not true!Judge:\nIn this situation, there is only one thing this court can do. And that is to declare a recess.Phoenix:\nR-Recess...!?Judge:\nI request that both the prosecution and the defense look further into this matter. And at tomorrow's trial...Phoenix:\n(T-Tomorrow...!? We don't have a \"tomorrow\"! If we don't get a not guilty verdict today, then...)Phoenix:Phoenix:\nPlease wait, Your Honor! Th...That's not necessary! The trial... Please continue the trial!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you sweating for...? Your client is getting one more day to live, isn't he?Phoenix:\nThat... That's not it! This isn't about that. Edgeworth! I know you know who the real killer is! Please... Let the trial continue! If I don't get the verdict... then Maya...Edgeworth:\n...?Judge:\nBut it's impossible to continue as long as the witness refuses to testify. Now then, this court is...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nIt is not impossible for this trial to continue.Andrews:\n...!Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you...Edgeworth:\nIt's true Ms. Andrews holds the right against self-incrimination; however, if the topic of conversation were something unrelated to whatever she may be guilty of, then she has no right to withhold testimony!Judge:\nY-Yes, that is very true, but...Edgeworth:\nActually, there is one little thing that I'm curious about. Ms. Andrews.Andrews:\n...Edgeworth:\nWhen you found the victim's dead body, you poured yourself a glass of juice.Andrews:\nY-Yes... And...?Edgeworth:\nI can't help but think how unnatural that is. Usually when one finds a body, they are shaken up, not stirring a glass of juice.Andrews:\nSo my actions were \"unusual\"? But I've already...Edgeworth:\nBefore you speak, I want to state that if you have a reason behind your actions, I would like you to testify to that effect.Andrews:\nTestify...!?Edgeworth:\nYour Honor! I would like to request that the witness testify again as to what happened when she first discovered the victim's body! Whatever we find out in this testimony should in no way implicate the witness.Judge:\nHmm...Mia:\nI don't know what it is about Edgeworth today, but I can't get a good read off of him. Is he friend or foe? I just don't know...Judge:\nThe court acknowledges the prosecution's request. Ms. Andrews, if you please.Witness Testimony-- When I Found the Body --Andrews:\nThat glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.\nI was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.\nAnd Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.\nWhen I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.\nTo be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.\nWhen I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.Judge:\nHmm... So you poured that glass of juice for the victim. Why didn't you say so in your earlier testimony?Andrews:\n...I didn't think I needed to include something so trivial.Mia:\nPhoenix. Please be careful here. If you can't find anything wrong with this testimony, then there's nothing left...Phoenix:\nI know. (Edgeworth... What the heck is going on in that brain of yours...?)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination",

That woman couldn't do anything like that.Phoenix:\nIn court today, there will be a mountain of evidence that will implicate you.Engarde:\nA mountain of evidence...?Phoenix:\nI'm certain there is someone out there trying very hard to pin this whole thing on you.Engarde:\nPlease, Mr. Lawyer! Dude, like I said yesterday... I'm \"refreshing like a spring breeze\", alright? I can't let any sort of scandal ruin that.Phoenix:\nI understand...???:\nWell, it's almost time.Phoenix:\nMia...Mia:\nWe must get a complete acquittal today.Phoenix:\nI know... But I can't focus on Maya's situation right now. (Changed from [I can't focus on Maya's situation right now.] in the original release) ...Or Pearls' either. No matter what, I have to focus on winning this case by the end of the day!Mia:\nIndeed. Well, let's get going!...*beep beep beep*...Phoenix:\n(It's him!)...*beep*...Phoenix:\nThis is Wright!???:\nGood morning. This is it, Mr. Attorney; the day of the trial.Phoenix:\nMaya... She's unharmed, right!????:\nWell... When I checked on her earlier this morning, she seemed a bit, how shall we say, tired.Phoenix:\n...!???:\nDon't worry. People don't die that easily. Besides, what you really should be concentrating on, is winning today's trial.Phoenix:\nG...Grrrr...???:\nFor my sake, as well as yours, you must win today's trial. (Changed from [For myself, you must win today's trial.] in the original release) Which is why... I sent you a little present this morning.Phoenix:\nPresent? What in the world would you want to give me!????:\nYou'll figure it out once the trial starts... And even if you don't \"like\" my gift... (Changed from [You'll figure it out once the trial opens... even if you don't 'like' my gift...] in the original release) I expect you to graciously accept it, and win the day's contest... If you please.Phoenix:\nWait!...*beep*...Phoenix:\n(The kidnapper sent me a \"present\"...?)Engarde:\nMr. Lawyer dude? Who was that...?Phoenix:\nAh, um... No one. It has nothing to do with you, so forget you heard anything!Engarde:\n...Dude, did your nose just get longer?March 22, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Matt Engarde. Are the prosecution and defense ready?Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\n... I say! Mr. Wright! What happened to Ms. von Karma!?Phoenix:\nI-I don't know, Your Honor! (Why are you getting mad at me!?)Bailiff:\n...Your Honor!Judge:\nPlease be quiet, bailiff. Court is in session. If you must tell me something, please keep it brief. Now then, what is it?Bailiff:\nProsecutor... Prosecutor von Karma has... This morning, Ms. von Karma was shot by an unknown gunman!Judge:\n... WWWWWWWHAT!?Phoenix:\nSh-Shot!?Mia:\nSomehow... I think this is the \"present\" that man was talking about.Phoenix:\nHis \"present\"...!Mia:\nMs. von Karma is one of the top prosecutors in the country at the moment. If she were to disappear... (Changed from [If she disappeared...] in the original release) it would be to your \"advantage\". (Changed from [This would be to your 'advantage'.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Th-This... This is totally insane!) M-Ms. von Karma! Is she alright!?Judge:\nI don't have that answer! ...???:\nShe's alive and in stable condition.Judge:\nThat's good... Phew. ... ...! Y-Y-You're...Phoenix:\n(I thought he'd show up...)Edgeworth:\n...Your Honor... Due to the circumstances, Ms. Franziska von Karma can not appear in court today. I, Miles Edgeworth, will be taking her place. The prosecution is ready... naturally.Edgeworth:\nMs. von Karma was shot in her right shoulder, and is currently undergoing surgery. Luckily, I have looked this case over and am familiar with the details. The prosecution seeks to prove the guilt of Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge:\nTh-The court acknowledges the prosecution.Edgeworth:\n...Wright. I finally found the answer I was struggling for on my long journey this past year. By the time this case comes to an end, you too, will know the answer.Phoenix:\n...!Edgeworth:\nNow then, the prosecution would like to call its first witness... Please bring Detective Gumshoe to the witness stand!Edgeworth:\nWitness, your name and occupation.Gumshoe:\nMy name's Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm a detective down at the precinct... for now.Judge:\n\"For now\"...?Gumshoe:\nAfter this trial's over... I'm supposed to turn in my badge, sir.Phoenix:\n(D-Detective Gumshoe...)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution has no need for a depressed witness. Lift your head up and face forward like a proud officer, Detective Dick Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!Edgeworth:\nNow, let's have your testimony. If we want to explore the various facets of this case, we must start with that.Mia:\nGet ready, Phoenix. This is going to be one very rough fight.Phoenix:\nYeah... It would have to be with Edgeworth as my opponent.  (The answer he was \"struggling\" for... Interesting... Show me this \"answer\" you finally found, Edgeworth...)Witness Testimony-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:\nHmm... After the award ceremony ended, the victim was alone in his room...?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! Both the victim and defendant went alone to their rooms, sir.Judge:\nI see. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Bare Facts of the Case --Gumshoe:\nThis murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you please give us a brief timeline of what happened after the ceremony?\nGumshoe:\nOK, pal. The ceremony started at 6 PM. It ended around 8 PM... and then there was a short break. A special post-ceremony show was supposed to start in the lobby 30 minutes later.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when the victim's body was found, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nWhich is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period.\nJudge:\nHmm... Please continue with your testimony, Detective.Gumshoe:\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe person who discovered the victim's body was Adrian Andrews, correct?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Adrian Andrews\" you're talking about?\nGumshoe:\nShe's the defendant, Matt Engarde's, manager. She's a really pretty lady... sir.\nJudge:\nAh, so she's a pretty lady... I wonder if she will grace us with her presence...\nGumshoe:\nWhen the post-ceremony show was about to start, she went to get Mr. Engarde. After visiting his room, she next went to the victim's room to get him for the show, sir.\nJudge:\nI see... And that's when she found the victim's body...Gumshoe:\nAfter looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana.\nJudge:\nMmm... \"Banana\"...\nGumshoe:\nUm, his \"bandana\", sir... That's the thing wrapped tightly around his neck, sir.\nJudge:\nAh, yes, yes. I see. His banana-scented bandana.\nPhoenix:\nThen, what about the knife...?\nGumshoe:\nIt seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death.\nJudge:\nHmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe cause of death... Wasn't that because Mr. Corrida was stabbed in the chest...?\nGumshoe:\nOnly a careless amateur would believe something so brainless as that, pal. Take a good, hard look at the crime photo. Now, a real pro's attention would be drawn here, to this bandana.\nJudge:\nMmm... \"Banana\"...\nGumshoe:\nUm, his \"bandana\", sir...

His banana-scented bandana.\nPhoenix:\nThen, what about the knife...?\nGumshoe:\nIt seems to have been stuck in the victim's chest on purpose after his death.\nJudge:\nHmm... We have a crafty murderer on our hands here.Gumshoe:\nAt first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal. The Jammin' Ninja doesn't go anywhere without his bright red guitar. And we couldn't find it anywhere at the scene of the crime.\nJudge:\nOh! Then how about this theory! A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...\nGuitar Case updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you think that?\nGumshoe:\nBecause it was empty, pal.

A fan really wanted the guitar and did the crime to get it! How's that!?\nGumshoe:\nUm, we thought of that too... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nThe only fingerprints on the guitar case were the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim's, huh...?\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. Ah, so much for my theory then...Gumshoe:\nHowever, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat convinced you it had nothing to do with the case?\nGumshoe:\nThe guitar wasn't at the Gatewater Hotel that night.\nJudge:\nWell then, where was it?\nGumshoe:\nThe bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir.\nJudge:\nSo you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar.\nPhoenix:\nSo that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all.\nJudge:\nHmm...Mia:\nOur first order of business should be to gather more info from his testimony.Phoenix:\nBut there might be a trap set up for us somewhere...Mia:\nMaybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.Phoenix:\nIf you say so...Mia:\nOf course, we're supposed to escape from them too, wouldn't you say?After pressing third, fourth and fifth statements:Edgeworth:\nI believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWhich brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.Phoenix:\n(Here it comes... Looks like Edgeworth's back in full swing...)Judge:\nVery well. Detective Gumshoe, please testify about this matter.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Judge:\nHmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.Gumshoe:\nIt was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.Knife added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\n...And there's this button.Judge:\nThat was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?Gumshoe:\nYes, and we know that the blood on it is the victim's blood, sir.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Jammin' Ninja's Button added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAll of this points very clearly to the defendant, doesn't it?Edgeworth:\nYes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?Phoenix:\nHmph! I'll find the hole in your argument somehow!Edgeworth:\nYou can press as hard as you'd like. Just hurry up with your usual pointless questions.Phoenix:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Cross Examination-- Why Arrest Engarde? --Gumshoe:\nMatt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut in terms of popularity, Mr. Engarde won, did he not?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah. But you know what's ironic, pal? Juan Corrida was always one step behind Mr. Engarde in everything. This year it seemed like he'd finally caught up, ready for the big, final showdown.\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Corrida lost the Grand Prix in the end...\nJudge:\nThat is too bad... He must have been pretty downhearted after losing.\nEdgeworth:\n...Gumshoe:\nThey each thought the other guy was \"in his way\". That's motive enough in my book.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait just one second here! Mr. Engarde was beating Mr. Corrida in the popularity polls!\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah, I guess, but...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that in the defendant's eyes, the victim was not a rival at all! Which means he had no motive to kill at all!\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, I quite agree. Well, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUm, it's not... Well... I guess if you put it that way, then yeah, the defendant would've had no motive...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective. I'm beginning to see why you were fired.\nGumshoe:\nEh!? N-No! Not you too, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! That's...\nEdgeworth:\nI look forward to your pension negotiations.\nGumshoe:\nN-N-N-NOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Detective. Let's continue with the testimony.\nGumshoe:\n*sniffle* Noooo... Not my poor pension too...\nEdgeworth:\nDetective! If you value your money, I suggest you proceed!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! We can talk about my pension later, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Um, what about what I was saying...? Hello? Anyone...?)Gumshoe:\nAs for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any proof that button belonged to the victim?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nOh. Umm, let me put it this way... I'm asking you if you have any evidence to back up your claim that, \"this button was ripped off of the Jammin' Ninja's costume\".\nGumshoe:\nHuh? But can't you tell by just looking at it?\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nA-And the victim's blood is on it.\nPhoenix:\nAnyone could have smeared that blood on there afterward.\nGumshoe:\n... M-M-Mr. Edgeworth... Help me... sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I knew it had to be this piece of evidence. Now to reel this one in...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Thread.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nThe button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! They're a perfect match, pal!\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nMia:\nThat's Edgeworth for you. Never misses a beat.Gumshoe:\nIt was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's \"hakama\".Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhen was this button found?\nGumshoe:\nPretty soon after the body was found, we rounded up everyone who knew Mr. Corrida. And then we did a search on them all. That's when we found the button.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was almost immediately after the murder...\nEdgeworth:\nThe police didn't have the free time to lollygag and play tricks, unlike some people...\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! What is he trying to say about me here?)Gumshoe:\nThe defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow were the fingerprints arranged on the knife?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What do you mean, pal?\nPhoenix:\nBy examining the fingerprints, you can determine how the defendant held the knife. For example, did he hold it normally, or overhand...?\nGumshoe:\nOh! Is that what you meant!? Well, we didn't actually think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe the bumbling of this department...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Hopeless. Were you paying attention to the testimony, Wright? The defendant's fingerprints were \"all over\" the knife. There is no way to determine how the knife was held at the moment of the murder.\nJudge:\nHmm... So is the defendant the owner of this knife, then?Gumshoe:\nThe defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way this was a premeditated murder, even if he bought the knife!\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. This isn't just some pocket knife. It's not really useful for anything, and you can't just walk around with it either.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Well, this is not good... If the prosecution can prove it was a premeditated murder, we're done for...)\nMia:\n...Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nThere's something very interesting about what the detective said just now. Think carefully, before it's too late.Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"Phoenix:\n(A button covered in the victim's blood... And a knife with Engarde's fingerprints!)Mia:\nBe grateful. If the judge were more rash, he would've already pounded his gavel in closing.Phoenix:\nWe're still in a world of trouble...Mia:\nWell, before any battle, you must find your enemy's weakness. So let's find the weakness in this testimony, no matter how small it may be, OK Phoenix?Phoenix:\nWait a second!Gumshoe:\nWh-What?Phoenix:\nSo the basis of your argument that this was a premeditated murder is simply that my client \"bought a knife beforehand\"?Gumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. The defendant...Phoenix:\n...Did not buy this knife.Gumshoe:\nH-Huh!?Phoenix:\nTake a good look at the handle of this knife, and you'll know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe:\n...Huh?Judge:\nIt has a \"Gatewater\" seal set into the handle...Gumshoe:\n\"Gatewater\"...? I think I've heard that name somewhere before.Phoenix:\nThat's the name of the hotel. The Gatewater Hotel.Gumshoe:\n... Uh oh.Phoenix:\nThe murder knife was actually property of the hotel! Which means this murder was not premeditated!Judge:\nYes, that is very true! This is a very big...Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...Judge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but the defense is simply too careless.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nI think whether the crime was premeditated or not... has already been determined.Phoenix:\nH-How so!?Edgeworth:\nI admit this knife is hotel property. There is no one currently on the police force that is dumb enough not to realize this.Gumshoe:\n...But I didn't kn... Oh... *whimper*Edgeworth:\nThe question is... Where did this knife come from?Judge:\nWh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...Edgeworth:\nSorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.Judge:\nThere is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?Edgeworth:\nIf it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that Mr. Matt Engarde's knife was missing.Phoenix:\nUrk...Edgeworth:\nMr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.Judge:\nAmazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.Mia:\nIt seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...Phoenix:\n(This must be one of those \"traps\", and I just walked headlong into it!)Judge:\nA murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.Edgeworth:\nI can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.Phoenix:\n(Evidence not yet shown...?)Mia:\nHe means evidence that the court hasn't seen yet. In other words, new evidence.Judge:\nWhat does the defense have to say about this, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nUm, well...Mia:\nPhoenix. The judge is favoring the prosecution right now. If we answer with something wrong here...Phoenix:\n(That gavel of his will be ringing out to the sound of our defeat!)Judge:\nMr. Wright, do you have something important and necessary to present to this court?Actually, I do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"No, not right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This has to be another trap! Better if I don't say anything than risk throwing out a bad piece of evidence.)\nJudge:\nLooks like the defense isn't saying a peep on this one.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means this court is adjourned.\nMia:\nPhoenix! We will lose this case if you give up here! So you had better show the judge something! Quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Slow down! We all know I have a tendency to be wrong more than... I can't even say it!)\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's one...\"Phoenix:\nThere's one...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nOne piece of evidence that catches my attention. Something that this court has yet to see!Judge:\nMr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.Edgeworth:\nWhat the judge is saying, Wright, is don't try pulling one of your usual bluffs here.Phoenix:\n(If I mess this up, it's curtains for all of us!)Judge:\nYou may now present one, and only one piece of evidence. Now then, what is this important evidence that you must show to the court?Present Wine Glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This... is a wine glass, is it not?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, Wright, but this time, your bluffing steered you wrong.\nJudge:\nI can see nothing strange about this piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait!\nJudge:\nI am a man of my word, Mr. Wright!\nInfinite penaltyJudge:\nThis... is a wine glass, is it not?Phoenix:\nPlease look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... Well, yes, I see your point.Phoenix:\nHowever! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!Judge:\n...Gumshoe:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nW-Well? What do you all have to say...?Judge:\nAh, well, yes, it is a little peculiar...Phoenix:\nY-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!Judge:\nYou can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nWhat is it, Your Honor?Judge:\nYour opinion...Edgeworth:\n...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.Phoenix:\n...What!?Edgeworth:\nIt's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.Judge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Could Ms. Andrews really have set that glass down without thinking...?)It's possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It's possible that is what happened. There's nothing that points to Ms. Andrews not being the one who set the cup down. And if I raise an objection here, that would only make the judge slam his gavel down...)\nMia:\nYou can't think like that, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nRight now, you're hanging on by a very thin thread. Anything else you can grab onto right now is better than nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(So in other words, push as far as we can go...)\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"There's no way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I appear weak here, the trial is over. I can look for my proof later! For now, I should trust my instinct and point with certainty!)\nMia:\nThey just might fall for it, if you're thought-provoking enough!\nLeads to:\n\"The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory.\"Phoenix:\nThe defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!Judge:\nHmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?Phoenix:\n(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)Edgeworth:\nUnlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Edgeworth:\nYou're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?Phoenix:\nTh-Then...Edgeworth:\nOf course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.Phoenix:\nFingerprints...Edgeworth:\nThere were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.Judge:\nOnly one? Well, whose were they!?Edgeworth:\nThey were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nThat is why I said that the person who had discovered the body had left it there. Are we done here, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)Edgeworth:\nMs. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.Judge:\nHmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.Phoenix:\nGrrr!Edgeworth:\nI've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a \"prosecutor\". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!Judge:\nW-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...Edgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.Phoenix:\n\"Another witness\"...?Edgeworth:\nYes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!Mia:\nWhat in the world is Mr. Edgeworth thinking?Edgeworth:\nNow then, witness, please state your name and occupation...Oldbag:\n...Edgeworth:\n... Witness! Your name and occupation, please!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Edgeworth:\nUurrngh!Oldbag:\n...Heh. G.O.T.C.H.A!Edgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Phoenix:\n(I wonder what happened to that calm composure he had earlier...)Oldbag:\nOh, Edgey-boy! It's been what, a year since we last met, hasn't it? You should be more happy to see me!Edgeworth:\nI saw the report with her testimony, but who knew that under that helmet... it was the wicked witch of the witness stand!?Oldbag:\nI tell you, this time I know what I'm supposed to do! So today, I'm going to tell you anything and everything! Even things that don't have to do with that terrible crime.Judge:\nMs... Witness... \"That terrible crime\" is all this court needs to know.Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nOof!Oldbag:\nShush! I'm talking to my dear Edgey-Wedgey right now! Don't interrupt us, gramps!Judge:\nYes, madam.Edgeworth:\nNo no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.Oldbag:\nIt's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?Edgeworth:\nThe witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag:\nIt was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!Judge:\nYou mean... You were a fan of the victim?Oldbag:\nLook, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!Phoenix:\n(Um... But those two were the same age...)Oldbag:\nAnyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.Edgeworth:\nVery well. Please tell the court what you witnessed the night of the murder.Oldbag:\nLeave it to me, Edgey-poo!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Judge:\nHmm... So Mr. Engarde came out from the victim's room...Oldbag:\nSee! It has to be him! He's the murderer!Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- What You Witnessed --Oldbag:\nAnyway, after the ceremony, I went to pace around in the hallway in front of his room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag, what was your post on that night?\nOldbag:\nThe lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it was a good thing the show didn't go on...)\nOldbag:\nBesides, that manager with the glasses seemed to be working hard at it without me. So I thought I'd take a break and spread my wings a little.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you went to hang around the victim's door?Oldbag:\nThere was something I was interested in finding out, you know...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSomething you were \"interested\" in? And just what was that?\nOldbag:\nIt's not some little thing I can just go around telling everyone, you know. It's top secret, between me and Juan. Ah, and Edgey, of course.\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What is this thing she was \"interested\" in...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have no idea. I despise gossip, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Gossip\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nIf this has something to do with the case, then you can append it to your testimony.\nMia:\nIt looks like we shouldn't force it right now.\nJudge:\nHmm... And did the witness stay in the vicinity of the victim's door the entire time?Oldbag:\nWell, since I was on the job, I made sure to keep a good eye out the whole time.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nOh? Then would you tell us the number of people who went in and out of Mr. Corrida's room?\nOldbag:\nI have no idea! I wasn't born so I could count things for those who didn't pay attention in class! That's why ever since I turned 20, I quit keeping track of how old I really am!\nJudge:\n...Yes, well, that would explain why your age was not recorded in the report.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... The witness then saw someone, correct?Oldbag:\nThat's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho in the world was that!?\nOldbag:\nI'm not allowed to say! This sort of information has to be carefully guarded from the masses, sonny. The man that came out of Juan's room... It was... He was...\nJudge:\nYes...? He was...?\nOldbag:\n... Ah! I'm too scared! I can't say his name out loud!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, what I wouldn't give to have Franziska's whip right about now...)\nOldbag:\nWell, I guess I can tell you, since he was such a bad boy anyway.Oldbag:\nIt was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get a sense of déjà vu? Maybe to avoid a repeat of last year, I should delve into this a bit further... (Changed from [Maybe to avoid a mess like last year, I should delve into this a bit further...] in the original release))\n\n\n\nThe person's face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's face in more detail!\nOldbag:\nYou don't need me to tell you about his face! That soft, gentle look in his eyes and his effeminate lips! His right eye covered by his silky hair! His sparkling, shining teeth!\nPhoenix:\nHis teeth were... shining?\nOldbag:\nWell, he's shining all around in this week's pin-up poster, dearie.\nPhoenix:\n... This week's pin-up...? Why do you... I mean! I don't care how he looks in this week's issue! Please stay with what you saw that night!\nOldbag:\nWhat? Engarde's face is the same no matter where it is, right, you whippersnapper!?\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth. That's more valuable than gold to me!\nPhoenix:\n(And my intelligence seems to have reverted to that of a toddler...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course it was important, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThen perhaps you would like to point out what part of that testimony was important!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't really have to put it that way to get me to say...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the person was carrying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was the man you saw carrying?\nOldbag:\nIn which hand? His right or his left?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nAh, now this is a real mess. I mean, I can't be expected to answer such a vague question!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Please be more specific with your question, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... What was the man you saw carrying in his right hand?\nOldbag:\nAh, he wasn't carrying anything in that hand.\nPhoenix:\nThen how about his left?\nOldbag:\nEmpty.\nPhoenix:\n... (Well, this whole thing has been a lot of nothing...)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable? If not, I suggest you learn.\nOldbag:\nYou've wasted three minutes of this woman's youth.

There is something much more valuable than a person's pride. And that is \"time\". Please don't waste this court's precious time with worthless questions!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... (I think I just wasted his good favor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nThe person's clothes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell the court about the man's clothes in more detail!\nOldbag:\nWhat a troublesome man you are. Really, as if something like that matters.\nPhoenix:\nBut it does.\nOldbag:\nUm... Now what was it... Oh, yes, it was that thing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat thing?\nOldbag:\nThat gaudy thing he's always wearing. That racing jacket.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, he was wearing that at the detention center too...)\nOldbag:\nThat thing's meant for nothing but seducing women out of their pantaloons! Hmph! Men!!\nPhoenix:\nUm, right...\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright. Was this testimony just now important or relevant in any way?\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\n\n\n\nIt was not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess it really wasn't that important after all.\nJudge:\n*sigh* Mr. Wright, do you know why we say time is valuable?

I request what the witness said about the jacket be appended to her testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't quite see where you're going with this, but alright. Witness, please...\nOldbag:\nAh well, I don't like to badmouth anyone without reason, but if I must...\nAdds statement \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw my client!? Are you sure about that!?\nOldbag:\nYessey!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnnoying brat! When I say I saw someone, I saw that person!\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I'm going to have to press a little harder on this one... There's got to be some sort of huge contradiction I can find here...)Oldbag:\nHe was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure the defendant was wearing a racing jacket?\nOldbag:\nWhat do you think? It's not like I've seen him in anything other than that horrible thing. I'm sure he was wearing it!\nPhoenix:\n(She is so sure of herself that it's to the point of self-absorption...)Present Jammin' Ninja's Button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Oldbag...\"Mia:\nShe may not remember things or be mistaken here and there, but I don't think she's lying.Phoenix:\nThat's bad for us. Really bad.Mia:\nBut, that's how the human mind is. It also has the tendency to jump off-topic. She's strayed onto a few interesting side-topics this time too, hasn't she? But that's what makes her a sweet old lady, right?Phoenix:\n(That's because you're not the one who has to question her...)Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag...Oldbag:\nWhat!? Don't say my name for no reason!Phoenix:\nDo you know what this is?Oldbag:\nAaaah! It's button number 2 on the Jammin' Ninja's costume!Phoenix:\n(Now I KNOW she's an obsessed fan... She identified it in a single glance!)Oldbag:\nGive it here! Give it here! If you don't give it to me, I'll punish you with this!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Phoenix:\n(Wow... She really is a die-hard fan to want a button covered in blood...) This button was discovered on Mr. Engarde's body during a full body search.Oldbag:\nSee! See! This button proves beyond a shadow of a doubt it was that rascal Engarde!Phoenix:\nIt was caught up in the pleats of his Nickel Samurai hakama pants.Oldbag:\nSee! See! And Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!Phoenix:\n...Witness! Now, it may just be me, and I do have an active imagination, but just now, didn't you say that the defendant... Matt Engarde was wearing his \"usual racing jacket\"!?Oldbag:\n... ... ... Ah... I'm so sorry. Sorry that you judge people based on what they wear! If I wore the trendiest dress, then maybe you'd think I was the most gorgeous woman ever! But instead, I have to put up with wearing this ridiculous-looking outfit. You'd agree this outfit is hideous, right? I've got a tape recorder stuck on my chest! Lemme tell you, it's HEAVY! So heavy, I wish we would have switched to CDs ages ago! But I'm keeping that dream alive for all those kids out there, I work hard with a smile on my face, don't you understand!? Now, take a look in the mirror. Your clothes are about as interesting as a documentary on curling! You should take a tip or ten from Edgey-poo. Now HE'S got style!Ray Gun:\n*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*Judge:\nNow hold your tongue still there for one second! So what you saw in actuality, was not Mr. Engarde, the man... but Mr. Engarde, the Nickel Samurai!?Oldbag:\nBut when you think about it... They're really one and the same anyway...Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! This is a very important point we're talking about!Oldbag:\nEdgey-poo! Do you think so too?Edgeworth:\nWell, it might be something worth considering. (Changed from [Well, it might be something worth thinking about.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nJust say, \"It's important\" and agree with me for a change!Judge:\nWitness! Think carefully and try to remember as much as you can before you testify!Oldbag:\n*sigh* Alright, if you insist.Phoenix:\n(I should be the one sighing, not you!)Witness Testimony-- Who I Saw --Oldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Phoenix:\nI... I knew it... I knew you'd say he was inside that costume!Oldbag:\nWhat? Did you think there could've been someone else inside that costume? Don't be a bad little boy, thinking such rude things.Phoenix:\nBut... But the possibility does exist!Oldbag:\nAh, young'uns today. I told you, there is no way it was anyone else.Judge:\nH-How do you know that?Oldbag:\nBecause... I said so. And what I say is the truth.Phoenix:\n(At least she's just as delightful a witness as she was a year ago...)Judge:\nMr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- Who I Saw --Oldbag:\nEngarde... Engarde... Yes, now I remember!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you please get on with your testimony!\nOldbag:\nHmph! Watch your language, young man! What sort of tone is that to take with an elder! My youthfulness isn't what it used to be, so you should forgive me for everything! If you keep on barking at me like that, I'll start singing at the top of my lungs!\nPhoenix:\nUh, what?\nOldbag:\n\"A striking figure by the sea, standing all alone is he. He's the Nickel Samurai!\"\nPhoenix:\n(...She's actually singing... Someone help my poor ears.)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Can you please do something about this racket!?\nEdgeworth:\nWitness. I'll give you a piece of gum later if you'll be good and stick to just the facts.\nOldbag:\nOKAAAAAAAY! ... You promise, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I'll be sending the bill for the chewing gum to your office at a later date.\nPhoenix:\n(Remind me to send you a thank you note later too, Edgeworth, old chum...)Oldbag:\nThe Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBe a little more careful with your testimony, please! Not too long ago, you said he was wearing his \"racing jacket\", and now he's not!?\nOldbag:\n\"Not too long ago\"...? Then let me ask you this! When you were itty-bitty, what was your grand dream?\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nOldbag:\nWhat did you want to be when you grew up, whippersnapper!?\nPhoenix:\nMy dream, huh...? Well, I... uh, wanted to be Judge Wackner, hero of the Public's Court. So what!?\nOldbag:\nSee! And look at where you are now! You're not Judge Wackner, are you!? Are you!?\nPhoenix:\nWell...\nOldbag:\n\"What I said earlier\"... Who puts any weight into things like that!? The \"now\" is everything! I can't be held responsible for the \"past\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did court become theatrics over testimonies?)\nOldbag:\nAll that matters is that man was inside that costume. Isn't that enough!?Oldbag:\nYes, it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why would that be?\nOldbag:\nThat way, no one could see his face, of course!\nPhoenix:\nBut there's still no advantage for him that I can see. In fact, you would think the costume would make him stand out all the more!\nOldbag:\n... You are such a annoying child, you know that? You disagree with everything I say...\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that what YOU'RE always doing to me!?)\nOldbag:\nI got it! Maybe it was more troublesome for him to change in and out of his costume!Oldbag:\nHe had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas there anyone else scheduled to appear at the post-ceremony show?\nOldbag:\nWell, all the contestants were supposed to go onstage in a friendly gesture thing.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that included the Jammin' Ninja...?\nOldbag:\nOf course it included him! That's why when Engarde came out of dear Juan's room, I didn't give it a second thought.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nOldbag:\nWell, anyway.Oldbag:\nSo he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo let me ask you one last time. The person you saw, it really was the Nickel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nAs showy as ever. Haven't I been saying that from the very beginning!?\nPhoenix:\n(Can I throw in the towel yet?)Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Please take a look at this.\"Phoenix:\nHmm...Mia:\nYou don't need to think too hard on this one.Phoenix:\nHuh?Mia:\nThere's a contradiction in her testimony and it's sitting in plain sight. The question is what that contradiction means for us...Phoenix:\n(Well, I have to figure out what you're talking about first, but OK...)Phoenix:\nPlease take a look at this.Oldbag:\nYeah, so, it's a knife. Big deal. If you're trying to scare me with that, I'll have you know it won't work!Phoenix:\nNo no, that's not my intention at all...Judge:\nThat's the knife that was used in the murder, correct?Phoenix:\nYour Honor. Do you know why this piece of evidence is important to this case?Judge:\nYou don't even have to ask. It's because the defendant's fingerprints are on it.Edgeworth:\n... Is that what you're driving at...?Phoenix:\nThat is exactly what I am driving at.Judge:\nWhat are we driving at? And whose car are we driving?Phoenix:\nIf Mr. Engarde was really in the Nickel Samurai costume at the time of the murder, then it's impossible for his fingerprints to have been left on this knife! Actually, he would have wiped all previous fingerprints on this knife right off!Judge:\nOh, that's right! The Nickel Samurai wears gloves, doesn't he?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHe probably took his gloves off before he began the stabbing!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nAnd why would he do something like that? To leave his prints on the murder weapon? There is no way he would do something like that!Edgeworth:\nHowever, there is one possibility!Phoenix:\nThen let's hear your \"possibility\"!Edgeworth:\nIt's very simple. The defendant went to the victim's room while in costume as the Nickel Samurai. At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder. He was probably just going to relax and talk with the victim about the stage show. Which is why he took his gloves off!Judge:\nHmm... But the murder still did take place...Edgeworth:\nIt's well known that there was bad blood between the defendant and the victim. (Changed from [It's well known that the defendant and the victim had bad blood between them.] in the original release)Judge:\nHmm, yes... I have heard that before... (Changed from [Hmm, yes... I have heard of that...] in the original release) Well, Mr. Wright? What do you have to say about Mr. Edgeworth's theory...?Phoenix:\n(So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this: When the defendant went to the victim's room, he had no intentions of killing him. Now, up to this point, are there any problems with his theory...?)There are no problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... I can't see any real problems with his theory...)\nMia:\nBut if you let Edgeworth's theory stand, then we're one very large step closer to a guilty verdict. Look at the Court Record again and take another shot at it.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I just have to think about it one more time...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please make your decision soon.\nLeads back to:\n\"So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this:\"There is a contradiction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!\"Think about it one more time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I think I need a little more time on this one.)\nLeads back to:\n\"So let me get this straight. Edgeworth's theory goes like this:\"Phoenix:\nThis theory contradicts something in an earlier testimony!Edgeworth:\nWh-What are you babbling about...?Phoenix:\nNow, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer. If that's the case, I think it's impossible for the killer to have gone to the victim's room without intent!Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nNaturally, you point to the one piece with the least value... but with such vigor! Enjoy your energy while you can. Humans don't live forever... Neither do lawyers.\nJudge:\nYou sure like to think you can bluff your way out of things, don't you?\nMia:\nPhoenix, pay attention! Let's pretend for a second that Mr. Engarde is the murderer. Now from that angle, if he didn't have a murderous intent from the very beginning, then that means there is a certain object that shouldn't be at the crime scene, right?\nPhoenix:\n(\"A certain thing\"...? What certain thing...?)\nEdgeworth:\nHow are you doing over there? Busy collecting your thoughts?\nPhoenix:\n(Alright, let's give this one more try... and with even more spirit this time!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now, for argument sake, let's suppose Mr. Engarde was the killer.\"Phoenix:\nThis knife. This was used by Mr. Engarde at dinner.Judge:\nY-Yes, we did establish that.Phoenix:\nWhich means that if my client was, in fact, the killer... Then he brought this knife with him when he went to visit Mr. Corrida.Edgeworth:\nI suppose...Phoenix:\nHowever, you just said it yourself. \"At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder.\" If that were true, then why would he bring a knife!? He wouldn't, would he!?Edgeworth:\nHmm...Phoenix:\nWhich means, Mr. Edgeworth, your theory was flawed from supposition one! And one more thing! If the murderer was wearing the costume at the time of the murder... Then there should be glove marks left on the knife! Which means the defendant's fingerprints shouldn't be all over it like bees on a hive!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nAnd that brings me to my final point... This knife was planted by the real killer to hide their identity and mislead us!Judge:\nO-Order! Order, I say! Order in the court!! Was this knife really planted by the killer!? Why would the murderer do such a thing!?To hide the murder method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's to hide the way in which the murder was carried out, of course!\nEdgeworth:\nM-More of your nonsense!?\nPhoenix:\nTake another good look at the autopsy report! The victim actually died from strangulation! The killer tried to hide thisx by stabbing a knife into thex victim's chest!\nJudge:\nBut doesn't the autopsy admit that the cause of death was strangulation?\nPhoenix:\nWell, yes, the real cause of death was easily discovered...\nEdgeworth:\nThen I'd say the knife did a terrible job of \"concealing\" this fact!\nPhoenix:\n... Aha ha ha...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that laugh doesn't do a very good job of concealing your error either!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! I will ask you one more time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Was this knife really planted by the killer!?\"To frame Matt Engarde.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"It's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!\"Phoenix:\nIt's to frame my client, Mr. Engarde, of course!Judge:\nTo frame...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nA-Aren't you forcing the interpretation just a little too hard on this one!?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut we just established that the witness saw the \"Nickel Samurai\" in costume, and if that were true, then there shouldn't be a single fingerprint on this knife!Edgeworth:\nGrrrrrrrrr! Witneeeeeesssssss!!Oldbag:\n... Looks like I've made your life a tiny bit more difficult, huh Edgey-poo...?

(Changed from [But I mean, I can't really do anything about that!] in the original release) Look, I was waiting around in front of their doors because, well... Well, I wasn't waiting around for the Nickel Samurai, that's for sure!Phoenix:\n...! (She wasn't waiting for the \"Nickel Samurai\"...?) Alright then... Who were you waiting around for then?Oldbag:\n... Hmph! That's top secret to anyone outside of security!Judge:\nI have a feeling that you were waiting for Mr. Juan Corrida. Am I correct, witness?Oldbag:\nHa ha ha. The way you think, you are a sad amateur with a terrible case of near-sightedness.Judge:\nAmateur...? Me...? What am I an amateur of...?Phoenix:\n(So Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room... But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...)Mia:\nMaybe... Phoenix! Maybe the old bag was waiting around for \"that\" person!Phoenix:\n(Hmm, if it's who I think Mia's hinting at... It's certainly possible...) Ms. Oldbag. You were waiting for this person to come out of the victim's room, weren't you?Present Adrian Andrews profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Who is this person...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nMia:\nWhat are you talking about, Phoenix!? She could've waited until the next century and this would never have appeared!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch... Busted... Guess there's no fooling her.)\nJudge:\nYou two! What do you think you're doing flirting in my courtroom!?\nPhoenix:\nWe weren't doing anything like that... Honest... (Well, back to the drawing board on this one... Oldbag was waiting around in front of the victim's room...)\nLeads back to:\n\"But it doesn't sound like she was waiting to catch a glimpse of Mr. Corrida...\"Judge:\nWho is this person...?Phoenix:\nThis is Adrian Andrews, Mr. Engarde's manager.Judge:\nB-But why would the defendant's manager be in the victim's room...?Edgeworth:\nIt seems that this is the latest rumor in circulation, Your Honor.Judge:\n...Hmm... Oh... This is... Well, this is... Hmm, hmm... Hah, I see...Phoenix:\n(The judge seems to be really into the \"article\"... If it can be called such a thing...)Judge:\nThen this manager with the initials A. A.... Are you saying it's...?Edgeworth:\nAdrian Andrews. Without a doubt, the witness thought so as well.Oldbag:\n... Hmph. Looks like you found me out. Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole \"sworn to confidentiality stuff\" then. (Changed from [Well, that's fine. I can throw away this whole sworn to confidentiality stuff.] in the original release)Judge:\nW-Witness...? What in the world are you...Mia:\nWatch out, Phoenix. I've got a bad feeling about this... A very bad feeling.Oldbag:\nI got some information... Some very secret information from a certain source. So that's why I was doing my own little investigation... In secret, of course.Judge:\nB-But what for...?Oldbag:\nOh, just for myself... Personal reasons and all that.Judge:\n... Well, Mr. Edgeworth. How will you proceed from here?Edgeworth:\nI really don't want to do this, however I cannot simply let this point slide.Judge:\nI see. Very well then. Witness, please testify about this \"secret information\".Oldbag:\nGet ready! This is going to take the wind out of you young'uns!Phoenix:\n(I'm sure we're all capable of handling this...

So I took action!\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!? Nobody else but you and me know yet, OK?Judge:\nThe defendant sent his manager...? What a distasteful topic for this court!Oldbag:\nWhat!? Nobody's above gossip! And isn't there a saying!? \"The truth is never pleasant.\"Phoenix:\n(Never heard that one before...)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. What about this Adrian Andrews person...?Edgeworth:\nWe have looked into this matter, and found that the \"truth\" the article proposes is, in fact, baseless gossip.Judge:\nHmm... But should this be true... Then this proves that the defendant did bear ill-will towards the victim.Phoenix:\n(...So this means I have to smash this rumor once and for all.)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Mia:\nBe careful. The old bag seems rather excited right now.Oldbag:\nThat's right! Engarde is nothing but your average foul-blooded youth!Phoenix:\n(Well, as the old saying goes... You've gotta burn old bags with fire!

A.!\"\nPhoenix:\nBut the name of the magazine this came from is \"Gossip Land\"...\nOldbag:\nWhat? Are you saying that \"gossip\" is all just a pack of lies? Hmph, what do you know? I suppose next you'll swear to me that the \"news\" is 100% truth!\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nOldbag:\nHonestly, sonny. You can't discriminate between the news and gossip!\nJudge:\nYes, discrimination is bad, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Discriminate? When did I do anything like that?)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, Engarde will never get me to say \"touché\"!Oldbag:\nHe thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA scandal...? What do you mean by that?\nOldbag:\nYou're a dimwitted one, aren't you? I can't believe you don't know what a \"scandal\" is! Honestly, what are they teaching kids in middle school these days...?\nPhoenix:\nAh, no no! I wasn't asking what the word \"scandal\" means! Even I know that much!\nOldbag:\nWell! That Engarde thought he could own a monopoly on popularity!Oldbag:\nSo to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou don't have any proof that Mr. Engarde did any such thing!\nOldbag:\nYou must be suffering from shock; the shock of hearing the truth. And now, since you're in so much shock, you can't do anything right!\nPhoenix:\n(You're right, I can't do anything, but boy do I wish I could do something about you.)\nOldbag:\nAlright then, sonny, show me what you've got! Can you show me proof that Engarde didn't bear any ill-will towards Juan!?\n\n\n\nPresent evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm not going to let you push me around that easily!\nOldbag:\nHeh.

Wh-What are you handing it over to me for!?] in the original release)\nOldbag:\nI want you to give that jagged-headed baboon-boy a message for me! Please? Tell him that no matter what he does, the only thing he's good at is failing.\nEdgeworth:\nUm... What she said, Wright! Or should I say... Baboon-boy!\nJudge:\nYes, I agree this isn't much of a piece of evidence...

So I took action!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you mean by \"I took action\"...?\nOldbag:\nLike I already told you, I was lying in wait close to the crime scene! Once that slimy woman came out of Juan's room... I was going to capture her, and teach her a good lesson. Something you young'uns need!\nJudge:\nYou were going to \"teach her a good lesson\"...?\nOldbag:\nI was going to make her eat the damaging beams of my ray gun! Like this!\nJudge:\nN-No, stop!\nOldbag:\nWell, it was too bad that woman didn't come through the door that night.Oldbag:\n...Oh, and this is top secret, you got that!?

You'll get your reward.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I don't want your reward, but you don't leave me much of a choice...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness could have gotten her information from anywhere! It's even possible that it was spontaneously made up inside the witness's head!\nPhoenix:\n(And he lectures ME on \"reckless blabbering\"!?)\nJudge:\nAs long as we don't know where this information came from, it's quite a waste of time to focus on this line of questioning.\nPhoenix:\n(Where did Oldbag get her inside information...?

That did nothing but set me back a few minutes of my life...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nWait and see\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I should probably think a bit more about this...

But you can't just ignore it either. It makes your client look bad either way.Phoenix:\n(Well, I don't think I heard anything really out of the ordinary just now...)Mia:\nThere has to be something we can catch her on...Phoenix:\n(Yeah... And when I find it, I'm going to press the heck out of it...)Phoenix:\nThe \"investigative photographer\", Lotta Hart...Judge:\nOh yes... I remember that mischievous girl.Phoenix:\nShe reported that she had lost a certain note she had written to herself.Judge:\nShe reported such a thing...?Phoenix:\nOn that piece of paper, she had written down some of her outrageo... er, impressions about the relationship between the victim and Ms. Andrews.Oldbag:\nWh-What!? Outrageous ideas, you say!?Phoenix:\nNo no no, I said impressions.Oldbag:\nThen... Then...! Then everything written on this piece of paper is completely meaningless!?Phoenix:\nAh! That's it! That's the note!Oldbag:\nAh! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Noooo! You see, this is something completely different! This is my top secret list of groceries to buyyyyyyy!!Judge:\nHmm, then you are the one who took Ms. Hart's note?Oldbag:\nI'm a huuuuuuuge fan of Juan's, that's why! That infamous, puffy-haired whippersnapper... She's working with that evil Engarde! She said so herself! \"En garde! I'm his sidekick!\" She was so happy, smiling like a silly duck. I was only checking what she had written!Phoenix:\n...Judge:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Oldbag:\n... Edgey-poo! You believe me, don't you!?Edgeworth:\nNngh...Oldbag:\nI was only trying to help out like the angel I am! It's only one little piece of paper! I've never taken anything else before!Edgeworth:\nYou really should come with a supply of cheese to match your vintage whine.Judge:\nWell, it was only a piece of paper. I suppose we can overlook this just this once.Phoenix:\n(She looks like she's really sorry... Should I forgive her?)Pile on more pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I let up on her now, she'll get away...

I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and \"borrow\" things from people!Judge:\nUm... I think your definition of \"borrow\" is a little off...Oldbag:\nI saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, \"Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire\"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!Judge:\nBailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?Edgeworth:\nThere is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.Judge:\nPlease present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!Oldbag:\nSee, I told you! That's the guy I saw!Judge:\nThis proves that the witness was not lying earlier about this matter.Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record.Judge:\nWh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nThis photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was still in his Nickel Samurai costume!Judge:\nIf that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...Edgeworth:\nThe defendant.Judge:\nHow did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?Phoenix:\n(If this photo really is decisive, then we're done for! But if I raise an objection here and blow it, then I would put Maya's life in jeopardy. I can't make a mistake here! There is only one road out of this mess!) This photo that Lotta took... There's...nothing strange with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is nothing strange with this photo.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I have done nothing to alter this picture either, in case you're wondering, Wright.\nJudge:\nI see... And it seems the defense will rest on this matter. In that case, there is no reason to further prolong this trial.\nMia:\nIs this really alright with you, Phoenix!?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well... There's nothing wrong with this photo that I can poi--\nMia:\nTry again! Take another good look at it! And if you still don't see anything... Do something... anything to prolong the trial!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Chief! W-Wait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright? I'm about to enter my verdict. Please address me with your comment afterwards.\nPhoenix:\nUm, no, I'm sorry, but this can't wait...\nEdgeworth:\nOh? Let me guess. You are going to point out some peculiarity with this photo?\nJudge:\nWh-What? Why didn't you say so earlier!?\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"something strange with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's... There's something strange with this photo!\"Phoenix:\nThere's... There's something strange with this photo!Edgeworth:\nI knew this was coming, Wright.Judge:\nYour thoughts, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI think we can all agree there is nothing strange with this photo. There is no way for the defense to debunk this photo, even with a bunker buster.Judge:\n\"Debunk with a bunker buster\"!? Is that what you're planning to do, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n... Um, anyway, please look at the photo one more time!Judge:\nIf you really believe you can honestly find something wrong with this photo, then you should only need one chance, correct...?Phoenix:\nUm... Well... (I have to find something wrong with this photo! I can't let this chance go by! Where in the heck did she take this photo from anyway...? (Changed from [Where in the heck did she take this picture anyway...?] in the original release) It's all out of focus!

With actual facts, that is.Phoenix:\nLet's take a look at the Nickel Samurai's poster. Please pay particular attention to the area around the bottom of the hakama.Judge:\nHis... His socks... You can see his socks...Phoenix:\nExactly! However, in this photo... The Nickel Samurai is clearly holding his hakama up just to walk!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nThere is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much shorter than the defendant! (Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)Mia:\nThat's curious...Phoenix:\nHuh? What is?Mia:\nEdgeworth is unusually calm today...Phoenix:\nThat's true...Mia:\nHe's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.Phoenix:\n\"Along for the ride\"...? What do you mean by that?Mia:\nI can only think that perhaps he doesn't feel under attack at all...Phoenix:\n(He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, I haven't damaged his case at all!?) (Changed from [He doesn't feel under attack!? Then, he's not taking any damage!?] in the original release)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nIf the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!Edgeworth:\n... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Edgeworth:\nWright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?Phoenix:\n(Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)Mia:\nDon't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Why is he so calm...?)Judge:\nMr. Wright. Let's hear your thoughts.

Do you just pick the first piece of evidence you see?\nMia:\nI can't believe it. I didn't think you would mess up here of all places...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...

What in the world points you to her? (Changed from [And why would you say it would be Ms. Andrews!? What in the world points you to her?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nFor starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.Judge:\nAnd how does that all add up?Phoenix:\nIt means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!Judge:\nThe knife that was used as a murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nWhy don't you just say what it is you want, Wright?Phoenix:\n(I have to do this now!

I can't believe that Adrian... No way! Not cool and collected Adrian Andrews!Phoenix:\nShe is your manager. It would have been very easy for her to pull this off. The only person who had easy access to the knife you used at dinner was, well... her.Engarde:\nSo after the ceremony, during the break, huh...? I was sleeping like a log the entire time...Phoenix:\nSee, she could have also easily planted that blood-covered button in your hakama.Engarde:\nHmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?Phoenix:\nYes. She is the real killer... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.Engarde:\nBut... Why!? I thought she was buds with Juan...!Phoenix:\nShe has her own agenda.Engarde:\nH-Her own agenda!? Wh-What are you talking about?Phoenix:\nI'm sure you'll see by the time this trial's over. It'll be alright. I'll get you acquitted by the end of today.Engarde:\nGet me a verdict that's refreshing like a spring breeze, OK Mr. Lawyer dude?Mia:\nPhoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's missing suicide note, right?Phoenix:\n...Yes. Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live. (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release) But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself. It sounds like she left a suicide note, and the person thought to have hidden it...Mia:\n...Is Juan Corrida, the victim of this murder.Phoenix:\nAnd that's why I think that Ms. Andrews got close to Mr. Corrida... All to get the suicide note back!Mia:\nThat sounds plausible... But one thing bothers me.Phoenix:\nUm, what...?Mia:\nWho was it that first told us about their relationship? Better stated, Mr. Andrews' dependency issues with regards to Ms. Inpax...?

Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you please.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls the witness subpoenaed by this court. Ms. Adrian Andrews, the person who discovered the crime in Mr. Juan Corrida's room!Edgeworth:\nWhat is your occupation?Andrews:\nI am the manager of the defendant in this case, Mr. Matt Engarde.Judge:\nI see. Now then...Andrews:\nBefore we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.Judge:\nUh, yes, sure. What is it?Andrews:\nI'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly \"magazine\" recently...Judge:\nAh, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of \"Gossip Land\"...Phoenix:\n(If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)Edgeworth:\nAnyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.Andrews:\nYes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.Judge:\nHmm, so it was a \"fry 'n bait\" matter... or was that \"bait 'n fry\"? Reminds me of fishing...Andrews:\nBut I... But I didn't kill him.Edgeworth:\nNo one has accused you of that.Andrews:\nI think there's someone who would beg to differ. (Changed from [I've got a feeling someone will soon...] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nI think we all understand your relationship with the victim now, Ms. Andrews.Edgeworth:\nVery well then.

I... I was in shock...\nWhat I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.\nI felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.Judge:\nYou poured yourself a glass of juice...?Andrews:\nYes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...Edgeworth:\nAnd that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.Judge:\nI see. Well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:\nPhoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.Phoenix:\nYes... I know.Mia:\nIn order to catch a person like her, you have to avoid head-on confrontations. You should disrupt her pacing. (Changed from [You should disrupt her pace.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nDisrupt her pacing...? (Changed from [Disrupt her pace...?] in the original release)Mia:\nShe's the type of woman who is easily thrown off by things inconsistent with her thinking so you have to attack when she least expects it. The instant you let up on your offense is the instant this trial is over. Understand?Cross Examination-- When I Found the Body --Andrews:\nIt was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what was Mr. Engarde doing at the time...?\nAndrews:\nHe was taking a nap. He was worn out from his mini performance as the Nickel Samurai during the ceremony...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, Mr. Engarde did say he was taking a nap...) Then I guess you could say it could not have been taken out of his room, yes?\nAndrews:\nExcuse me? \"It\"...? What are you...?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I thought years of school would have taught you how to construct a sentence. If you can't make a sensible sentence with a subject, then I'll make one for you. Watch. Did you, Ms. Andrews, remove Mr. Engarde's knife from his room?\nAndrews:\n...No.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nSubject, verb, object Wright. Did you skip basic grammar? The witness may continue.Andrews:\nAfter that, I went to Juan's room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd why did you do that...?\nAndrews:\nAs a friendly gesture, Juan was to make an appearance with the other Heroes.\nPhoenix:\n(So the show was supposed to be a \"show\" of friendship, huh?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIs that the only reason?\nAndrews:\nI beg your pardon? What are you implying...?\nPhoenix:\nYou had a certain goal in mind when you started to get close to him, correct...? So perhaps you had a more personal matter to discuss with the victim...?\nAndrews:\n... Sorry, but I didn't have any such intentions in mind at that time.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't get her to talk without a strong piece of evidence, I guess...)\nLeads to:\n\"May we continue now...?\"\n\n\n\n\nLet her be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I should back off...

Have a little professionalism. The bright red guitar was found at the studio. These trials would be over in half the time if you would just pay attention.\nJudge:\nYes, pay more attention, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nSorry...Present Guitar Case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way you were the one who opened the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nWhy would you say that!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's elementary, my dear. Because the only fingerprints on this guitar case are those of the victim!\nAndrews:\nAh!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\n... You shouldn't assume that I must have left prints just because I touched the case.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nAndrews:\nWhat if I were to tell you that I was wearing gloves at the time?\nJudge:\nGloves...? But why would you be wearing gloves at the time?\nAndrews:\nIt was the night of the award ceremony. So of course I dressed up for the occasion. Yes, now I remember... I'm almost sure I was wearing a pair of thin gloves.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see... Well, Mr. Wright. It seems the witness was wearing gloves at the scene of the crime.\n\n\n\nNothing strange about that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHmm, I guess so... And I guess that makes sense.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. You're the epitome of a half-baked idea.\nAndrews:\nA brain is to be used, not to look pretty for med students carving cadavers.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like I need to bake my thoughts just a little longer...)\nEdgeworth:\nNow, if the defense has no further objections, let's return to the testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nThat's strange...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were wearing gloves...? Isn't that a little strange?\nAndrews:\nWhy is that strange!? Do you have something that would prove I was not wearing gloves at the time...?\n\n\n\nPresent Wine Glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I have your proof right here. This wine glass.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI think it's time for you to go home now, Wright... Before you hurt yourself, that is.\nPhoenix:\n(Hurt myself...!?)\nJudge:\nIt's alright, Mr. Wright. You don't have to push yourself so hard.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I was trying a little too hard there...)\nEdgeworth:\nNow, if the defense has no further objections, let's return to the testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examinationAndrews:\nAs for why I opened the case... Even I don't know.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas that because you were \"shocked and dazed\" at discovering the victim's body?\nAndrews:\nYes... That's probably it.\nPhoenix:\n...\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not going to get anywhere if I continue pressing her like this... The only way to make her talk is with evidence... I guess I should give it a try...)Present Guitar Case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way you were the one who opened the guitar case.\nAndrews:\nWhy would you say that!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's elementary, my dear.

We can't afford to let up on her now.Phoenix:\nI wasn't planning on letting up, but...Mia:\nShe's at her weakest now, so this is our chance!Phoenix:\n(Yeah, if we had a weapon to hit her with...)Mia:\nI'm sure a weapon is hiding somewhere in the Court Record, waiting to be found.Phoenix:\nI have your proof right here. This wine glass.Andrews:\nThe wine glass?Phoenix:\nYou left your fingerprints very clearly on this wine glass.Andrews:\nAh...Phoenix:\nEven if you took your gloves off when you poured yourself this glass of juice, wouldn't you think it was just a little strange... That you put your gloves back on, just to open the guitar case!?Andrews:\nUgn!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!Mia:\nLooks like you hit the nail on the head this time.Phoenix:\n...? What do you mean?Mia:\nI believe that guitar case plays a very important role here.Phoenix:\nBut it's just an empty case...Mia:\nI wonder if it really was empty though...Phoenix:\nB-But the guitar... The bright red guitar was at the studio!Mia:\nPhoenix, drop all of your presumptions. What was in the guitar case was not the bright red guitar.Phoenix:\n(You don't mean... it was a bright WHITE guitar!? Wait, that's not right either...)Judge:\nHmm, I admit it would be unnatural for someone to do that. So the witness was not wearing gloves, despite the fact that on the case...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nYour Honor, this is obviously the defense's usual misdirection tactic at work. Steer the court towards an unrelated topic, and lull us all into his misguided...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor! Please recall that Ms. Andrews had testified that the vase \"fell onto the guitar case\"! Which means that the case was closed when the crime took place! However, it is wide open in this photo of the crime scene! I am sure this guitar case has some relation to the murder!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nIf you are so sure, Wright, then I'm sure you can somehow substantiate your outrageous claim, correct!? Please, enlighten us as to why that guitar case has anything at all to do with this murder!Phoenix:\nUh...Judge:\nCan you do that, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\nUm, well... Let's suppose for a second... That the bright red guitar was not the only thing that could have been in the case...Judge:\nThe bright red guitar not being the only thing...? Y-You don't mean to suggest that a bright BLACK guitar was inside the--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nSo, you intend to push your theory that the case was not empty!? Is that it, Wright!?Phoenix:\nI wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!Edgeworth:\nDeflate that head of yours! You haven't proven anything yet! Now then, let's have it. What was inside this case at the time of the murder!?Present The Nickel Samurai or Lotta's Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Th-This is... This is a photograph...!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why would something like that be inside a guitar case, let alone this one?\nJudge:\nWhy, Mr. Wright, why?\nPhoenix:\nWell... I just thought it might have been possible...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have a suggestion. Why don't you put that in the void where your brain is supposed to be!\nJudge:\nYes, and never bring it out again!\nPhoenix:\n(Can't a foolishly foolish fool get some love...?)\nEdgeworth:\nDo you still think you can prove your theory? Can you prove that the guitar case was not empty at the time of the murder?\nLeads back to:\n\"I wouldn't say something I didn't intend to prove!\"Judge:\nTh-This is... This is a photograph...!Phoenix:\nYes, but what is important is what is in that picture, Your Honor.Judge:\nI-In this picture...?Phoenix:\nIt doesn't take a genius to see what I mean! What I am proposing is... Inside the guitar case was the Nickel Samurai! The hero's very own costume!Edgeworth:\nWh-What!?Judge:\nM-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!Edgeworth:\nWright! Are you saying that the witness opened the guitar case to take out a costume!? What insane point would there be to doing something like that!?Phoenix:\nThat insane point would be to wear the costume, of course. Ms. Andrews put it on to hide her identity so she could make her escape. After all, you couldn't let anyone see you leave, could you, Ms. Andrews?Andrews:\n...!Edgeworth:\nI-I refuse to accept your theory! Do you have anything to support such a preposterous idea!?Phoenix:\nJust outside the door was an investigative photographer who was starving for a big scoop. And in the end, she managed to get this shot, correct?Judge:\nYou... You mean this photo!? Order! Ordeeeer! It looks like we've wandered into quite another mess again, haven't we...?Mia:\nNice job, Phoenix.Phoenix:\nWell, you know my strategy. Speak first, think later!Judge:\nHmm... So the real murderer was hiding inside a costume...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nW-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!?Judge:\nHmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...?It was stolen from Engarde.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI think it may have been stolen from Mr. Engarde...\nJudge:\nS-Stolen!? But why would someone do such a thing!?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe the thief wanted to interfere with the post-ceremony stage show.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nAnd so, if he didn't have his costume, then Mr. Engarde would be forced to go naked!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe YOU should be stripped naked and run out for making a mockery of this court!\nPhoenix:\nE-EXCUSE ME!?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Matt Engarde did not take his costume off after the award ceremony! He even testified that he took a nap while still wearing his costume! Is this not correct!?\nPhoenix:\n... Ah, yeah, he did say something like that, didn't he?\nJudge:\n*sigh* That's what I thought. Let's try that one more time, shall we, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts.\"It was a spare costume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period...\"Phoenix:\nMr. Engarde did not take his costume off during the break period... In that case, the costume we are talking about was a spare one.Edgeworth:\nWhat...?Judge:\nThen... are you saying that on the night of the murder... there were TWO Nickel Samurai costumes at the Gatewater Hotel!?Phoenix:\nYes, that is what I am saying.Judge:\nAnd how do you explain the costume that was inside the guitar case...?Edgeworth:\nIt would mean that the victim himself had brought this spare to the ceremony on purpose! (Changed from [It would mean that the victim himself had planned to bring this spare to the ceremony!] in the original release)Judge:\nBut... But why!? The victim, Mr. Corrida, was the Jammin' Ninja. Why would he secretly bring the Nickel Samurai's spare costume with him...? What could be the reason behind such a peculiar act?Phoenix:\n... And therein lies the sticking point... (Changed from [... Ah, so that's what he intended...] in the original release)Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWh-What are you mumbling to yourself about now!? Have you just been rambling all this time without any sense of inner monologue!?Phoenix:\nHuh!? N-No, I just...Judge:\nMr. Wright, please explain yourself! Why do you think the victim had the Nickel Samurai's spare costume!?Mia:\nPhoenix... Are you sure you can explain this one? Think carefully before you answer... And then answer with gusto! I believe in you!Phoenix:\nAlright. This is what I think. The reason the victim brought the Nickel Samurai's spare costume to the hotel was...Present Press Conference Ticket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"What is this...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nMia:\nPhoenix! What are you doing!? Are you crazy!?\nPhoenix:\nI... I, uh... I presented the evidence with gusto, just like you said!\nMia:\nI told you to present it with gusto, yes... But I seem to recall the sentence before that was, \"Think carefully\"!\nPhoenix:\n*gulp*\nJudge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nAh, sorry...\nMia:\nThis one is pretty tough. I really think you should look carefully at the Court Record. And then search through your memories! The answer is there, I know you'll find it!\nJudge:\nNow then. Are you ready to try again, Mr. Wright? Minus the wrong evidence this time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Alright. This is what I think.\"Judge:\nWhat is this...?Phoenix:\nOn the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special press conference.Judge:\nA press conference...?Phoenix:\nYes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to confess something at this conference.Edgeworth:\nI heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright.Phoenix:\nBut what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had no idea he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night.Andrews:\n...Judge:\nBut how can that be!?Phoenix:\nThe way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida himself!Judge:\nTh-The victim?Phoenix:\nYes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the \"Nickel Samurai\"!Judge:\nHe was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!?Phoenix:\nThat's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is what he intended to reveal at that conference.Edgeworth:\nThe Nickel Samurai was going to \"confess\" something. And by \"confess\", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about \"himself\".Phoenix:\nWhich means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about Matt Engarde!Judge:\nYes, I guess that is what it would mean...Edgeworth:\nBut, if that's the case... that's not a \"confession\"! That's \"public disclosure\"!Andrews:\nHmph.Judge:\nM-Ms. Andrews...?Andrews:\nI can see why you are pros at what you do.Judge:\nPardon me?Andrews:\nYes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan.Judge:\nMs. Andrews! Please offer us an explanation for this!Andrews:\nI was the one he asked to help set it up. And the person who prepared the second costume for him... That was also me.Judge:\nYou...!?Andrews:\nJuan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was going down with him. That's what he thought anyway.Judge:\nHe was going to ruin him, huh...?Andrews:\nIt looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a secret so powerful... that it would destroy Matt's acting career had it been revealed!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Judge:\nAnd do you know what this \"secret\" of Mr. Engarde's is, Ms. Andrews...?Andrews:\n... That's something only Juan knew. I... I don't know what it is.Judge:\nAh... I see.Edgeworth:\n...Andrews:\nI... I've probably been coming off quite suspicious to everyone, but that's to be expected. I've been trying to protect Matt, after all...Phoenix:\nP-Protect Mr. Engarde!?Judge:\nAnd yet again another strange bit of truth comes to light it seems... Ms. Andrews, if you could, please tell us the truth about your behavior!Andrews:\nYes, Your Honor. I understand.Witness Testimony-- Protecting Matt --Andrews:\nFrom the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.\nMatt had to kill Juan no matter what.\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...Judge:\nHmm... This does account for everything...Andrews:\nWell... I am the logical type.Mia:\nWe're finally seeing her true self. She is more nervous than a scared rabbit.Judge:\nIf the defense can find no fault with this testimony, I am ready to make a ruling. (Changed from [If there are no objections, I feel that I can pass a verdict based on this testimony.] in the original release) Please keep that in mind as you cross-examine, Mr. Wright. (Changed from [Now then, Mr. Wright, if you please.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Looks like somehow everything has swung to the opposite end of the scale again... That just means I have to put my weight into this and turn her logic upside-down!)Cross Examination-- Protecting Matt --Andrews:\nFrom the moment I saw the crime scene, I had a feeling that Matt was the murderer.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWould you say that was your \"intuition\" speaking to you?\nAndrews:\nDon't confuse my methods of reasoning with your own.\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\nAndrews:\nIf you want to prove that someone did something, you need three things.\nPhoenix:\nThree... things?\nAndrews:\nA motive, an opportunity to commit the crime, and finally... decisive evidence. And if you think these three things through, the answer becomes quite clear.\nMia:\nYou should have already known that, Phoenix...\nPhoenix:\nThey didn't teach that to us in school... At least, not from what I remember...\nAndrews:\nMay I continue now?Andrews:\nMatt had to kill Juan no matter what.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo would you say this \"need\" came from the press conference?\nAndrews:\nYes. Do you know why Juan chose that event and that hotel for the conference? Because that was when he could cause the most damage to the public's beloved Matt Engarde.\nJudge:\nAnd you knew of this plan, didn't you, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\nYes... because I was the one who set up the conference and prepared the costume.\nPhoenix:\nBut... I'm sure Mr. Engarde himself didn't know anything about a press conference.\nAndrews:\nOh really? Can you show me any proof that he didn't know about the press conference?\nPhoenix:\nA-Anyway! The important thing here is that this information was not in your testimony!\nJudge:\nYes, I agree. Ms. Andrews, please correct your testimony, if you please.\nAndrews:\n\"Grasping at straws\" now, are we, Mr. Wright?\nChanges statement from \"Matt had to kill Juan no matter what.\" to \"I know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.\"Andrews:\nI know what his motive was. ...But I don't have any way to prove I'm right.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHas Mr. Engarde done something to hurt or betray you personally?\nAndrews:\n... Why do you ask?\nPhoenix:\nYou were the one who helped Mr. Corrida with his press conference... And that event was supposed to bring down Mr. Engarde, yet you still helped out!\nAndrews:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe person on trial right now is Mr. Engarde, Wright. What the witness was thinking, helping the victim with his plan, is none of our concern. In any case, this means that the defendant had a motive to kill.\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I keep doing this to myself...?)Andrews:\nAnd he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nB-But didn't you already testify earlier that Mr. Engarde was... \"Taking a nap in his room\"!? Are you telling me now that, that too, was a lie so you could cover for Mr. Engarde!?\nAndrews:\nI'm not telling you anything of the sort. When I went to get him for the show, he honestly was sleeping. However, as to whether he was sleeping the entire time, that I cannot say. I was too busy setting up the stage at the time.\nJudge:\nHmm... I keep trying, but I can find no flaws with what Ms. Andrews has said. I can't say the same for some people here in this courtroom, however.\nPhoenix:\n(The judge is glaring straight at Mia...)\nMia:\nHe's glaring at you, smart guy!Andrews:\nMy thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou can hardly call the knife \"decisive evidence\"! The fingerprints on the knife could very well be a clever camouflage!\nAndrews:\nThen... What about the button?\nPhoenix:\nThe button...?\nAndrews:\nIt's clear from the crime scene that the victim and the murderer fought. And during the fight, the killer ripped the button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.\nJudge:\nYou're talking about this button, correct?\nAndrews:\nThat button was found in the pleats of Matt's hakama, isn't that correct? I would think that makes it very decisive evidence.\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nJudge:\nLooks like you were out-foxed again, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nA-Anyway! The knife doesn't prove a thing! Please fix your testimony!\nAndrews:\nI can't stand the sight of a man who can't gracefully accept his defeat.\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(... Thank goodness Mia can still look at me...)\nMia:\nWith an icy stare, yes.\nJudge:\nMs. Andrews, for Mr. Wright's sake, please add this information to your testimony.\nChanges statement from \"My thoughts were confirmed by the evidence, of course; the button and the knife...\" to \"That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\"Andrews:\nThat button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd how do you know that?\nAndrews:\nWhen the ends of the threads on the button and the costume were matched up, they were found to fit together perfectly... Or so I heard.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I've heard that before too. But why would Ms. Andrews know about this case down to such a fine detail?)\nAndrews:\nDon't look at me like that! Just because I'm prepared and you are not!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... And I thought I had her this time for sure. If there's anything to trip her up on, it has to be here. ...But where and what?)Present Juan's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is the victim's autopsy report.\"Andrews:\nBut I'm Matt's manager... So I felt that I had to protect him...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut what you really did was stab the guy in the back, didn't you? And at the worst possible time.\nAndrews:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nWho's to say she really \"stabbed the guy in the back\" as you put it?\nPhoenix:\nThis witness could have disclosed things about Mr. Engarde at any time. Why, then, would she wait until there was a large audience before doing so? It's the same reason why Mr. Corrida planned such an elaborate conference. Ms. Andrews wanted to cause Mr. Engarde as much damage as she possibly could! This witness bears ill-will towards the defendant!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis isn't the \"Phoenix Wright Wax Philosophical Power Hour\". And please, stop slandering the witness.\nAndrews:\n...Phoenix:\nAs I expected, Ms. Andrews' testimony seems pretty solid.Mia:\nReally? Because to me, it sounded a little wishy-washy.Phoenix:\nWishy-washy? (Well, I guess we'll see if I press a little more...)Mia:\nYou should know this by now, but you'll need strong, decisive evidence to make her talk.Phoenix:\nGot it, Chief! (...I'm going to pin you down this time, Ms. Andrews!)Phoenix:\nThis is the victim's autopsy report. It clearly states that the cause of death was \"strangulation by a scarf\".Andrews:\nS...Strangulation...Phoenix:\nThe knife stab to the victim was done after the victim had already died.Judge:\nA-And what does that mean?Phoenix:\nLet's examine the evidence. This button has the victim's blood on it. Which would mean that it was ripped off of the costume... when?Edgeworth:\nAfter the knife was stabbed into the victim...Phoenix:\nExactly! Which means... It is impossible that this button was torn off during the victim's final struggle, because the victim was strangled to death in that fight!Andrews:\nAh...Phoenix:\nThat's right, Ms. Andrews. There is no way this button was ripped off during the struggle. This button was consciously pulled off of the victim's already dead body!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Wh-What is the meaning--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWhat is the meaning of this, Wright!? So what if the button was torn off the body after the victim had already died? What does that change!?Phoenix:\nLet me ask you one simple question, Mr. Edgeworth. Why was the button torn off? What purpose did that serve?Edgeworth:\nWhat \"purpose\"...?Phoenix:\nWe now know this button was not torn off during the fight. So the murderer took the time and effort to purposely rip this from the victim's body. That would mean that the murderer had something in mind, wouldn't it?Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nMr. Wright! Does this mean... Does this mean you know what the murderer wanted to do with this button!? What was it!?To have a memento of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaybe this was the criminal's first crime and since it went so well, the person wanted something as a memento...\nEdgeworth:\nWright... I'll give this button to you as a memento.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nA reminder to never set foot in another court of law again for as long as you live!\nJudge:\nYes... I think it would be for the best if you stayed away from the attorney's bench.\nPhoenix:\nW-W-Wait! Please, Your Honor! I... I'll get it right this time! I'm sure of it!\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\"To pin the crime on Engarde\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is only one logical reason for doing something like that.\"To destroy evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was to destroy the evidence, of course!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... To destroy the evidence...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, we heard you the first time! And which blasted piece of evidence was the person trying to destroy, Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! If you continue like this, I'm afraid you'll only destroy yourself!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry...\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright! Does this mean...\"Phoenix:\nThere is only one logical reason for doing something like that. It was to pin the crime on Mr. Engarde!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nThere is no way anyone would put a bloodied button in their own pants! That's right! Mr. Engarde was set up! By the real killer, of course!Judge:\nAnd... The real murder is...? Well, Mr. Wright!? Who in the world is the real killer then!?Phoenix:\n(Finally... I can't believe I managed to bring this trial all the way up to this point...)Mia:\nPhoenix... You can't let your guard down yet! Not until the very end!Phoenix:\nThe real killer, the person who planned to frame Mr. Engarde is...Present Adrian Andrews profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Adrian Andrews!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWright. Which of these four doesn't belong here? Up, down, left, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nUm, \"Wright\"?\nEdgeworth:\nThank you, I feel much better. I'm relieved to know you can at least pick that much out. I worry about you. You seem to fail every time you try to make logical sense!\nMia:\nOr in other words, \"think before you speak\", Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\n(Is it just me or is everyone ganging up on me?)\nJudge:\nThat's enough dawdling now, Mr. Wright.

Then what about this knife!?Phoenix:\nThe knife was used to stab the victim after he had already been strangled to death. It was used to throw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, naturally. A knife covered in the defendant's fingerprints could only be taken from his room. And the only one who had dinner with him, and knew which knife to take, was you.Andrews:\n...Tsk! Th-Then! What... What about the button that was found in Matt's hakama!?Phoenix:\nThis button was removed from the victim's body after he had already died. The only people who could've done so were the person who found his body or the killer. However, if Mr. Engarde was the real killer, there is no way he would have put such incriminating evidence in his own hakama!Andrews:\nUghn...Phoenix:\nThe only person who could have put this button into Mr. Engarde's hakama, is the person who went to wake him from his nap... which is you, yet again, Ms. Andrews.Judge:\nI... I see... What about the empty guitar case...?Phoenix:\nThat is also another piece of evidence that incriminates Ms. Andrews. That costume was used to hide the real killer's identity as they fled the crime scene. Now, who could have known that there was just such a costume inside the guitar case...? It could only have been the person who prepared the costume for the victim. And that person is... you, Ms. Adrian Andrews!Andrews:\nN...No... I...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nBut Ms. Andrews' fingerprints were nowhere to be found on the guitar case! And it was you who proved that she was not wearing gloves at the time!Judge:\n...! Th-That's right!Phoenix:\nThat's because she did not intend on leaving any prints. If anyone had found out that she had touched the case, they would have asked her why. So to avoid leaving any prints, she used a towel or something else to open it. But! The glass of tomato juice is a different story! Ms. Andrews purposefully left her fingerprints on the glass to show that yes, indeed, she was the classic \"dazed discoverer\" of a dead body!Andrews:\nAaaaaah!Phoenix:\nAnd to top it all off, there is this photo! A photo of the killer as they exited the scene of the crime. No reasonable person on Earth can believe this Nickel Samurai is Mr. Engarde! He would be much too short for his own costume if it was him.Andrews:\n...!Phoenix:\nSpeaking of how tall people are... Ms. Andrews, you're also kind of short in stature, are you not?Andrews:\nP-Please... Stop...Phoenix:\nWell, how about it, Ms. Andrews!?Andrews:\nUm...Phoenix:\n(I've got her this time!)Andrews:\n...Judge:\nMs. Andrews...?Andrews:\n... I... I... I refuse... to testify.Phoenix:\nWhat was that...?Andrews:\nTh-There's a law... It says I can't be forced to testify about something... if it can incriminate me!Judge:\nWell, yes... You are absolutely correct, Ms. Andrews. The law does provide us with a way to avoid self-incrimination... by allowing a witness to not testify if the testimony can cause damage to themselves.Phoenix:\nWHAT!? (\"Pleading the fifth\" is not something most people would think to do on the spot! Actually... Thinking back to yesterday in Mr. Engarde's room...)von Karma:\nAdrian Andrews!Andrews:\nY-Yes...?von Karma:\nThink hard about what we just discussed. Understood!?Andrews:\nA-Alright... ...Phoenix:\n(That's it. That's when Franziska planted this idea into her head... She must have told Ms. Andrews to not testify if things looked bad.)Mia:\nYou did a good job proving everything up to this point, Phoenix. But there is still one thing you haven't done.Phoenix:\nSomething I haven't done...?Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh. What's wrong, Wright? Are you finished already? Run out of evidence?Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nWhat is so humorous, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nI'm sure you realize this as well, Your Honor... But, everything the good lawyer here has proven up to this point is meaningless.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Edgeworth:\nEverything you have proven is circumstantial.Phoenix:\nCircumstantial...?Edgeworth:\nYes, circumstantial. You have yet to provide a single piece of definitive proof. Proof that Ms. Andrews, did in fact, harbor a wish to murder Mr. Corrida!Judge:\nM-Ms. Andrews! You... Did you want to kill Mr. Corrida...?Andrews:\nI believe this may lead to me incriminating myself, so I will abstain from answering.Judge:\nBut Ms. Andrews... If you do that, it would be the same as admitting your guilt, don't you think...?Andrews:\nMaybe so, or maybe not. There is nothing to prove it either way. Besides, you don't even know what crime I would be \"guilty\" of due to my silence.Phoenix:\n(NO!! She's taking that defiant attitude again!) M-Mia! What should we do...?Mia:\nSomehow, we've landed in the worst possible situation.Judge:\nI think we have reached a certain conclusion at this point in time. Ms. Adrian Andrews has refused to testify. And the defense's theory that she is the actual murderer... has not been fully substantiated with solid, definitive proof.Phoenix:\nBut! That's not true!Judge:\nIn this situation, there is only one thing this court can do. And that is to declare a recess.Phoenix:\nR-Recess...!?Judge:\nI request that both the prosecution and the defense look further into this matter. And at tomorrow's trial...Phoenix:\n(T-Tomorrow...!? We don't have a \"tomorrow\"! If we don't get a not guilty verdict today, then...)Phoenix:Phoenix:\nPlease wait, Your Honor! Th...That's not necessary! The trial... Please continue the trial!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you sweating for...? Your client is getting one more day to live, isn't he?Phoenix:\nThat... That's not it! This isn't about that. Edgeworth! I know you know who the real killer is! Please... Let the trial continue! If I don't get the verdict... then Maya...Edgeworth:\n...?Judge:\nBut it's impossible to continue as long as the witness refuses to testify. Now then, this court is...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nIt is not impossible for this trial to continue.Andrews:\n...!Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you...Edgeworth:\nIt's true Ms. Andrews holds the right against self-incrimination; however, if the topic of conversation were something unrelated to whatever she may be guilty of, then she has no right to withhold testimony!Judge:\nY-Yes, that is very true, but...Edgeworth:\nActually, there is one little thing that I'm curious about. Ms. Andrews.Andrews:\n...Edgeworth:\nWhen you found the victim's dead body, you poured yourself a glass of juice.Andrews:\nY-Yes... And...?Edgeworth:\nI can't help but think how unnatural that is. Usually when one finds a body, they are shaken up, not stirring a glass of juice.Andrews:\nSo my actions were \"unusual\"? But I've already...Edgeworth:\nBefore you speak, I want to state that if you have a reason behind your actions, I would like you to testify to that effect.Andrews:\nTestify...!?Edgeworth:\nYour Honor! I would like to request that the witness testify again as to what happened when she first discovered the victim's body! Whatever we find out in this testimony should in no way implicate the witness.Judge:\nHmm...Mia:\nI don't know what it is about Edgeworth today, but I can't get a good read off of him. Is he friend or foe? I just don't know...Judge:\nThe court acknowledges the prosecution's request. Ms. Andrews, if you please.Witness Testimony-- When I Found the Body --Andrews:\nThat glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.\nI was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.\nAnd Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.\nWhen I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.\nTo be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.\nWhen I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.Judge:\nHmm... So you poured that glass of juice for the victim. Why didn't you say so in your earlier testimony?Andrews:\n...I didn't think I needed to include something so trivial.Mia:\nPhoenix. Please be careful here. If you can't find anything wrong with this testimony, then there's nothing left...Phoenix:\nI know. (Edgeworth... What the heck is going on in that brain of yours...?)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- When I Found the Body --Andrews:\nThat glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut... There wasn't anyone else in the room, right?\nAndrews:\nOf course not.\nPhoenix:\nThen... who did you pour it for?\nAndrews:\nMr. Wright. There is a rhyme and reason for everything. Can you wait just a little longer for it to be revealed to you?\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, Wright, \"Be quiet and listen.\"\nAndrews:\nPrecisely! I couldn't have said it better myself.\nPhoenix:\nUnnngh...Andrews:\nI was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, it was a \"mess\"? Are you sure it wasn't messy because of your fight with Mr. Corrida...?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI understand your frustrations at not being able to prove your theory. However... Before you go accusing people of crimes, go find yourself some evidence!\nPhoenix:\n(Grr...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnd then, what did you see next, witness?Andrews:\nAnd Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSlumped over?\nAndrews:\nYes, he was just sitting there with his head tilted forward, eyes closed. He really looked like he was sleeping.\nPhoenix:\n(...Is it just me or did that right there sound a little... odd?)Andrews:\nWhen I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThen what did cross your mind?\nAndrews:\nI thought maybe he had smashed everything up in anger because he lost the Grand Prix. And then felt tired after his rampage, so he decided to take a nap... Anyways, that's what I thought...\nJudge:\nI see. So you didn't think he was dead at all.Present Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"Andrews:\nTo be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou thought he fainted...?\nAndrews:\nI thought he was asleep at first. But then, the room was in such a messy state... I thought maybe he had gotten into a fight with someone...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that's when you went to pour the glass of juice?\nAndrews:\nYes. He always has a hard time waking up. So Juan always has a glass of tomato juice to drink.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. And after that, what happened next?Present Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"Andrews:\nWhen I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd how did you come to realize that he was, in fact, dead?\nAndrews:\nI shook him over and over, but I never got a response... So I set the glass down on the dresser and tried to take his pulse. I... I was shocked... and staggered backward...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd knocked the flower vase over. So that's what happened.\nAndrews:\n...Yes.Present Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"So you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?\"Mia:\n... This is what it all comes down to.Phoenix:\nHuh?Mia:\nThis is the absolute end for both sides... And Adrian is letting her guard down. Phoenix, now is our best chance yet to kill the prosecution's case!Phoenix:\n(Isn't that a bit harsh...? Ms. Andrews... Will you tell us the truth this time...?)Phoenix:\nSo you honestly didn't think he was dead when you found him?Andrews:\nNo, not at all...Phoenix:\nEven though this is what you saw when you discovered the body?Andrews:\n...Ah!Judge:\nWh-What is the meaning of this!?Phoenix:\nIsn't it obvious, Your Honor? There is a knife sticking straight out of Mr. Corrida's chest! Anyone who saw this scene would have immediately thought that here was a dead man!Andrews:\nAh... Um... That's... Well, you see...Phoenix:\nI doubt a single person in the world would mistake this for someone who fainted, and then so nonchalantly go pour something to drink!Judge:\nY-Your point is...?Phoenix:\nMs. Andrews! Your testimony just now... It was all one giant lie!Andrews:\nUngh!Phoenix:\nAnd your lie has proven one thing very clearly. That you are the real killer!Andrews:\n... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Judge:\nIt looks like the defense has somehow brought the ugly truth to light. The defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde, is not guilty after all...Andrews:\nThat... But that's impossible! You're wrong...Judge:\nM-Ms. Andrews! Try to have some composure!Andrews:\nIt... It wasn't me... It wasn't me, I tell you! It was Matt! I swear it! He's the one who killed Juan!Phoenix:\nBut you were the one who refused to testify! And your reason for not doing so was that you \"might\" end up incriminating yourself!Andrews:\nTh-That's because...Judge:\nMs. Andrews, I will give you one last chance. What exactly are you hiding that may \"incriminate\" you?Andrews:\n... I... I... I refuse... to testify.Judge:\nThen there is no need for this court to continue any further. Mr. Matt Engarde's innocence has been clearly demonstrated.Phoenix:\n(Is... Is it... over...? Have we... Have we found the truth at last...?)Mia:\nWhat's wrong, Phoenix?Phoenix:\nUsually... Well, usually, the real killer confesses his or her guilt. And now that I think about it, this is the first time someone hasn't.Judge:\nNow then, I would like to hand down my verdict for Mr. Matt Engarde.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. The prosecution feels that it would be premature to pass down a verdict at this time.Judge:\nWh-What...?Edgeworth:\nThe reason is quite simple. This witness has yet to speak the absolute, real truth.Judge:\nThe \"absolute, real truth\"...? What are you...?Edgeworth:\nWitness... Don't you understand yet?Andrews:\n...Huh?Edgeworth:\nI don't know who planted this silly idea in your head, but as long as you \"protect\" yourself through your silence, Matt Engarde will go free. And in his place... YOU will become the guilty party!Andrews:\n...Th-That's... That's a lie! I... I don't believe you!Edgeworth:\nWhat...?Andrews:\nI... I was told... If I spoke... If I spoke, then it would be all over... And Matt would never be declared guilty...Phoenix:\n(Wh-What in the world is she talking about!? Has she lost it!?)Andrews:\nI... I can't speak about it... I'm too scared...Mia:\nIt's Franziska von Karma...Phoenix:\nHuh...?Mia:\nDon't you rememeber, Phoenix? Ms. Andrews lives by gripping tightly onto the words of another. Because she doesn't have the strength to believe in herself.Phoenix:\nTh...Then, right now... Ms. Andrews is...Mia:\nYesterday, she was tossed a life-saver by Ms. von Karma. \"Don't say a word, no matter what happens. If you do, Matt Engarde will be acquitted.\" Ms. Andrews undyingly believes in those words right now, and is clinging onto them...Phoenix:\n(Th-Then what should we do!? This... This is the first time I've ever come across anything like this! But Ms. Andrews has to be the killer, right!? All we have to do now is... is get our not guilty... That is my only priority!)Andrews:\nIt wasn't me! I'm begging you, please believe me! I didn't kill Juan! Help... Please... Someone... Help me...!Judge:\nMr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor!Judge:\nThe court can't continue on like this, therefore I'd like to hear what you intend to do.Phoenix:\n(What I intend to do...!? Wh-What am I supposed to do!? What am I supposed to say!?)Edgeworth:\nWright! I suggest you think very carefully about this! Think about what this witness did, and what she did NOT do! And think about who is the real mastermind behind this crime!Phoenix:\n(Who's the real mastermind? Isn't that obvious!?

Are you sure you know what you're doing!?\nPhoenix:\nSure, Mr. Engarde would get an acquittal, but in his place, you would be found guilty! Is this... Is this how you really want this trial to end!?\nAndrews:\nB-Be quiet... How dare you!? You... You're trying to trick me!\nLeads to:\n\"That's enough!\"Judge:\nThat's enough!

I really thought he had fainted. Honest.\nWhen I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan.\nOnce I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room.\nAnd then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button.\nJust when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience.\nAnd that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume.Judge:\nS-Stabbed the body!? With the knife!? But why would you do that!?Andrews:\nIsn't it obvious? To pin the blame on a certain person... A certain cowardly man!Judge:\nWh... What do you mean by all of this...?Edgeworth:\nIt might take this court a little while to understand, but... This is the truth.Andrews:\nThe real killer is Matt! That scumbag of a man! I'll never forgive him! He's trying to escape his guilt again! Just like last time!Phoenix:\n(\"Last time\"...?)Edgeworth:\nSo, Ms. Andrews stabbed the victim, Juan Corrida, in the chest with the knife. However, she didn't do it with murder in mind. She did it with the intent of framing Matt Engarde for the murder... And this! This is her \"crime\"!Phoenix:\n(Wh-WHAT!? How is this possible!? I mean... Wasn't Ms. Andrews supposed to be the real murderer!?)Judge:\nMr. Wright. Please get over your shock and commence the cross-examination.Cross Examination",

Therefore, we motion that this court passes a verdict of \"not guilty\" as soon as possible!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nI'm disappointed in you, Wright! What have you learned in this past year!?\nLeads to:\n\"That's enough!\"Force Andrews to testify\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I have to win a complete acquittal today... There's no way around that! But... I can't bring myself to do it like this! Not when she's making a face like that...) Ms. Andrews! I would like to know what you are really hiding!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Wright! Are you sure you know what you're doing!?\nPhoenix:\nSure, Mr. Engarde would get an acquittal, but in his place, you would be found guilty! Is this... Is this how you really want this trial to end!?\nAndrews:\nB-Be quiet... How dare you!? You... You're trying to trick me!\nLeads to:\n\"That's enough!\"Judge:\nThat's enough! I commend you for trying, Mr. Edgeworth. However, it's clear that the defense's theory is the truth.Andrews:\n...Y...You're wrong...Edgeworth:\n... What a shame... (Changed from [Such a shame...] in the original release)Andrews:\n...!Edgeworth:\nI had hoped things wouldn't come to this, however...Judge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nMs. Andrews. Since you absolutely refuse to testify... It falls on my shoulders to disclose this to the court.Andrews:\n...S...Stop...Judge:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nThis witness... How should I put this... She has an illness.Andrews:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nAnd because of this illness, she has tried to commit suicide in the past.Andrews:\nS-Stop... Please stop...!Edgeworth:\nNo matter how much you want to hide it, it's no use. I have the evidence right here.Andrews:\nAh! Th-That's...!Phoenix:\n(That's the second part of the suicide report -- the attempted suicide report!)Edgeworth:\nWhat will you do now, witness? You know what I am about to do, don't you? I will now reveal to the court, the true nature of the pitiful woman known as Adrian Andrews!Phoenix:\n(The secret of her dependent nature... (Changed from [The secret of her co-dependant [sic] nature...] in the original release) Having other people know about it scares her more than anything else in the world...)Andrews:\nPlease! Please STOP!! I beg you!! If people find out... If people find out... I... I'll...Edgeworth:\nIf you're going to say you would \"choose death\", that is of no concern to me.Andrews:\n...!Phoenix:\n(Edgeworth... How can you be so cold...!?)Edgeworth:\nHowever, before you die... I will pull the truth from your still-breathing lips! (Changed from [I will pull the truth from your breathing lips!] in the original release) ... No matter what I have to do.Andrews:\n...Edgeworth:\nSo, will you tell the court yourself, or shall I!? Either is fine with me.Andrews:\n... ... ...I... I'll talk. But please... Help me... N-Nothing matters anymore...Witness Testimony-- My \"Crime\" --Andrews:\nWhen I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest.\nWhen I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan.\nOnce I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room.\nAnd then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button.\nJust when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience.\nAnd that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume.Judge:\nS-Stabbed the body!? With the knife!? But why would you do that!?Andrews:\nIsn't it obvious? To pin the blame on a certain person... A certain cowardly man!Judge:\nWh... What do you mean by all of this...?Edgeworth:\nIt might take this court a little while to understand, but... This is the truth.Andrews:\nThe real killer is Matt! That scumbag of a man! I'll never forgive him! He's trying to escape his guilt again! Just like last time!Phoenix:\n(\"Last time\"...?)Edgeworth:\nSo, Ms. Andrews stabbed the victim, Juan Corrida, in the chest with the knife. However, she didn't do it with murder in mind. She did it with the intent of framing Matt Engarde for the murder... And this! This is her \"crime\"!Phoenix:\n(Wh-WHAT!? How is this possible!? I mean... Wasn't Ms. Andrews supposed to be the real murderer!?)Judge:\nMr. Wright. Please get over your shock and commence the cross-examination.Cross Examination",

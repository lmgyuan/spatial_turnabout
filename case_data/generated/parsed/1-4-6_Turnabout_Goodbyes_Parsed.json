She only eats these high-quality bird pellets from France. They only have them in the big pet shop downtown.\nPhoenix:\nBut you weren't arrested until this morning! Why didn't you go back to the caretaker's shack?\nUncle:\nEr... well... I kind of got lost, you see.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe witness has trouble remembering things sometimes.

Or maybe you're lying about not having your memory, hmm? You know exactly who you are!\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe witness has testified quite clearly that he has no memory of who he is.

I'm glad you've come to your senses, Mr. Wright. Very well, witness. Please continue.Uncle:\nEr... I mean, I'd need one of those \"motive\" things, right? And I don't got one.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow can you say you had no motive? I say you do! You had a grudge against Edgeworth and the victim, Robert Hammond! That's why you took revenge on them! Right?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nPlease don't make me repeat myself, Mr. Wright! This witness has no memory of anything beyond several years ago! He can't hold a grudge!

Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou've been saying the same thing now over and over. You've been calling the witness's memory of the past or lack thereof into question. But, does this really have anything to do with the current case?Phoenix:\nOf course, Your Honor. The witness has said he has \"nothing to do with this case\" and \"no motive\"... Both of these statements are lies!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Wright! There is a serious problem with your claim! Or... are you saying... Are you saying you know who this witness is!?Phoenix:\nOf course, Your Honor!Karma:\nHo hoh! Now, this is interesting. I would like to know myself!

Today, things are gong to get settled at last... a lot of things.) Waaaaaaaargh! Wh-what's the big idea!?Maya:\nS-s-sorry, Nick! I only touched your shoulder! I guess the \"shock\" hasn't worn off from my run-in with the stun gun yesterday. Anyhow, today's the last day of the trial! Good luck, Nick!Phoenix:\nYeah... thanks, Maya.Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\n(Edgeworth is looking glum as always. I hope von Karma doesn't push him too hard.)Edgeworth:\n... Whooooooooaa! Wh-wh-what are you doing!?Maya:\nSorry! I'm sorry! I just thought I'd ch-cheer you up with a pat on the back...Phoenix:\nMaya... Maybe you should go outside and discharge?Maya:\nRight. Good idea.Phoenix:\n(Try not to electrocute anyone on your way out...)Woooooooooyaaah, pal!Gumshoe:\nWhat's gotten into that girl?Phoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nMorning! Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nUh... good morning.Phoenix:\nHow did it go, Detective?Gumshoe:\nHave no fear! As promised, I've captured our runaway caretaker! I just brought him in. Took all night, pal.Phoenix:\nThanks, Detective Gumshoe. You must be tired.Gumshoe:\nActually, after that shock I got on the way in, I feel pretty good.Phoenix:\n(Yogi says he's forgotten his own name... But that has to be a lie! Why would he want revenge on Edgeworth if he couldn't remember his past!? He does remember... and I'm going to prove it!)December 28, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:\n... The prosecution... is ready.Judge:\n... U-uh... right, very well. We have reached the final day of our proceedings in this trial. I ask that the prosecution submit decisive evidence.Karma:\nUnderstood.Judge:\n...Phoenix:\n(C'mon! Don't be awed into silence by every little thing he says!)Judge:\nVery well, Mr. von Karma, your opening statement.Karma:\nRight. Thanks to Detective Gumshoe's efforts, the boat rental shop caretaker has been arrested. In yesterday's trial, the defense asserted that the caretaker was the murderer. However, the caretaker has yet to confirm this. I would like to ask the defense to cross-examine him as much as necessary.Judge:\nVery well! Please bring the witness into the courtroom.Karma:\nLadies and gentlemen of the court... I believe you all remember our witness. He lives in the boat rental shop on the lake, from where he witnessed the incident. In addition, he has currently lost memory of his name and identity.Judge:\nWitness! Why did you run away yesterday?Karma:Karma:\nThe witness was not running away, as he will now testify.Judge:\nI-I see. Very well, please begin your testimony.Uncle:\nZzz... mmph?Witness Testimony-- Why I Left Court --Uncle:\nEr, I'm really sorry about just leaving yesterday like I did.\nBut, I wasn't running away or nothing.\nI, uh, went to buy some food for Polly, see...\nI figured I got nothing to do with this incident anyhow.\nEr... I mean, I'd need one of those \"motive\" things, right? And I don't got one.\nSo, my testimony yesterday stands as is.Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination, shall we?Phoenix:\n(He has to know his name! Yanni Yogi! You're Yanni Yogi and I'm going to prove it!)Cross Examination-- Why I Left Court --Uncle:\nEr, I'm really sorry about just leaving yesterday like I did.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI'd call what you did \"running away,\" and not \"just leaving.\" You heard Larry's testimony, and realized you were in danger!\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nNow, Mr. Wright, there's no need to rush to conclusions. As I said, the witness was not \"running away.\" Listen to the testimony.\nPhoenix:\n(He sure seems relaxed! In fact, they both do--von Karma and Yanni Yogi!)Uncle:\nBut, I wasn't running away or nothing.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThen why did you leave!?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nHe's just about to say why! Is it so hard for you just quietly listen when someone is talking!?\nPhoenix:\n(If I sat quietly, Edgeworth would be guilty in three minutes!)Uncle:\nI, uh, went to buy some food for Polly, see...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nFood...?\nUncle:\nWell, Polly is a bit of a gourmand, you see. She only eats these high-quality bird pellets from France. They only have them in the big pet shop downtown.\nPhoenix:\nBut you weren't arrested until this morning! Why didn't you go back to the caretaker's shack?\nUncle:\nEr... well... I kind of got lost, you see.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe witness has trouble remembering things sometimes. When the police apprehended him, he was on his way back to the shack!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, right! Nice try von Karma! No one's going to believe that!)\nJudge:\nHmm... I see! So he was lost!\nPhoenix:\n(Please! Your Honor, come to your senses!)Uncle:\nI figured I got nothing to do with this incident anyhow.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou've lost much of your memory, is that correct?\nUncle:\nEr... ayup, seems like it.\nPhoenix:\nThen how could you know that you didn't have anything to do with this incident!\nUncle:\nUh...\nPhoenix:\nOr... Or maybe you're lying about not having your memory, hmm? You know exactly who you are!\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe witness has testified quite clearly that he has no memory of who he is. If you claim he's lying, then show the court proof!\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... How am I supposed to prove what's going on in that old codger's head? That's impossible!)\nKarma:\nHmph! I'm glad you've come to your senses, Mr. Wright. Very well, witness. Please continue.Uncle:\nEr... I mean, I'd need one of those \"motive\" things, right? And I don't got one.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow can you say you had no motive? I say you do! You had a grudge against Edgeworth and the victim, Robert Hammond! That's why you took revenge on them! Right?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nPlease don't make me repeat myself, Mr. Wright! This witness has no memory of anything beyond several years ago! He can't hold a grudge! It's impossible!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to prove he's lying about his memory... Otherwise, it's going to be the same thing over and over until the trial ends!)Phoenix:\n(First things first, I have to prove this man is who he is! Do that and the motive will prove itself!)After pressing fourth and fifth statements:Judge:\nMight I say something, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes... Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou've been saying the same thing now over and over. You've been calling the witness's memory of the past or lack thereof into question. But, does this really have anything to do with the current case?Phoenix:\nOf course, Your Honor. The witness has said he has \"nothing to do with this case\" and \"no motive\"... Both of these statements are lies!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Wright! There is a serious problem with your claim! Or... are you saying... Are you saying you know who this witness is!?Phoenix:\nOf course, Your Honor!Karma:\nHo hoh! Now, this is interesting. I would like to know myself! So, who is he?Phoenix:\n(Don't play dumb von Karma!)Judge:\nMr. Wright, please tell us this witness's name.Gregory Edgeworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHis name... is \"Gregory Edgeworth\"! ...\nJudge:\nEr... Mr. Wright? All of us here remember what Gregory Edgeworth looked like. And he looked nothing like this, believe me.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... that's pretty harsh, Your Honor...)\nJudge:\nI'm going to have to penalize you for your wild claim! Now... let me ask you again.\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright, please tell us this witness's name.\"Yanni Yogi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"His name is Yanni Yogi, a former court bailiff!\"Robert Hammond\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHis name... is \"Robert Hammond\"!\nJudge:\n... Mr. Wright. Robert Hammond is the name of the victim in this case.\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nJudge:\nGenerally, the victim in a murder case is no longer living.\nPhoenix:\nThat's true...\nJudge:\nPlease, try again.\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright, please tell us this witness's name.\"Phoenix:\nHis name is Yanni Yogi, a former court bailiff!Judge:\n... Yogi...? That name seems familiar. ... Oh! Yanni Yogi! From the DL-6 Incident!Phoenix:\n(I thought the judge would have heard of it... it was such a famous case.)Judge:\nBut, what does this mean?Phoenix:\nYour Honor! If this man is Mr. Yogi, then he has a clear motive!Karma:Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Jumping to conclusions again, Mr. Wright! This man, this witness, is Yanni Yogi? Fascinating! However... How do you propose to prove this to the court?Phoenix:\n...Karma:\nThis is a court of law, as you may recall. You need proof! And, allow me to repeat, once more, that the witness has lost his memory!Phoenix:\n(This is it... I have to do this now! If I can't prove he's Yogi right here, right now... Then I've got nowhere else to go!)Maya:\nNick! How are you going to prove it!? How can you prove that he's Yanni Yogi?Phoenix:\nIt's okay. It's actually quite simple. Your Honor! Please take this man's fingerprints! Then, we'll compare them to the fingerprints on file for Yanni Yogi 15 years ago...Judge:\nI see... that makes sense.Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk!Phoenix:\nHuh?Karma:\nI'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nWh-why?Karma:\nThe witness... has no fingerprints!Phoenix:\nWhat? What!? No fingerprints!?Uncle:\nEr... you see, before I worked as a caretaker, I worked at a chemical plant. I burned my fingers working with the stuff. Ayup.Phoenix:\nWh-what!? (Yogi, you sneak! You burned your fingerprints off to hide your past!)Judge:\nHmm... Well, if the witness has no fingerprints... I guess we will not be able to prove his identity.Phoenix:\n(No...!)Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Well, what will you do, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nUh...Karma:\nHmm? It seems that the case has been decided, no?Phoenix:\n(No!!! I know what happened! I know everything! I... I just can't prove it! But no... I can't let it end like this. I can't lose! There has to be another way!)Karma:\nThere is no one who can testify as to who this witness is! No one!Maya:\nNick! What are we going to do!?Phoenix:\nI didn't even consider that he might have erased his fingerprints... (What do I do!?)Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Well, Mr. Wright? Perhaps you'd like to cross-examine his parrot for a little comic relief, hmm? (Changed from [Perhaps you'd like to cross-examine the parrot for a little comic relief, hmm?] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Yeah, yeah, very funny. You're a sore winner, von Karma. ... Wait a second... \"Cross-examine his parrot\"? (Changed from ['Cross-examine the parrot'?] in the original release))Maya:\nWh-what is it, Nick? No... you're not going to...!?Phoenix:\nYour Honor! The defense would like to take Mr. von Karma up on his proposal!Judge:\nTake Mr. von Karma up?Karma:\nOn my... proposal? (Changed from [On his... proposal?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nExactly, Your Honor! I would like to cross-examine the witness's pet parrot!Judge:\nO-order! Order! Uh... well, what do you think, Mr. von Karma?Karma:\nNeed you even ask!? This is a farce! I object!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nWait a second! You were the one who suggested I cross-examine the parrot, von Karma! I have a right to do as you suggested!Karma:\nMmph... ... Well, if you're so desperate, then please, be my guest.Phoenix:\n!Karma:\nOf course, should you go through with this... And nothing comes of it, then I hope you're ready for the consequences.Maya:\nNick... this is crazy!Karma:\nWell? Still want to go through with your little game!?Yes, I'm doing it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLet the parrot take the stand. I will cross-examine her, Your Honor.\nJudge:\n!\nKarma:\nThis is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard!\nPhoenix:\n(von Karma's rigged every person's testimony, every piece of evidence... Except the parrot! She's my last chance! At least... I think so.)\nLeads to:\n\"Bailiff! Bring in the parrot.\"No, maybe not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(You know, come to think of it... This is a really stupid idea.)\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk... I've heard of desperate men grasping at straws... But this is the first time I've heard of men grasping at macaws! Hah!\nPhoenix:\n(Think! von Karma is a perfectionist in all things. He's probably rigged every piece of evidence and all the testimonies... If I can't do the unexpected I've no chance of winning!) Your Honor. I've thought about this proposal... And I'm going to do it. I'm going to cross-examine the parrot!\nJudge:\n!\nKarma:\nRidiculous!\nLeads to:\n\"Bailiff! Bring in the parrot.\"Judge:\nBailiff! Bring in the parrot.Judge:\nThat's... quite a bird. Please tell us your name?Parrot:\n\"...\"Judge:\nName!Parrot:\n\"...\"Judge:\nThe witness is ignoring me.Phoenix:\n(It must be hurt... to be ignored by a bird.)Judge:\nAhem. Very well, witness... Who is your owner? Please, er... testify for us.Witness Testimony-- Who Is Your Owner? --Parrot:\n\"...\"\n\"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk*\n\"...\"Judge:\nHmm... Certainly the most concise testimony we've had so far. Very well, begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nRight...Maya:\nWhat are you going to do, Nick?Phoenix:\n... I... I don't know! What do we do, Maya?Maya:\nHmm...Cross Examination-- Who Is Your Owner? --Parrot:\n\"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk*Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWitness! You can't just say \"hello\" and expect us to get anywhere! I want you to testify! Maya, you talk to her.\nMaya:\nR-right! Uh... What do I say?\n\n\n\n\"Have we forgotten something?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(As I recall... two days ago...) (Changed from [Remember... two days ago...] in the original release)\n\n\nMaya:\nPol-ly, Pol-ly. Have we forgotten something?\nParrot:\n*squawk* \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk*\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I can get Polly to say that here...! That will prove that the caretaker had something to do with DL-6!)\nMaya:\nUm, Polly? Have we forgotten something?\nParrot:\n\"... ... Hello! Hello!\" *squawk*\nMaya:\n...! Th-that's not what you're supposed to say! Forgot! Something we forgot!\nParrot:\n\"Hello! Hello!\" *squawk*\nMaya:\nUh oh. It's not working, Nick! She won't say it!\nPhoenix:\n(This is ridiculous! Why won't she say it!?)\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Something the matter, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Wait... Don't tell me von Karma expected this! He couldn't have retrained the parrot... could he!? Did he train her not to respond when we asked if we'd forgotten anything!?)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\"What's your name?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe I should get her to say her name?)\nMaya:\nPolly! Polly! What's your name?\nParrot:\n\"Pol-ly! Pol-ly!\" *squawk*\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... I think we've established that this parrot is named \"Polly.\" Does this have anything to do with her owner's identity?\n\n\n\nOf course\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYes it does!\nJudge:\n!!!\nKarma:\nHah! Fascinating! You claim that the parrot's name will prove her owner's identity? Then show us this proof!\nMaya:\nNick! Don't you think you're taking the bluffing a little too far?\nPhoenix:\nListen. We've not here to answer the question of \"who is the caretaker.\" We're here to prove that he is Yanni Yogi! All we have to do is tie the name \"Polly\" to Yogi! Your Honor. The proof that the parrot's name reveals the caretaker's identity is...\n\n\n\nPresent DL-6 Case File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nThe DL-6 Case File?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThat's quite a large file you have there! Which page is this \"proof\" on, then? Show us, or stop wasting our time!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, please show us the page. Where in this file is the information connected to this parrot's name?\n\n\n\n\"Case Summary\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's on the \"Case Summary\" page!\nJudge:\n... I'm sorry... But I don't see anything here that relates to the name \"Polly.\" At least, not on this page.\nKarma:\nHmph! A bluff! As I expected!\nJudge:\nI'm afraid I have to deny your claim, Mr. Wright. The witness may continue.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\"Victim Data\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's on the \"Victim Data\" page!\nJudge:\n... I'm sorry... But I don't see anything here that relates to the name \"Polly.\" At least, not on this page.\nKarma:\nHmph! A bluff! As I expected!\nJudge:\nI'm afraid I have to deny your claim, Mr. Wright.

Indeed, it does say that, yes.\nPhoenix:\nWhat was his fiancée's name? ([fiancée] not accented in the original release)\nJudge:\n\"Polly Jenkins\"... \"Polly\"!\nPhoenix:\nExactly, Your Honor! He wanted to remember the name of his fiancée who had committed suicide. (Changed from [He remembered the name of his fiancee who committed suicide.] in the original release) That's why he named his parrot after her!\nJudge:\nI see! I guess that is possible.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nBah! A mere coincidence, that's all! My granddaughter has a dog she calls \"Phoenix.\" Well, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Does this make you my granddaughter's fiancée!? ([fiancée] not accented in the original release) She's only seven years old!!!\nJudge:\nHmm... Indeed. Alone, it is a little weak for evidence in a murder trial. We would need some other corroborating evidence...\nPhoenix:\n(Where am I going to find that!?)\nMaya:\nNick! We're getting closer! One more! If we can just get one more piece of evidence...!\nPhoenix:\n(Right... but what?)\nKarma:\nHmph!\nJudge:\nVery well, witness.

But he didn't believe me! We won the trial... But I lost everything. I lost my job, my fiancée, my social standing... ([fiancée] not accented in the original release) ... Then, this year, 15 years later... A package arrived. It was a letter... and a pistol. The plan was written out in careful detail. It was a plan for me to take my revenge on the people who ruined my life. I didn't care who had sent it. I thought this was my chance, after 15 years, this was it! Finally, a chance to have my revenge on Robert Hammond and Miles Edgeworth... I have no regrets.Judge:\nW-wait a moment! Revenge... against Miles Edgeworth? What do you mean?Yogi:\nI'm not at liberty to speak on that matter. Why don't you ask Mr. Edgeworth yourself? Anyway, I admit it, I was the one who killed Robert Hammond.Judge:\nvon Karma... Where is Mr. Yogi?Karma:\nUnder arrest, Your Honor. I saw no room for error in his confession.Judge:\nThen... the defendant, Miles Edgeworth is...Karma:\nInnocent. In this case, at least.Judge:\nHmm. Very well. Will the defendant please take the stand?Judge:\nThere are a few mysteries left unsolved. Still, you are cleared of suspicion for this particular case. So I would like to pass judgment on the murder of Mr. Robert Hammond. Any objections?Phoenix:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Karma:\n...Phoenix:\n(I don't believe it! Why isn't von Karma saying anything?)Judge:\nVery well. This court finds the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...Not GuiltyJudge:\nThat is all. The court is adjourned!Edgeworth:Judge:\nD-did someone just say \"objection\"?Phoenix:\n(It wasn't von Karma...! Wait, but that means...) No... Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. I object to your judgment.Judge:\nWh-what do you mean?Edgeworth:\nI'm not innocent at all! As we have heard, Yanni Yogi killed Robert Hammond in revenge. But, revenge for what?Maya:\nNick! Edgeworth is trying to confess! He's going to say he's guilty! He's going to tell them he was the murderer in the DL-6 Incident! He's going to tell them he killed his own dad!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh! What do I do?)Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe judgment has already been passed! I object to Edgeworth's outburst...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDidn't something like this happen yesterday, too? I believe a certain witness raised an objection after a guilty verdict was passed.\nPhoenix:\n(That would be Larry...)\nKarma:\nWe must hear this new statement! We must hear Miles Edgeworth!\nJudge:\nHe's right. We have a duty to hear Mr. Edgeworth out.\nLeads to:\n\"For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream.\"Leave it to Edgeworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No... I'm sure Edgeworth thought about this one long and hard. This isn't my place to interfere!)\nMaya:\nNick, are you sure!?\nPhoenix:\nThere's nothing we can do about it. This is his problem, now.\nLeads to:\n\"For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream.\"Edgeworth:\nFor fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream. A nightmare... it's only a nightmare. That's what I told myself. But now I know, it wasn't a dream. Yanni Yogi wasn't the killer.Judge:\nYou mean... in the incident where your father died?Edgeworth:\nFrom the distance of the shot, it wasn't suicide, either. Everything was as clear as day. The murderer... The criminal in the DL-6 Incident... It was me! Your Honor! I confess my guilt! I am guilty for DL-6, the statute of limitations of which ends today! The culprit... is me!Judge:\nOrder! Order! This is certainly unexpected! The defendant, declared innocent, is confessing to a different crime! A crime for which the statute of limitations runs out today! I'm not really sure how I should deal with this...Karma:\nBah! It's obvious. We hold a trial. Right here. Right now. We try this man for his crime of fifteen years ago!Judge:\nI think... I think I would like to take a five-minute recess. During this time, I will consider the appropriate course of action to take. Court is adjourned!December 28, 2:24 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Edgeworth:\nI'm sorry, Wright. I've just wasted all of your effort.Gumshoe:\n... Mr. Edgeworth... I just don't believe it, sir! (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... I just don't believe it, pal!] in the original release) I mean, you... kill your dad?Edgeworth:\nI didn't want to believe it myself, Detective! But... it's the truth. I deserve to be punished. Murder is murder, no matter what the circumstances.Gumshoe:\nThis is crazy! Just crazy!Maya:\n... ...? Nick? What are you doing?Phoenix:\nHuh? Oh... I was just reading through the Court Record once more. I'm getting my case ready.Maya:\nYour case... for what?Phoenix:\nHuh? Isn't it obvious? I'm going to prove that Miles Edgeworth is innocent.Gumshoe:\n...! Wh-what are you talking about, pal! He just admitted to it! He confessed that he did it! In court!Phoenix:\nI'm sorry, Edgeworth. But I don't believe in your \"nightmare.\"Edgeworth:\nWh-what!?Phoenix:\nIt's just a dream. It's not real. The truth is right here in this Court Record. In any case, tighten your belts. The real fight is just beginning. I'll prove you're innocent. Trust me.Edgeworth:\nW-Wright...December 28, 2:30 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nNow then, I would like to resume our trial. (Changed from [Then, I would like to resume our trial.] in the original release)Karma:\nJudge! Miles Edgeworth has admitted his own guilt. He has confessed his crime. Let us begin by hearing his testimony. Then, though pointless, let the defense do their cross-examining. The statute of limitations on the DL-6 Incident runs out today. Though it's unconventional for me, I'd like to run this one by the book.Judge:\nI see. Does the defense have any objections?Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor. (von Karma... you knew this was going to happen from the very beginning, didn't you!)Judge:\nVery well. Will Miles Edgeworth take the stand?Karma:\nWill the witness state his name and profession.Edgeworth:\nMiles Edgeworth... I am a prosecuting attorney.Karma:\nMr. Edgeworth. Fifteen years ago, you mistakenly killed your father, Gregory Edgeworth. Is this correct?Edgeworth:\n... It is correct.Karma:\nThen testify about this matter to the court.Phoenix:\n(When Edgeworth was telling me about his dream yesterday I noticed something... One detail didn't quite fit. That will be the key... but only if I can get it to work!)Maya:\nPlease... Please...Witness Testimony-- The DL-6 Incident --Edgeworth:\nThat day, I had gone to the courtroom to observe one of my father's trials.\nAs we went to leave, an earthquake struck, trapping us in the elevator.\nMy father and Mr. Yogi lost their composure, and began to argue.\nJust then, something heavy fell at my feet.\nI picked it up, and threw it at Mr. Yogi. I wanted them to stop fighting.\nA moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream.\nIt was a terrible scream. I remember it to this day.\nThat's all.Judge:\nHmm... And, until now, you thought this memory was a \"dream\"?Edgeworth:\nWe were stuck in that elevator for five hours. The oxygen in the elevator ran out, and I lost my memory of the events.Karma:\nBah! The same claim Mr. Yogi has made!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Wright? Your cross-examination, please.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination",

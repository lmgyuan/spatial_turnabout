(Changed from [You don't seem like you're [sic] usual sparkling self today.] in the original release)Max:\nI'm always like this before I go in front of an audience... I'm working up to it.???:\nTee hee...Regina:\nDon't get nervous, Maxy... Here, have a glass of milk.Maya:\nR-Regina!!Max:\nHow fabulous!! My sweetie pie!! My sweetie pie princess!! You came to watch my performance today?Regina:\nOf course I did! Moe told me that I should come and watch this.Phoenix:\n(Moe said that...?)Regina:\nSo, what kind of performance will you put on today? Lemme guess, you'll fly at the end?Max:\nUh... It's not kind of show... Isn't that right, my sweeties?Maya:\nHuh?Max:\nI think my sweetie pie princess doesn't...Phoenix:\nYeah. She doesn't seem to realize what's going on... Or even where she is...Max:\nHmm...Regina:\nWell, Max, it looks like it's time to raise the curtain. I'll see you later. Today I'm just a member of the audience!Max:\nF-Fabulous! Enjoy yourself out there!!Regina:\nGood luck, Max! You're the best!!Maya:\nRegina's different, don't you think, Nick?Moe:\nTop of the morning to ya! Everybody... Let's get ready to get stuck in legal limbo! How low can you go?Phoenix:\nM-Moe.Moe:\nTop of the morning to ya, guv'ner.Phoenix:\nUhh... Top of the morning.Moe:\nThat's the ticket! Attacking the day starts with energy in the morning! The early bird gets the worm. But then again, worms lack higher brain function. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Here Max! I brought you a present! Have some milk.Max:\nOh, my! Th-Thanks... (Changed from [Oh my! Thank you!!] in the original release)Moe:\nSo how are you today, Wright?Phoenix:\nWell... I've got the feeling that today I'm going to face off against the real culprit. (Changed from [Well... I've got the feeling that today I'm going to face off against the real criminal.] in the original release)Moe:\nYou mean Acro?Maya:\nHuh!? You think he did it...?Moe:\nBe careful... He's used to putting his life on the line. Literally. He's got guts to spare.Phoenix:\nIf all I've got to worry about is how thin the tightrope is, I'm used to it already... It just means that I won't be able to press him like I can other witnesses...Maya:\nWhat are you going to do then, Nick!?Phoenix:\nI guess today we'll just have to do without our psychological warfare. Today we rely on evidence. It's the only way we'll get past Acro and to the truth.Maya:\nYou're right... But it's gonna be tough...Moe:\nAnyways... I want you to make sure that Regina see it all today. It's important. Then she'll finally have to deal with the reality of what happened to her father.Maya:\nYou want us to make sure Regina watches?Moe:\nYes. That's why I brought her here to court today.Max:\nWhat's that supposed to mean?Moe:\nShe need to know that when people die, they don't just become stars. I may be an old-fashioned clown, but I don't believe in people becoming stars.December 30, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maximillion Galactica. (Changed from [The court is now in session in the trial of Maximillion Galactica.] in the original release)von Karma:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery well. Ms. von Karma, you may proceed with your case.von Karma:\nThe prosecution would like to revise its previous theory of events. (Changed from [The prosecution would like to revise it's [sic] previous theory of events.] in the original release)Judge:\nWhat's the meaning of this?von Karma:\nWe have discovered a new witness. Or shall I say, a new eyewitness. One that saw Maximillion Galactica fly off from the scene of the crime.Judge:\nOrder! Order! I had a feeling something like this would come up...von Karma:\nDue to this revision, we are now prepared to explain how the defendant flew that night. An explanation the prosecution will present if the need so [sic] arises... In fact, my detective stayed up all night creating a mockup of the scene, on my orders.Phoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe...)Judge:\nVery well... Please call your witness to the stand!Phoenix:\n(Time to get to work! Or shall I say, time to walk the courtroom tightrope...)von Karma:\nName and occupation.Acro:\nKen Dingling, but everyone calls me Acro. I'm employed as an acrobat at the Berry Big Circus.von Karma:\nWhere were you the night of the crime?Acro:\nI was in my room that night.von Karma:\nIf you look at the map, you will see the witness' room is near the crime scene.Acro:\nMy room is on the third floor. The crime scene is below my window.Judge:\nHmm...von Karma:\nThe night of the crime, the witness saw something quite shocking. Would you tell us what you witnessed?Acro:\nOK...Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Acro:\nIt was just after 10:00 PM, and I was resting in my bed.\nAround that time, I heard a large \"THUMP\" noise from outside the window.\nThen a few moments later, I saw someone... flying... Right by my window.\nIt was Max Galactica... I only saw him from behind, but that's who it looked like.\nTo be honest, when I saw that, I thought I was dreaming...Judge:\nHmm... This witness's testimony matches up exactly with that of the clown.von Karma:\nIf that's the case, there is very little the prosecution need add... All that's left is to explain how the defendant disappeared into the sky that night.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBefore we get that far, I'd like to cross-examine the witness.von Karma:\nA foolish choice by a foolish fool who wishes to feel the foolish sadness of a sad fool. A man must know the proper timing for things, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Just like your old friend, Mr. Miles Edgeworth did.Phoenix:\n...Judge:\nMr. Wright. Do you have a problem with the witness' testimony?Phoenix:\nIn the words of Ms. von Karma, may I quote yesterday's proceedings... \"There's no way that actually happened!\"Judge:\nVery well... You may proceed with your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- What You Witnessed --Acro:\nIt was just after 10:00 PM, and I was resting in my bed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou said that you were resting in bed. One would thus assume that you turned the lights off in your room, correct?\nAcro:\nThat's correct. But there are safety lights around the outside of the lodging house. It's so bright, sometimes it can make it hard to sleep...\nJudge:\nIf that's the case, wouldn't it be a good idea to close some curtains?\nAcro:\n... I never really thought of that. I guess that means I'm off to buy some curtains.\nJudge:\nHah hah... Sometimes I do make myself useful in these chambers. OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nThe witness will proceed with his testimony!Acro:\nAround that time, I heard a large \"THUMP\" noise from outside the window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour room is on the third floor, right?\nAcro:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\nAnd you said that you were resting in bed.\nAcro:\nThat is correct.\nPhoenix:\nBut you were still able to hear a sound from outside?\nAcro:\nI was indeed.\nPhoenix:\n(Pressing Acro doesn't seem to get results... Hmm... Maybe something was contradictory with what he just said...)\n\n\n\nThere's nothing wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nWhat's the matter, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nN-N-Nothing, Your Honor. (Until I can find a clear contradiction... I should tread lightly.)\nvon Karma:\n...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nThere is a contradiction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is a huge contradiction with the testimony that was just given!\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nIf there's a contradiction, then prove it with evidence!\nJudge:\nHmm... She's right. Let's see some evidence. Do you have any evidence to support your claim of a contradiction?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nT-This... What in the world is this? OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nYou just don't get it, do you Mr. Phoenix Wright?\nPhoenix:\nW-What don't I get?\nvon Karma:\nYou're not going to be able to get through this one with your usual bluff routine! You're* ([sic]) client looks to be* ([sic]) ready to take off once again! Straight towards a guilty verdict...\nJudge:\nYou were... B-Bluffing? I will not forgive any more mockeries made of this court!\nPhoenix:\n(W-Whoops!)\nvon Karma:\nWitness... Would you mind repeating your testimony?\nAcro:\nCertainly...\nLeads back to cross-examinationAcro:\nThen a few moments later, I saw someone... Flying... Right by my window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it was a human being? It could've been a mannequin, or perhaps a large action figure...\nAcro:\nHmm... Well, setting aside the possibility of a mannequin, an action figure is plausible...\nvon Karma:\nYou have no need to mince words with Mr. Phoenix Wright. Testify the truth and only the truth. Just as if we were there with you that night...\nAcro:\nI believe it was a human.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(Damn... I just strengthened his testimony... I wonder if Acro's statement jives with the facts...)\n\n\n\nThere's nothing wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nWhat's the matter, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nN-N-Nothing, Your Honor. (Until I can find a clear contradiction... I should tread lightly.)\nvon Karma:\n...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nThere is a contradiction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is a huge contradiction with the testimony that was just given!\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nIf there's a contradiction, then prove it with evidence!\nJudge:\nHmm...

I will not forgive any more mockeries made of this court!\nPhoenix:\n(W-Whoops!)\nvon Karma:\nWitness... Would you mind repeating your testimony?\nAcro:\nCertainly...\nLeads back to cross-examinationAcro:\nIt was Max Galactica... I only saw him from behind, but that's who it looked like.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe light in your room was turned off then, right?\nAcro:\nThat's true. I was going to bed after all...\nPhoenix:\nSo with the lights off, you were still able to clearly see a human fly by your window?\nAcro:\nThe safety lights lit things up enough for me to see. But honestly, there was only enough light for me to see the silhouette outside my window. It was the person's back, so I couldn't see the white roses on the front.\nJudge:\nDid you see any of the other symbols?\nAcro:\nI clearly saw the silk hat, as well as the cloak wrapped around his body. I'm convinced that the person I saw was Max Galactica.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(The more I press him, the less results I seem to get... But maybe there was something fishy with his latest bit of testimony?)\n\n\n\nThere's nothing wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nWhat's the matter, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nN-N-Nothing, Your Honor. (Until I can find a clear contradiction...

She's right. Let's see some evidence. Do you have any evidence to support your claim of a contradiction?\n\n\n\nPresent Silk Hat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You claim to have seen the exact same thing Moe saw that night. Do you stand by that?\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nT-This... What in the world is this? OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nYou just don't get it, do you Mr. Phoenix Wright?\nPhoenix:\nW-What don't I get?\nvon Karma:\nYou're not going to be able to get through this one with your usual bluff routine!

Would you mind repeating your testimony?\nAcro:\nCertainly...\nLeads back to cross-examinationAcro:\nTo be honest, when I saw that, I thought I was dreaming...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhen did you start thinking that what you saw \"wasn't a dream\"?\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nThat's not important...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe that the prosecution has done a bit of maintenance on the witness's memory!\nJudge:\nHmm... Just to make sure, let's ask the witness. OWWW!!!\nvon Karma:\nObjection...\nJudge:\nS-Sustained...\nPhoenix:\n(Don't sustain that!!)Maya:\nAcro must be lying about what he saw, right? (Changed from [Acro must be lying about things, huh?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nOf course he is. Now the challenge will be to expose his lies in court.Maya:\nWell, put the pedal to the metal, Nick!Phoenix:\nYou claim to have seen the exact same thing Moe saw that night. Do you stand by that?Acro:\nWhat do you mean...?Phoenix:\nThe silk hat.Acro:\nWhat about the silk hat? I saw it on Max's head as he flew by my window.Phoenix:\nWell... You should have tried looking down out of your window that night.Acro:\nThat would have been quite difficult considering the state that I'm in. Just looking outside of the window was a tough enough challenge for me.Phoenix:\nThat's a shame, because you would have noticed the silk hat found on the scene.Acro:\nThat... That's the Ringmaster's hat... Right?Phoenix:\nAfraid not. No matter how you look at it, this is Max's silk hat.Judge:\nWhere are you going with this, Mr. Wright? Are you saying that Max has two silk hats!?Phoenix:\nNo. This is a handmade, one-of-a-kind model made only for Maximillion Galactica. Which means, Acro... That you've been fibbing on the stand!Judge:\nOrder! Order!von Karma:von Karma:\nAs always, it looks like someone just had to open their mouth before thinking... (Changed from [Like always, someone has to open their mouth before thinking...] in the original release)Maya:\nAre you OK, Nick?Phoenix:\nWell, I opened my big mouth, and now I have to back it up...Judge:\nHow about it, Mr. Wright? What would cause this witness to commit perjury in this court today?He has a grudge against Max.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPerhaps it is because Acro has a grudge agains the defendant! Which is why he is trying to frame Max...\nJudge:\nOWWW!! Why me!? What'd I do!?\nvon Karma:\nNever get your fat head in the way of a whip bent on finding justice! Mr. Phoenix Wright... I have no interest in your silly little theories! He has a grudge against the defendant, huh? You wouldn't happen to have proof of that?\nPhoenix:\nWell... Umm... That's the thing...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Thanks to you, I got my head lashed by Ms. von Karma's whip! I don't like getting hit for nothing, so how about you answer with an explanation!\nLeads back to:\n\"Are you OK, Nick?\"Acro was dreaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's obvious that what Acro saw, he didn't actually see at all, because it was a dream!\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nSo you plan on writing off all the inconvenient facts as nothing but dreams? Maybe you should just pinch your cheeks and see if you are actually awake.\nPhoenix:\nOWWW!! (I think your whip proved this isn't a dream just fine...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! How about you provide an answer that actually explains things!\nLeads back to:\n\"Are you OK, Nick?\"Acro is the real culprit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"... Your Honor!\"Phoenix:\n... Your Honor! On this occasion, the defense accuses Acro himself!von Karma:\n\"On this occasion\"...?Judge:\n\"A-A-Accuses Acro\"!? What in the world are you accusing him of?Phoenix:\nObviously we accuse him of the murder of Mr. Russell Berry!Judge:\nMr. Wright, are you serious!?Phoenix:\nDeadly serious, Your Honor.von Karma:\nHa ha ha... I think your trips to the circus have served you well... You seem to have learned how to try and grab at an audience's hearts and minds. (Changed from [You seem to remember how to try and grab at an audience's hearts and minds.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...!!von Karma:\nYour Honor. Don't allow yourself to be swayed by theatrics. Trying to wow the crowd with smoke and mirrors is the oldest bluff in the book.Judge:\nR-Really...?von Karma:\nIf you don't believe me, just look at the witness. He's calm enough for it to almost be scary...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... He is staying rather calm and collected...)Judge:\nMr. Dingling, do you have any response to the defense's accusation?Acro:\nI don't really need to say a thing, do I?Judge:\nWhat do you mean?Acro:\nEveryone, take a good look at me. I can't even stand up by myself, let alone leave the lodging house.Judge:\nT-That's true...Acro:\nI understand that Mr. Wright is just trying to help his client. But to do this by accusing me of a murder of all things...von Karma:\nSee! Even a sliver of common sense makes it clear the accusation is ludicrous! (Changed from [See! Even a silver [sic] of common sense makes it clear the accusation is ludicrous!] in the original release)She's right! Way to pick on the disabled you heartless, cruel man!Phoenix is a poopyhead!!von Karma:\nSee that, Mr. Phoenix Wright? If you're trying to drum up support from the peanut gallery, that's how you do it.Phoenix:\nUhh...von Karma:\nI think that's enough of this little game. I've got a doctor's note to confirm that Acro is unable to stand under his own power. Maybe the defense is planning on making a claim to counter this as well? I can hear the defense now... \"Acro had an accomplice!!\"Judge:\nWhat do you say about this, Mr. Wright? Did Acro have an accomplice?Of course he did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's impossible for Acro to be the murderer in this case. If that's the case, then it's natural for one to consider possible accomplices!\nJudge:\nHmm... You don't say...\nPhoenix:\n(Not good... Not good... This isn't going to end well.)\nvon Karma:\nDon't tell me you think you're gonna get off easy.\nPhoenix:\nW-WHAT!?\nvon Karma:\nYou must not have heard that sound just now... Maybe it wasn't clear enough... The sound of you falling into your own trap can be hard to notice sometimes!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... It seems as if you won't be stopping at Acro, but will be making other accusations. If Acro did not have an accomplice, things are not looking good for you!\nPhoenix:\nI understand, Your Honor. *gulp*\nJudge:\nVery well... Let's continue. Who, perchance, would happen to be Acro's accomplice?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nYou... You don't say!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... This is suddenly looking very very bad...)\nvon Karma:\nDon't tell me you think you're gonna get off easy.\nPhoenix:\nW-W-W-WHAT!?\nvon Karma:\nOh... Did you hear that?\nPhoenix:\nHear what?\nvon Karma:\nThe sound of you getting caught in your own trap! What a splendid accomplice. I'm sure this accusation is built on a solid foundation.\nPhoenix:\nFoundation...\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright... Do you have proof that this person you've accused was indeed an accomplice?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\n... Mr. Wright...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nThis piece of evidence is lacking in persuasive power.\nvon Karma:\nYou didn't miss that sound, did you Mr. Phoenix Wright? You know... The sound of you receiving a penalty!!\nPhoenix:\n(Arrrrghhhh!)\nMaya:\nWhat are you doing, Nick!?\nLeads back to:\n\"What do you say about this, Mr. Wright? Did Acro have an accomplice?\"Of course he didn't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Now then, this must be when we get to hear the name of the mystery accomplice!\"von Karma:\nNow then, this must be when we get to hear the name of the mystery accomplice!Phoenix:\nNot this time, Von Karma.von Karma:\nWh... WHAT!?Phoenix:\nYou're not going to sucker me into this one.Judge:\nWhat are you blabbering about, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nThere was no accomplice! Acro planned and committed this murder all by himself!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! What the... What are you getting at!?Maya:\nWay to keep them on their toes, Nick!Phoenix:\nNow I'm going to have to prove how it all fits together... I have to show how Acro murdered Russell Berry.Maya:\nCan you do it Nick? Can you really do that!?Phoenix:\nI know what I can't do. I can't stop now... If I stop attacking, I'm doomed!Maya:\nAlright! Then let's do it!!von Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright... If this witness is the killer, then his eyewitness account is all lies, right?Judge:\nHmm... Mr. Wright, I'd like you to clear something up for me... When the crime was committed, exactly where was Mr. Dingling?Present Acro's room\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"He was obviously here the entire time.\"Present plaza\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way he was anywhere but exactly right here!\nJudge:\nIn the plaza? He was at the scene of the crime itself? You're right though... The murderer would have had to have met the victim...\nvon Karma:\n\nPhoenix:\nOWWW!!\nJudge:\nMs. von Karma! Stop it!! You will be quiet and refrain from striking people!\nvon Karma:\nThe witness could not have possibly left the lodging house on his own! Not to mention what Mr. Phoenix Wright just said! \"There was no accomplice!\" remember?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Um... You're right. You think I could get another chance?\nJudge:\nWait just one minute. Don't forget about my proverbial whip as well.\nPhoenix:\n(Arrrrgh!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Hmm... Mr. Wright, I'd like you to clear something up for me...\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe was right here!\nJudge:\nWhat!? That location is completely unrelated to the crime... But I suppose if you said he was in his room, he wouldn't have been able to commit...\nvon Karma:\n\nPhoenix:\nOWWW!!\nJudge:\nMs. von Karma! Stop it!! You will be quiet and refrain from striking people!\nvon Karma:\nThe witness could not have possibly left the lodging house on his own! Not to mention what Mr. Phoenix Wright just said! \"There was no accomplice!\" remember?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Um... You're right. You think I could get another chance?\nJudge:\nWait just one minute.

Mr. Wright, I'd like you to clear something up for me...\"Phoenix:\nHe was obviously here the entire time.Judge:\nThat's... Acro's room?Phoenix:\nPretty simple, eh? Acro wasn't able to leave the lodging house by himself. In that case, there can be only one correct answer! (Changed from [There's only one answer to that...] in the original release) Acro didn't leave his room to kill the Ringmaster!von Karma:\nWhat!? Are you nuts!?Judge:\nWhat say you, Mr. Dingling!?Acro:\n... It's an interesting theory.Phoenix:\n... Umm... That's it?Acro:\nConsidering that what you proposed is impossible, yes, that's it.Judge:\nHmm... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Judge:\nAs the witness has stated... Your assertion is impossible. As he is in a wheelchair, there is no way he could go to the scene or be the killer.Phoenix:\nHmm... You've got a point.von Karma:\nIt seems you've forgotten once again, Mr. Phoenix Wright. The defendant was clearly spotted at the scene of the crime.Maya:\nThat's true! Moe said that he saw Max, didn't he?Phoenix:\nBut Maya, it's still impossible for humans to fly.Acro:\nDo you mind if I ask a question, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nWhat is it?Acro:\nI understand some of your logic... However, how do you think that I killed him? If I can't leave my room, I obviously couldn't wear Max's costume...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... How did he do it? That's the next course of this legal buffet...)Maya:\nBe careful, Nick. If you mess up here...Phoenix:\n(She's right. I can't mess up here. I've gotta give this one some serious thought! I'm sure that Acro killed the Ringmaster... And he did it while he was in his room... No doubt about it! (Changed from [And he killed the Ringmaster while he was in his room... No doubt about it!] in the original release))Judge:\nTime to enlighten us as to how Mr. Dingling committed the crime, Mr. Wright!Present evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm going to present some evidence!\"Can't present evidence now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvon Karma:\nAhh... I think we will finally be graced with an explanation!\nPhoenix:\nDon't push it, Von Karma!\nvon Karma:\nWha... WHAT!?\nPhoenix:\nYou aren't gonna suck me in this time. I'm smart enough to know when I don't have the cards to play and my hand sucks right now.\nJudge:\n... Uhh... What do you mean, Mr. Wright?\nvon Karma:\nHe means that everything he's said up until now has all been nonsense.\nPhoenix:\nUh.\nvon Karma:\nIt's true, right? If you can't establish proof of your murder theory, then it's nonsense!\nPhoenix:\nUhhh...\nvon Karma:\nHe's trying to fool us by playing some misdirection game.\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like this isn't going to pass muster...)\nMaya:\nNick!

He caught me...)\nJudge:\nAnd if you don't put an end to this funny business, I've got a few more ideas!\nLeads back to:\n\"I'm going to present some evidence!\"Judge:\nWhat's that? A picture?Phoenix:\nIt is indeed. The problem is with the item that's shown in the picture.Judge:\nThe bust?Phoenix:\nIt's quite a large bust. And because it is life sized, it is also very, very heavy.von Karma:\nHeavy...?Phoenix:\nHeavy enough to guarantee a certain death. Especially if it was dropped from a third story window.von Karma:\nAHHH!!Acro:\n...Phoenix:\nSee! This is how Acro was able to kill the Ringmaster! With the force of gravity and Maximillion Galactica's ample bust!Judge:\nOrder! Order! So you're saying the bust fell onto the Ringmaster!?Phoenix:\nA rather simple crime... Even if you were stuck in a wheelchair, it would be incredibly easy to commit...von Karma:von Karma:\nHow could you possibly wheel a wheelchair with something so heavy!? It's impossible!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nWell, Acro is an acrobat!

He knows that I'm getting close to the truth!) Well well well, Acro. You can't run away from things this time... OWWW!!von Karma:\nI'd watch what I say, if I were you, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?von Karma:\nYour Honor! The physical health of the witness is material to this case! I demand that we get proper testimony from the witness himself!Judge:\nHmm... Testimony you say...Phoenix:\n(Von Karma... She's just using this \"testimony\" as a rouse [sic] to stall for time!)Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThere is absolutely no need for such testimony!von Karma:von Karma:\nThe defense has its version of the murder. The prosecution has the right to respond!Judge:\nThe defense's objection is overruled...Phoenix:\n(Why can't he see things my way once in a while!)Judge:\nMr. Dingling, I'm sorry, but we need you to testify about your physical condition. If you have any doubts about your ability to testify, we can request expert testimony.von Karma:\nThe witness will have no problems; however, let's all be respectful towards him.Acro:\nThank you...Phoenix:\n(Argh! That woman will sink to any low to win a case!)Witness Testimony-- Acro's Physical State --Acro:\nI suppose I could have lifted something the size of that bust.\nI have a strong upper body from working as an acrobat, and only my legs were injured.\nHowever, lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible.\nThere's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body.\nThat makes it impossible for me to have known the location of the Ringmaster's head.\nThus it would be unrealistic to drop the bust on him. Don't you think?Judge:\nHmm... I have no doubts in regards to this witness's testimony.von Karma:\nIt was impossible for him to lift the bust and stick himself out far enough to look. (Changed from [It was impossible for him to lift the bust and carry it over to the window.] in the original release) Not to mention that he could not have known the location of the Ringmaster's head. A single false step would have lead [sic] to even more severe injuries.Judge:\nThat's what I was thinking. What is your opinion on the matter, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n... I'd still like to proceed with my cross-examination.von Karma:\nHe's simply stalling. It's shameful, really.Phoenix:\n(Grr... I can't let her get to me... I've got to focus...)Cross Examination",
    "newContext": "-- What You Witnessed --Acro:\nIt was just after 10:00 PM, and I was resting in my bed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou said that you were resting in bed. One would thus assume that you turned the lights off in your room, correct?\nAcro:\nThat's correct. But there are safety lights around the outside of the lodging house. It's so bright, sometimes it can make it hard to sleep...\nJudge:\nIf that's the case, wouldn't it be a good idea to close some curtains?\nAcro:\n... I never really thought of that. I guess that means I'm off to buy some curtains.\nJudge:\nHah hah... Sometimes I do make myself useful in these chambers. OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nThe witness will proceed with his testimony!Acro:\nAround that time, I heard a large \"THUMP\" noise from outside the window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour room is on the third floor, right?\nAcro:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\nAnd you said that you were resting in bed.\nAcro:\nThat is correct.\nPhoenix:\nBut you were still able to hear a sound from outside?\nAcro:\nI was indeed.\nPhoenix:\n(Pressing Acro doesn't seem to get results... Hmm... Maybe something was contradictory with what he just said...)\n\n\n\nThere's nothing wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nWhat's the matter, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nN-N-Nothing, Your Honor.

She's right. Let's see some evidence. Do you have any evidence to support your claim of a contradiction?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nT-This...

Right by my window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it was a human being? It could've been a mannequin, or perhaps a large action figure...\nAcro:\nHmm... Well, setting aside the possibility of a mannequin, an action figure is plausible...\nvon Karma:\nYou have no need to mince words with Mr. Phoenix Wright. Testify the truth and only the truth. Just as if we were there with you that night...\nAcro:\nI believe it was a human.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(Damn... I just strengthened his testimony... I wonder if Acro's statement jives with the facts...)\n\n\n\nThere's nothing wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nWhat's the matter, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nN-N-Nothing, Your Honor.

I only saw him from behind, but that's who it looked like.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe light in your room was turned off then, right?\nAcro:\nThat's true. I was going to bed after all...\nPhoenix:\nSo with the lights off, you were still able to clearly see a human fly by your window?\nAcro:\nThe safety lights lit things up enough for me to see. But honestly, there was only enough light for me to see the silhouette outside my window. It was the person's back, so I couldn't see the white roses on the front.\nJudge:\nDid you see any of the other symbols?\nAcro:\nI clearly saw the silk hat, as well as the cloak wrapped around his body. I'm convinced that the person I saw was Max Galactica.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(The more I press him, the less results I seem to get... But maybe there was something fishy with his latest bit of testimony?)\n\n\n\nThere's nothing wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nWhat's the matter, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nN-N-Nothing, Your Honor.

Just to make sure, let's ask the witness. OWWW!!!\nvon Karma:\nObjection...\nJudge:\nS-Sustained...\nPhoenix:\n(Don't sustain that!!)Maya:\nAcro must be lying about what he saw, right? (Changed from [Acro must be lying about things, huh?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nOf course he is. Now the challenge will be to expose his lies in court.Maya:\nWell, put the pedal to the metal, Nick!Phoenix:\nYou claim to have seen the exact same thing Moe saw that night. Do you stand by that?Acro:\nWhat do you mean...?Phoenix:\nThe silk hat.Acro:\nWhat about the silk hat? I saw it on Max's head as he flew by my window.Phoenix:\nWell... You should have tried looking down out of your window that night.Acro:\nThat would have been quite difficult considering the state that I'm in. Just looking outside of the window was a tough enough challenge for me.Phoenix:\nThat's a shame, because you would have noticed the silk hat found on the scene.Acro:\nThat... That's the Ringmaster's hat... Right?Phoenix:\nAfraid not. No matter how you look at it, this is Max's silk hat.Judge:\nWhere are you going with this, Mr. Wright? Are you saying that Max has two silk hats!?Phoenix:\nNo. This is a handmade, one-of-a-kind model made only for Maximillion Galactica. Which means, Acro... That you've been fibbing on the stand!Judge:\nOrder! Order!von Karma:von Karma:\nAs always, it looks like someone just had to open their mouth before thinking... (Changed from [Like always, someone has to open their mouth before thinking...] in the original release)Maya:\nAre you OK, Nick?Phoenix:\nWell, I opened my big mouth, and now I have to back it up...Judge:\nHow about it, Mr. Wright? What would cause this witness to commit perjury in this court today?He has a grudge against Max.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPerhaps it is because Acro has a grudge agains the defendant! Which is why he is trying to frame Max...\nJudge:\nOWWW!! Why me!? What'd I do!?\nvon Karma:\nNever get your fat head in the way of a whip bent on finding justice! Mr. Phoenix Wright... I have no interest in your silly little theories! He has a grudge against the defendant, huh? You wouldn't happen to have proof of that?\nPhoenix:\nWell... Umm... That's the thing...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Thanks to you, I got my head lashed by Ms. von Karma's whip! I don't like getting hit for nothing, so how about you answer with an explanation!\nLeads back to:\n\"Are you OK, Nick?\"Acro was dreaming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's obvious that what Acro saw, he didn't actually see at all, because it was a dream!\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nSo you plan on writing off all the inconvenient facts as nothing but dreams? Maybe you should just pinch your cheeks and see if you are actually awake.\nPhoenix:\nOWWW!! (I think your whip proved this isn't a dream just fine...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! How about you provide an answer that actually explains things!\nLeads back to:\n\"Are you OK, Nick?\"Acro is the real culprit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"... Your Honor!\"Phoenix:\n... Your Honor! On this occasion, the defense accuses Acro himself!von Karma:\n\"On this occasion\"...?Judge:\n\"A-A-Accuses Acro\"!? What in the world are you accusing him of?Phoenix:\nObviously we accuse him of the murder of Mr. Russell Berry!Judge:\nMr. Wright, are you serious!?Phoenix:\nDeadly serious, Your Honor.von Karma:\nHa ha ha... I think your trips to the circus have served you well... You seem to have learned how to try and grab at an audience's hearts and minds. (Changed from [You seem to remember how to try and grab at an audience's hearts and minds.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n...!!von Karma:\nYour Honor. Don't allow yourself to be swayed by theatrics. Trying to wow the crowd with smoke and mirrors is the oldest bluff in the book.Judge:\nR-Really...?von Karma:\nIf you don't believe me, just look at the witness. He's calm enough for it to almost be scary...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... He is staying rather calm and collected...)Judge:\nMr. Dingling, do you have any response to the defense's accusation?Acro:\nI don't really need to say a thing, do I?Judge:\nWhat do you mean?Acro:\nEveryone, take a good look at me. I can't even stand up by myself, let alone leave the lodging house.Judge:\nT-That's true...Acro:\nI understand that Mr. Wright is just trying to help his client. But to do this by accusing me of a murder of all things...von Karma:\nSee! Even a sliver of common sense makes it clear the accusation is ludicrous! (Changed from [See! Even a silver [sic] of common sense makes it clear the accusation is ludicrous!] in the original release)She's right! Way to pick on the disabled you heartless, cruel man!Phoenix is a poopyhead!!von Karma:\nSee that, Mr. Phoenix Wright? If you're trying to drum up support from the peanut gallery, that's how you do it.Phoenix:\nUhh...von Karma:\nI think that's enough of this little game. I've got a doctor's note to confirm that Acro is unable to stand under his own power. Maybe the defense is planning on making a claim to counter this as well? I can hear the defense now... \"Acro had an accomplice!!\"Judge:\nWhat do you say about this, Mr. Wright? Did Acro have an accomplice?Of course he did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's impossible for Acro to be the murderer in this case. If that's the case, then it's natural for one to consider possible accomplices!\nJudge:\nHmm... You don't say...\nPhoenix:\n(Not good... Not good... This isn't going to end well.)\nvon Karma:\nDon't tell me you think you're gonna get off easy.\nPhoenix:\nW-WHAT!?\nvon Karma:\nYou must not have heard that sound just now... Maybe it wasn't clear enough... The sound of you falling into your own trap can be hard to notice sometimes!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... It seems as if you won't be stopping at Acro, but will be making other accusations. If Acro did not have an accomplice, things are not looking good for you!\nPhoenix:\nI understand, Your Honor. *gulp*\nJudge:\nVery well... Let's continue. Who, perchance, would happen to be Acro's accomplice?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nYou... You don't say!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... This is suddenly looking very very bad...)\nvon Karma:\nDon't tell me you think you're gonna get off easy.\nPhoenix:\nW-W-W-WHAT!?\nvon Karma:\nOh... Did you hear that?\nPhoenix:\nHear what?\nvon Karma:\nThe sound of you getting caught in your own trap! What a splendid accomplice. I'm sure this accusation is built on a solid foundation.\nPhoenix:\nFoundation...\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright... Do you have proof that this person you've accused was indeed an accomplice?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\n... Mr. Wright...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nThis piece of evidence is lacking in persuasive power.\nvon Karma:\nYou didn't miss that sound, did you Mr. Phoenix Wright? You know... The sound of you receiving a penalty!!\nPhoenix:\n(Arrrrghhhh!)\nMaya:\nWhat are you doing, Nick!?\nLeads back to:\n\"What do you say about this, Mr. Wright? Did Acro have an accomplice?\"Of course he didn't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Now then, this must be when we get to hear the name of the mystery accomplice!\"von Karma:\nNow then, this must be when we get to hear the name of the mystery accomplice!Phoenix:\nNot this time, Von Karma.von Karma:\nWh... WHAT!?Phoenix:\nYou're not going to sucker me into this one.Judge:\nWhat are you blabbering about, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nThere was no accomplice! Acro planned and committed this murder all by himself!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! What the... What are you getting at!?Maya:\nWay to keep them on their toes, Nick!Phoenix:\nNow I'm going to have to prove how it all fits together... I have to show how Acro murdered Russell Berry.Maya:\nCan you do it Nick? Can you really do that!?Phoenix:\nI know what I can't do. I can't stop now... If I stop attacking, I'm doomed!Maya:\nAlright! Then let's do it!!von Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright... If this witness is the killer, then his eyewitness account is all lies, right?Judge:\nHmm... Mr. Wright, I'd like you to clear something up for me... When the crime was committed, exactly where was Mr. Dingling?Present Acro's room\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"He was obviously here the entire time.\"Present plaza\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is no way he was anywhere but exactly right here!\nJudge:\nIn the plaza? He was at the scene of the crime itself? You're right though... The murderer would have had to have met the victim...\nvon Karma:\n\nPhoenix:\nOWWW!!\nJudge:\nMs. von Karma! Stop it!! You will be quiet and refrain from striking people!\nvon Karma:\nThe witness could not have possibly left the lodging house on his own! Not to mention what Mr. Phoenix Wright just said! \"There was no accomplice!\" remember?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Um... You're right. You think I could get another chance?\nJudge:\nWait just one minute. Don't forget about my proverbial whip as well.\nPhoenix:\n(Arrrrgh!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Hmm... Mr. Wright, I'd like you to clear something up for me...\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe was right here!\nJudge:\nWhat!?

Are you nuts!?Judge:\nWhat say you, Mr. Dingling!?Acro:\n... It's an interesting theory.Phoenix:\n... Umm... That's it?Acro:\nConsidering that what you proposed is impossible, yes, that's it.Judge:\nHmm... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Judge:\nAs the witness has stated... Your assertion is impossible. As he is in a wheelchair, there is no way he could go to the scene or be the killer.Phoenix:\nHmm... You've got a point.von Karma:\nIt seems you've forgotten once again, Mr. Phoenix Wright. The defendant was clearly spotted at the scene of the crime.Maya:\nThat's true! Moe said that he saw Max, didn't he?Phoenix:\nBut Maya, it's still impossible for humans to fly.Acro:\nDo you mind if I ask a question, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nWhat is it?Acro:\nI understand some of your logic... However, how do you think that I killed him? If I can't leave my room, I obviously couldn't wear Max's costume...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... How did he do it? That's the next course of this legal buffet...)Maya:\nBe careful, Nick. If you mess up here...Phoenix:\n(She's right. I can't mess up here. I've gotta give this one some serious thought!
